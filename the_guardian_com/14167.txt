Detectives hunting a man over the murders of a mother and her three children in Manchester have found his car at Heathrow airport, it was revealed today.Police fear taxi driver Rahan Arshad, 36, originally from Pakistan, could be abroad after his silver BMW sports coupe was discovered at the airport overnight. It is not yet known how long the car had been parked there.Police want to trace Mr Arshad after officers called to a house in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, found the bodies of a woman in her 30s and three children, two boys and a girl, aged between the ages of five and 11, on Sunday.He also lived at the house, but it is not yet known whether he was the victims' husband and father.It is believed the bodies had been in the house for up to four weeks. Neighbours on busy Turves Road spoke of a stench coming from the building and reported seeing bluebottle flies buzzing around the letterbox.Detective Superintendent Martin Bottomley yesterday confirmed that a multiple murder inquiry had been launched, and urged Mr Arshad to come forward.Officers launched an international manhunt, with every police force in the UK put on alert."We want to speak to him in relation to the horrendous events in the house," Mr Bottomley said yesterday. "We are concerned for his welfare. We don't know where he is. We are treating it as a murder inquiry, therefore we need to speak to him."The cause of the victims' deaths has yet to be established, and post-mortem examinations have not yet taken place. Police believe they know the identities of the victims, but have not so far released their names.Neighbours said the two boys were 11-year-old Adam and Abbas, aged eight, the girl was Henna, six, and their mother was called Uzma.
