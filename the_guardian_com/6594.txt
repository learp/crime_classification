The last teenager to stand trial for the murder of a 15-year-old boy who was hunted down at a central London railway station has been convicted of his killing.Junior Bayode, now 19, was 16 when he joined a 20-strong mob that chased and killed Sofyen Belamouadden in front of hundreds of commuters at Victoria station.A jury at the central criminal court on Wednesday convicted Bayode of manslaughter and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. The teenager was one of the group who was armed with a knife, which the jury heard he used after Sofyen fell on to the floor during the attack.Sofyen, who was studying for his GCSEs, died after sustaining fatal wounds to his heart and right lung on 25 March 2010.The attack had been planned the night before on Facebook and via Blackberry messaging systems. Bayode denied murder and claimed he had tried to stop the group getting out of control.The Old Bailey jury convicted him of manslaughter and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm, but failed to reach a decision on the murder charge after 17 hours of deliberation. He may face a retrial on that charge.Bayode – who denied the charges – was the 20th defendant to be tried and the 17th to be convicted for his part in the killing.The murder was the result of what the court heard were "simmering tensions" between pupils at St Charles sixth form college in Ladbroke Grove, west London, and teenagers from Henry Compton school in Fulham, where Sofyen was studying.His attackers used a £3.99 five-piece knife set bought from Argos, as well as batons, iron bars and a samurai sword in an act described as one of "indescribable aggression".Sofyen was rushed to St Thomas's hospital after the attack but could not be saved.
