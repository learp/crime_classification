A couple who found a winning lottery ticket and cashed it in were today ordered by a court to pay back half of the prize money to the woman who bought it.Dorothy McDonagh, 61, dropped the £1 ticket on the floor of her local Co-op store in Swindon on 20 October last year.Michael and Amanda Stacey found the ticket, cashed it and then spent half of the £30,000 prize money clearing their debts.The couple were each given an 11-month suspended sentence for fraud in April this year.Today a judge at Swindon crown court ordered Michael Stacey, 43, to pay McDonagh £15,111 – the £111 being interest on the payment.Amanda Stacey, 34, was ordered to pay a nominal £5 compensation.McDonagh was able to prove to lottery firm Camelot that she bought the winning ticket because she kept the receipt.She purchased four £1 lines on the daily play game but realised her ticket was missing later that evening when her numbers matched the top prize.Camelot checked computer records and found the prize had been claimed at a post office.Police froze the remaining £15,000 and brought charges against the couple, who told police they didn't realise they were committing a crime and put the find down to luck.The Staceys admitted charges of making a false representation, and Amanda Stacey also admitted theft.Camelot said they will not pay McDonagh the remaining £15,000."We urge National Lottery players to write their name and address in the space provided on the back of the ticket," said a Camelot spokeswoman. "This ensures that the player can be quickly identified as the rightful owner of their ticket."While we are sympathetic to the situation, Camelot cannot be held responsible for the failure to follow the advice we offer to players or people who find tickets – and would refute any suggestion of negligence."McDonagh has said she will pursue legal action against the lottery organisers in a bid to retrieve the money.Speaking outside court after the proceeds of crime act hearing today, McDonagh said: "This has gone on for nine months now and this is not the final episode."I will not elaborate on the pursuance of the matter with Camelot for legal reasons."I am infuriated and deeply offended by their negligence."Who would have believed that winning the lottery could cause so much hassle and for so long?"
