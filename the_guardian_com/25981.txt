A firearms officer has told an inquest that he did not shoot at the barrister Mark Saunders, who was drunkenly waving a shotgun in the air, because he "could not justify" doing so.The officer, known only as Alpha Zulu 14 (AZ14), said the 32-year-old did not appear to aim the 12-bore weapon at police who were surrounding his home in Markham Square, Chelsea, and he could not see if the gunman had his finger on the trigger in the seconds before he was fatally wounded in a volley of police shots.Westminster coroners court heard that the breech of Saunders's shotgun was found in an open position suggesting it could not have been fired, when officers stormed his home.AZ14, a member of Scotland Yard's diplomatic protection group, was one of the first armed officers to arrive on 6 May 2008 after Saunders fired his shotgun.Giving evidence, the officer said he was in the basement of 1 Bywater Street when the fatal shots were fired at 9.32pm and did not pull the trigger himself."If I did not believe the firearm was pointing at anybody I was not going to pull the trigger," he said."I have to believe there is a threat to life. That threat to life is going to come when I believe the firearm is pointing at somebody."Until that happens I am not justified in my actions to pull the trigger."In a statement written after the shooting, AZ14, who was armed with an MP5 carbine, said he could not be certain anyone was in the line of fire."I could also not see his hand in relation to the trigger. At this moment I could not justify taking a shot."I said to AZ12, who was directly opposite the subject to my right: 'I cannot see what he is doing.'"Earlier, the firearms officer described how he swore at a resident to get back as Saunders fired towards them when they were standing in a child's bedroom.He said officers then listened to a running commentary of the gunman's movements and actions but could not hear the progress of telephone negotiations.Under cross-examination by Patrick Gibbs QC, who represents Saunders's wife, the officer described the moment seven colleagues opened fire and Saunders was killed.He said a loud bang was followed by a cacophony of noise as other shots were fired before the first had stopped ringing out."I was quite certain as to where I believe the gun was pointing," he said. "I believe it was pointing diagonally up at the roof top of 45 [the neighbouring property]."I knew there were no officers present at that location so I could not justify taking a shot."The inquest has heard that it is the responsibility of each individual officer to decide if a gunman poses a lethal threat and whether to open fire.The hearing continues.
