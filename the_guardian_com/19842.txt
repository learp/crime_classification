A man was jailed for 11 years today for killing his neighbour with a samurai sword after a row over a child's football.Gary Kelly, 38, was found guilty at the Old Bailey last month of the manslaughter of father-of-three David Martin, 40, in January last year.The court was told that Mr Martin had intervened in an argument between three boys playing football. The 10-year-old boy, who owned the football, wanted to leave the game but his friends would not return the ball.Edward Brown, QC, prosecuting, said: "[The boy] decided to leave the football game and wanted to take his football with him. His friends, however, decided not to give him his ball back, teased him and played pig in the middle with him."The boy phoned Mr Martin who went to help him.Kelly, who had been drinking and had nothing to do with the boys, came out of his house in Rutter Gardens, Mitcham, Surrey, and threatened Mr Martin with a beer bottle.An angry Mr Martin returned home to nearby Ravensbury Grove and went back to Kelly's house with a piece of wood used as a parrot's perch, the court heard.Kelly emerged with the sword and part of a snooker cue and attacked Mr Martin in the front garden. Mr Martin collapsed to the ground after being stabbed in the side by Kelly.Judge Christopher Moss said Kelly had been drinking and smoking cannabis before arming himself. He said: "You had lost your self-control by reason of provocation. Your use of the sword was quite deliberate."Mr Martin's wife, Angela, had told the court in an impact statement that her family had been devastated.She said: "It feels like my heart has been ripped out and part of me is missing."
