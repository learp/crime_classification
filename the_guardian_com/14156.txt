"A verbal clip around the ear" is not what this is about. Neither is it about doing "the work of the state" or indeed in any way replacing the police (A verbal clip round the ear can't do the work of the state, 10 August). Working with the police, Dfuse has developed a range of programmes based on the first-aid model of training to give us as citizens the skills to respond, safely and effectively, when we encounter antisocial behaviour and social conflict.The Dfuse programme helps us to stop and think before rushing in, to assess the level of risk: is this a situation where we could perhaps do something, in between keeping our heads down, feeling bad about ourselves and sending all the wrong messages to the perpetrators, or rushing in and getting harmed? What other response options are there which could make a difference without us personally getting involved in what might be a risky situation? Or is it a situation where we feel we do want to say something? In which case what should we say to defuse the situation rather than make it worse? How should we position ourselves to make sure we can get away if it looks as if it might turn nasty? As Lynsey Hanley describes, multiple problems in fragmented neighbourhoods need multiple solutions and proactive state intervention. The Dfuse programme is just one grassroots initiative which can give people confidence that individually and acting together we can start to make a small difference in our neighbourhoods.Jane AtkinsonFounder, Dfuse Citizen Training
