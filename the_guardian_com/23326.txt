The government's youth crime figures have come under fire today from the former chairman of the Youth Justice Board who accuses the board of releasing statistics that "perpetrate smoke and mirror exercises".Rod Morgan said the figures, which showed a sharp decline in the number of first-time entrants to the youth justice system, raised concerns over the definition used for young people committing their first offence.Morgan said the 10.2% drop over two years – 2005/6 and 2007/8 – failed to take account of more than 19,000 children and young people issued with penalty notices for disorder (PNDs) for minor offences of anti-social behaviour."Inexplicably, children and young people issued with PNDs are specifically excluded from the calculation," said Morgan."It is reasonable to assume that a high proportion of these young people were first-time entrants to the system because these are precisely the circumstances in which PNDs are said to be appropriate," he said.He added that a further unreported number of 10- 15-year-olds also received PNDs in six police areas in England where use of the notices for this younger age group is being piloted."Were the 20,000 or more young people who got PNDs in 2007/08 to be included [in the first-time entrant figures] it seems likely that the trumpeted 10% reduction would be wholly or largely wiped out," said Morgan."It does no credit to our criminal justice statistics to perpetrate smoke and mirror exercises of this nature."After three years as head of the Youth Justice Board, Morgan quit in 2007 in a blaze of publicity, lambasting the government for "criminalising" young people through antisocial behaviour policies and presiding over record numbers of children in jail. Since his controversial departure , Morgan, now professor of criminal justice at the University of Bristol, has continued to be a vocal critic of the government's youth justice policy.His comments follow the row that erupted over crime figures last month when Sir Michael Scholar, head of the UK Statistics Authority, accused the government of releasing selective knife crime figures.A Department for Children, Schools and Families spokeswoman said first-time entrants data shows the numbers of young people entering the "formal" criminal justice system."Penalty notice disorders can be issued when there is no admission of guilt for minor offences – therefore receiving one does not make a young person a 'first-time entrant' to the criminal justice system. The distinct nature of PNDs is to prevent young people from being criminalised too early, yet being a serious enough measure to deter them from offending," she said."PNDs offer an opportunity to provide swift justice to avoid drawing a young person further than necessary into the criminal justice system for low-level offences and anti-social behaviour."
