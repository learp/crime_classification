A police hunt is under way for the killer of a 15-year-old boy who was shot on a street in Derby last night.The boy was walking with a group of friends close to a recreation ground in the south-west of the city just before 9.20pm yesterday when he was shot in the chest. He was taken to Derbyshire Royal Infirmary, where he died of his injuries.Armed officers and a helicopter were sent to the scene in Caxton Street, but failed to find the offenders. Police cordoned off the area, where they will remain today carrying out investigations.Residents speculated that the killing could be linked to rivalry between local gangs.Simon Gilly, who works at Sinfin cars in nearby Wordsworth Avenue, said there were three gangs in the area, known as A1, BCT and 38 Estate.He said: "I can imagine it being gang affiliated. It's gone pretty far with someone being shot, hasn't it?"Gun crime in Derbyshire has declined in the past three years after a police campaign targeting the problem.But there were still 83 gun-related crimes in Derbyshire in the year ending April 2007. Assistant Chief Constable Peter Goodman said: "This is a terrible tragedy in which a young teenager has lost his life."He appealed for witnesses and said people could pass on information anonymously.View Larger MapDerbyshire police can be contacted on 0845 123 3333.
