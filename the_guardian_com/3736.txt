Magistrates have staged the first open rebellion against government plans to make them impose new surcharges on top of fines handed out in court.Ministers have ordered that a £15 surcharge must be levied which would go directly towards raising money for services for victims of crime and witnesses.But three magistrates in Cambridgeshire became the first to refuse to add the charge brought in on April 1. The surcharge has angered magistrates throughout England and Wales, who say it threatens their judicial independence and turns them into unofficial tax collectors for the government. On Thursday a bench at Ely, chaired by senior JP Alan Williams, refused to impose the surcharge on a young man convicted of possession of cannabis.Magistrates say they are "outraged" at having to collect what they regard as a tax from people on low incomes. Some say they will give poorly-off offenders conditional discharges instead of fines to avoid the surcharge.A spokesman for the Judicial Communications Office said: "To refuse to obey or enforce any relevant law would be incompatible with holding judicial office. It would be a matter for the local advisory committee to consider whether to refer the magistrates to the Office for Judicial Complaints." A Home Office spokesman said: "Courts should impose the victims surcharge whenever a fine is handed out in a court."The surcharge is likely to cut revenue from fines because JPs will have to give priority first to any compensation ordered for the victim of the offence, then to the surcharge, and only then to the fine, in working out what an offender can afford.Applying to all offences committed from April 1, it is expected to bear most heavily on people convicted of motoring offences, because most other defendants who appear before magistrates' courts are of limited means. Many of the offences magistrates deal with, such as petty theft and evading the TV licence, are typically committed by people with little money.JPs will return to the bench after Easter with little or no preparation for the new regime because of an error by Home Office officials in drafting the statutory instrument authorising the surcharge.Cindy Barnett, Magistrates' Association chairman, said her colleagues were "still waking up" to implementation of the surcharge. "We are under a statutory duty to apply the £15 surcharge but are also under a duty to take offenders' means into account. One [duty] does not wipe out the other."
