A visibly emotional Margaret Moran, former Labour MP for Luton South, made her first appearance in court on Monday, charged with fiddling her parliamentary expenses by £80,000.The 56-year-old held a tissue to her face and sobbed during a five-minute hearing at City of Westminster magistrates court in central London.Moran faces 21 charges: 15 of false accounting, contrary to the Theft Act 1968, and six of forgery, in which it is alleged she submitted false invoices. She was barely audible as she spoke to confirm her name and date of birth. No indication of plea was given, and her case was committed to Southwark crown court for a plea and directions hearing on 28 October.Moran, who is alleged to have claimed for dry rot treatment costing more than £20,000 on a home about 100 miles from her constituency, was remanded on unconditional bail to an address in Southampton. She is one of the last politicians to be investigated over the expenses scandal.Among the charges she faces are that she dishonestly claimed £22,500 for "urgent and essential works" due to severe dry rot at her second home, and £14,805 for the emergency replacement of a boiler, pipework and central heating as well as conservatory repairs for her second home.The list of charges also includes dishonest claims for £2,678 for a new carpet, and £4,756 for the replacement of kitchen units for her second home. Prosecuting, Louis Mably told district judge Daphne Wickham the total amount involved was "in the region of £80,000".Moran was helped from the glass-panelled dock at the end of the brief hearing. She sobbed as she left court and was helped into a waiting taxi.Former Labour MPs David Chaytor, Eric Illsley, Elliot Morley and Jim Devine, as well as former conservative peers Lord Hanningfield and Lord Taylor of Warwick, have already been jailed over the expenses scandal.
