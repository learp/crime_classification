The natural father of Baby P has for the first time publicly condemned his former partner, her lover and another man who were tonight facing "substantial" prison terms for torturing and killing the boy.In a statement issued through his lawyer, the father described his sadness at the death of his "bouncing" 17-month-old son."The guilty verdict will help me bring closure for what has been a traumatic time for me, P's family and all those who knew him," P's father, who cannot be named, said."I loved him deeply. Those who systematically tortured him and killed him kept it a secret not just from me but all the people who visited the house up until his death. Even after he died, they lied to cover up their abuse."Earlier, Judge Stephen Kramer told the mother and her boyfriend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and 36-year-old Jason Owen that they should not be fooled into thinking otherwise because he had ordered pre-sentence reports."A substantial term of imprisonment is the likely outcome," he told them.The 27-year-old woman and 32-year-old man from Haringey, north London, and Owen, from Bromley, south-east London, were remanded in custody on Tuesday and will be sentenced on December 15.Owen and the woman appeared in the dock at the Old Bailey today while the boyfriend appeared on a video link for the brief hearing.Seventeen-month-old Baby P died after his back was broken following eight months of torture while on the Haringey child protection register.The failure of Haringey social services to protect him from months of abuse has focussed attention on the council, eight years after the death of Victoria Climbi√©. Four separate inquiries are underway into how the boy was allowed to perish.Tonight the children's secretary, Ed Balls, promised action once the inspectors complete their reviews."I will then do what it takes so that, while we can't take away the pain and suffering of this poor little boy, we can't take away the anger we feel, we can take the action required to ensure not just accountability but also that we prevent this happening in the future."Baby P died in August last year after suffering more than 50 injuries and despite 60 visits by health and social care workers.
