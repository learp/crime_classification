A 44-year-old man has appeared in a Northern Ireland court charged with killing two British soldiers and attempting to murder six other people.At Ballymena magistrates court today Brian Shivers was also charged with possession of firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life.Sappers Mark Quinsey, 23, from Birmingham, and Patrick Azimkar, 21, from London, were shot dead at Massereene Army base, Antrim, in March.Shivers, from Maghera, Co Derry, was refused bail and remanded in custody. The court was told that CCTV cameras mounted outside the base in Antrim town recorded pictures of two masked gunmen firing 60 rounds of ammunition during the attack.A detective inspector told the court there was DNA evidence linking Shivers to the alleged getaway car. He said the evidence had been discovered on a mobile phone and on items found inside and outside the vehicle. A defence solicitor questioned the validity of the evidence and said they were just partial matches.The soldiers were killed outside the barracks as they collected pizzas they had ordered. Both victims were in desert army fatigues in preparation for their planned flight the following day to a tour of duty in Afghanistan.Two gunmen in a car parked nearby opened fire with semi-automatic rifles. When the soldiers fell to the ground, mortally wounded, their bodies were sprayed with more bullets. Four other people were seriously injured, including the pizza delivery men, one of whom was a Polish immigrant. A prominent dissident republican from Lurgan, Co Armagh, Colin Duffy, is the only other person to have been charged with the murders.
