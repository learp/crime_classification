Women who suffer abuse at the hands of their partners will be granted anonymity in any subsequent court case under government plans to crack down on domestic violence to be unveiled today. The measure - designed to encourage more women victims to testify without fear of stigma - will mean they are given the same right as victims of sexual offences. Men convicted of beating their partners will also be placed on a domestic violence register - similar to the sex offenders register - to help police track their movements. Men who batter their wives will get a criminal record, and face a prison sentence, if they breach court orders, in a move to prevent non-molestation and restraining orders being openly ignored. The measures will be outlined today by the home secretary David Blunkett, in Safety and Justice, a domestic violence consultation paper which seeks to revamp the law on domestic violence for the first time in 30 years. The proposals have been hammered out by Mr Blunkett and the solicitor general Harriet Harman, after consultation with Acpo (the Assocation of Chief Police Officers), Women's Aid, refuge groups, and the cross-party committee on domestic violence.While they are expected to recognise that domestic violence is inflicted on men as well as women - a measure being pushed by Ms Harman - they are not believed to go as far as she has wished in extending the plea of self-defence for murder to women who have suffered years of abuse. The proposals will also push for statutory reviews in domestic murder cases to see if there has been a history of violence and whether more could have been done to prevent the killing. The measures will now go out for consultation for 12 weeks before a bill is drafted for later this year. One woman in four will experience domestic violence in their lifetime with a woman being attacked, on average, 35 times before she goes to the police.
