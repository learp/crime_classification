David Abrahams, the businessman accused of illegally channelling Â£630,000 to the Labour party, has been cleared of any wrongdoing by the police, according to a statement issued yesterday by his solicitor. After interviewing Abrahams at his home, police are understood to have told him that he will be treated solely as a witness. The disclosure that Abrahams gave money to the Labour party through four intermediaries over four years was thought to have been a breach of the electoral law on transparent disclosure. The revelation last November led to the resignation of the Labour general secretary, Peter Watt.Gordon Brown said the practice of using proxies was unacceptable and set up an internal party investigation, appointing a retired judge, Lord McCluskey, and the former Bishop of Oxford, Lord Harries, to advise on changes in relation to donations. No report has been published. It was claimed that Abrahams had breached electoral law, since he had concealed the use of intermediaries. Watt had not thought the arrangement unlawful. Abrahams said yesterday: "I am pleased that after thorough inquiries I have been exonerated of wrongdoing. From the beginning, my only wish was to make a contribution to the party which I have supported for over 40 years. I have been subjected to the most intrusive media investigation and sensationalist speculation that has called into question my personal integrity." Efforts were made to prove that Abrahams corruptly bought planning decisions in the north-east, but no evidence was ever produced.His solicitor, Louis Charalambous, a partner with the London law firm Simons Muirhead and Burton, claimed the original story in the Mail on Sunday "was a politically motivated attack on him and the Labour party". He added: "The electoral commission should never have referred the question of donations to the police. I hope now my client can be left alone."
