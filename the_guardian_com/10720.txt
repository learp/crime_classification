Law enforcement chiefs have urged the government to ensure cross-border crime prevention measures are not jeopardised by Brexit negotiations, it has emerged.The director general and deputy director general of the National Crime Agency said they asked ministers to protect Britain’s arrangements with Europe, including use of the European arrest warrant and membership of Europol, amid concerns about the impact of leaving the union.Membership of the EU gives the NCA and UK police forces access to tools which allow them to share intelligence quickly and efficiently with European counterparts.Lynne Owens, the NCA’s director general, said at a briefing on Friday that the agency had approached the Home Office and Brexit department to raise its concerns.“We’ve been describing what we need to be in place post-Brexit,” she said. “We’re absolutely clear the policy decisions are not for us but we need to be spelling out the operational case.“In bluntest form, we must be able to continue to exchange intelligence and we must be able to understand the movement of criminals and criminal behaviour across international borders. We are supplying that information to the Home Office and it’s for them to make the policy negotiation.”Before the 23 June referendum, Owens said a vote to leave the EU could put efforts to fight crime at risk.Her deputy, David Armond, said on Friday that a “substantial paper” on the current arrangements had been compiled by the NCA, which has a broad remit, to tackle serious and organised crime, cybercrime and child sexual exploitation.“We’re coming up with a strong operational case for why those arrangements are necessary,” he said. “Obviously [Brexit] is a concern and we are all over this and contributing quite significantly.”He said the NCA was considering alternatives measures if the UK was no longer able to use those in Europe.“It won’t be easy. But Europeans need us as much as we need them, probably more so.”Armond said he was confident the negotiations would deliver the right outcome. “I cannot envisage a situation where we cannot continue to do business with our European partners,” he said. “It’s important for all of our security in protecting our citizens.”He said the European arrest warrant, which allows police forces to request the detention and extradition of an offender, would be a particular “tricky” issue.“If we can’t stay in that we’ve got to negotiate a series of new treaties with overseas territories about what extradition will look like.”Europol chief: Brexit would be a mistake for UK security Theresa May argued strongly in favour of the European arrest warrant when she was home secretary. Rejoining the warrant, which also allows for swift extradition of foreign offenders in the UK was put to a vote in 2014, ahead of which May said it was a vital tool for keeping Britons safe.Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency, helps member states fight serious international crime and terrorism. Before the referendum, former security chiefs, including the former head of MI5 Lady Manningham-Buller, and the former head of MI6 Sir John Sawers, said that voting remain was in the best interests of the country’s security.Asked if law enforcement officials did enough before the referendum to argue the case to remain, Owens said there was a concern that security chiefs would be seen as “political animals”.
