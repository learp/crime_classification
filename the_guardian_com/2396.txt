Two men and a woman charged over Britain's biggest cash robbery were today remanded in custody after appearing in court.Car salesman John Fowler, 60, his business associate Stuart Royle, 47, and Mr Royle's girlfriend, 38-year-old Kim Shackleton, are the first people to be charged in connection with the Â£53m raid at a Securitas depot in Tonbridge, Kent, last week.Amid tight security, they were led one by one into the courtroom at Maidstone magistrates' court, sitting together in the dock as the charges were put to them.Mr Fowler, of Elderden Farm, Chart Hill Road, Staplehurst, Kent, is accused of conspiracy to rob Securitas at Tonbridge. He also faces three charges of kidnapping the depot manger, Colin Dixon, his wife, Lynn, and his nine-year-old son, Craig.A fifth charge - that he was jointly concerned in handling stolen goods - was put to him. The charge relates to mobile steel cages used to hold the stolen money.Mr Royle, of Allen Street, Maidstone, is charged with conspiracy to rob. Ms Shackleton, self-employed and also of Allen Street, Maidstone, is charged with jointly handling stolen goods.Mr Fowler and Mr Royle stared impassively from behind a glass screen in the wood-panelled dock throughout the proceedings. A police officer sat between them.Ms Shackleton, who sat behind them, looked tired and drawn, with deep bags under her eyes. A female police officer sat next to her, and two other officers were also in the dock.Four policemen stood inside the courtroom near the door, with another two outside, as Elizabeth Howe, the chief Crown prosecutor of Kent, spent almost half an hour outlining the case against the defendants.Applications for bail by lawyers for Mr Fowler and Ms Shackleton were refused by the chair of the bench, Jennifer Crickman-Porter.All three defendants were remanded in custody until March 13, when they will appear at Maidstone crown court.Detectives were yesterday granted an extension until 9pm tonight to continue questioning another two men who remain in custody in connection with the robbery.This morning, officers hunting members of the armed gang that tied up the Dixons and 14 staff members at the depot and loaded cash cages into a white Renault lorry made their 14th arrest.They detained a man at an address in Crowborough, East Sussex, on suspicion of conspiracy to rob.Seven of those arrested in connection with the investigation over recent days have since been released on police bail.Mr Fowler was charged after police spent three days searching his home and surrounding farmland, removing some of the many vehicles kept on the site.The police inquiry has included a series of raids around Kent and south London.On Tuesday evening, a week after the raid, police stopped more than 600 cars at a series of roadchecks along the route the robbers are believed to have taken after kidnapping Mr Dixon and his family.Last night, the assistant chief constable of Kent police, Adrian Leppard, who is leading the investigation, said: "I remain pleased with the progress of this case."This investigation is likely to continue for many months, and possibly years, as we track down those responsible and indeed all of the stolen money."
