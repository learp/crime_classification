A husband who killed his wife after she begged him to help her die was jailed for life today. Retired accountant Frank Lund, 58, admitted suffocating wife Patricia, 65, with a plastic bag and a pillow at their home in New Brighton, Merseyside, last September.He denied murder on the grounds that Mrs Lund, his wife of 33 years, had persuaded him to help her die after her life was made miserable by an irritable bowel condition.His claims were not contested during a three-day trial at Liverpool Crown Court in which he was supported by his late wife's relatives.But he was found guilty after the jury was told to put aside sympathy and judge him only on the fact that he deliberately killed his wife.Andrew Menary QC, defending, said: "It was not in any way motivated by wickedness but only out of love."He has, as a consequence of this, lost the love of his life."He was totally devoted to his wife, he did what he did as he felt he had no choice."Her persistent request wore him down, he felt there was no other course of action for him."The court heard that Mrs Lund's sons, Daniel and Stephen, had sent letters to the judge asking for leniency and stating that Lund was only before the court because he loved his wife "absolutely and selflessly".Mr Justice Silver described the case as "highly unusual if not unique".He added: "It is the duty of citizens in this country not to take any steps which might lead to the death of another citizen."To assist someone to commit suicide is a serious offence."This was a killing which took place at the express request and insistence of your wife who wished to die."Your decision to smother her was out of a misguided feeling of loyalty."The judge sentenced Lund to life and ordered him to serve a minimum of three years.
