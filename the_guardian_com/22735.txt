A German doctor who accidentally killed a patient on his first UK shift as an out-of-hours locum GP failed in his first attempt to win the right to work in Britain, the Guardian can reveal.Daniel Ubani withdrew an application to join a "performers list" run by the NHS in Leeds when he failed to score sufficient marks in an English test and did not provide guarantees he would only work locally.But just a few weeks later, he joined the list of Cornwall NHS, which had less stringent rules on proof of language skills and did not demand doctors commit themselves to working in its area.That was his ticket to England, where he killed David Gray, 70, at his home in Cambridgeshire when he gave him a ten-fold overdose of a painkiller. He later told Gray's family he was tired and stressed, having had only three hours' rest before he started the shift, his first in the UK.He has since been convicted in Germany of causing Gray's death by negligence, and the NHS watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), is investigating what went wrong and how.The revelations about loopholes in the checks follow calls from medical leaders for European doctors to face the same compulsory tests as other foreign doctors on their medical knowledge and English before they can work in Britain.Ubani was recruited for the Cambridgeshire shift by an agency called Cimarron to work as a locum for a private company, Take Care Now (TCN), which has an out-of-hours contract with Cambridgeshire NHS.The way he got the job is likely to reinforce demands for tighter rules. Ubani tried to join the Leeds list in 2007. He first referred authorities to his English-language website promoting his clinic for plastic surgery and anti-ageing medicine but the trust refused to make exceptions.Ubani did not achieve the scores demanded when he took a test, nor did he satisfy the place of work requirement. In July he withdrew his application.Within weeks, he joined Cornwall's list. This trust did not demand an intention to work locally from new applicants until later in the year. It still does not require English test results.Cambridgeshire NHS, within whose area Ubani did his shift, says it always demanded proof of competent English from applicants to its list.Whether Ubani would have passed its requirements cannot be known. NHS Cornwall and Isles of Scilly said it "does not require doctors applying to join its performers list to have undergone an English language competency test if they are from an EEA [European Economic Area] country and they can provide evidence of their knowledge of English."Asked what evidence Ubani provided, a spokeswoman said: "Competence in English is something that is normally picked up during the application process."TCN's chief executive David Cocks said: "We share the publicly voiced concerns, highlighted by the Guardian in its investigation, over the testing for standards of English of all practitioners within the NHS. "We therefore look forward to seeing any recommendation for change that the CQC, General Medical Council or Royal College of General Practitioners may make on this subject."He added that Ubani, as a self-employed professional recruited through an agency, "was under a duty to ensure he was fit to practise and to report to us, or the agency that recruited him, if he was concerned that his ability was in any way impaired. "Our records show that he had sufficient time between his induction and the start of his shift."Tom Stewart, a director of Cimarron, said: "We have robust processes in place to ensure that all important checks are undertaken before deploying a GP and I can confirm that all these checks were undertaken for Dr Ubani. As part of this process, Cimarron, like any other agency, relies partly on the checks in place within the GMC to register GPs and those within individual PCTs to place GPs on PCT performers lists."The Department of Health said: "NHS organisations must carry out the necessary checks in accordance with the relevant regulations to ensure doctors are appropriately qualified … A doctor has a duty of care to patients to only practise when fit to do so. It is the responsibility of an employer to ensure that a doctor is fit to practise on a given shift. We would expect a PCT commissioning out-of-hours services to ensure through their contract that the provider is using GPs who are fit to practise to deliver appropriate services."• The headlines on this article were amended on 22 September 2009 to correspond with a revised version published in later editions of the newspaper.
