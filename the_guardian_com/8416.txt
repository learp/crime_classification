"We are slowly coming to terms with what has happened to Jane and pulling together as a family to support each other during such a difficult time."We have made many appeals for information since Jane went missing six weeks ago today, but even at our lowest points we were never prepared for something like this. "Jane was close to all her family. Whilst we didn't always see a lot of each other, there was always regular contact and we got together when we could. We heard about each other's lives and took an interest in all that we did. "That has now been taken away from us never again will I see my sister, my mum see her daughter or Malcolm his partner."If you have a loved one who you suspect might have done this, we understand how hard it must be to pick up the phone to the police - but a young woman has lost her life in the most horrific way, and we have lost someone who was very loved and so special. "Please, if you think you know something then find your conscience and phone the police."
