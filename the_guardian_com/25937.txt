Two teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of stealing a swan and trying to take another.Police launched the investigation into alleged swan pilfering after videos were uploaded on to YouTube that appeared to show birds being targeted in Gloucester. They decided that offences had potentially been committed under the Wildlife Act and their inquiries led them to two boys, aged 15 and 16.A police spokesperson said: "Both were arrested on suspicion of theft of a swan and attempted theft of a swan. They were bailed to attend a police station at a later date. Officers seized mobile phones and computers as part of the investigation."The investigation began after the Gloucester Citizen newspaper brought videos to the attention of the police. The films appeared to show a swan being dragged out of a lake by its neck and a duck writhing around in a sports bag. The videos were being shared on Twitter and Vine as well as on YouTube.Last week, Sergeant Simon Clemett told the Citizen: "I am horrified by this footage and some of the associated comments on Twitter. Causing unnecessary suffering to an animal is an offence. Removing a creature from its natural habitat can cause it a significant amount of stress, as well as depriving its young."It appears to be a bad time to be a feathered or furred creature in Gloucestershire. Later this month a teenager is appearing before magistrates in Gloucester charged with causing unnecessary suffering to a police dog during disorder outside a nightclub. And later this year the controversial badger cull is due to take place in the county. Gloucestershire police have launched Operation Themis to patrol it. Swans are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and it is an offence to intentionally injure, kill or take a wild bird. The crown retains the right to ownership of "all unmarked swans in open water" but the Queen only exercises her ownership on certain stretches of the Thames and surrounding tributaries.
