Tony Blair is hoping to implement swiftly plans set out yesterday to split the Home Office into a ministry for national security and a separate ministry for justice.The proposal will go to the cabinet in the next fortnight, and Number 10 sources said they hoped Mr Blair would leave the premiership having overseen the biggest ever reform of the Home Office.The chancellor, Gordon Brown, is said to be interested in studying the proposal in detail, but is stressing that any such reform could only be in the context of a new national security strategy run by the prime minister with a single national security budget across the government capable of determining priorities.John Reid is proposing a new national security ministry to oversee the fight against terrorism including the security services, the role of the police in public protection, and the operation of new immigration and national identity Whitehall agencies.The newly styled "ministry of justice" would take responsibility for the prison and probation services, criminal justice policy and the functions held by the Department for Constitutional Affairs.Mr Reid's proposals have won the backing of the former home secretary Jack Straw, as well as the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer.But it was also being made clear yesterday that a new justice ministry will mean that a senior minister in the cabinet will be explicitly making the human rights and civil liberties arguments when national security and public protection questions are discussed."This will make sure that they are clearly heard around the cabinet table and they will become much more explicit to the public," said a Whitehall source.A final decision to split up the 73,000-strong Home Office would mark the biggest reform since it was created in 1782. No legislation is needed and the process could be underway within months.Lord Falconer confirmed the basic shape of the split: "We need to move forward and think: is the right thing to do to divide the Home Office into a position where the bits that focus on our borders, on police, on counter-terrorism are in one place and in another place is a justice ministry dealing with the courts, with prison, with criminal law, with sentencing."The recommendation to break-up the department to secure a much tighter focus on national security and public protection follows an internal 'capacity review' of the ability of the security services to respond to the terrorist threat. It was undertaken by Mr Reid at the request of Downing Street in the wake of last summer's airline plots. Mr Blair considered his report over the New Year break.Mr Reid said yesterday: "There must be no sacred cows when it comes to protecting security and justice - the two fundamental roles demanded of the Home Office and the home secretary. Whilst in the short term my focus will be on putting right that which needs the most urgent attention - including the way we deal with the transfer of c riminal records information and prison pressures - in the long term even more radical change may be unavoidable. Nothing must be ruled out if we are to properly protect the public and ensure that offenders are brought to justice."The home secretary's split plan follows his "action plans" for criminal justice and immigration, but repeated problems in the past two months have convinced him of the need for more fundamental reconstruction.Mr Reid yesterday cited as examples of the need for radical action: the unresolved foreign prisoner problem, the worse than expected problems in dealing with the asylum backlog, inadequate counter-terrorism response, the overseas criminal records problem and the continuing crisis over prison numbers.The Conservatives said yesterday they preferred to see a second cabinet minister appointed to the Home Office to take responsibility for "homeland security", while the Liberal Democrats welcomed a ministry of justice as "long overdue".Split decisionMinistry of JusticeIts responsibilities would include:· Prison and probation services · Criminal justice policyNational Security MinistryIt would oversee:· The fight against terrorism including the security services · The role of the police in the protection of the public · The operation of new immigration and national identity Whitehall
