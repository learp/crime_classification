Police are investigating reports of two men acting suspiciously near the British army garrison in Aldershot, Hampshire.Officers received a report from a civilian member of staff who works in the military complex that two men were behaving suspiciously in a blue Renault Clio parked nearby.There was no contact made between the two men and the person reporting the incident and there is nothing to suggest a crime was committed, the police added.Tensions have been high around military bases since two men described as “Middle Eastern” in appearance allegedly tried to abduct an RAF serviceman at knifepoint outside RAF Marham, Norfolk, in July. A statement from Hampshire police said: “We were called to a suspicious incident at 8.42am today at the junction between Queens Avenue and Hospital Hill, Aldershot. Two men were seen acting suspiciously in a blue Renault Clio. At this stage there is nothing to suggest that a crime has been committed but we are looking into why the two men had stopped the car on this stretch of road.”Bulford military camp on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, was placed on lockdown on Thursday after reports that three people had been seen on a nearby ridge with a “long-barrelled weapon”. But police said the incident was a false alarm and that tensions were high following the Marham incident and the Bastille Day attack in Nice.Detectives investigating the attempted abduction at Marhamhave released efit images of the suspects. The first suspect, who was fought off by the serviceman, is aged between 20 and 30 and about 6ft tall. He is described as of athletic but stocky build, with dark hair which was long on top and a well-groomed beard. He had a dark skin tone and wore casual clothing.Police believe he may have a visible facial injury as the serviceman headbutted him to fend him off.
