The mother of a pregnant Briton who was jailed in Laos for trafficking heroin said today she was "overjoyed" that her daughter would be sent home tomorrow in time for the birth of her baby.Samantha Orobator, from south London, who conceived in prison, was given a life sentence after pleading guilty to drug trafficking in June.But following an agreement with the Laos government, the 20-year-old can return to the UK to serve the rest of her sentence.The deal – signed last week – came in time for Orobator to return home for the birth of her child, which is due next month.Her mother, Jane Orobator, said she was "shocked but delighted" by the news. "I just want her to come back to the UK – that is my first desire," she added."One step at a time … I just want her to have her baby here."Khenthong Nuanthasing, a Lao foreign ministry spokesman, said Orobator's transfer was a humanitarian gesture that took her pregnancy into account."To my understanding, she is fine," he said. "The doctor keeps an eye on her. Both the officials from the UK and from Laos have taken care of her, particularly her health."Orobator's scheduled return to Britain was also welcomed by human rights activists.Clive Stafford Smith, the director of Reprieve, said: "I hope that, when she gets back, the government allow her access to independent lawyers, which she hasn't yet had."The stress she's been through has been phenomenal, and the biggest risk has been to her unborn child."He urged the government to treat her compassionately, saying: "She needs to be sent to hospital, not prison."No one can think the Laos conviction is valid, and for Britain to enforce that is to enforce something surely everyone in the British government deplores."Orobator has been held in Laos since last August. The authorities repeatedly postponed her trial while they attempted to solve the mystery of how she had become pregnant in a women's prison.It is not known who the father of her child is, but her mother insisted Orobator had not been raped and the father of the child was not a Lao prison official.Police found 1.5lb (680g) of heroin in 68 capsules on Orobator's body when she was arrested at Vientiane airport on her way to Australia.Heroin trafficking is punishable by death in Laos, but Orobator was spared because Lao law does not allow the execution of pregnant women.
