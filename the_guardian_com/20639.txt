A 22-year-old man arrested on suspicion of fatally stabbing a 16-year-old schoolgirl on a bus has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act, police said on Friday night. Christina Edkins was killed on a double-decker in Hagley Road, Birmingham, during the morning rush-hour on Thursday.A spokesman for West Midlands police said the man would be sent to a secure facility after an assessment by mental health professionals deemed him unfit to be interviewed any further by detectives.Police said the man had been regularly assessed by medical experts throughout his time in police custody. He was arrested near the scene of the attack.Christina had been sitting in front of her attacker on the top deck when he struck as the bus was slowing down. Postmortem tests have revealed that she died from a single stab wound to the chest.Detective Superintendent Richard Baker said: "He walked down the stairs and calmly waited to get off the bus."Friends of the teenager gathered on Friday afternoon to pay their respects at the scene, where floral tributes have been placed.Police have released a picture of the suspected killer, a black man in his early 20s, who was wearing a distinctive jacket with a picture of a tiger on the back. They believe he used buses in and around Birmingham around the time of the attack and have appealed for anyone who saw him between 6am and 1pm to come forward. They called on any remaining passengers from the No 9 bus to speak to them about what happened.Baker said: "We know that at the time of the tragic event yesterday 16 people were on the bus. We have identified and spoken directly to about eight of those individuals. We are appealing for the other people on the bus at the time of the incident to please come forward also."Even if you think the information you have is not relevant or will not assist us, please let us make that assessment. It is quite possible that the people on the bus who haven't come forward may not have been aware at the time of the severity of what had happened."We know from witness accounts that we do have that, although some screaming was heard immediately after the incident, initially people thought perhaps it was just teenagers messing around on the top deck of the bus."
