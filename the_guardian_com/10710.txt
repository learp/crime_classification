Police today named the two Chinese students murdered in a flat in Newcastle upon Tyne at the weekend in what a spokesman called a frenzied attack.A Northumbria police spokesman said the victims, whose bodies were found in the West End area of the city, were 25-year-old Xi Zhou and her boyfriend, Zhen Xing Yang, also 25.The couple's bodies were discovered in separate rooms at a ground-floor flat in Croydon Road on Saturday.Detectives say they so far have no known motive for the "savage and brutal attack".So severe were the head injuries of both victims that police were unable to ascertain what kind of weapon had been used to kill them. Detective Superintendent Steve Wade, who is leading the murder inquiry, said the pair suffered defence wounds, but he would not say whether the killer had tied them up or whether there was a sexual element to the murders.A postmortem examination revealed that Xi may also have been suffocated.Wade said the couple had been discovered by a former tenant and two friends, who visited the address on Saturday afternoon."On entering the flat and searching the front bedroom, they discovered the body of their female friend and contacted the police," he said at a press conference. Officers then found Zhen's body in the back bedroom.Wade described the "unpleasant" crime scene as very bloodstained, and said the murderer must have been covered in blood after the attack."It was a vicious attack," he said. "There was a lot of blood, and I think in any interpretation that was a frenzied attack," he said.The detective also paid tribute to the "hardworking" couple, who graduated from Newcastle University in 2006."They were two nice, hardworking, respectable people who have come to the UK for the best of reasons, to get a good education," he said."They had both worked hard while at Newcastle University, and both had done extremely well, graduating with good degrees."Xi had finished her MA in Applied Linguistics in September 2006, while Zen gained his MA in International Human Resources the same month.Wade said Xi had worked as a waitress at the Wagamama restaurant in the city centre, where she was a popular member of staff. She was last seen leaving work on Thursday afternoon but did not turn up for her shift on Friday.Zhen's employment status is unknown. His last known contact was a phone conversation with a female friend on Wednesday, but Wade said the conversation had given "no cause for concern".Zhen was discovered wearing nightclothes, while Xi was still wearing daytime clothes when she was attacked.Wade added that officers were still trying to trace the couple's final movements, but said that the killer, or killers, would be caught."We will work around the clock to catch those responsible," he said.Xi's relatives have been traced to Hunan province, in southern China, but police have been unable to trace Zhen's family.Thorough forensic examinations began on Saturday, and officers have made house-to-house inquiries in neighbouring streets.
