The headteacher of a London academy school described as outstanding by Ofsted has been suspended pending a police investigation into "serious allegations" of financial irregularity at the school.Jo Shuter has been head of Quintin Kynaston school in St John's Wood, north London, since 2002 and is credited with turning around its performance. She was awarded the CBE for her services to education in 2010.The Metropolitan police said it had been informed of the "possible financial irregularity" on Wednesday night. "We will be discussing the matter with the school in due course," said a spokesman. "No crime has been recorded at this stage."Patrick Lees, chair of the 1,400-pupil academy's governing body, said: "On receipt of serious allegations relating to management of the school, governors took immediate action to initiate an investigation and are now referring the matter to the police."In order to facilitate this investigation and ensure that pupils' education is not compromised during this process, we have now also taken the decision to suspend the headteacher."Governors are seeking to reassure the school community, who will be undoubtedly shocked and unsettled by this news, that the highest priority is being given to the smooth running of the school and to this end governors are seeking to appoint an interim headteacher as soon as possible."Shuter, secondary school headteacher of the year at the 2007 Teaching Awards, told the BBC that the allegations were "malicious and vindictive". She said: "There is an investigation process ongoing and I'm not allowed to comment. I urge people to wait and see the outcome."A spokesman for the Department for Education said: "The suspension of the headteacher is a matter for the Quintin Kynaston Trust. The trust have rightly taken responsibility for the situation and carried out a full independent investigation. We are confident it is taking appropriate action in response to the investigation's findings."Unfortunately, no system of financial audit can guarantee it will prevent all wrongdoing. However, the financial accountability systems in place for academies are more rigorous than those for maintained schools and they enable swift resolution of any issues of financial impropriety."The spotlight of this accountability system demonstrates that academies cannot hide from their responsibilities and are held to account for their actions."Last year's Ofsted report described the school as outstanding and Shuter as an "inspirational" headteacher.
