It is testament to the rough press Jersey has received in recent years that when news filtered through on Sunday that the island had been the site of a horrible crime, the first reaction among many was: "Again?"This is not to lessen the tragedy of those involved in the weekend's knife attacks, but simply an indication of how Jersey's reputation has been tarnished since a botched child abuse investigation began in early 2008 at the Haut de la Garenne children's home.Then, a major police inquiry was launched after forensic investigators claimed to have discovered what they believed were "the partial remains of a child" buried underneath the former home. Several months later, after the story had circled the world, it turned out that the "bones" were more likely to have been a piece of coconut shell. And police talk of putting 30-plus child abusers on trial in the early days of the investigation ended in January this year with just seven convictions and some very light sentences.When Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell took over the inquiry in autumn 2008 and admitted that police had made a catalogue of errors in the £4.5m investigation, his words were widely reported. But the damage was done. In the minds of many, Jersey was no longer an idyllic island but instead "the island of secrets" – as one newspaper billed it during the height of the child abuse investigation.The island off the coast of Normandy had become a sinister place, a haven not just for tax exiles but also child abusers.Interestingly, the Jersey tourist board admitted to the Guardian that summer that bookings were up year-on-year, apparently proving the "all publicity is good publicity" adage.Of course, whatever may have driven someone to stab a family to death on Sunday tells us nothing about Jersey. Such horror can take place in any house in any town. And, relatively speaking, the island continues to be a safe place to live. Just 4,554 crimes were recorded in 2010 – a below-average number for a population of 92,500, and 9% down on 2009.Residents also feel secure. Only 6% of people said they were very worried that they might become a victim of violent crime, compared with 13% of UK respondents to the British Crime Survey in England and Wales.
