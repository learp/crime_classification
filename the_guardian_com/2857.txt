Everyone's watching YouTube these days - including the police, it seems.A man has been questioned by officers after posting footage on the video-sharing website that showed him apparently reaching speeds of up to 100mph on his Yamaha R1 bike.Jeremy Parrott, of Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, filmed his bike arriving and leaving what was thought to be his home address, enabling local police to track him down.The 37-year-old was interviewed by officers earlier this week and was reported for summons following questioning. He may now be prosecuted for dangerous driving."This man was driving through a built-up area, past a housing estate and a school, at up to 100mph," a spokesman for Avon and Somerset police said."There have been a number of incidents of people videoing themselves driving at excessive speeds in urban areas. They are putting their lives and the lives of other road users at risk."In the video - which has now been taken off YouTube - Mr Parrott's bike can be seen being driven through the Burnham-on-Sea area at high speeds. A camera has been fixed behind the windscreen, revealing the high-performance machine's dashboard."The motorcyclist is risking a long ban," the police spokesman added. "This is an important example to other road users thinking of putting videos like this on the internet."What is humorous to some could be fatal to others. If anyone knows of individuals involved in speeding they should contact police."
