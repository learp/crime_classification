Almost half of girls aged up to 18 feel unsafe in the UK's biggest cities and are often scared to go out in their own neighbourhoods, research by the Plan UK children's charity has shown.One in five respondents said they felt threatened by gangs, and 17% said they feared someone would assault them.More than 40% said they knew someone who had been attacked or assaulted.The girls, aged between 11 and 18, were questioned as part of a wider international report to be published by Plan UK next week.Entitled Because I am a Girl, the report examines the problems facing girls in cities across the developed and developing world.In the UK, more than 500 girls living in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, Bristol, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Coventry, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, took part in the survey.Nine out of ten said they thought more police on the streets would make them feel safer in their home cities, and 91% wanted better street lights to make them feel more secure after dark."Poor street lighting, overcrowded housing, and harassment on public transport all contribute to the very real risks that girls face. These are issues that must be tackled," Marie Staunton, the chief executive of Plan UK, said."It is unacceptable that, in cities all over the world, including in the UK, girls are often scared to go out."City life should present great opportunities for girls and young women â€“ we know that, in the developing world, girls in cities have better access to both education and health services."Living in cities can often be liberating. Violence and fear of violence should not be allowed to rule girls' lives."The surveys showed that more than 50% of girls in London thought crime in their local area had gone up in the last few years. Ten per cent of girls living in cities in the Midlands knew someone who had been assaulted in their neighbourhood in the last six months.Internationally, the report highlights urban poverty, overcrowding, unlit streets, lack of proper housing and transport and sexual harassment, making cities feel frightening to many young women.In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, 77% of girls said they were afraid to walk through their neighbourhoods after dark, 14% have friends who have been raped and 50% live in fear of sexual assault.In the developing world, thousands of girls are migrating from rural areas to big cities every day looking for education and economic opportunities, as well as independence. By 2030 approximately 1.5 billion girls will live in urban areas.The report says international, national and municipal authorities must make it their responsibility to make cities girl-friendly.
