Max Clifford has told a court he was greedy and liked women but was never interested in "silly little girls".He told Southwark crown court he had never been sexually frustrated, he had had several "loving relationships" with women and never needed to pursue young girls.Clifford, 70, who is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven girls and women, has previously branded his accusers "fantasists and opportunists", claiming their accusations could have stemmed from a desire to get compensation.As his cross-examination by the prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC continued on Monday, Clifford was taken through some of his diaries from the late 1970s that included regular references to lunches and appointments with different women, including employees, some of whom he has admitted having affairs with.He told the court: "I was never frustrated â€¦ I have been very lucky."Clifford said he had a "totally loving relationship" with his wife, as well as "loving relationships" with other longstanding mistresses, but he had "no interest or attraction" to young girls."I was not sexually frustrated, which was what you suggested," he told Cottage. "I was very happy with my sex life and I didn't need to impress young girls to achieve any kind of sexual satisfaction or interest or stimulation."It has never been me, that's not the person I ever was. I happen to like women, yes sure, and I have had some wonderful relationships in my life. I like women, is that a crime?"He said he was greedy in as much as he had a wife and had affairs with other women. "But I was never frustrated and never interested in silly little girls," he said.The trial continues.
