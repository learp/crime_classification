A former British spy who tried to sell top secret files to foreign agents admitted two offences under the Official Secrets act today.Daniel Houghton, who worked for MI6 between September 2007 and last May, was arrested in a Scotland Yard sting at a central London hotel in March after offering to sell documents to Dutch intelligence agents for £2m.The information consisted of MI5 files he had accessed while working for MI6 and a list of his former colleagues with their home addresses and mobile phone numbers.Appearing at the royal courts of justice, 25-year-old Houghton denied a count of theft but admitted two charges of unlawful disclosure of material relating to security or intelligence contrary to the Official Secrets act.The MI5 documents concerned specialist techniques developed by spies for gathering intelligence.Houghton burned many of the files onto DVDs and CDs on his office computer before taking them home.The former MI6 agent, who holds British and Dutch nationality, approached the Netherlands intelligence security and intelligence service offering to sell information in August 2009.A meeting was arranged for 18 February 2010 but, unknown to Houghton, the Dutch had tipped off MI5. Houghton was secretly videoed and bugged as he used a memory card and laptop computer to show his wares to the Dutch agents.The former spy said he would throw in two lists containing details of MI6 employees he had worked with.One contained more than 300 names, while the second had the home addresses and mobile phone numbers of 39 agents.After Houghton's initial offer to sell the information for £2m, the price was negotiated down to £900,000 and, in a subsequent phone call, a meeting was set for the handover two weeks later. During negotiations, he revealed he had a second memory card, containing further information, hidden at his mother's home in Devon. This card has never been found.On 1 March, Houghton handed over two memory cards and a computer hard drive after displaying the contents on a laptop.As he left the London hotel carrying the suitcase, he was arrested by plain clothes officers from Scotland Yard's specialist operations wing after a brief struggle.When Houghton handed over the information to supposed Dutch spies, he claimed he had given them "everything".But officers from Scotland Yard's specialist operations unit found hard copies of classified paperwork, some marked top secret or secret, while searching his shared rented flat in Hoxton, east London.They also discovered a Sony memory card containing about 7,000 files, some of them deleted, thought to be copies of a list of MI6 agents and the files he tried to sell.Some of the documents held by him have yet to be traced, and security service officials have warned that unauthorised disclosure of the material could have a significant impact on operations to protect Britain.Houghton is also said to hold potentially valuable experience of security techniques in his memory.Piers Arnold, prosecuting, told the judge, Mr Justice Bean, that the pleas entered today were acceptable to the prosecution.He asked for the theft matter to be adjourned until after Houghton had been sentenced "with the prosecution's intention to offer no evidence in respect of that charge".Houghton claimed his actions were "directed by voices" and the defence has submitted psychiatric reports in mitigation.The prosecution is to obtain its own independent report ahead of sentencing at the Old Bailey on 3 September, although Bean warned that custody was "inevitable".
