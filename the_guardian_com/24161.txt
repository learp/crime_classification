You say that the Home Office has postponed plans to reform the probation service (Home Office retreats on probation reform, April 3). This is not true. Public protection is our first priority and reform is essential to ensure the public is properly protected, as well as to reduce reoffending - both of which are central planks in the five-year strategy the home secretary published in February. Last week I published a summary of the responses to these reform plans. I set out with absolute clarity our intention to introduce contestability and legislate when parliamentary time allows.To this end, next month we will publish the prospectus which outlines the timetable and areas of service in which we will introduce contestability into the probation service. There is strong evidence that competition has helped improve the performance of prisons across the board and we want to similarly drive up standards in the probation service.
