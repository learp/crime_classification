It would make a surprising twist in a dramatist's plot – and burglar Anthony Kelly inadvertently chose the right property if he wants to see his criminal career on stage.Wandering into a five-floor mansion in Scarborough, he encountered its owner Sir Alan Ayckbourn, the world's second most performed playwright, who exchanged a courteous nod, assuming he was visiting someone else in the busy house.Kelly, 31 and a father-of-one from London, kept his cool and played the part, during the opportunistic sneak-raid while weekending with his mother, who lives in the Yorkshire resort. He went on to steal nearly £13,000 worth of jewellery, cash and Sir Alan's engraved black iPod, while life in the house continued as normal.York crown court heard yesterday that the thefts were only discovered some hours later, and Kelly's luck ran out rapidly after that. A convicted burglar, he had left his fingerprints on a letterbox. His link to Scarborough was soon traced and police arrested him at his mother's.He was jailed for 18 months by Judge John Swanson who told him: "You entered a large property where this very successful man entertains many visitors and friends and family. You came across him and he assumed you were visiting someone in the house so there was no confrontation, which is a mercy."David Garnett, prosecuting, said that Kelly had already stolen £2000 worth of property from another flat before he found an unlocked door in one of the three houses which Sir Alan and his wife Heather have combined into one. His takings included two of Lady Ayckbourn's earrings worth £2500 as well as necklaces, brooches and gold rings, which had sentimental as well as financial value.The theft had caused distress to the couple, both through the loss and when Sir Alan, 71, realised that the visitor he had taken on trust had been the burglar.Taryn Turner, solicitor for Kelly, who admitted two burglaries, said that he had sold the stolen goods because he was "desperately short of money." She said that following previous jail sentences in 1995 and 1997, he had found work in a store in London, but "succumbed to temptation again" while staying with his mother.Sir Alan, 71, retired as artistic director of the Stephen Joseph theatre in Scarborough last year after 30 years. He has written more than 70 plays, celebrated for their ingenious plots, and premiered all but four of them in the Yorkshire resort.
