Vital witnesses are withholding information in the hunt for the person who planned a skydiving murder, a summit of detectives from all over Britain was told yesterday.Leading police teams spent the day brainstorming over the unsolved killing last July of army parachute expert Stephen Hilder, 20, who plunged 4,000 metres (13,000ft) after his straps were cut. The unusual summit was prompted by frustration in Humberside police at the collapse of promising leads. Several skydiving friends of Hilder's have been questioned and inquiries have targeted 80 participants in the student championship weekend at Hibaldstow, Lincolnshire. Detective Superintendent Colin Andrews, head of the taskforce which has carried out 2,500 interviews so far, said: "There are still people out there who, for whatever reason, have not told us snippets of information that may be important to the inquiry and we need to keep digging. "One of those bits of information may be the vital clue we need to solve this mystery."
