A jury heard an audio recording today of the final moments of a police officer's life as he pleaded for mercy before being shot in the head.The recording was played at Newcastle crown court where US citizen David Bieber, 38, stands accused of the murder of PC Ian Broadhurst and the attempted murders of two of his colleagues. PC Broadhurst's screams and the shot being fired were picked up on a police patrol car's recording equipment. The 34-year-old officer and his colleagues PC Neil Roper, 45, and PC James Banks, 27, were attempting to arrest a man in a suburb of Leeds last Boxing Day when the shooting began. Moments before a CD of the recording was played to the jury, PC Broadhurst's wife, Eilisa, left the court accompanied by her parents. The jury was also shown video footage recorded by PC Broadhurst's patrol car. PC Roper could be seen checking over the suspect's car, a black BMW, which had been reported stolen. On the recording, the jury heard PC Roper tell the suspect they were going to transport him for further questioning and that they needed to handcuff him. The officer told the suspect he could not sit behind them in the car. The court heard PC Roper get out of the patrol car and open the rear door to place the handcuffs on the man and inform him that he was to be arrested. The sound of a handcuff ratchet was heard.The suspect said: "Mate lis ... lis ... listen don't don't." Then PC Roper said: "He's got a gun." This was followed by the noise of the first gunshot, then screams and groans before the second, third and fourth shots were heard followed by further screams. Then the words: "No don't, don't. Please, please, no." Then a fifth and final shot. Mr Bieber denies murder and two counts of attempted murder. He also denies possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and possession of 200 9mm cartridges. The trial continues.Â· Read the full transcript of the audio recording here
