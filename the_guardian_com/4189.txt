More than 1 million people packed the streets of west London yesterday for the final day of the Notting Hill carnival. Partygoers danced and clapped to the sound of steel drums and Caribbean music as floats snaked their way through the streets in the Mas parade.A total of 148 arrests were made, 52 for drug offences, 21 for carrying an offensive weapon, 27 public order offences, eight for drunken behaviour and two for robbery. There were also 334 incidents of reported crime. On Sunday there were 110 arrests and 207 incidents of reported crime. Chief Inspector Jo Edwards of the Metropolitan police said: "The number of arrests is up on last year, but that is predominantly because of proactive policing."Police used stop-and-search tactics throughout the carnival and in one incident officers surrounded 180 youths outside the Oval cricket ground to stop them travelling to Notting Hill. Several were arrested to prevent a breach of the peace. "The message is that there is no place for knives at the carnival," Edwards said. "We share the concern of Londoners over the recent spate of knife crime and we are doing all we can to combat that."Twelve people were arrested under the Dangerous Dogs Act over the weekend.
