Posters advertising a Holocaust memorial event have been daubed with graffiti including the words “liars” and “killer”.The Metropolitan police said the incidents, which took place in Stratford, east London, were being listed as a hate crime, and said officers in Newham were investigating.Newham council received pictures of the offences – involving three posters publicising the council’s Holocaust memorial day event – through social media.Meanwhile, chief constables across the country are reviewing how to strengthen the protection of their officers and the Jewish community in the light of the Paris terrorist attacks.Assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, the national policing lead for counter-terrorism, said the attack on a kosher supermarket in the French capital and antisemitic rhetoric from extremists had led to a heightened concern about the risk to the Jewish population in the UK.Sir Robin Wales, mayor of Newham, described the incidents in east London as despicable.He said: “This despicable and cowardly hate-crime is an assault on the values of decency and mutual respect which the vast majority of us share.“This outrage underlines not only the importance of keeping the memory of the Holocaust alive but of standing up to intolerance and hatred at every opportunity.“Newham council will work with our police partners to bring those responsible to justice.”The graffiti, which is being treated as racially aggravated criminal damage, has already been removed from the three sites around the Stratford area, the council said.The posters, which are on display at 43 sites across the borough, are advertising the council’s Holocaust memorial day event on 27 January at Stratford town hall.The council said police were checking the borough’s CCTV footage to try to identify those responsible and council officials would monitor all advertising boards in case of further offences.Resident James Tattle reported one of the incidents to Newham council on Twitter.He said he was “repulsed” by what he saw.“I recently noticed the posters promoting the Holocaust Memorial Day event, I thought it was great that an event was happening locally to mark the occasion. I was utterly repulsed, and saddened, to see one of the posters had been defaced,” he said.“I couldn’t believe that anyone would stoop so low as to scrawl that graffiti – not something I expect to see in London in 2015.”The racially aggravated criminal damage was found in three locations: two in High Street, Stratford, and one in West Ham Lane, near Stratford Park, the council said.
