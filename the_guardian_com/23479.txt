Stephen Lawrence's mother yesterday warned that it could take more than one generation to implement the changes stemming from the inquiry into her son's racist murder.Doreen Lawrence spoke at the inaugural Stephen Lawrence memorial lecture, delivered by the Prince of Wales. Her son, who was 18 in 1993 when stabbed to death at a bus stop, had dreamed of becoming an architect, and the prince used his speech to announce a scholarship named after him aimed at increasing ethnic minority architects.Speaking before the prince's address, Mrs Lawrence said many lessons arising from the murder and the bungled police investigation had yet to be learned: "How it should be changed is going to take some time, not even in Stephen's generation will it happen, but the generation to come." She and Neville Lawrence, father of Stephen, have set up a trust to raise funds to support ethnic minority architects, with the aim of a "Stephen Lawrence" student in each of the country's 30 architecture schools. Most of the Prince of Wales's speech, made at his architecture foundation, was an attack on modern architecture, but he expressed his deepest sympathy for Mr and Mrs Lawrence, saying: "I wish them well in their quest to build something positive from the shocking and sudden loss of their son."
