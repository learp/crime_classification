"You were about to bring all that to an end," he added."This was a deliberate, wilful act of shocking, dangerous vandalism."Thornton continued: "The Reeves family lost their historic business, something they and generations before had lived and worked for all their lives. Their loss is priceless. The trauma they have suffered is inestimable."Thompson followed other looters into Reeves and stole a laptop, before deciding to set fire to a sofa in the shop window.As the blaze caught hold it spread to buildings on the opposite side of the road, forcing residents to flee.One woman, Monika Konczyk, had to throw herself from the building where she lived to escape the flames.Thompson admitted starting the fire on 24 February â€“ shortly after the start of his trial. He had been filmed on mobile phones and by CCTV cameras as he attacked the shop.
