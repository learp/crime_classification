John Reid, the home secretary, faced fresh embarrassment last night when senior police officers revealed that his department had turned down a request in October for extra funds to sort out the criminal records backlog of Britons convicted abroad.The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said it had asked officials for money to allow it to clear up the 27,500 case files within three instead of 12 months but the request had been rejected.It also emerged yesterday that Acpo sent a letter about the difficulties they were having with the exchange of criminal records across the EU to the police minister, Tony McNulty, in the same month. Acpo claimed last night that subsequent meetings on the problem had taken place with the Home Office in October and November.The developments brought the row over the latest Whitehall blunder one step closer to Mr Reid, although the Home Office said last night that no minister knew about the decision to reject the police request. The matter was handled by the Home Office's crime reduction and community safety group, headed by Moira Wallace, director general of crime, policing and terrorism.The revelation came as Mr Reid admitted to the Commons that the details of 280 - more than half - of Britons convicted abroad of serious offences, including murder, rape and robbery, dating back to 1999 have yet to be logged on to the criminal records database. In an emergency statement to parliament, he said half of the offenders had not been logged on the police computer because foreign governments had provided "insufficient detail" to make the entry usable. In some cases only a name had been provided; in others the information had been faxed and was illegible. So far, details of only 260 of the 540 British criminals who have committed the more serious offences abroad have been entered on the computer, 111 of them supplied directly by Interpol.Mr Reid's admission was embarrassing because his department had claimed on Tuesday that the case files of all serious offenders had been entered on to the police national computer. His clarification followed complaints from senior police officers. Mr Reid promised that an internal inquiry would be completed within six weeks and would cover how 27,500 case files dating back seven years could have been left lying around in boxes at the Home Office instead of being processed. A spokesman said last night it would also look into the circumstances surrounding the Acpo request for extra funds.The Home Office said last night that Acpo's letter - which is not thought to have specifically mentioned funding or the backlog - was referred from Mr McNulty's office to junior Home Office minister, Joan Ryan, who is responsible for the Criminal Records Bureau.Acpo released a statement last night saying they had received a reply to the letter from Ms Ryan, and "subsequent meetings with Home Office officials took place in October and December".Mr Reid admitted there had been "fundamental flaws" in the sending and receipt of the information: "This is a very serious matter ... The process for handling these notifications when they arrived in the UK was fragmented and piecemeal."The assurance followed a tense meeting between the home secretary, police chief constables and the head of the Criminal Records Bureau yesterday morning. Acpo, which took over responsibility for processing foreign conviction reports in May, told Mr Reid it would take a further 12 months to work through the less serious 27,000 case files yet to be processed.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said Mr Reid could no longer blame civil servants or police officers for the blunder. The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said: "John Reid is fast resembling Manuel from Fawlty Towers who made a habit of declaring 'I know nothing'.
