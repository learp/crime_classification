Within the details of the government's announcement on organised crime today is a tacit admission that the policies of the last five years have failed to get a grip on a problem that eats at the heart of civilised society.While the focus from the politicians has been on counter-terrorism, there has been an insidious rise in criminal gangs in the UK that has not been tackled by the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca), set up in 2006 to be Britain's equivalent of the FBI.The mention of "regional units" in the new strategy addresses what senior police have been saying for nearly two years: that there is a huge policing gap between the intelligence work of Soca at the top of the scale and the capabilities of local police forces to tackle organised crime that crosses county boundaries and requires costly covert surveillance and dedicated teams of officers.For many, the words "regional units" will hark back to the regional crime squads of the 1980s and 90s, teams of detectives focused on organised crime, drug trafficking and murder linked to criminal gangs. Many will look at the government's new strategy and believe that we have come full circle.It was in 1998 that the regional crime squads were disbanded, after years of controversy and allegations of corruption. Their demise led to the creation of the National Crime Squad, Britain's first national police force, with 1,500 officers based in London and three regional operating bases, whose job was to tackle organised crime at every level. It was the NCS that successfully targeted Terry Adams, bringing him to justice for money laundering after a lengthy, hugely expensive covert surveillance operation.But in 2006 the government's flagship Soca took over from the National Crime Squad, with a former head of MI5 at its top and a mixture of police, customs and intelligence officers in its teams.Soca, too, was created to target all forms of organised crime, but senior police officers told the government repeatedly that, while Soca concentrated on the high end, what was needed was dedicated teams at regional level for operations against criminal gangs.What most senior officers wanted was the merger of Britain's 43 police forces into nine or 12 large regional units that would have a more strategic overview and be better funded, less localised and better able to cope with the complexities of fighting organised crime.Yet they know that there is neither the political will nor the funding for this.In the absence of that prize, most investigators welcome the new strategy on organised crime. What they hope it will amount to is not the re-creation of the regional crime squads but a tight, workable, efficient collaboration of major crime units across the country, with the Home Office taking strategic control and political oversight.
