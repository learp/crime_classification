Police who shut down one of the largest illegal raves in several years in south-west England said the gathering did not signal a return to the rave scene of the late 1980s and 1990s.An officer was injured at the event near Warminster, in Wiltshire, which drew 4,000 revellers on Saturday night. It is thought to be the biggest rave that the county's force has had to deal with.A 46-year-old policeman was hit by a car at the site, off the B390 between Knook and Chitterne, and suffered a suspected fractured ankle. He was taken to Salisbury district hospital where he was due to undergo surgery today.Officers were deployed throughout Saturday night to clear the site, where ravers had set up sound stages and hundreds of cars were left by the side of the road, which was closed temporarily.A Wiltshire police spokesman said raves normally attract several hundred people rather than thousands. "Fortunately a gathering of this size is unusual. There have been smaller gatherings – some involving several hundred people – we have had to deal with on occasions in the past couple of years. I don't know why this one was larger. The bank holiday weekend might be a factor."A number of people at the rave required medical treatment for alcohol and drug intake and one person was taken to hospital.Wiltshire police said the injured officer was standing by the side of his car trying to restrict access to the site when he was hit by another vehicle trying to enter the rave. The force is investigating whether any charges will be brought.In 1994 the then Conservative home secretary, Michael Howard, introduced the Criminal Justice Act to tackle unlicensed raves. Zero-tolerance policing and legislation that banned gatherings of more than 10 people listening to music "wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats" drove many abroad.But the scene never entirely disappeared and gatherings of several dozen or a few hundred people continued across the country – much smaller than events such as the week-long rave at Castlemorton, a traveller camp on common land in Hereford in May 1992, which attracted about 25,000 revellers.Police in Suffolk, Norfolk, Gloucestershire and Somerset have dealt with illegal gatherings, usually involving 100-500 revellers, a few times a year in the past few years.In April, Gloucestershire police broke up a rave with more than 1,000 revellers in Chedworth Woods, near Compton Abdale, on the £15m estate of Lord Vestey, head of Vestey Foods.Police in Suffolk and Norfolk urged landowners and the public to be on the lookout for illegal raves over the bank holiday weekend.
