A builder accused of murdering schoolgirl Danielle Jones was always looking at young girls, her grandmother told a court yesterday.Stuart Campbell, 44, used to laugh and joke with Danielle, his 15-year-old niece, and tell her how nice she looked, Janet Jones said. The jury at Chelmsford crown court also heard that Danielle's father, Tony Jones, had gone to Mr Campbell's home on the day of his daughter's disappearance because he was suspicious of him. Mr Jones told the court that Mr Campbell used to put his arm around Danielle, letting his hand rest near her breast. Danielle went missing shortly after leaving her home in East Tilbury, Essex, in June last year. Her body has never been found. The prosecution alleges that Mr Campbell, of Grays, Essex, was obsessed by her and had a fixation with girls. He denies abducting and murdering Danielle. Mrs Jones, the mother of Mr Campbell's wife and of Danielle's father, said: "He [Campbell] would always be looking [at young girls]." Asked about Mr Campbell's attitude towards Danielle, Mrs Jones said: "Quite nice. He would laugh and joke with her and say how nice she looked." Mr Jones, 42, told the court he had spoken to Mr Campbell soon after hearing that Danielle was missing. Mr Campbell said he had not seen her. Shortly afterwards, Mr Jones said, he visited his brother-in-law at his home. He said: "[I went] just to check. To see that he definitely hadn't seen her. I wanted to make sure. I was a little bit suspicious." Orlando Pownall QC, prosecuting, asked Mr Jones whether he had seen any physical contact between Mr Campbell and Danielle. He replied: "The only contact I saw was he would put his arm around her. Over her shoulder and his hand near her breast." Michael Borrelli QC, for Mr Campbell, asked Mr Jones why, if there had been inappropriate contact between Mr Campbell and Danielle, he had not objected. Mr Jones said: "I wanted to be 100% sure. I didn't want to cause a big row in the family." The trial continues.
