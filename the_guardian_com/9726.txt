A teenager was stabbed to death on Britain's busiest shopping street during the Boxing Day sales, a court has heard.Seydou Diarrassouba, 18, was knifed twice in the chest by Jermaine Joseph with such speed that no one realised what had happened, said Mark Heywood QC, prosecuting. He had been stabbed through the heart with such force that the knife broke in two at the hilt, Heywood said.Diarrassouba staggered out of the packed Foot Locker store and collapsed on the pavement in Oxford Street, central London, where he died.Diarrassouba and Joseph had spotted each other on the street and ran into the shop where Diarrassouba had just bought shoes, along with co-accused Thulani Khumalo.Heywood told the Old Bailey the case involved "bad blood" between Diarrassouba and his association and Joseph and his friends."The grievance was evidently a deep and powerful one," said Heywood. "It led almost instantly to ugly, brutish violence in broad daylight in a packed street on the busiest shopping day of the year."You may think that was one of the days and places people could go in peace."Jermaine Joseph, 23, from Tottenham, and Thulani Khumalo, 20, from Finsbury Park, both in north London, deny murder on 26 December last year.Joseph told police he had acted in self-defence and Khumalo denied involvement in the stabbing.The case continues.
