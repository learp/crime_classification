The wife of a man who plunged from a hotel balcony in Crete with his two children has denied that her husband was drunk and described him as a "caring father".John Hogan, 32, could be charged with murder after his son, Liam, six, died and his daughter, Mia, two, was injured when they fell four storeys from their beachfront hotel in Lerapetra on August 15.Mr Hogan, who had apparently been arguing with his wife before the incident, is under police guard at a hospital in the island's capital, Heraklion, after breaking his arm and leg and suffering chest injuries in the fall. The family had been on a two-week holiday at the Petra Mare hotel.In a statement released yesterday, his wife, Natasha, 34, said she wanted to "set the record straight" regarding the events leading up to the fall: "On the day in question, John was sober having consumed no alcohol. His action is felt to have been completely out of character for the caring father that he was to both Liam and Mia. John remains in hospital in Crete and it has still not been possible to speak with him in order to discuss in detail exactly what happened."Mrs Hogan and their daughter, who broke her arm in the fall, returned to the UK on Friday after the girl was discharged.Meanwhile, reports that Mr Hogan had gone on hunger strike have been denied by the Foreign Office. It said Mr Hogan, who runs a tiling business in Bristol, would be arrested on suspicion of the murder of Liam and the attempted murder of Mia when he had recovered sufficiently.But a spokesman for the Greek embassy said it could be several days before Mr Hogan was fit enough to be formally interviewed. An inquest into Liam's death will open today and his funeral is planned for next Tuesday.
