Downing Street has moved to quash claims that David Cameron "slapped down" Ken Clarke over his plans to simplify the rules on sentencing murderers within 24 hours of the justice secretary outlining his major criminal justice shakeup.A Downing Street spokesman said while Cameron "felt very strongly" that the most serious offenders deserved the toughest sentences, there was never any intention to abolish the mandatory life sentence for murder or propose any reduction in the minimum terms for murder.Some of the tabloid newspapers seized on the proposal and claimed that Clarke – as the Sun put it – was a "softie justice minister who wanted to end minimum jail sentences for murder". They claim that Cameron has already ordered Clarke to abandon the proposed change.Downing Street went out of its way today to say that the guidelines, in schedule 21 of the 2003 Criminal Justice Act, were under review, but would not be scrapped.The schedule says that in specified types of murder cases the "starting point" for judges when considering their sentences should range between 25 and 30 years and a "whole life" sentence for adults, and 15 years for juveniles. These starting points are not binding minimums, and judges go on to consider any aggravating or mitigating factors to decide whether the actual sentence should be higher or lower."There are a series of guidelines which effectively set a point of departure for judges in cases," said the prime minister's spokesman. "They set out parliament's intention in terms of the appropriate tariff. In individual cases judges have discretion to move away from that if the circumstances of the case allowed for it."Downing Street said Cameron agreed with Clarke that over time the guidelines had become complicated, and so it was worthwhile reviewing them to see if they could be simplified.No 10 said that Cameron did not want to see any "watering down" of sentences for serious offences, and strongly backed 'Ben's law' – the 25-year "starting point" for considering the minimum term for murders involving a fatal stabbing. This was introduced earlier this year by the Labour home secretary, Alan Johnson, in the wake of the murder of teenager Ben Kinsella.Clarke's green paper on sentencing, which was published on Tuesday, also makes clear that there is "no intention to scrap the mandatory life sentence, or of prompting any general reduction in minimum terms imposed for murder".It goes on to add: "However, schedule 21 is based on ill-thought-out and overly prescriptive policy. It seeks to analyse in extraordinary detail each and every type of murder. The result is guidance that is incoherent and unnecessarily complex, and is badly in need of reform so that justice can be done properly in each case."Juliet Lyon, of the Prison Reform Trust, said there appeared to be a deliberate attempt to create a misunderstanding about sentences for murder, and to manufacture a row between Cameron and Clarke, to torpedo a thoughtful green paper. "There is a clear commitment to reform policy and practice based on evidence, rather than opinion, of what works to cut crime. Just desserts, rather than just politics, would be a welcome break for a beleaguered justice system."
