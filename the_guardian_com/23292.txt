A cage fighter who was extradited from Morocco to face trial over his part in the £53m Securitas robbery in Tonbridge, Kent, was jailed for 18 years today.Paul Allen 30, was flown back to the UK under police guard in January 2008 four days after five men were convicted for their role in Britain's largest cash robbery.He was tried at the Old Bailey but, in January, a jury failed to reach a verdict. He was due to be retried at Woolwich crown court in south-east London but the Crown Prosecution Service revealed last week that he had admitted three charges relating to the plot.Posing as police officers, the gang got away with what was described as a "king's ransom", in February 2006. But they left behind £153m because they could not fit any more into their lorry. The manager of the depot, Colin Dixon, and his family were kidnapped at gunpoint. The story of the raid is to be made into a Hollywood film.Allen's agreed basis of plea said that he did not handle or obtain any firearms used for the raid. He said he was working for Lee Murray, a fellow cage fighter who was the mastermind of the heist.Allen fled to Morocco with Murray, who remains in the north African country, after the raid.The pair embarked on a spending spree, purchasing villas, drugs and jewellery and spending thousands of pounds on plastic surgery for their partners.After he was caught Allen spent 20 months in Rabat jail before being extradited. Murray, whose father was from Morocco, claimed Moroccan nationality to avoid extradition.
