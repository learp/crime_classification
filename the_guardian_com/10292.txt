Former socialist MSP Tommy Sheridan has been charged with perjury, his lawyer has said.The 43-year-old was detained at Gayfield police station in Edinburgh after plain clothes officers picked him up outside Talk107 radio station, where he presents a show.The former MSP's home was being searched tonight by officers from Lothian and Borders police, the force dealing with the perjury allegations. Sheridan's wife Gail was detained at the house while nine police officers carried out the search.Sheridan, who left the Scottish Socialists to set up his own party Solidarity, was awarded Â£200,000 damages following a defamation case against the News of the World newspaper last year.Sheridan's lawyer Aamer Anwar confirmed that his client had been charged with perjury and the case would be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal. He said: "Tommy Sheridan has been charged. He is being processed at the moment and will be released shortly."Mr Sheridan maintains his innocence and condemns the excessive action of Lothian and Borders Police today. They have had a year in which to carry out their inquiry. If they had lifted up the phone he would have come down. The fact that they detained his wife in her home and came to his workplace is simply unacceptable."
