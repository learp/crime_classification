The best comment on the hanging of Mrs Ellis was made yesterday by a group of teachers from a school near Holloway Prison. It is reproduced on another page. They speak of the ferment of excitement in the school, of children who claimed to have seen the execution from their windows, or spoke "with a fascinated horror about the technique of the hanging of a female ... Not only was Mrs Ruth Ellis hanged to-day, hundreds of children were a little corrupted."This ferment of excitement was no doubt exceptionally keen because the school was near the prison, but its echo has sounded far afield; innumerable people, children or adults, have been a little corrupted by it. And this will always be so, while capital punishment remains the penalty for murder. The Home Secretary should not be criticised for his refusal in this instance to grant a reprieve. While the death penalty endures, this was the occasion for it. The case against hanging Mrs Ellis was the case against hanging anybody. But was there ever a murder in which the prospect of hanging so singularly failed to act as a deterrent? Whatever the state of excitement or of resentment under which Mrs Ellis laboured, she must have known what would follow the deliberate shooting of a man in the street. When passions spin and plot, the threat of the gallows is a broken reed.
