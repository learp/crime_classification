The number of child pornography offences in Britain has soared by about 1,500% since 1988 as a direct result of internet use, according to a study by the children's charity, NCH. To date, the most successful British campaign against purchasers of child pornography has been Operation Ore, which has seen 7,250 suspects identified since its launch four years ago. Almost 1,500 have been prosecuted, and more than 100 children have been removed from situations in which they were thought to be in danger.Among those arrested, and later cautioned, was Pete Townshend, the guitarist and songwriter with the rock band The Who.Police relied upon credit card details which purchasers had given to a child pornography business run by Thomas Reedy and his wife Janice from their home in Fort Worth, Texas.The parallel US investigation, Operation Avalanche, identified about 35,000 customers. While only a fraction of those were prosecuted, Reedy was sentenced to 1,335 years in prison, and his wife was jailed for 14 years.Since then, there have been growing signs that organised criminals are starting to move into online child pornography, according to the newly formed Serious and Organised Crime Agency. Although tackling such sites is difficult, as they are usually hosted abroad, a number of police forces around the country now have small teams of officers who enter chatrooms posing as juveniles in an attempt to identify predatory paedophiles.Many of those involved in the fight against internet child pornography remain pessimistic about the future, however, believing they are frequently one step behind the pornographers.And more child pornography means more child suffering. As NCH observes: "Because the internet is facilitating a larger number of individuals becoming involved in collecting and possessing child abuse images, it follows that it is highly likely that more children are being abused."
