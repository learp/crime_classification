The jurors in the trial of three men accused of helping the 7/7 suicide bombers to pick their targets for the 2005 attacks that killed 52 innocent people were today told they could return a majority verdict.Mr Justice Gross gave the direction, which means agreement by 10 out of the 12 jurors would be acceptable for a verdict, after more than 10 days of deliberations by the jury failed to produce a decision.The jury retired to consider its verdict on July 14 following a three-month trial at Kingston crown court.Waheed Ali, Sadeer Saleem and Mohammed Shakil are accused of accompanying two of the 7/7 bombers on an alleged "hostile" reconnaissance of potential targets in London in December 2004. During the trip they visited the London Eye, the Natural History Museum and the London Aquarium.Seven months later Mohammed Sidique Khan, Shezhad Tanweer, Hasib Hussain and Jermaine Lindsay detonated rucksack devices packed with explosives on three Tube trains and a bus. Ali, 25, Saleem, 28, and Shakil, 32, travelled from Leeds to London with Hussain on December 16 2004 and met up with Lindsay in the capital. The group stayed overnight in a hostel and over two days visited a series of locations which bore a "striking similarity" to where the bombs were detonated on July 7 the following year, the prosecution claimed.The three defendants admitted making the visit but claimed it was entirely for social reasons and that they visited the tourist attractions solely for sightseeing.
