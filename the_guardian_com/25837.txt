A police inspector who shot his mother-in-law dead while awaiting trial over the murder of his wife may have planned the shooting a month in advance, an inquest heard today.Garry Weddell may also have intended to kill other members of his family, but was prevented from doing so when he was disturbed by a police helicopter, the coroner was told. Instead he shot himself in the head with a stolen shotgun."The investigation team believe Weddell was possibly en route to carry out another attack but had been worried about the helicopter overhead," Detective Chief Inspector Sean O'Neill told the inquest at Dunstable magistrates court, in Bedfordshire."He thought we were aware of his presence, and he panicked."David Morris, the coroner for Bedford and Luton, ruled that Mrs Weddell and 70-year-old Traute Maxfield were unlawfully killed by Weddell.There was evidence that Weddell had planned his mother-in-law's killing and his suicide, taking lessons in clay pigeon shooting and stealing the shotgun from his gun club, Morris said.In a statement read out by police after the verdict, Mrs Weddell's family said: "It is impossible to describe the utter hurt and devastation the selfish coward has been able to cause to our family and his own children."Weddell, of Dunstable, killed Maxfield following a successful application awarding custody of Weddell's three children to her son.Five months before shooting Maxfield,Weddell was granted bail while awaiting trial for his wife's murder, despite prosecution objections. However, a psychiatrist reported that he did not pose a suicide risk.He had claimed his wife's death was suicide, but was charged with murder after police found marks on her body indicating that she had been in a fight. Experts concluded her suicide note had been faked, the inquest heard.Morris said he may urge the government to review restrictions on judges considering bail applications in the light of Weddell's case, and may also submit observations on the safeguards employed by gun clubs.
