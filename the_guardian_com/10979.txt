More people have come forward with claims they were abused at the Jersey care home that is being searched for human remains, police said today.A child's skull was found at Haut de la Garenne last Saturday during a police search stemming from allegations of widespread child abuse on the island dating back to the 1960s.The Jersey deputy police chief, Lenny Harper, said two people had come forward in the last few hours with allegations of "serious sexual crimes".On Wednesday, police broke into the bricked-up cellar of the building, which is now a hostel. They have said there may be two more such rooms.Today, Harper said police had found a trapdoor that corroborated the evidence of victims.He said police had obtained old plans of Haut de la Garenne indicating the cellar was once the ground floor.It was a "very slow, methodical and thorough operation to separate out any possible pieces of evidence", he said, while revealing he hoped to draft in 12 more officers to work on the inquiry.The Jersey ITV station, Channel TV, today named 13 people, including former staff at the home and high-profile government officials of the time. Police would not say whether any of them were being interviewed as suspects or witnesses.The island's chief minister, Frank Walker, said yesterday: "There are no states of Jersey employees that have been subject to any police investigation."You should not conclude that [state employees at Haut de la Garenne] were involved in any sort of abuse."The deputy police chief, Lenny Harper, has previously referred to suspects who held "positions of responsibility".Shackles were found yesterday in the cellar of the home. The discovery was described as "significant" by police, who said it matched accounts given by complainants. They have described suffering horrific abuse including beatings and rape while in solitary confinement in "punishment rooms" underneath Haut de la Garenne.A bath has been found in the room, as mentioned by many of the more than 160 people who have reported abuse.Police yesterday began excavating a third site in a field next to the building. Harper said this arose from "unspecific information which related to items that somebody has said might be out there".He said the police search would continue for several weeks.
