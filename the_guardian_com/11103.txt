Fears that prisoners would be locked up in police cells as a costly alternative to jail were allayed today as prison chiefs announced that pressure on prison places has eased.The prison population of England and Wales reached a record of 79,843 over the weekend, theoretically leaving space available for only 125 more prisoners.The home secretary, John Reid, announced emergency measures on Monday to cope with the crisis, including making 500 police cells available.But Charles Bushell, general secretary of the Prison Governors' Association, today said that that numbers of inmates had now dipped by about 200, and the extra cells may not be needed apart from in isolated local areas.However, the Prison Reform Trust said it was too early to claim the government had got to grips with overcrowding. Prison places had risen and dropped on a weekly basis for the last three months and were likely to continue, a spokesman for the charity said."I would not be too quick to claim that numbers are on their way down, due to the fluctuation. It is historically too early for the time of year given that it tends to go on an annual cycle."Mr Bushell said some of the credit for the fall in numbers being imprisoned should go to the lord chief justice, Lord Phillips, who issued a call for courts to make more use of community sentences."Since the weekend, and I think particularly since the intervention of Lord Phillips, our numbers have declined by a couple of hundred," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."So actually, at the moment, we can probably cope with the current position for some time to come," he said. "But we may find in little pockets we have to use police cells because we have run out of room locally."With jails on the brink of having to put up "no vacancies" notices last weekend, Mr Reid implemented Operation Safeguard to bring police cells into use, as well as announcing measures to speed the deportation of foreign prisoners and plans to use women's prisons to house male inmates.Home Office minister Gerry Sutcliffe said today that government backed Lord Phillips' call for fewer offenders to be jailed."There is a balance that needs to be struck," Mr Sutcliffe told the Today programme. "What's happened is that people are serving longer sentences because we need to imprison those who are the most dangerous and prolific offenders. "What we have got to do is look at community sentences to see if we can get people on community payback schemes and that's a matter for the judges and the judiciary."We are quite happy with what Lord Phillips said. We do need to manage the prison population."But magistrates today denied pressure was being brought to bear on sentencing outcomes, insisting prison place pressures did not, and should not, affect decisions made in the courts.A spokeswoman for the Magistrates Association said: "Magistrates are aware of the situation but as sentencers they work from legislation and guidance, and sentence according to seriousness. If they can step back from custody they do, but they are not directed by anybody to do so because of a shortage of prison places."
