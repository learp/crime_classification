The family of a mother and her three-year-old daughter who were stabbed to death at their home have spoken of their ordeal.The bodies of Susan Peters, 29, and her daughter, Ellen, were found at their flat in New Brighton, Merseyside, on Friday. Detectives believe that Mrs Peters may have known her killer as there was no evidence of forced entry and nothing was stolen. They believe the killer may have left on a stolen Peugeot mountain bike. After Mrs Peters failed to turn up for a shift as a waitress at a local golf club on Friday morning, her brother Fred, a police officer, visited their home where he found his dead sister and niece. He said: "Ellen was a beautiful little girl whose personality touched everyone. She gave so much love and was not only Sue's little girl, but also her closest friend." He said he could not understand why anyone would want to hurt his sister, whom he described as a "quiet, inoffensive person with a strong personality". Mrs Peters's husband, Ian, a chef in the Royal Navy, was being comforted by family members after he had driven home from his base in Portsmouth. He had last seen his wife at Christmas. Detective Superintendent Peter Currie, of Merseyside police, described the murders as despicable and horrendous. "There hasn't been, on the face of things, a burglary or a robbery. She [Susan] led just a normal life with a little child who was absolutely devoted to her." Police are appealing for witnesses.
