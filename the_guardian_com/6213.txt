Two murder investigations have been launched after separate fatal stabbing incidents in London on Friday.A man was found collapsed on a road in east London, 90 minutes after a woman was murdered one street away. The victims, both aged in their 20s, were not related but knew each other, Scotland Yard said.The woman had been stabbed repeatedly in Valentines Road, Ilford, with police called to the scene at 5.30pm. She was taken to hospital but pronounced dead on arrival.Shortly after 7pm officers were called to nearby Auckland Road where a man was found lying in the street. He was taken to hospital and died soon afterwards, the Metropolitan police said.In a statement police said: “The death of the woman, who had suffered multiple stab wounds, is being treated as murder. At this early stage there is no evidence to suggest that the death of the man is suspicious.”Earlier, around 2.30pm, police were called to reports of a stabbing in Pilgrimage Street in the Borough area of south London. Officers, London ambulance and the air ambulance attended but the 18-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene.The road was cordoned off as forensic teams began investigations outside the Quality Food store. No arrests had been made, the Met said on Friday.A witness, who did not want to be named, said the teenager was with a friend and his aunt when he was attacked.Postmortem examinations were to be held on all three who died in the two separate cases.
