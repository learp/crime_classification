A pensioner was tricked into opening her front door by a man displaying Age UK charity leaflets, then brutally murdered with a hammer, a court has heard.Judith Richardson, 77, was found battered to death at her home in Hexham, Northumberland, in August last year after her handbag was discovered dumped in a bin in Newcastle.Graeme Jarman, 48, from the Delves Lane area of Consett, County Durham, denies her murder. The prosecution said it was not a random attack, and that there was evidence that Jarman selected his victim, whom he also robbed, the day before.Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said: "The murder was done for no other reason than personal gain. This was not a chance encounter with Miss Richardson. The prosecution's case is that the defendant planned her killing and went to her home well-prepared for what he intended to do."In order to kill Miss Richardson, the defendant needed to gain access to her home and to have available some means of explaining his presence in the road where she lived, should he be challenged."His method was simple. He took with him two leaflets issued by the charity Age UK. These are likely to have been obtained from the Age UK shop shortly before the murder."The leaflets were found in the hall of her home after her death and Jarman's fingerprint was found on one of them, Smith said. "The person responsible for her murder had ransacked her bedroom and had taken away with him her handbag and items of jewellery."Jarman allegedly fled Hexham using public transport and sold the items to a shop in Newcastle hours later.Smith said Jarman had planned to kill Richardson as he took a hammer he had stolen from a Hexham department store with him. "He used that hammer to batter her to death then abandoned it in a carrier bag on a wall next to her home," Smith said.CCTV images of Jarman in Hexham, Newcastle and other locations were later detected, the court heard.He was arrested two weeks later in Filey, North Yorkshire, after police circulated his description and he was spotted by a member of the public, Smith said.The jury was shown CCTV footage of both Jarman and Richardson shopping in Hexham the day before she was killed.At one stage, Jarman appears to leave Beal's store, where the prosecution alleges he stole the hammer he used as a murder weapon, just 30 seconds before Richardson, who was doing her shopping, enters.Smith told jurors the defendant had just Â£1.55 in his bank account and had ended the tenancy on his flat and travelled to Hexham two days before the killing.He slept in a bed and breakfast on his first night in the town before sleeping rough the second night, the court heard.The CCTV footage appeared to show Jarman walking around the town centre, carrying a distinctive green bag and talking to elderly residents.Smith said: "The prosecution say that, at this time, the defendant was observing elderly females. There's clear evidence that this is what he was doing."The trial, which is scheduled to last up to four weeks, continues.
