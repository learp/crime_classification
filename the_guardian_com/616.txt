The sister of the murdered British hostess Lucie Blackman attempted to commit suicide over her grief, and her brother requires constant medication, a court in Tokyo heard today.In a harrowing statement to judges trying the Japanese businessman Joji Obara, Tim Blackman spoke of the devastating effect of the murder on his family.He said Lucie's 25-year-old sister, Sophie, was under psychiatric observation and her 22-year-old brother, Rupert, was under medical supervision as they both struggled to come to terms with the murder.Ms Blackman, a former flight attendant from Sevenoaks in Kent, was working as a hostess in a nightclub in the Roppongi district of Tokyo when she vanished in July 2000.Her dismembered body was found in a cave in Miura, a remote fishing village outside the city, in February 2001, after a seven-month search.Mr Obara denies the abduction of Ms Blackman, rape resulting in her death and disposing of her body.Mr Blackman, from the Isle of Wight, told the court: "I see the pain and despair in the faces of Sophie and Rupert, knowing I can only comfort them with words as I worry how their future will be affected by the loss of their sister."After the internment of Lucie's ashes, my daughter Sophie, who had amazed the world by her strength and courage during the seven-month search for Lucie, could no longer sustain the grief and trauma caused by the death of her beloved sister and she attempted to commit suicide."Since then she has been under psychiatric observation and is currently an in-patient at a psychiatric unit."He said Rupert's life had been "tortured" and "damaged", and that he needed constant medication and supervision to stabilise his emotions.He had failed years at university through illness while he struggled to move on, his father said.Mr Blackman said: "[Lucie's] death has left me shattered, empty and numb as her precious life has been torn from me."He added he could not stop thinking of the moment when her life stopped. "Was she in pain, was she terrified, did she call for me?" he asked.Mr Blackman's former wife, Jane Steare, has already given her impact statement to the court, telling judges that Lucie's death was the "greatest and most unrelenting pain" she had ever had to endure.Mr Obara also denies further charges of killing another foreign hostess and raping six other women.His four-storey apartment block, where he is alleged to have chopped up Ms Blackman 's body and encased her head in concrete, is about 100 metres from the cave where her body was found.Mr Blackman refused a £300,000 offer by her alleged killer to stop him giving evidence in court.Lawyers acting for Mr Obara initially offered him £200,000 but increased it to £300,000 on condition that he not appear in court and give up his right to bring a civil case against the businessman.Mr Obara also offered 500,000 Australian dollars (£200,000) to the grieving relatives of the Australian Carita Ridgway, who died after allegedly being drugged and raped by him in 1992.This offer was also rejected, but Mr Obara is believed to have paid around £10,000 to at least one of his alleged rape victims.Defendants in Japan who admit their guilt can pay compensation to their victims or their grieving families as a way of expressing remorse. Judges then take the payments into consideration when passing sentence.But Mr Obara has not pleaded guilty to any of the charges against him and he denies any involvement in Ms Blackman 's death. Mr Blackman told judges that Mr Obara, who did not appear in court to hear the statement, should be given the maximum penalty of life imprisonment if found guilty.Speaking from Tokyo, he said: "The defendant did not appear in court, unfortunately. His defence team say that it was his view that the use of impact statements were being made to make him look like he was already guilty when he had not been proven guilty."But, he added: "It was quite a positive day for us to be able to have that input and have our say. I really welcomed the opportunity to verbalise how this has affected me and my family."Mr Blackman will stay in Japan to speak with prosecution counsel about the progress of the trial, which has already lasted about three and a half years.
