A man was convicted of grooming a 14-year-old girl, abducting her and having sex with her in a tent on a beach. The judge told him a jail sentence was inevitable.The girl disappeared from her home in Scotland and took a train to Hartlepool to be with Sean Clode, 21, who had befriended her while playing Xbox games online, Teesside crown court heard.She pretended to her parents she was going to school but met up with Clode and spent 20 hours in a tent pitched on dunes at Crimdon Dene.The court heard how her frantic father drove first to Edinburgh, then on to the north-east desperately searching for the teenager.In his statement read to the jury, he said: "As I got to Hartlepool it was first light and I spent an hour walking around the docks and a picnic area."After not much luck and beside myself with worry I attended Hartlepool police station." He charged his phone at the station and continued his search."During my frantic attempts to locate my daughter, I leafed through the local phone book, walked along sections of the coastline, knocked on doors and spoke to postmen."Finally, he got word a police helicopter had found her."I cannot express how much of a relief it was," he said. "I was becoming increasingly concerned I wouldn't see [her] alive again. No words can explain how traumatic and upsetting this whole experience has been for me and my family."Footage from the police helicopter showed Clode getting out of the tent and putting his trainers on, while the girl, who cannot be named, pulled her dress down.The next day the girl told police in a recorded interview that she had sex several times that night with Clode in the tent. But the following month she changed her story and said no sex had taken place.The prosecution claimed she altered her account out of "misplaced loyalty" or embarrassment.Clode, of Hartlepool, was found guilty of sexual grooming, child abduction and two counts of sexual activity with a child.The abduction charge related to Clode removing the girl from the lawful authority of her parents.He denied all the offences, denying sex had taken place and claiming the girl arrived in Hartlepool without his knowledge and that he was merely trying to keep her safe.Judge Howard Crownson told him that jail was inevitable when he is sentenced in a fortnight and remanded him in custody.
