A tape of the model Amy Leigh Barnes pleading for help in her dying moments was played to a hushed court during the trial for her murder today.Mr Justice MacDuff told jurors at Manchester crown court to "steel yourselves" before they listened to the 10-minute 999 call, and Barnes' family left the room.Barnes, 19, had been slashed across the face and stabbed nine times with a kitchen knife moments before the emergency call, allegedly by her boyfriend, Ricardo Morrison, 21, who denies murder.The tape begins with screams and Barnes telling the BT operator: "I've been stabbed." Gradually, her speech becomes slurred and she appears to lose consciousness. The phone line stayed open with the handset beside her body.Over the chatter of the phone operators sending police and ambulance services to the address, the teenager can be heard groaning and whimpering. Her breathing becomes laboured and the silence grows between sobs. The operator tries to keep her conscious by asking her name and reassuring her emergency services are on the way â€“ but there is no response.In the background, Barnes' mother, Karyn Killiner, can be heard leaving two messages on the house phone, both starting "Hiya love!" and asking her daughter to ring her urgently.Barnes's father, Andrew, who had been summoned to the house by her worried family, then arrives to find his daughter on the floor in a pool of blood. He tells the police call handler: "I need an ambulance. There's blood everywhere. Amy, are you OK?"She was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead two and a half hours later.Morrison's mother, 49-year-old police officer Melda Wilks, of Rubery, Birmingham, denies destroying evidence.
