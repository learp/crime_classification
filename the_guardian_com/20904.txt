Nottinghamshire police got a roasting this month after the murder of the jeweller Marian Bates in her family-run shop on the outskirts of Nottingham.Family members and the area's long-retired beat officer blamed a system which "keeps police in committees instead of on the street". They demanded more officers and more funding. John Clarke, chairman of the county's police authority, who has a reputation for calling for more police resources at every opportunity, said that there were rises in all three categories of crime spotlighted by the performance review - burglary, robbery and car crime - and a drop in detection and the successful punishment of offenders in the courts. Last year saw the arrival of 52 new constables through the government's crime-fighting fund, and 36 financed by rises in local council tax. The chief constable, Steve Green, found 88 officers he could spare at the headquarters and redeployed them to "frontline policing". But the effects did not work through in time for the Home Office monitors, apart from a 9% increase in the number of class-A drug dealers convicted. Other successful initiatives, such as child protection work with young prostitutes in Nottingham, are outside the review's parameters. The force has traditionally had to deal with high crime rates, including consistently violent crime in urban areas.
