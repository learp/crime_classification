A retired businessman, who was found guilty of shooting a drunken teenager who he had feared was a burglar, was given a suspended jail term yesterday.Anthony Spray, 64, of Broughton-in-Furness, Cumbria, told Preston crown court that Paul Evans, then 19, was about to attack him and his wife, Patricia, on the doorstep. Mr Evans, 20, of St Ives, Cambridgeshire, had to have his left eye removed after Spray shot him with a .22 air rifle last November 2. Judge Michael Byrne handed Spray a 12-month sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered him to pay £3,000 in compensation and costs up to £1,650. Spray was found guilty at Lancaster crown court last month of causing grievous bodily harm. The jury cleared him of causing GBH with intent. The court was told of a spate of burglaries in Broughton-in-Furness and how the Sprays had heard someone try to force their front door. Spray grabbed the air rifle he used to frighten rabbits off his vegetable patch, loaded it and went downstairs where he saw a silhouette of a man outside. The front door had already been forced open and Spray tried to reason with the man before the stranger "lunged" at him, the court was told. Mr Evans thought he was banging on the door of the pub where he was staying after his sister's birthday party. Judge Byrne said the combination of drink, Mr Evans' unfamiliarity with his surroundings and the darkness "produced a most unfortunate mistake".
