Armed officers arrested a 22-year-old man yesterday in connection with the murder of the student Marsha McDonnell, who was bludgeoned to death.The man was also being questioned about attacks on a girl of 17 and a man of 18. The arrested man, who has not been named, is from Hampton, in south-west London, where all three attacks took place. He was arrested outside New Malden railway station after a tip-off. Although the arrest was made after a televised reconstruction of McDonnell's last moments was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch UK programme on Wednesday, the police said that the tip-off was given independently to the investigating team before the programme went out. Detectives came to suspect that McDonnell's attacker was a serial assailant when the 18-year-old told them that a man had lunged at him after he got off a night bus in Hampton Hill, not far from where McDonnell was killed earlier this month. They were also investigating a link with the attack on the 17-year-old, who was left unconscious with head injuries. At first the police thought the girl might have slipped on ice, but a 6cm cut on her head was consistent with a blow. She was attacked on January 8 and the teenage boy on February 25. McDonnell, who was murdered in the early hours of February 4, was attacked from behind as she walked home from a bus stop. She had been to the cinema with friends. She was hit over the head three times and died the following day from multiple skull fractures and extensive internal bleeding. She had sat A levels in photography, psychology and communications at Richmond-upon-Thames College in Twickenham She intended to pursue a career in photography.
