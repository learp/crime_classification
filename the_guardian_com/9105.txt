The child protection committee responsible for the welfare of a 13-year-old boy jailed for life for the rape of his teacher today launched a formal review into his case.A formal review, overseen by an independent barrister specialising in child protection, will examine all aspects of the case and produce a report that will be made public later this year.Earlier today the boy, who was 12 at the time of the assault in November last year and has severe learning difficulties, was jailed for life for raping his special needs teacher and stealing her car. At Teesside crown court, Mr Justice Grigson ruled that the boy should serve at least 21 months of his sentence, but said he was likely to serve much longer.The court case revealed that the boy had been the victim of sexual and physical abuse from infancy. By the time he was three-and-a-half years old, concerns were raised about his sexualised behaviour and his GP had warned that he was under the influence of illicit substances.During the court case his defence lawyer John Evans said the boy had been "significantly let down" from an early age.Gateshead ACPC said a number of agencies in the region had worked intensively with the boy over the past few years."The ACPC has commissioned a review of this case and each organisation involved is now completing their contribution to it," said Simon Hart, chairman of the Gateshead area child protection committee. "This will help all organisations involved determine any improvements that could be made to their procedures."The Gateshead ACPC is a collection of agencies, including Gateshead council, Gateshead primary care trust, the National Probation Service and Northumbria police.Gateshead council has confirmed that it is cooperating fully with the review carried out by Gateshead ACPC.
