Britain's most senior police expert on sexual violence warned yesterday that more women could be raped as a result of the new licensing laws.Rapists would target young women who had been binge-drinking, said John Yates, the Association of Chief Police Officers' expert on sexual offences.Yates, the Metropolitan Police deputy assistant commissioner, said last night: 'Anything that involves more drinking of course involves the risk of increasing allegations of rape and sexual assault.'Drinking is a real issue. Forget Rohypnol [the date-rape drug], the biggest single factor in terms of drugs and rape is alcohol,' he said. 'Men, I suspect, think that they can get away with rape; that they have a one in 20 chance of being convicted. Rapists are clever. They have changed their behaviour, they are targeting nightclubs where young girls have been drinking.'Although judges have previously warned that pubs and clubs that stay open all hours may lead to a rise in rapes, this is the first time a senior police figure has expressed such concerns.His comments came as the minister responsible for rape prosecutions unveiled fresh moves to secure more convictions. Solicitor General Mike O'Brien announced that he was considering introducing expert witnesses to aid jurors in rape cases.He also admitted concern over the 'profoundly disturbing' frequency of alcohol in rape cases. It follows a survey last week showing that 30 per cent of the public believe that drunk women hold some responsibility for being raped.His comments follow last week's furore over the collapse of a rape case at Swansea Crown Court in which the victim admitted under cross-examination that she was unsure she had not consented to sex because she was too drunk to remember.Commenting publicly for the first time on the case, O'Brien stressed the verdict did not affect the principle that a 'woman, whether drunk or not, has the absolute right to say no.'Aside from alcohol, a principal concern to ministers and senior police officers remains the public's attitude to rape. Yates said that surveys suggesting significant numbers of the public believe a woman who gets drunk, flirts or dresses in short skirts has herself to blame if she is raped, pose grave dangers to jurors. Yates will write this week to Home Office minister Paul Goggins, urging the government to launch an educational programme aimed at challenging such 'outdated' views.It has also emerged that the solicitor-general is looking to increase convictions by copying the US system of introducing expert witnesses who can explain to jurors the trauma and behaviour of rape victims.The government, however, remains firmly opposed to lowering the standard of proof in rape cases, aware that although such a move would increase the number of convictions it would also heighten the risk in sending innocent people to jail.
