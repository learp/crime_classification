A City banker strangled his wife after he bugged her phone calls and discovered she was having an affair with their son's tennis coach, a jury heard today.Neil Ellerbeck, 46, feared his marriage would end and had started hiding more than £500,000 so it would be out of the reach of any divorce settlement.The HSBC executive was himself having an affair, but the Old Bailey heard that his jealous nature led him to bug more than 127 hours of his wife's phone calls, during which he learned she was having two affairs, planned to divorce him, and had told her lover her children would "love" him.Last November Kate Ellerbeck, 45, was found strangled at the couple's home in Enfield, north London.The court heard the couple appeared to have it all: wealth, a 13-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter, and a nice home. But below the surface the Ellerbecks were repeatedly cheating on each other.Ellerbeck, who was the chief investment manager at HSBC's headquarters in Canary Wharf, denies murder. He told police that he had been involved in a fight with his wife after reacting to an attack from her, the court heard.A postmortem showed the victim had suffered 45 marks to her body, including many to the head and face, some of which indicated asphyxia caused by a minimum of 20 to 30 seconds of "sustained pressure".Edward Brown QC, prosecuting, said: "The defendant acted out of very considerable anger which got the better of the man – at the moment when the build-up of his wife's behaviour became all too much for this obsessive and jealous man."Mrs Ellerbeck feared her husband was spying on her and, after a search of his office, police recovered a memory stick with more than 127 hours of tape recordings made from inside the family home.They included a conversation between his wife and the tennis coach, Patrick McAdam, "in which she described in detail how successful the physical side of their sexual relationship was, in her view", said Brown. The recordings showed Mrs Ellerbeck had sought advice about divorce and that, according to what she had told her friends, her husband had told her she must not leave "for the children's sake".In a phone conversation about her "possibly taking up with the caller", there was also a discussion of the children, said Brown. She described how she "can't imagine the kids won't love you".A search of Mr Ellerbeck's work office also showed other spy gadgets, Brown told the jury: "The police discovered that the defendant had too the ability to spy on his wife's emails and text messages - special gadgets manufactured for this purpose were found by the police in his office. "Mr Brown added: "On the face of it the Ellerbeck family had everything - a nice house and private education for the children, each of whom was clearly talented. The parents, however, were not happy together.."As time went by Kate Ellerbeck began looking for support from her friends. It was not only friendly support that she sought."Brown said Ellerbeck had never told his wife how much money he earned.He had been withdrawing £500 a day from his account over 13 months to deposit elsewhere – a total of £103,000. He also transferred more than £35,000 over 12 months into the account of a friend of his mistress, the court heard, and was said to have moved more than £430,000 from an account to one held by his sister.The case continues.
