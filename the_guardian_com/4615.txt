Andrew McKee was 32 when he killed himself in Preston prison. His brother, James, found him in the cell they shared. He would probably only have had another month to serve of his six-month sentence."He was a real family man. He had four kids, but it wasn't just them. It was aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews," said his sister, Valerie Little. Mr McKee, from Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire, was schizophrenic. Diagnosed when he was 17, he had been on regular medication all his adult life. But when he went into Preston jail he stopped taking it. "That was what we really wanted to get to the bottom of - why he just stopped taking his medication when he had been on it for nearly 16 years," said Mrs Little. Mr McKee had been in and out of prison for years. In November 2002, he received a six-month sentence for burglary. He killed himself on February 27 last year. He would probably have been released in March or April. "I think the prison service failed him," said Mrs Little. "He needed to be on his medication and not enough was done to persuade him to go back on it. Prison officers should be more aware of how to deal with prisoners with mental health issues." An inquest was held into Mr McKee's death; his family say it gave them comfort. Mrs Little said: "We knew he didn't do it to hurt us - it was just because he wasn't on his medication."
