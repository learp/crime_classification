Teenage boys who download images of child abuse from the internet should not always be prosecuted as sex offenders, according to experts on the sexual exploitation of children.Leading children's charities warned that prosecuting boys as young as 13 and putting them on the sex offenders register was counterproductive.They said the vast majority of boys arrested after internet trawling operations by the police had downloaded images of girls their own age after being coaxed by adult paedophiles into thinking child pornography was acceptable.The prosecution of minors in possession of child pornography has been brought to the limelight by the biggest ever police operation against suspected internet paedophiles in the UK.Twenty-seven people were arrested in Operation Magenta on Wednesday, including a 15-year-old boy from Cleveland and a 17-year-old from Hertfordshire.The charities' recommendation was branded "naive" by one of the lead detectives in the raids.Detective inspector Terry Jones, of Greater Manchester police's abusive images unit, said boys convicted for downloading child pornography usually had "a whole range of horrific images stored on their computers, including baby abuse".But the Children's Charities Coalition for Internet Safety (Chis), a taskforce set up last year following a series of high profile cases involving online paedophile rings, has called on the courts to distinguish between adults and children arrested on child pornography offences.In a submission to the sentencing advisory panel, the group of seven charities, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Barnardo's and Childline, said it was "regrettable" that young people were beginning to be arrested and charged with child pornography offences.John Carr, internet advisor to Chis, said it was "strange" that the law could not recognise there was a difference between an adult making or possessing sexual images of a 13 year-old-girl, and a 13-year-old-boy doing the same thing.He said: "Prosecuting a young teenage boy and putting them on the sex offenders' register is the blunt way of dealing with that behaviour. We believe counselling and support would be more appropriate."According to Greater Manchester police's abusive images unit, more than 10 boys have been arrested in internet child pornography investigations by vice squads across Britain. They include a 13-year-old boy from Teeside, who was placed on the sex offenders register last May after 326 images of child abuse were found on his computer after a previous police raid codenamed Operation Appal.The judge in the case said the boy had become "an unwitting victim of the pornography that is available on the internet".Mr Carr said the boy had presented none of the usual indications of becoming a sex offender. "He had no history of abuse and came from a warm, loving family. This poses the question, does the internet act as a catalyst for sexually inappropriate behaviour?"Rachel O'Connell, director of the cyberspace research unit at the University of Central Lancashire, said paedophiles established virtual communities on the internet to support one another, organise abuse and ensnare young people.Ms O'Connell, who has spent five years investigating internet paedophiles, said: "Young people can quickly become integrated into these communities, sometimes lured with images of girls their own age but then exposed to even more hardcore material."Det Insp Jones said it was "very rare" for young offenders to download so-called age specific images of abuse.He said: "At least six out of the 48 people we arrested as a result of Operation Appal last year were under 17. As far as I'm aware they had downloaded a whole range of material, not only of young teenage girls but also horrendous images of baby abuse."
