Jack Straw will face his first court challenge as lord chancellor next week when the Law Society, the Commission for Racial Equality and ethnic minority lawyers go to the high court to try to halt the government's controversial shake-up of legal aid.They argue that the changes, due to be phased in over the next two years, could force ethnic minority-owned law firms out of business and threaten access to justice for the communities they serve.The reforms, to a blueprint drawn up by government troubleshooter Lord Carter of Coles, aim to restrict the right to provide legal aid services to a smaller number of bigger firms. The government expects the model to be more efficient and produce savings for the public purse.But the judicial review application to be heard next week could force Mr Straw to put the reforms on hold while a full race impact assessment is carried out to find out if the changes discriminate against ethnic minority law firms and their clients.Legal aid lawyers vehemently oppose the reforms, which will initially replace hourly charges with fixed fees - producing, they say, at least a 10% reduction on already low pay rates - before moving to a system of price-competitive tendering by firms for the work.Their case has been boosted by an independent report by Otterburn Legal Consulting - commissioned by the Legal Services Commission (LSC), which administers legal aid - which warned of the "highly fragile" financial position of many legal aid defence firms and urged the commission to delay the fee cuts.The high court challenge, brought by the Black Solicitors' Network and the Society of Asian Lawyers, alleges that the government and the LSC failed to carry out an adequate racial impact assessment of the reforms as a whole. The two organisations are backed by the Commission for Racial Equality and the Law Society.A second case, mounted by the Law Society, argues that one part of the new legal aid package - the establishment of panels of lawyers to handle "very high cost cases", including drugs, terrorism and fraud cases in the crown courts - risks discriminating against ethnic minority firms, which tend to be smaller. That case was due to be heard next week as well but has now been put on hold pending the outcome of the first challenge.Sailesh Mehta of the Society of Asian Lawyers said: "In cities like London a staggeringly high percentage, something like 44%, of small firms that do criminal legal aid work are black and ethnic minority-controlled."Therefore the effect of getting rid of the smaller firms will be to get rid of the vast majority of black and ethnic minority-controlled firms doing criminal legal aid work. The very large firms are almost exclusively white Anglo-Saxon-controlled."Our concern is that if the smaller firms that tend to be dotted fairly widely apart and tend to be a support to and supported by black and ethnic minority communities go, then these communities' access to justice is affected."A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: "It would be inappropriate to comment at this time."
