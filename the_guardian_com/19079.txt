Three teenage girls collapsed in tears yesterday as they were convicted of killing a schoolgirl after a summer afternoon drinking spree when they were "bored and had nothing else to do".They were part of a gang that taunted and threatened 15-year-old Aimee Wellock and a group of her friends at a beauty spot in Bradford before egging one another on to punch and slap their victims.Claire Carey, 18, and two girls aged 17 and 15, who cannot be named because of their ages, were convicted of the manslaughter of Aimee, who was found at her postmortem to have had a severely diseased heart. The two-week trial heard that the condition may have led to her fatal collapse when she ran away to try to escape the gang in June.Her parents, who attended every day of the hearing in Leeds, held hands than hugged one another after the jury of nine women and three men returned their guilty verdict after deliberating for three hours. A 15-year-old boy was cleared of manslaughter and causing an affray, and left the court in tears.The girls, who were also found guilty of affray, wept uncontrollably after the verdicts, until the judge, Mr Justice Field, adjourned the court to allow them to compose themselves in a separate room. When they came back, he warned them: "All sentencing options are open to the court and there is inevitably a chance that I will decide that you should be sentenced to custody."He bailed them on condition that they obeyed a curfew keeping them at their homes in Bradford between 10.30pm and 7.30am. They will be sentenced next month after the judge has considered reports from the probation service and from other agencies.The court heard that Carey and her friends had bought 40 bottles of Stella Artois from an off-licence and taken them to Chellow Dene, a leafy valley in Bradford, where they drank for five hours. They then came across Aimee, a keen dancer who was described by neighbours in the Allerton area of Bradford as "a bright, lively girl," who was out enjoying the sunshine with five friends.Carey admitted that she had "felt fresh" after her drinking session, which had led to the group jeering and threatening the younger girls, sneering at them as "slags in short skirts". The group then trapped Aimee and her friends against a stone wall and Carey hit one of them, who was 14 at the time, in the face. Carey has previous convictions for assault and theft and the 15-year-old girl, who is having psychological treatment, has convictions for theft.
