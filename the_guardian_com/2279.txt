A bank robber who stole more a £115,000 broke into the same branch a week later to put most of the money back, it emerged last night.Police confirmed a large quantity of money was removed from the cash machine inside Barclays bank in Barkingside, Essex, at sometime overnight between May 21 and 22. But on May 28 staff discovered a bin bag filled with banknotes inside the premises, a Scotland Yard spokesman said. According to the Sun newspaper £104,000 was returned in a bag placed just inside the front door. Police believe the thief had a copy of the main front door key because there was no sign of forced entry following the first theft, although a window inside the bank had been smashed in order to gain access to the cash machine. The bin liner was discovered inside the bank a week later when a senior member of staff opened up the premises for the day. The incident is thought to be the first reverse bank theft in Britain. Last night a senior police source told the Sun: "It must have preyed on the thief's mind, but taking the trouble to break back in is bizarre." Leading criminal solicitor Robert Brown of lawyers Corker Binning said that returning the money might help the thief reduce his sentence if he is caught. All staff at the branch were interviewed by police "as a matter of course" and investigations were ongoing, police said. A Barclays bank spokesman said he could not confirm any details of the incident.
