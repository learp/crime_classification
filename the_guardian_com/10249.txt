Five men formerly charged with murdering Stephen Lawrence yesterday won a High Court battle allowing them to challenge their summons to the public inquiry into the police investigation of the racial killing.David Norris, 21, Neil Acourt, 22, his brother Jamie, 21, Luke Knight, 20, and Gary Dobson, 22, have at various times been accused of the murder of the black teenager. They were due to appear at the south London inquiry on Monday to answer detailed questions about their role in his death.The decision by Mr Justice Laws to allow a full judicial review of their objection to the questioning is a setback for the inquiry, but the obstacles surrounding their appearance were always expected to raise complex legal issues. Neil Acourt, Dobson and Knight were acquitted of the killing at the Old Bailey in 1996; the charges against Jamie Acourt and Norris never came to trial.Allowing their application for a full hearing next week, Mr Justice Laws ruled there was a case to be debated about whether the questions they face were relevant to the conduct of the police inquiry."It seems to me there is an arguable question here as to whether the guilt or innocence of these men goes to the issue which the tribunal should properly be considering," he said. The judicial review is likely to be heard at the Divisional Court on Wednesday.Charles Conway, counsel for the five, argued that if compelled to give evidence to the Lawrence inquiry they would in reality be facing an "unfair and unlawful" trial for murder."These questions are intended really to put all these suspects through a criminal trial in full view of the media." The questions it was proposed they should answer were "outside the remit of the terms of the inquiry", he claimed.The questions the men had been sent in advance included: "What are your views about ethnic minority groups?" and "Would you describe yourself as a racist?""Questions about who killed Stephen Lawrence and did the suspects kill him are totally irrelevant and outside the remit of the terms of the inquiry and outside the Police Act," Mr Conway asserted.The inquiry has been convened under the 1996 Police Act and is charged with inquiring into matters arising from the death of Stephen Lawrence in order to identify the lessons to be learned for the investigation and the prosecution of racially motivated crimes.Edmund Lawson QC, representing the inquiry, assured the judge that questions as to whether the five were guilty or innocent of anything to do with Stephen's murder were relevant to the inquiry."If it should transpire that some or all of the five are wholly innocent of any involvement whatsoever in the matter of Stephen Lawrence, then that goes some way towards the materiality of the alleged negligence of the police operation."Imran Khan, solicitor for the Lawrence family, said outside court: "Clearly Mr and Mrs Lawrence are disappointed at the delay that this hearing has caused and obviously it has been five years."They hope it will only be a short delay to the inquiry. It is quite clear from their point of view that these individuals will have to attend the Stephen Lawrence inquiry in due course."Michael Holmes, solicitor for one of the five, said he believed his client, Gary Dobson, would be "very pleased" by the decision. "He doesn't object to attending the inquiry. My fear on his behalf is that they were seeking to put him on trial for an offence which he has always denied and for which he has been cleared at the Old Bailey."Yesterday's decision means the five men will not appear at the Lawrence inquiry on Monday, a spokesman for the inquiry said. "The summons still stands, but the date has been varied until after the full judicial review hearing."
