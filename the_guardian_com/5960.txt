A father was tortured to death by the mother of his baby daughter, her ex-lover and her brother, a court heard yesterday. Andrew Gardner, 35, was repeatedly punched, kicked, stamped on and burnt in the weeks before his death in March last year, Teesside crown court was told. Clare Nicholls, 28, her brother Simon Nicholls, 24, and her former partner Steven Martin, 44, who went on trial yesterday, all deny murder. Gardner's lifeless body was found by paramedics in the living room of the house he shared with the three defendants in Chilton, County Durham. The trial continues today.
