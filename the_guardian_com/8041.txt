Detectives investigating the brutal murder of a man whose battered body was sealed in an oil drum and dumped in the River Clyde are investigating the possibility that it was a gangland killing.The unidentified remains were dredged up from the river on Thursday, close to Erskine Bridge on the outskirts of Glasgow, and is thought to have been in the water for up to 14 days. The partially decomposed corpse was found by workmen carrying out routine maintenance work to keep the navigational channels of the river open to boats.The man is believed to have been aged between 20 and 50, around 6ft tall, of stocky build and with very short hair. There was no identification with the body, which was dressed in a blue polo shirt with the words Yves Saint Laurent across the chest, except for two items of jewellery.The man had a gold-coloured ring on his left pinkie, with the word 'Dad' written on it, with stones embedded in the letters, and a large square-shaped ring, similar to a signet ring, with a square emblem, on his wedding finger.As officers began trying to match the description of the dead man to missing persons reports from Strathclyde and across Scotland, experts were examining tidal conditions in a bid to identify when and where the body was dumped in the river.Detective Chief Inspector Neil Thomson of Strathclyde police, said the man had been subjected to a 'brutal attack' prior to his death.
