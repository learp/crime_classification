A former police officer who left a dying man at a roadside while on duty has been jailed for a year.David Driver was on patrol in the village of Bourton-on-the-Water, in Gloucestershire, when he came across two men apparently asleep on the ground on a cold night last February.He left without waking the men and one of them, 25-year-old Steven Hathaway, was later pronounced dead at the scene. The other, who was woken after a member of the public found the pair, survived.Driver, a constable at the time, falsified his notes of the incident, claiming the men had not been unconscious when he found them.The 36-year-old admitted misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice.At an early hearing, Worcester crown court heard that Hathaway was believed to have fallen unconscious after drinking and taking drugs.Speaking outside court, Assistant Chief Constable Kevin Lambert, of Gloucestershire Constabulary, said: "The conduct of ex-PC Driver on the night in question fell well below the standards of professional behaviour we expect from our officers."I would like to express my sympathies to Mr Hathaway's family for their loss and apologise for the lack of action taken by ex-PC Driver when he first encountered Steven and his friend."He was immediately served with a discipline notice following this incident and was placed on restricted duties, which prevented him from having contact with the public."He was suspended from duty when first summonsed to appear at court then, when he pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice, he resigned."We have worked closely with the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) throughout their investigation and have also reviewed our own policies and procedures to ensure any lessons learned from this case are fed back to our staff to ensure such a situation does not arise again."The IPCC, which launched an investigation into Driver's conduct, said he submitted a false statement after Hathaway's death in which he claimed to have helped him to his feet and watched him walk away from the scene.Rebecca Marsh, the IPCC commissioner, said: "This police officer owed a duty of care to the public and failed to exercise it when he found two young men unconscious on a very cold night."He compounded this by repeatedly lying about the events of that night and offered a false account of his actions."It is clear from the post-mortem results that Mr Hathaway had consumed a large quantity of alcohol, together with opiates. However, he was owed a duty of care which Driver failed to exercise."
