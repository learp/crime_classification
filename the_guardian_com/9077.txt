We are following a number of lines of inquiry and have spoken with a number of people who were at the house on the night in question."However, I would still urge anybody who has any information which they believe could assist us with our investigation to come forward."The teenager, from Lytham, is in police custody and will face questions about the blaze, which swept through the house at 11.30pm on Saturday.Postmortem examinations confirmed the four victims, who were found in two attic bedrooms, had died from the effects of breathing in smoke.Their mother, 36-year-old Michelle Smith, was led from the building by firefighters. She was not seriously injured. Smith had been celebrating her birthday on Saturday and was hosting a party at the bungalow.Initial investigations by Lancashire fire service and Lancashire police suggested smoke alarms had not been working.On Monday, Smith, holding a photograph of her twin daughters, returned to the scene of the fire. She said: "I have lost the lights of my life. Where can I turn?"Smith, who has five surviving children, is thought to have moved into the bungalow last summer.
