Sir Alec Jeffreys (DNA database has to cover everyone, September 13) argues for a database that includes the entire population. DNA matching is probabilistic rather than positive.The evidence of coincidence between points of identification of the DNA of a suspect and that found at the crime scene indicates a match with a probability of one in so many millions. If the sample is to be compared with that of a large number of people, the risk of misleading matches rises. If the technique is to be used with a database of the whole population, one would expect mistakes. If everyone is included among potential suspects, perhaps we are all in need of permanent alibis.Prof Peter Taylor-GoobyUniversity of Kent
