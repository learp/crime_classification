Britain's record jail population has left a once "settled and stable" prison unfit for human habitation, infested with rats, mould and drug-dealing, according to a Prisons Inspectorate report.The plight of Wealstun in North Yorkshire, where overcrowded buildings have broken windows and there is a backlog of unfinished repairs, highlights the problems of a system under severe strain, says the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers. Staff shortages mean that officers are sometimes absent from the low-security category C section of the jail. Problems have worsened since serious disturbances at the jail last June. Drugs are so much part of Wealstun life, says Ms Owers, that some prisoners have stuck "No salesmen" signs on dormitory doors to deter dealers. All inmates have signed up to a drug-free regime, but the report dismisses this as "theoretical", with 95% of prisoners describing drugs as freely available. The report makes 135 recommendations for improvement. Ms Owers says: "Wealstun shows the effects of population pressure on a previously stable and settled prison. "That is a message that needs to be heard and understood at every level, as more and more prisoners, early in sentence, are decanted into low security and open prisons. But there can be no excuse, whatever the pressure, for holding prisoners in conditions which breach basic health and safety requirements." The director-general of the Prison Service, Phil Wheatley, said Wealstun had been through a difficult time and "much work needed to be done". The buildings most strongly condemned were due to be demolished, he said.
