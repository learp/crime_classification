A 16-year-old boy appeared in court today charged with the murder of a teenager who was stabbed to death in a school corridor. Luke Walmsley, 14, was knifed through the heart in an incident at Birkbeck school in North Somercotes, Lincolnshire, last November. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spoke only to confirm his name during a two-minute hearing at Skegness youth court. Wearing a pale blue Adidas jacket and red T-shirt, he remained expressionless as he sat in the dock flanked by two local authority workers. Edward Johnson, prosecuting, requested that the case be committed to the crown court for trial. The teenager was remanded back into local authority secure accommodation for a plea and directions hearing at Lincoln crown court on January 16.
