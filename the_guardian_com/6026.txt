A man arrested on suspicion of killing schoolboy Owen Wightman by dangerous driving has been released on police bail.Officers in West Yorkshire made the decision after questioning the 21-year-old from Huddersfield about the tragedy on Saturday which saw the six-year-old fatally injured by a driver who failed to stop.A man alone in a blue or grey hatchback then pulled into sidestreet near the scene in Wakefield, got out to check the front of the car for damage, and drove off.Details of a car thought to have been involved in the incident have come from CCTV and witness statements, after what detectives called a "good response" to appeals for information.Owen was crossing a busy main road near his home when he was struck by the car. He had been playing out with a seven-year-old friend. His parents Joanne, 33, and Neil, 31, who have two other sons aged 12 and one, described him as "a perfect little man who walked into a room and lit it up".Rewards for information leading to a conviction totalling Â£15,000 have been offered by the charity Crimestoppers and the Sun newspaper. West Yorkshire police said that the man had been released on bail pending further inquiries, while detectives continued the investigation into Owen's death.
