A human trafficking ring thought responsible for smuggling hundreds of Turkish people into Britain in the last few years was broken by police today.The illegal immigrants were brought in by air, road and sea through Germany, France and Belgium to provide cheap labour in London. Eight alleged members of the gang were arrested in raids in south-east England this morning.Further raids were launched by immigration police on the continent and they arrested more suspects. Five people were held in raids on nine addresses in Hamburg and Cologne in Germany. The crackdown forms part of Scotland Yard's ongoing effort - codenamed Operation Maxim - against human trafficking."Today's operation is a further example of our commitment to tackling organised immigration crime that has a devastating effect upon London's communities," said Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, the head of the Yard's specialist crime directorate."The arrests follow a 12-month intelligence-led operation, which has seen unprecedented co-operation between the Metropolitan Police, United Kingdom Immigration Service, our counterparts in Germany and with other European law enforcement agencies."Pan-European operations of this type can be very successful and we expect to be mounting more of these in the future."The eight suspects were arrested just after 6am during raids in Surrey, south-west and south-east London. Police are still searching businesses connected to the suspects."This operation is a real success for the Immigration Service in its joint work with the police. It sends a clear message that those seeking to abuse our immigration system will be caught and prosecuted," said immigration minister Des Browne."The UK welcomes all foreign nationals who come to the UK legitimately - as visitors, students or workers - with the intention of making a contribution. However, we will take tough action on people here illegally and those who make money by facilitating them."
