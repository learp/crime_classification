A 15-year-old boy died in hospital on Monday after becoming ill in the early hours of Sunday at an illegal rave in south London where clashes took place with police and where arrests were made for alleged violent disorder, drugs offences and money laundering.The teenager was taken by ambulance to hospital from the event at a disused sorting office in east Croydon, according to police. They believe they know his identity but are waiting for formal identification and confirmation that all next of kin have been informed.A 19-year-old remained in hospital in a stable condition after he also became ill at the event on Cherry Orchard Road, which was attended by about 1,000 people.At least six other people who were taken to hospital with injuries have been discharged, according to police, who arrested 14 people in connection with the event.Scotland Yard said that officers on routine patrol became aware on Saturday evening of large numbers of people inside, outside and heading towards the disused sorting office, where music was being played.At one point, the window of a police van was smashed and missiles thrown at officers. The area was cordoned off to stop "dangerously large numbers of people" from getting in, but some in the crowd became violent, Scotland Yard said at the weekend.The force said additional officers were called and cordons were put in place to prevent more people from gaining access to the building and the surrounding area.Two men have been charged with violent disorder and drugs offences while men aged 47 and 30 were given adult cautions for possession of class A drugs.Three men were arrested on suspicion of money laundering, a 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and a 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. All five have been bailed pending further enquiries.Police made five further arrests for handling stolen goods and criminal damage offences.
