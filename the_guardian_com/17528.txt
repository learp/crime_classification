A predatory paedophile who snatched a six-year-old girl from a bath before raping her was told today he may never be released from jail.Peter Voisey, 35, was jailed for life and will serve a minimum of 10 years in prison after he sneaked through the back door of the girl's family home and abducted her as she played with her toys in the bath, two days after Christmas last year.He drove her off in his Vauxhall Astra van, stopping twice to sexually assault her.He then dumped her in a lane near her home in north Tyneside where she was heard sobbing by neighbours.Voisey, of Blyth, Northumberland, had denied abduction and sexual offences but was convicted after a trial at Newcastle crown court.At the time, he was the subject of a multi-agency public protection arrangement after serving a two-year jail sentence for indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl at a swimming pool in 2001.Jailing Voisey today, Judge David Hodson told him: "You will only be released into the community when the parole board considers it safe for you to be released, it may be that you will never be released but that is a matter for others."I am in no doubt whatsoever that you are a dangerous predatory male who poses a serious risk."He added it was " a most grave offence of kidnapping" of a girl who should have been safe in her own home.The judge said: "It was the night after Boxing Day and the excitement of Christmas was over."The girl was playing with her toys in the bath at about 6.30pm."She was, anyone might think, as safe as she could be in her own bath, in her own house."No one would dream that she was in imminent peril of being kidnapped."You, however, were lurking in the vicinity on the lookout for the opportunity to burgle premises and, it seems to me, to commit sexual offences if the chance arose."Judge Hodson said it was impossible to know what the long-term effects on the girl would be.According to her mother's victim impact statement, she was worried about the approaching anniversary of the abduction."The shorter, darker and colder nights have reminded her of the ordeal," the judge said."She is wetting the bed; she is worried someone else might come to the house."She is awaiting counselling."Clearly there is a long road ahead for her."Detective Chief Inspector Jim Napier, who led the investigation, added that the offence could not have been prevented, even though Voisey was a known sex offender.He said: "He was a registered sex offender and that is about reducing risk not eliminating risk."We could not have prevented this particular offence."
