The designer Nicole Farhi was choked until she passed out and threatened with a knife in a doorstep robbery, a court heard today.Farhi was attacked from behind in the driveway of her home in Hampstead, north-west London, in April last year.It is claimed that Daniel Mykoo forced his arm around her throat and his brother Matthew wielded a knife during the attack.Farhi lost consciousness for a few minutes as the pair took a ring and her Rolex watch, John Carmichael, prosecuting, told Wood Green crown court.She pleaded to keep the watch, which had sentimental value, but the pair refused, he said. They also stole cash, the jury heard.Farhi's husband, the playwright Sir David Hare, gave chase as the robbers fled, and took down the registration number of the car they used.The court has heard that the brothers acted as a "strangler-robber" team, targeting 17 women and one man. The pair struck in areas including Hampstead, St John's Wood, Ladbroke Grove and Chelsea between March and June last year, Carmichael said.Daniel Mykoo has admitted 18 counts of robbery. His 27-year-old brother, of Brent, north London, denies the same charges and one count of taking a car without permission.The trial continues.
