Two retired Church of England priests have been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing young men and children.A 73-year-old man was arrested at his home near Eastbourne, East Sussex, on suspicion of sexual assaults committed against nine young people in Crawley, West Sussex, Barkingside, north-east London, and Middle Wallop, Hampshire, between 1965 and 1972.A 70-year-old man was also arrested at his home in Eastbourne on suspicion of sexual assaults against three young men in West Sussex during the late 1970s and mid-1980s.The men, named by sources as Canon Gordon Rideout and former parish priest Robert Coles, were arrested following a six-month investigation by a team of specialist Sussex police child protection detectives.Sussex police decided to re-examine several of the historic allegations referred to in a confidential report by Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss last year.The force and the diocese of Chichester provided detailed information to the report of some historic allegations of sexual abuse by Church of England priests against young people in Sussex and elsewhere.Several of those allegations had previously been reported to police but there had been insufficient evidence to justify prosecution at the time, a police spokesman said.The allegations against Rideout go back to a period between 40 and 45 years ago, police said.Several were made to police in 1972 but did not result in criminal proceedings. Another allegation was made to police in 2001 and an arrest was made, but there was insufficient evidence to justify criminal proceedings.One of the allegations against Coles was investigated by police in 1997 and an arrest was made, but there was insufficient evidence to bring any charges.The other allegations have only just emerged as a result of the current inquiry, a police spokesman added.Detective Chief Inspector Carwyn Hughes said: "Although they have been arrested on the same day, the cases against the two men are being treated as separate inquiries at this stage."The offences were allegedly committed at different times and in different places from each other. "The re-investigation of these cases has taken six months. This is a very complex inquiry, in the course of which many people, all now adults, have had to be traced, together with other witnesses and records from a wide variety of sources."There are no allegations of recent or current offending and police emphasise that there is nothing to suggest that any children are currently at risk."The diocese of Chichester is co-operating fully with police."Although the cases referred to are still under police investigation, Sussex police make it clear that the force will always take seriously any allegations of historic sexual offending, and every possible step will be taken to investigate whenever appropriate."The diocese of Chichester said in a statement it was aware of the arrests and had been co-operating fully with the police and other statutory agencies throughout the investigation.The acting bishop of Chichester, Mark Sowerby, said: "We are absolutely committed to making sure that our churches are safe communities for children and vulnerable adults, and to giving the highest priority to statutory safeguarding practice and Church of England policies on safeguarding."We owe this to those who have suffered abuse and most especially to those who have suffered abuse at the hands of people exercising a ministry in the name of the church."We are resolved to do whatever is necessary to prevent the abuse of children and vulnerable adults, and to ensure that no one fails victims of abuse by failing to report information or knowledge of wrongdoing to the police."We are unable to comment further while the investigation continues except to make it clear that the priests who have been arrested do not hold licensed posts."A special helpline, staffed by NSPCC workers, has been set up for anyone who feels they need support or advice.Calls will be handled sensitively and confidentially, and where appropriate callers will be referred to specially trained police officers and counselling services. The helpline number is 0800 389 5344.
