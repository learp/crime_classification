Police yesterday arrested 12 eastern Europeans suspected of duping British bank account holders out of hundreds of thousands of pounds. The six men and six women from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and Ukraine are alleged to have tricked dozens of people into revealing their online account details in a scam known as "phishing". Officers raided addresses in London and Kent, seizing computers, passports, cheque books, bank cards, money and crack cocaine. The FBI and US secret service were involved in catching the alleged fraudsters, thought to have been obtaining and laundering funds for Russian organised crime syndicates. The top criminals behind "phishing" scams use Britain-based intermediaries to transfer money out of victims' accounts. The intermediaries open up bank accounts to lodge the stolen money and then send it abroad, typically charging around 7% commission.
