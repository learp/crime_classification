The education secretary, Estelle Morris, will today unveil a 6ft-high permanent memorial to murdered youngster Damilola Taylor.The sculpture, in the form of a phoenix and chosen because it symbolises hope rising out of tragedy, is sited in the grounds of Oliver Goldsmith primary school in Peckham, south London, where 10-year-old Damilola was a pupil.Damilola died on November 27 2000, after being stabbed in the leg on the nearby North Peckham Estate.The school garden in which the memorial stands marks the spot where, in the weeks after his death, a wall of floral tributes and toys were placed.School governors selected the metal sculpture by Alexandra Brooke, a student at Camberwell College of Arts in south London, who collaborated with children at the school.Bola Ogun, head of governors at Oliver Goldsmith, said: "This is a poignant time to remember that the search for answers as to what happened goes on, and those responsible for his death remain at large. "As we again show today, Damilola's school and community will never forget this special child or the tragic manner of his passing."Headteacher Mark Parsons said the school would hold a memorial every year on Damilola's birthday despite the fact that his classmates all left the school last year."Some children who remember him are still here but in two years time there will be hardly any," he said. "It's very important what the memorial stands for - a lot of our kids come over from other countries full of hope, I have got any number of children like Damilola."To end up being killed in an alley, it's something that must never happen again."We must keep going on at children to get information about anything that is happening to them because we didn't know with Damilola. Had we known it all might have been very different."The memorial designer, Alexandra Brooke said: "I'm thrilled to have played a part in creating this tribute to Damilola and having the opportunity to contribute something positive to the community in which I live and work."As a student in the area at the time of Damilola's death I'm pleased to have been given this chance to help restore hope and regeneration."Four teenagers were cleared of murdering Damilola at the Old Bailey earlier this year.
