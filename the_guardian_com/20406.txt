He was taking his girlfriend to a bus stop when the attack began.Hundreds of people attended a vigil in Liverpool city centre yesterday to support the Walker family and protest against racism.The scene of Anthony's death, at the entrance to McGoldrick Park, has attracted scores of tributes, including a message from Doreen Lawrence, the mother of murdered black London teenager Stephen Lawrence.
