The Independent on Sunday has defended Rupert Murdoch in an editorial pointing out that his newspapers "were not the only companies using hackers, blaggers and thieves." The Sindy argues that Murdoch's organisation, News International (now News UK), paid a high price for "reprehensible and illegal intrusions into people's private lives."But it believes the authorities are guilty of a double standard because the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) discovered that similar illegal techniques were used by law firms, insurance companies and telecoms businesses. The Sindy says:"While the press was subjected to a public inquiry, headed by Lord Justice Leveson, and to a belated full-scale police investigation, Soca refuses to identify these other alleged customers of hackers, blaggers and thieves."It calls the arguments advanced by Soca's chairman, Sir Ian Andrews, for failure to disclose the information "unconvincing" and his citing of the human rights act as a reason "frankly ludicrous." It continues:"Of course, it would be damaging to the companies concerned for it to be known that they are being or have been investigated, but if they have not been 'associated with criminality', then let them account for themselves.The privilege of a shroud of secrecy over police investigations to protect the share price has not been extended to newspapers, whether owned by Mr Murdoch or not, as the arrests, investigations and court cases in the hacking scandal proceed."The Sindy calls on Andrews to reconsider his decision or face the possibility that "parliament might well reconsider it for him."The National Union of Journalists has also attacked Soca for refusing to reveal the names of companies involved in illegal practices. Its general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: "Media corporations have sacrificed their journalists as an act of corporate damage limitationâ€¦ It is outrageous that commercial companies are being given special treatment in this way." It is thought that Sir Brian Leveson will face questions over why he decided to ignore Soca's report on hacking by non-Murdoch organisations when he appears before MPs on the media, culture and sport select committee.
