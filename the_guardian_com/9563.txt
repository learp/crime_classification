The parents of alleged "honour killing" victim Shafilea Ahmed appeared in court on Monday and pleaded not guilty to murdering their daughter. Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, and Farzana Ahmed, 49, of Warrington, appeared at Manchester crown court. They were charged in September with murdering the 17-year-old, whose decomposed remains were discovered in Cumbria in February 2004. She had disappeared from the family home five months earlier. During the hour-long hearing the couple sat with an interpreter. The court set a provisional trial date for 8 May at Chester crown court. At a bail hearing at Manchester crown court on 15 September, Mr Justice Richard Henriques ruled the press could report that the couple were charged after "a family member" accused them of murdering Shafilea. The couple are on bail with a number of conditions.
