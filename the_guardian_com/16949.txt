Harold Shipman was yesterday accused of "browbeating" and "bludgeoning" relatives of his alleged victims to persuade them against demanding postmortems.Shipman was questioned at Preston crown court about what was described as his "uncaring and insensitive" attitude towards the grieving family of Winifred Mellor, 73, when he went to her home a few hours after her body was found. The GP claimed Mrs Mellor visited his surgery complaining of chest pains less than two hours before her body was discovered on May 11 last year. But neighbours said they had seen the doctor enter Mrs Mellor's home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, an hour earlier. Shipman went to the house to meet the family and their priest, Father Denis Maher, that evening. The prosecuting counsel, Richard Henriques QC, told Shipman: "Your sole purpose was to make sure there was no postmortem examination." Shipman denied the claims of four members of Mrs Mellor's family and Father Maher that he had made no mention of the possibility of a postmortem. He said: "The family were completely stressed and in a state of shock." Shipman also denied evidence from Father Maher that he had told him that Mrs Mellor had telephoned his surgery earlier that day. Shipman, 53, of Mottram, near Hyde, denies the murders of 15 women patients with morphine injections. He also pleads not guilty to forging the Â£386,000 will of one of them. The trial continues.
