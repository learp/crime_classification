A police officer stabbed to death in a main shopping street in Luton this morning was wearing a stab-resistant vest at the time, Bedfordshire police said.Constable Jonathan Henry, a 36-year-old married father of one, died in hospital shortly after being stabbed when he tried to tackle a man with a knife who was eventually subdued by officers using baton rounds and a Taser stun gun.Two other people were injured in the incident, one seriously. A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.PC Henry leaves behind his wife, Mary, and baby daughter, Maggie.He had been with the police for three years, the force's chief constable, Gillian Parker, told a press conference."He loved his job and was a dedicated member of the police service," she said.He was among officers who responded to an emergency call shortly after 7.15am after a man was stabbed in George Street, in the town centre, said Chief Superintendent Nicky Dahl, the divisional commander for Luton."A number of police officers attended and they attempted to detain the suspect," he said. "During this time Jon received his injuries."PC Henry was wearing a stab-resistant vest at the time, said Ch Supt Dahl, adding that it was "too early to say" how he could have received the fatal injuries despite being protected.According to earlier reports from witnesses, a man in his 50s, believed to be a window cleaner, was stabbed by another man, after which police were called.A man is being treated for wounds to his back at Luton and Dunstable hospital and is in a serious condition. Another member of the public received a minor stab wound, police said.Detective Superintendent Keith Garwood, who is leading the investigation into the incident, said a number of people had witnessed the attack and appealed for them to come forward.He refused to give any more information about PC Henry's injuries or how he was stabbed despite wearing the vest.The entire incident took around 15 minutes, added Det Supt Garwood.It was the first such fatality in the Bedfordshire force's history, Mrs Parker said."I think it's fair to say that we're absolutely devastated," she said. It's the first time we've lost an officer in such circumstances."The last police officer to be stabbed to death on duty in the UK was Detective Constable Michael Swindells, of Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire. He died after being stabbed in the heart by a person with paranoid schizophrenia on a canal towpath in the Nechells area of Birmingham in May 2004.Figures published last year showed that the number of people convicted of carrying a knife or blade in a public place had reached record levels. Home Office statistics showed 5,784 people were found guilty of the crime in English and Welsh courts in 2004, compared with just 3,511 in 2000, an increase of 65%. The Home Office has said knife-related crime - around 6% of all violent crime - has remained relatively stable over recent years. A knife amnesty last year resulted in more than 100,000 knives being handed in to police forces in England, Scotland and Wales, and was hailed as a success by ministers.
