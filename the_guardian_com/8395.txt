Police who bungled a murder investigation by failing to take prompt notes of a statement by the killer have been cleared of misconduct by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.Det Insp Anthony Webster, who led the hunt for the murderer of Nottingham jeweller Marian Bates in September 2003, broke down in court for "letting down" the victim's family and apologised to prosecuting counsel.The admission by Peter Williams, 19, which named others involved, was ruled inadmissible, but he was subsequently convicted at Stafford crown court in March last year.
