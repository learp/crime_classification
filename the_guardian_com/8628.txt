It is a case that has transfixed and appalled the wine industry in equal measure, involving a once-in-a-lifetime discovery in a dusty Paris cellar, the American president Thomas Jefferson, a colourful German dealer, one of the world's top wine experts – and the most expensive bottle of wine ever sold.It is 24 years since a bottle of 1787 Lafite sold at Christie's in London for the still record sum of £105,000, its enormous value explained by the etched initials "Th.J" on its side, which suggested, it was claimed, that it had been the property of the man who became America's third president.A quarter of a century later, however, many experts believe that bottle, and others claimed to be from the same batch, are fake – leaving the billionaire collectors who bought them, and the eminent oenophiles who testified to their authenticity, red-faced.This week, the man who authenticated the Lafite and presided over its auction won an apology and damages from the publisher Random House over a bestselling book, which, he argued, had suggested he had sold the wine knowing its provenance to be suspect. Michael Broadbent has retired as the senior director of Christie's wine department but remains, according to Adam Lechmere, editor of decanter.com, "among the top three most respected wine critics in the world".Broadbent described the ruling as a "great relief", adding that he planned to celebrate with a magnum of Mouton 1990 over dinner at his club.The settlement relates to a book called The Billionaire's Vinegar by American journalist Benjamin Wallace, which outlines the now notorious case of "the Jefferson bottles" – and which Random House, according to Broadbent's lawyer, Sarah Webb, must now remove from bookshop shelves in Britain.A German wine dealer called Hardy Rodenstock said he bought the bottles from someone who claimed they had been found in a bricked-up cellar in Paris in 1985, though he has never given more details about its location.Broadbent, according to Lechmere, had the Lafite tested by Christie's glass and etchings experts, before pronouncing that the circumstantial evidence suggested it was genuine. "There is no question whatsoever that he would ever act in bad faith," said Lechmere. "He did everything he could to verify them."In 2005, Bill Koch, a US billionaire who bought other bottles from the batch, became suspicious about their provenance. He has launched successive legal actions against Rodenstock in the US for alleged fraud, which continue.Though many experts also believe the wines are unlikely to be genuine, nothing has been conclusively proven. Broadbent, notably, stands by his original assessment. He had been forced to take action, Webb said yesterday, because the book suggested he had acted "at best unprofessionally, at worst dishonestly". In response, however, Wallace told the Guardian: "I have never felt that Mr Broadbent acted in bad faith, and contrary to his claims, I maintain that The Billionaire's Vinegar does not suggest that he did."Jasper Morris, burgundy director at the London merchants Berry Bros & Rudd, said yesterday that while the number of faked wines circulating had grown, the market had become much more sophisticated since the 1980s. "These days we would have doubts about the provenance of this kind of find from the very beginning," he said.He, too, had no doubts of Broadbent's integrity, but said: "I am pleased the book was written because where there is a possibility of fraudulent bottles, it is something that should be exposed."This week's settlement may close one chapter of the saga, but, says Lechmere, "as for the wider story of the Jefferson bottles, we are not nearly at the end. Nothing has been proven conclusively. "Most pressing for Broadbent may be a film version of The Billionaire's Vinegar, reportedly under development by a conglomerate of Hollywood producers including the actor Will Smith.
