A convicted sex offender was found hanged in his cell this week, the Home Office said yesterday, fuelling criticism over the soaring number of suicides in custody.The apparent suicide of Stanley Murphy, 64, takes the number of deaths in custody since the start of June to eight. Murphy, from Torquay, was discovered by staff at Dorchester prison on Tuesday. The chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, has voiced her concerns, linking the issue of suicide to problems of overcrowding and mental illness in Britain's jails. Ms Owers said on BBC that self-inflicted deaths were occurring in institutions "at the sharp end of the problem we have of prison overcrowding". She added: "Some while ago, we closed our big mental hospitals on the premise that people would get care in the community. They don't. They tend to end up in our prisons."
