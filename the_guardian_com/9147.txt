Scotland Yard today claimed to have disrupted one of the biggest gangs smuggling illegal immigrants into Britain.Officers raided on 12 addresses across London and one in the Midlands targeting the gang and its two suspected leaders.Police said they had tracked the gang for over a year as they smuggled into the UK people whose journey began in the Chinese province of Fujian.The gang ran the European leg of the route, bringing people secreted in lorries from France to the UK.Scotland Yard sources say the gang are among the "Premier League" of smuggling gangs and are also involved in heroin imports and money laundering.The illegal immigrants would pay up to £20,000 to be smuggled to Britain, police say, the trip taking up to 18 months, with people being placed in safe houses waiting the next leg.The gang were mainly Turkish, working with "snakehead" smugglers based in China and receiving £5,000 for each person smuggled into Britain.Police this morning made 13 arrests across north and south London, and one in Kidderminster. Twelve people were arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration into the UK, and one person is accused of having a false passport.In Peckham, south London, police found 23 alleged illegal Chinese immigrants living in cramped conditions.Officers are unclear where many of the illegal immigrants end up, but it believed some are employed illegally in restaurants and other businesses in London's Chinatown.Police say some families and communities in Fujian club to together to pay the smugglers to take one of them into Britain, believing the money that person makes will be sent home.Operation Greensea began over a year ago and involved authorities in Belgium and France, who have carried out their own raids in recent months.Detective Superintendent Steve Richardson of the Metropolitan police's Special Intelligence Section said: "We have today dismantled two organised criminal networks involved in what is suspected to be large-scale human smuggling into the UK."We are committed to taking out these networks and this operation is the latest in our collaboration with a growing number of law enforcement agencies in Europe and the UK to work robustly to achieve this mission."The Border and Immigration Agency's regional director, Tony Smith, said: "Anyone found to be in the UK illegally should know that we will take steps to deport them."Our border with France is one of the toughest in the world. Last year we searched over 1m lorries, stopped a record 18,000 people crossing the channel illegally and removed record numbers of illegal immigrants from the UK."He said as many as 13,000 people were caught hiding in lorries at major ports, particularly Calais.
