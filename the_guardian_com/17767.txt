The former Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins, who was handed a 35-year sentence for a string of child sex offences, has lodged an application for permission to appeal.The move by the disgraced rock star, whose sentence is made up of a custodial term of 29 years and a further six years on licence, was confirmed by the Judicial Office on Thursday. Watkins, 36, was sentenced at Cardiff crown court last month.He confessed to 13 offences and was described as a committed and determined paedophile. His two accomplices, Woman A and Woman B, were jailed for 14 years and 16 years respectively.After sexually touching a groupie's 11-month-old baby, Watkins tried to have penetrative sex with the child. He also encouraged a second fan to abuse her child during a webcam chat and secretly stashed videos of child abuse, some of which he had made himself.The trial judge, Mr Justice Royce, told Watkins: "Those who have appeared in these courts over many years see a large number of horrific cases. This case, however, breaks new ground. I am satisfied that you are a deeply corrupting influence, you are highly manipulative, you are a sexual predator, you are dangerous. The public and, in particular, young females need protection from you."Watkins was told that he would have to serve two-thirds of the custodial term before he could be considered for release by the parole board.
