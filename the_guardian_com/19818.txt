A man was found guilty today of murdering two sisters whose bodies were found last year at their flat in central Birmingham.Mohammed Ali was convicted by a jury at Birmingham crown court of the murders of Yasmine and Sabrina Larbi-Cherif.The court heard that Ali had been in a relationship with Yasmine, 22, before killing her and Sabrina, 19.Prosecutor David Crigman QC said Ali stabbed both women in the living room of their flat before dragging their bodies into a bedroom, leaving a "swath" of blood on the floor.Jurors, who watched CCTV film of Ali leaving the Jupiter apartments in Ryland Street, near Broad Street, after the killings with a bag believed to contain blood-stained sheets, heard that he twice walked from the living room of the flat to the kitchen to rearm himself after breaking two of the knives he used.The prosecutor said: "He had left behind a scene of carnage. He had used violence of the most brutal and depraved kind and he had killed two young girls."The jury was told that the partially-clothed bodies of the Algerian-born sisters were found last September at their fourth-floor flat .Ali was arrested in Dover, Kent, two days after being seen leaving the flat."In this case it's likely that there will be overlapping motives – anger, control, base male brutality and a significant sexual dimension," Crigman said at the start of the trial.The court heard the attack on Sabrina had a sadistic element. Thirty-two of the wounds she suffered were inflicted with apparent precision rather than in anger.During Ali's evidence, he tried to undermine forensic evidence of a sexual dimension to the killings by claiming to have had consensual sex with Yasmine shortly before being provoked into killing her.He had denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter at a hearing in March, claiming he was provoked into doing what he did during a loss of self-control.But Crigman told the jury: "It's not a case of him being provoked – it will be a case of him not getting something he wanted or something not going his way … or losing control of the relationship, as he probably was at this time."This man knew exactly what he was doing – so in control was he that, in the course of these attacks on these two girls, he broke off to rearm himself.Yasmine and Sabrina moved from Algeria to the UK with their parents and three brothers in 1998. The family settled in Wembley, north-west London.Yasmine, a salsa dancer, moved to the West Midlands to study chemistry at the University of Birmingham. After failing her exams she left and became a French and Arabic translator and later a sales administrator.Sabrina moved to live with her sister not long before she was killed. She was due to study French at the same university as her sister.The court heard that Yasmine met Ali in 2006 and became pregnant by him twice, resulting in two terminations.Crigman said their relationship had been "foundering" before the killings.Ali, who was not in court, will be sentenced at a later date.The family of the sisters expressed relief that their "barbaric" killer was found guilty of murder.In a statement, the victims' parents and three brothers, one of whom is Yasmine's twin, said they would always be proud of them. Their statement, read to the media by police family liaison officer Andy Pates, said: "This verdict will not bring back our angels but it will ensure that this barbaric killer will be placed behind bars for a very long time, and that he will never get the chance to inflict any such suffering on any other family."
