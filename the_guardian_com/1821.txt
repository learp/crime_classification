A police investigation has been launched following apparent racist attacks on Muslim students in London in which three people were stabbed.In the worst incident, last Thursday evening, a mob of 30 white and black youths is said to have surrounded Asian students near City University in central London and attacked them with metal poles, bricks and sticks while shouting racist abuse. Three people ‑ two students and a passerby who tried to intervene ‑ were stabbed.The attack was the culmination of a series of confrontations over several nights near the university. Earlier in the week a group shouted abuse at a Muslim student going to a prayer room at the university and then attacked him and other students escorting him to the tube. In that incident one student suffered a fractured skull.The Federation of Student Islamic Societies claimed that the gang of youths shouted: "Get those Muslims," and "Pakis." It called on the university to provide assurances for students' safety and welfare but described the incidents as isolated.Qasim Rafiq, Fosis's spokesman, said: "We believe these attacks involved the same group but there have been sporadic attacks at other universities over the last year. We are in consultation with the police and university authorities and want reassurance that the measures they are putting in place to protect students are permanent, not just temporary."The Metropolitan police said that patrols were being placed in the area and searches were being conducted. Detective Inspector Trevor Borley, of the Islington police community safety unit, said: "We are taking this matter very seriously."Three teenagers, aged between 17 and 19, have been arrested.In a statement, City University authorities said they were shocked and saddened by the attacks and had increased security patrols of the campus and at prayer meetings. Prof Julius Weinberg, the acting vice-chancellor, has written to all students advising them to be extra vigilant.
