The focus on alleged VIP and celebrity sex abuse scandals is putting victims at risk, according to the man who led a review into how the Home Office investigated claims of a Westminster paedophile network.Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, warns that the current focus risks returning the UK to the “dark days” of the 80s, when children abused by people from “ordinary” backgrounds had little confidence that their voices would be heard.High-profile allegations of sex abuse involving celebrities first emerged three years ago following the death of Jimmy Savile. The jailing of Rolf Harris, Max Clifford and Stuart Hall continued the focus on famous perpetrators. These were followed by lurid allegations against a handful of powerful politicians and officials, including former Tory home secretary Lord Brittan, and former prime minister Edward Heath.But, in a sign that children’s charities are becoming concerned about the impact the investigations into the allegations are having on wider society, Wanless suggests they could “distract from the reality” and undermine the “significant shift in confidence and understanding of child sexual abuse” that has occurred in recent years.Why a deserved downfall beckons for Tom Watson | Nick Cohen “For too long victims remained quiet, fearful of the consequences of speaking up, lacking the belief that anything positive would come of it if they did,” Wanless writes in an article carried on the Observer website. “Now they can be a little more confident that not only will they be heard but that also no one is above the law.”The danger now, Wanless believes, is that while “high-profile cases have helped keep child abuse under a spotlight and at the forefront of people’s minds … we must not allow it to distract from the reality that VIP child abuse is not typical.”Around 90% of sex offences against children are committed by someone they know, often a member of their family or a family friend. “The vast majority of these offenders are from what you might term ‘ordinary’ backgrounds,” Wanless says. “Their horrendous crimes might make them notorious, if uncovered, but celebrities they certainly aren’t. If we look at just a handful of recent court cases we can see that the offenders come from all walks of life.”He cited recent cases including that of a retired college principal who was convicted of dozens of offences against young boys; a former town planning officer who attempted to rape a 13-year-old girl; a middle-aged couple found guilty of inciting their own children to perform sex acts before taking pictures of them; and a publican and a shopkeeper who were part of a paedophile ring.Another involved seven men who conspired to abuse very young children including a baby. The perpetrators numbered an IT contractor, a businessman, a hospital worker, and a football coach and father of two – “people you could encounter on the street or at the school gates without having an inkling of their sordid background”, says Wanless, who last year completed a report for the home secretary, Theresa May, into concerns that the Home Office failed to act on paedophile allegations against several high-profile individuals.“While the media focus is, understandably, trained on particularly high-profile allegations, we have to ensure nothing is done to reverse the progress we have made and slide back to the dark days of the 1980s where child abuse existed in the shadows,” he writes. “There is a very real danger that children could be put at risk if we concentrate solely on celebrity offenders.”Figures obtained by the NSPCC show that the number of sex offences against children reported to the 43 police forces in England and Wales last year has increased by more than a third. More than 31,000 crimes – 85 a day – including rape, sexual assault and grooming were recorded.While the majority of victims were aged 12-16, nearly 3,000 cases involved children aged five and under.“If they fall silent it could well send us back to those terrible times when child sexual abuse was something few people dared even whisper, let alone tried to tackle.”
