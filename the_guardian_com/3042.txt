A Â£60m emergency package of 700 extra prison places to be put in place from next April to ease the overcrowding crisis has been agreed with the Treasury, the home secretary, David Blunkett revealed yesterday.But while the cash will provide extra cells in the medium term, it also became clear yesterday that the chancellor, Gordon Brown, has not sanctioned any short-term relief in the face of a record prison population of 72,379, and rising by over 250 a week. The home secretary also confirmed the Treasury is unwilling to come up with an immediate cash injection until Mr Brown and Mr Blunkett agree a new strategy for dealing with the jail crisis. Existing plans announced a year ago mean that an extra 2,300 places, mainly in ready-to-use units, will be put in place this financial year, but that will still leave 6,000 inmates living in overcrowded conditions. The confirmation of extra money comes as the chief inspector of prisons reports that one of the system's most notorious young offender institutions, Feltham in west London, has fundamentally changed and should be taken off the critical list. Anne Owers says that her inspection in January found that it was "an establishment whose culture, regime and vision were fundamentally different. Feltham can be considered a healthy establishment." The director-general of the prison service, Martin Narey, said the chief inspector's report was encouraging and that "the Feltham of old, has been replaced by an establishment we can be proud of".The following apology was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Monday October 21, 2002In the article above, quoted remarks by the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, were truncated in the editing, partially changing her meaning. She did not say "Feltham can be considered a healthy establishment". She said: "...there remains much to do before Feltham can be considered a fully healthy establishment". Apologies.
