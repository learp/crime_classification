A man believed to be the first British criminal caught using a new text message service alerting the public to criminal activity was jailed today.Church burglar Christopher Coulthard was arrested in February after Suffolk police sent 6,000 text messages about his crimes to people who had signed up to the alerts system.Coulthard had broken into more than 500 places of worship across the country.Seconds after the appeal was issued, a builder who had signed up to the service told police the 43-year-old was near a church in Santon Downham. Officers arrived on the scene and arrested Coulthard, who was today sentenced to five years in prison at Ipswich crown court.Coulthard, of no fixed address, admitted three church burglaries and one theft from a church, and asked for 76 other church-related offences to be taken into consideration at an earlier hearing. The charges involved St Mary the Virgin church in Santon Downham, Suffolk, the Roman Catholic church in Weeting, Norfolk, St Michael's Church in Brimfield, Shropshire and Holy Trinity church in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. Coulthard was convicted of burgling churches in 2003, and used lock picks and surgical scissors hidden in an empty camera case he used to disguise himself as a tourist. The text message appeal was made using Police Direct, a system developed by the Police Information Technology Organisation after the July 7 London bombings to spread information rapidly. The technology allows 200,000 voice, text or email messages to be sent in an hour, with members of the public receiving alerts applicable to their surrounding area."The eyes and ears of the public are essential to help us fight crime, and Police Direct enables us to harness this power," the Suffolk chief superintendent, Mark Cordell, said."It is a fantastic system that gives us the opportunity to communicate with thousands of people within a matter of seconds."West Suffolk was the first area in the country to test the technology for local policing. It is now being expanded to cover the whole of Suffolk, and could be used across the whole country.
