A mature student was charged tonight with the murder of three prostitutes in Bradford.Stephen Griffiths, 40, will appear before magistrates tomorrow, charged over the deaths of Suzanne Blamires, Shelley Armitage and Susan Rushworth, who all went missing in the west Yorkshire city.The announcement by the Crown Prosecution Service followed confirmation that body parts found in a river belonged to missing prostitute Blamires.West Yorkshire police said the remains of Blamires were found on Tuesday afternoon in water just a few yards from where the busy Otley Road crosses the River Aire in Shipley - about five miles from her home.Griffiths was arrested on Monday at his Bradford home.Blamires was last seen on Friday, while Armitage, 31, has been missing since 26 April. Rushworth, 43, disappeared on 22 June last year.Suzanne Blamires's mother, Nicky, 55, tonight described her daughter as "bright and articulate", who went to college and was training to be a nurse."Unfortunately my daughter went down the wrong path, and she did not have the life she was meant to have."She was a much-loved daughter, sister and niece, and what has happened to her will haunt me to the day I die," she said.Suzanne Blamires's home in Barkston Walk, in the Allerton area of Bradford, is just a few streets from that of Armitage, who was last seen on CCTV footage walking in Rebecca Street, in the red-light district.People who knew Armitage today said she was a "bubbly, lovely" girl.The third woman, grandmother and mother-of-three Rushworth, was last seen on 22 June last year, after getting off a single-decker bus near her flat at Oak Villas, in the Manningham area of Bradford.Neighbours said she used to visit elderly residents at Oak Lodge old people's home.Griffiths lived in a third-floor flat in Thornton Road, just a short distance from Bradford city centre.Tonight police were continuing to search the flats complex, and an area around it was sealed off.
