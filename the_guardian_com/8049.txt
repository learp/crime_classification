Women are increasingly turning to serious and violent crimes because they have been brutalised by violence against them, according to a controversial report to be published this week.Home Office figures last week showed the majority of female prisoners now reoffend within two years of being released, suggesting they are becoming more hardened criminals.The number of women jailed for burglary rose by 49 per cent last year, with sharp increases too in convictions for robbery and violence. In the past decade, the number of women serving 10 years or more but less than life has risen more than sixfold.The Commission on Women and the Criminal Justice System, set up by the charitable Fawcett Society and headed by Labour MP Vera Baird, will this week argue that women turn to crime for different reasons from men, and that the criminal justice system is failing to tackle this.Some were being forced into drug dealing by abusive partners they feared, while for others offending was closely linked to a history of violence against them.Half of women prisoners say they have been hit by a partner - at least twice the rates in the general population - and a third say they have suffered sexual abuse.'There seems to be a closer link between women who are victims and women who offend than there is with men,' says Baird, a criminal barrister. 'Lawyers tell us of women who deal drugs or hide weapons under coercion from men who think women will be less of a target for police.'More than a third of sentenced female prisoners have at some stage attempted suicide, and two thirds are either on drugs or drinking heavily in the year before going into jail.The commission, launched almost two years ago by Cherie Blair, will call for better treatment and routes of escape for victims of domestic violence. 'If there are fewer women victims, there may be fewer women offenders,' Baird said.
