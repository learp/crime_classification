Young men intoxicated with drugs or drink are more likely than people with mental health problems to kill strangers, according to research published today.The study found that contrary to popular fears, failures of the mental health care system were not to blame for the rising number of "stranger homicides" in England and Wales.Looking at 358 cases of murder between 1996 and 1999 where the victim was a stranger to the perpetrator, researchers from the University of Manchester found that the killers most commonly had a history of alcohol or drug abuse.Strangers were more than three times as likely to be killed by someone with a history of drug or alcohol problems than someone who had ever been in contact with mental health services, according to the study published in the British Medical Journal.It recommended that efforts to reduce homicide should place a greater emphasis on tackling alcohol and drug abuse among young men.Strangers were more than 15 times more likely to be killed by someone with a history of drug or alcohol problems than someone with schizophrenia who had been in contact with mental health services in year before they committed murder. The research groups, which includes the mental health tsar Professor Louis Appleby, found that of the 37 perpetrators of stranger homicide between 1996 and 1993 who had ever been in contact with mental health services, 10 were diagnosed with schizophrenia, including eight who had been treated in the previous 12 months. Only 14 exhibited symptoms of mental illness when they committed murder or manslaughter.In contrast, 124 young men with a history of drug and alcohol abuse killed strangers over the same period. In 104 of these cases, alcohol or drugs was thought to have contributed to the offence.The findings were welcomed by the mental health charity Rethink, which said the research proved that most violent, avoidable or preventable homicides had nothing to do with the 630,000 people in contact with mental health services across England and Wales at any one time. The charity's director of policy, Paul Corry, said: "This is yet another [piece of] research clearly showing that levels of violence among people abusing alcohol or drugs are higher than levels of violence involving people with a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia. "Some 62% of violent crime is committed by people under the influence of alcohol. People dependent on street drugs are three times as likely to be violent as people with schizophrenia."There were 1,594 murders in England and Wales between 1996 and 1999, of which 358 were committed by strangers, according to the Manchester researchers.The team also noted that the proportion of homicides committed by strangers doubled between 1967 (33) and 1997 (125). "Homicides by strangers have increased more than homicides by people known to their victims, although they remain a minority of all homicides," the authors stated.Although the proportion of murder and manslaughter cases where the perpetrators were ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment in hospital decreased, the researchers found that "failings in mental health care have contributed to individual cases" and called for measures to address this.
