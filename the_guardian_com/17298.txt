This is twice the total of the constabulary with the second highest figure – West Yorkshire recorded 4,125.A total of 27,688 cars have been seized so far in 2015. Last year, 70,430 cars were taken by the police.The information comes from freedom of information requests to the UK’s police forces on 2 June and the analysis is based on responses from the 23 forces that responded fully.Steve Barrett, head of car insurance at Churchill Insurance, said: “This analysis exposes just the tip of the uninsured iceberg. Thousands upon thousands of motorists across the country are driving without insurance, which is truly terrifying.“We need an urgent examination of the penalties for uninsured motoring, introducing sentences that are a real deterrent and that will keep these irresponsible motorists off the road.”Of the seized cars, 1,892 have been sold at auction, raising just over £1m. More than 6,700 vehicles have been crushed, generating a scrap value of over £600,000.
