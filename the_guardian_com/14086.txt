This is the complete statement given by Doreen Lawrence at the Home Office today.She said:-"We have spent years telling those in authority how we perceived what has happened."When one of your children has been brutally murdered you are looking for those with power to do something about it."My son was stabbed and left to bleed to death on the night of 22 April 1993 while police officers looked on."They treated the affair as a gang war and from that moment on acted in a manner that can only be described as white masters during slavery."Since Sir Paul Condon took over the role as Commissioner he has spent a lot of time defending his officers while those he was employed to protect were vulnerable and at the mercy of the racist officers who walked the streets in the name of the law."On racism - one of the issues of racism the report said that there was nothing in their finding that suggested or implied that all police officers are racist, even though they believe that institutional racism was apparent in a number of areas the police handled of the case."It seems that we had all the officers who were racist handling our case."Well no wonder that we are in the position we are today that no one is serving time for the murder of my son."At the moment the flagship of the Metropolitan Police is the race and violent crimes task force led by John Grieve, Deputy Assistant Commissioner."What I see is that black people are still dying on the streets and in the back of police vans."To me institutional racism is so ingrained and it is hard to see how it will be eradicated out of the police force."On the recommendation of stop and search it is said by the inquiry that this should remain unchanged."The Home Secretary has said that his government will make sure that these provisionsm are used more effectively and fairly."I would like to know how he is going to do this."How is he going to make ensure that police on the streets are not going to continue to abuse those who they have stopped."It is a tall order, and I hope that they can accomplish this."On recruitment of black and ethnic minority officers I would like to see monitoring of this done by an independent body outside the police force."I think we have had enough of police policing themselves because they have always given themselves a pat on the back saying how well they are doing as like the Barker review.""For a long time I have talked about education as the key, and I welcome the emphasis that the inquiry has placed on this."They see the need to amend the National Curriculum. I truly believe in education as gaining and imparting knowledge."Our history, our background is what separates us."If those who had murdered my son had been better educated in knowing who had helped to build this society in which we live they would have realised that everything in this country has black people who have played a part in it."We helped to make the National Health Service what it is today, we have good transport, you name it and we have been a part of it."We have more than earned our place to live and not to have our children killed in the way that Stephen was."There are areas in the report of the inquiry which criticised the family over the past six years."The inquiry, like so many, has failed to grasp what we did, for example with the private prosecution. Because we had no other alternative, no one would do anything to bring our son's killers to justice, we had to fight for everything that we have had in this past six years."It is said by the report that the second investigation could not salvage the faults of the first."In my opinion there was a lot they could have salvaged had they not taken what Barker had written as gospel."It is hard to believe that after all the public and I had witnessed at the inquiry at Elephant and Castle - how my son bled to death while police stood idly by - their actions are acceptable to this inquiry team because they could not find any police officers racist."I would like them to tell me what it was that prevented officers from giving my son first aid."The police have made their position very clear right from the start."They are the authority and they should not be challenged over their decision or their conduct."Paul Condon has maintained right from the start that his officers acted in a manner that he supported."He has talked about how this incident has ruined his officers' lives, there is no mention of how this must have ruined our lives."This society has stood by and allowed my son's killers to make a mockery of the law and it seems like this society is going to stand by and support the inquiry led by the judge, but there is part of this inquiry that I do not support."My feelings about the future remain the same as they were when my son was murdered.Black youngsters will never be safe on the streets."The police on the ground are the same as they were when my son was killed."I am hearing killing on the streets and in the back of police vans and it is clear that nothing has changed."We all saw at the inquiry how the five boys who we say are responsible for Stephen's murder lied under oath and the judge has chosen not to take any action against them."Nonetheless, this report represents an opportunity not to be missed by this society as a whole."It is a time for change."
