A former police officer found guilty of murdering his estranged wife at her high street hair salon has been jailed for a minimum of 28 years.A judge said Ivan Esack planned the killing "to the minute" before he stabbed Natalie Esack up to 11 times because he could not cope with her being with someone else.The 20cm (8in) blade bent and the tip broke off under the ferocity of the attack at Esack Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent, on 30 April.Following the stabbing, Esack, 38, of Ashford, turned to his estranged wife's colleague Chelsea Ford, then 17, and said: "She deserved it, the bitch."In the period before the killing he told his wife, 33, she was a "dead woman walking" and added: "Tick tock, tick tock".On Friday the detective constable turned aspiring football agent was found guilty of murder following a three-week trial at Maidstone crown court.Sentencing him on Monday, the judge, Charles Byers, said Esack would not be freed until authorities had judged him fit for release after at least 28 years in prison.The judge said Esack had killed his estranged wife while she was in the prime of life, and had shown no remorse for his actions. "Not only did you take her precious life but in doing so you devastated the lives of so many around her. You had previously made her life a misery, subjecting her to repeated physical and verbal abuse. And yet she never offered you any malice, not of any sort."He said Mrs Esack had decided to leave her husband after considerable threats. "You are a controlling man and the only way that you could continue to control her life was to take it from her. You had no other intention that day other than to kill her. This was a calculated, premeditated killing planned to the minute."Byers said the attack happened in the victim's salon, "a place where she was entitled to feel safe", in front of her 17-year-old colleague, Chelsea Ford, whom he praised for her actions in the aftermath. "No one could have done more for the person she liked and loved so much," the judge said.Concluding his sentencing remarks, he said: "I'm particularly concerned that, if you are released by such time as it's considered safe, that anyone who forms a relationship with you may be in danger."In mitigation, the defence counsel Oliver Saxby said of Ivan Esack: "He has unquestionably a lack of empathy and that surely must have played a part, if not in the killing itself, but in the way it was carried out and his conduct thereafter."
