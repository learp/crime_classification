A "vulnerable" 13-year-old girl was abducted on her way home from school by four men, blindfolded and subjected to a horrendous sexual assault, police said yesterday.The girl was travelling on a bus towards Hackney, east London, at around 4.30pm on Tuesday when she was approached by the four attackers. They started to chat to the girl, who was still wearing her school uniform, before forcing her to get off the bus at Clapton Common. The men then placed a bandana over her eyes and led her to an area nearby where she was subjected to a sexual assault, Scotland Yard said. The group then led the victim back to the bus stop at Clapton Common, where they removed her blindfold before fleeing the scene. Police are hunting four black men all aged around 18. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said it was unclear at this stage how many of the men were involved in the attack itself and exactly where the assault took place. Detective Inspector Daniel Smith of Operation Sapphire, which investigates sexual assaults, said: "This was a horrendous assault on a vulnerable young girl. We are certain that someone must have seen the group of four males on the bus and then later as they led this blindfolded teenage girl to an unknown location. We urge anyone with information to come forward as soon as possible." To assist witnesses, the victim is described as black and was wearing her uniform of maroon blazer and tartan skirt. Police believe she was travelling on the 253 bus towards Hackney. Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact Stoke Newington police station on 020 7275 4070 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
