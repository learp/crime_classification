The government has dropped plans to merge five watchdogs in the criminal justice system, including chief inspector of prisons, after the measure was comprehensively defeated in the Lords. The former chief inspector Lord Ramsbotham last week led an all-party rebellion against the plan to combine the inspectorates of prisons, probation, police, Crown Prosecution Service and court administration.In a letter to the five inspectorates, John Reid, the home secretary, Lord Falconer, the lord chancellor, and Lord Goldsmith, the attorney general, have agreed instead to strengthen cooperation between the inspectorates rather than merge them."We have recognised the serious concerns about aspects of our proposals and agree with you that the focus of our effort should now be on finding ways to strengthen and improve joint working rather than on proposals for organisational merger," the ministers said.In reply, the five chief inspectors - including Anne Owers, holder of the prisons post, acknowledged the Lords debate and said that by working together they could "deliver for you the substantial benefits that you were looking to the single inspectorate to secure".The inspectors added: "In some cases, for example work on a joint business plan, we think we can do this more quickly than would otherwise have been the case."The prisons inspectorate has provided uncomfortable, independent advice to ministers.Supporters of Lord Ramsbotham's amendment to scrap the government's plan included Lady (Joyce) Quin, a former prisons minister in the Blair government, former Northern Ireland minister Lord Dubs, and Lord (Robin) Corbett, a former chairman of the home affairs select committee.The amendment was passed by 211 to 98, and initially the government said it was intent on overturning the move in the Commons.Lord Dubs said last night: "I am delighted, I think the government has been quite sensible to have changed their minds. Ramsbotham made it game, set and match."David Winnick, a member of the Commons home affairs select committee, had protested to party managers about the plan. "I don't believe it would have been defeated in the Commons, but I have no doubt there would have been quite a few on the government benches who would have never agreed to vote for the merger," he added.Lord Dholakia, a Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said the government had "suffered a massive defeat on this issue", which had been consistently opposed by his party.
