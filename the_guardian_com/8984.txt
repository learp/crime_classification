An intriguing aspect of Si√¥n Jenkins' appeal concerns a vagrant identified as X who was spotted near the murder scene. The court heard that X had a fixation with sealing openings to keep out imagined poisons. He would stuff paper into his mouth or nose and used tape to make his room airtight.Clare Montgomery QC, for Jenkins, pointed out that one of the most extraordinary features of the murder was that a piece of bin liner was found stuffed into Billie-Jo's left nostril. On the afternoon of the killing, X was in a hotel in the same road as the Jenkins' house. The hotelier said he was behaving in a "bizarre fashion" before leaving at 3pm. X was seen in the park opposite the house after 3.40pm but there were no sightings of him during the 40 minutes after he left the hotel - the time of Billie-Jo's murder. Miss Montgomery said X was "episodically psychotic" and had been violent in the past. She also said he had formed the "irrational belief" that he would be falsely accused of rape by a girl with brown hair worn in a pony tail. Billie-Jo's brown hair was tied back in such a way. The court also heard that X and Billie-Jo had been in the same department store the day before the murder. Miss Mongomery said X "disappeared from the face of the earth" for two days after Billie-Jo died. When police did pick him up he tried to stuff pieces of blue plastic which had been hidden in his shoes and pants into his mouth and nose. Lord Justice Rose conceded that the discovery of the bag in Billie-Jo's nose was a "curious feature" but added that there was no evidence linking X to Billie-Jo.
