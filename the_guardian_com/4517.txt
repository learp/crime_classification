An ex-IRA prisoner being questioned about the murder of two British soldiers earlier this month is on hunger strike, his family confirmed today.Colin Duffy has been in police custody since his arrest on 14 March. The 41-year-old prominent North Armagh republican was detained in connection with the Police Service for Northern Ireland (PSNI) investigation into the double murder at Massareene barracks in Antrim.Eleven people, including a 17-year-old youth, are still being held by the police in connection with the Real IRA Massareene murders and the death of PSNI constable Stephen Carroll, who was shot dead by a Continuity IRA sniper.In a statement issued through the Republican Unity Network, Duffy's family said he was refusing food "to highlight the injustice he is suffering".The family added: "Following his arrest Colin's legal representative was astounded to be informed that the arrest was 'not based on evidence'. In the absence of any evidential basis for his arrest, it is clear that the PSNI had other sinister motivations for detaining him."It is the view of his family that the PSNI's motivations are based upon sheer vindictiveness and also as a reaction to the media frenzy."Several newspapers in Ireland named Duffy as a member of the Real IRA, a claim he and his family deny.They also called for the release of all the other suspects who can be held by the PSNI for up to 28 days. At the weekend detectives were given an extra week to hold the suspects.Among those still in detention are the sons of former Irish National Liberation Army leader Dominic "Mad Dog" McGlinchey. They also include former Sinn FÃ©in councillor Brendan McConville.The investigation into the murder of Sappers Patrick Azimkar and Mark Quinsey is focused on a car believed to be the getaway vehicle.Security sources said the gang that fled the murder scene failed to set the car alight and may have left some forensic traces inside.
