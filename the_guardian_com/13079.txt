An armed officer, who on 4 August 2011 was three metres away from the Tottenham resident Mark Duggan, said the latter had a gun when he was shot by the police but afterwards that the suspect's hands were empty.But the officer, known only as W70, had omitted that fact from his initial statement, an inquest has heard.The officer said he had a clear view of Duggan, but did not see him throw or drop a gun after he was shot twice by police. He told the inquest into the shooting he would have expected the gun he says Duggan was holding to be visible to himself, and he grabbed the suspect's hands and shouted "where's the gun, where's the gun?" as the shot man slumped to the floor.The firearms officer said he omitted mentioning Duggan had been holding a gun in an initial account hours after the shooting, after receiving legal advice.W70 told the inquest jury this was because the initial account was not to contain details. W70 denied claims he did this because he wanted to make sure his account matched those of colleagues.The gun Duggan is alleged to have threatened officers with was found 10ft-20ft over a fence from where he fell, near a cannabis plant. No officers say they saw it flying in the air after Duggan was shot.The shooting in Tottenham, north London, led to the riots of 2011.W70 is one of two officers to say they saw Duggan emerge from the cab with a pistol. W70 says he was stood next to the other officer who says Duggan was armed, called V53, who fired the shots that killed Duggan.W70 told the inquest that when Duggan emerged from the cab, he had no time to react or reach for a gun he was carrying, before V53 fired two shots, which whistled past his head.He told the jury that Duggan pivoted after coming out of the cab: "In his hand was a self-loading pistol," W70 said, adding he could see the weapon's shape but could make out no details.W70 did not get his gun out of his holster, saying the incident was over in two seconds.In a full statement made on 7 August 2011, three days after the shooting, he said Duggan pulled a pistol from under his jacket: "I felt very much at risk and thought I was in danger as this male was believed to be in possession of a firearm."Police believed Duggan was a gangster who had collected a gun minutes before they stopped him.Police say Duggan was shot in self defence after threatening officers with a gun. His family say he did not have a gun when he was shot by police.W70 was questioned at length by Leslie Thomas for the Duggan family who described his account as "nonsense".Pressing W70 about his omission from his initial statement that Duggan had a weapon, Thomas said: "One of the obvious things that should have been in your notes was you saw a gun and felt threatened."The firearms officer, whose identity was concealed from the public, said: "I told my legal adviser that night I had seen a gun … He told me not to put in any detail."Thomas said of the weapon officers claim Duggan had: "What happened to the gun … magically disappeared did it?"The inquest also heard from an officer, W42, who was shot by a colleague's bullet, which passed through his T-shirt and lodged in his radio after it tore through Duggan.W42 told the jury he saw Duggan's hand in his jacket and then his arm movements led him to shout to colleagues: "He's reaching, he's reaching."W42 accepted he had left out of his initial statement the fact he shouted to colleagues that Duggan was going for a gun in his jacket, saying he was "quite happy" he would remember this when he came to make his full statement days later.
