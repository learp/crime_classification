A British couple who encouraged "unspeakable" sex acts against a nine-year-old girl in the US as they watched via a webcam were today jailed for 10 years each.Ronald and Denise Edwards looked on from their home in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, while the girl's grandfather abused her at his apartment in New York.The couple, aged 55 and 44, also had sex in front of a camera at their home while the girl was forced to watch, again via the internet.Judge Martin Picton told them that they thought they would never be traced because the girl was so far away. "You thought you could offend over the internet, confident that no-one would ever find out. But the internet does not provide an anonymous playground for perverts."The two of you took substantial pleasure in watching a nine-year-old girl being horribly abused by her grandfather and you encouraged that."Judge Picton said the girl had been "permanently and enormously harmed", adding: "She will never recover from the abuse to which she was subjected."The conviction, the first of its kind, is the culmination of two years' work by police in Gloucestershire and the FBI.Ian Fenny, prosecuting, told Gloucester crown court the offences against the girl involved "essentially unspeakable acts".He said the investigation began in 2004 when a woman in the US came upon "disturbing" chat rooms and message boards as she looked on the grandfather's computer.It was found that the man, now serving an 18-year jail sentence, was abusing the girl and relaying it to others via the internet. Among them were Ronald and Denise Edwards. When police raided their house in Cinderford they found computer discs and videos with images of children being abused.The abused girl's grandfather gave evidence against the couple from his cell in the US.He told the court - via a satellite link - that he made contact with the Edwards through a paedophile chatroom and said they were the only couple who watched the abuse.After the sentencing, detective Sergeant Steve Vallender, who led the investigation for Gloucestershire Police, said he believed the convictions were unique."As far as we are aware it's the first offence of this type that has been investigated, where offences have been encouraged to someone in a different country."It's also the first time a video link has been used to hear evidence from a convicted sex offender in another country."The couple were each convicted of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child. The charges only became offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. A case can only be brought if the offences are illegal in both countries.Mrs Edwards broke down in tears as the sentence was passed. The couple's two sons, who were watching their parents from the public gallery, wept as they were led away.
