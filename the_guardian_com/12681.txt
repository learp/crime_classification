Two classmates aged 10 and 11 dragged a girl into a school toilet as she waited for her mother to pick her up from an afternoon club and tried to rape her, a court heard yesterday.One of the boys attacked the girl, 11, while the other stood guard outside. They then swapped places, it was claimed. After the alleged assault at the north London school, the 11-year-old headed for the sandpit while the younger climbed on a child's scooter and called out: "Same time tomorrow." He also suggested that he could get the girl pregnant. The boys deny attempted rape and sexual assault. They cannot be named for legal reasons. One of the boys, dressed in his school uniform, appeared to sob occasionally and sipped a glass of Ribena. The second wore a rugby shirt and jeans. Michael Birnbaum, prosecuting, told the jury at Inner London crown court that the school ran an afternoon club for pupils who had to wait to be collected by parents. After finishing a French lesson at about 4pm on a day last May, the girl and a friend began skipping in the playground. Mr Birnbaum said: "The boys called her over ... they told her to sit down on a bench and she did. They told her friend to back off or they would beat her up." He added: "They were all by the toilets and she was pulled in. The older boy then grabbed her by the upper arm and said, 'Shush. If you tell your mum or teacher or any relative we will beat you up.' Once again her friend was told to back off and she went away." The girl kept her alleged ordeal a secret for a couple of days before finally confiding in her mother, who told the school's headteacher. Mr Birnbaum said the boys denied anything of a sexual nature had gone on and said if anything had, it was an ordinary game of the sort kids played, and "nothing of the kind she alleged". Police were called and the older boy told officers: "It was like play, like a game of tag." The trial continues.
