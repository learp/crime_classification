An accountant who stole more than £9m from his bosses to fund his gambling addiction was jailed for five years yesterday.Wing Kit Chu borrowed the identities of company executives to authorise transfer of thousands of pounds a time from the funds of the engineering firm Charter plc to his spread-betting account.The 32-year-old, described by his colleagues as "quiet, unassuming and polite," then squandered most of the money betting on the future performance of FTSE and Nasdaq stock indexes.By the time his crime was discovered, £9,237,312.68 was missing from the company's funds. But despite the huge sums involved, Chu's "well-planned series of thefts" went unnoticed by the £800m firm for more than five years.The court heard that the company only discovered Chu's years of theft after he handed in his notice in July last year and was asked to help a replacement resolve some inconsistencies in the past three month's transfers.After repeatedly failing to explain the discrepancies, the treasury manager finally sent an email to one of his bosses on August 18 effectively confessing his guilt.He wrote: "I never meant for things to end this way. The truth is I can't bear to face you or any other person in the office any longer. I realise this is not acceptable behaviour from a professional person."I have not taken this decision lightly. I don't expect anybody to understand what I have done because I am not sure myself. I am very very sorry."He turned himself in at Belgravia police station in central London the following month.Chu, originally from Hong Kong, stole amounts of between £2,000 and £150,000 at a time by logging on to in-house computers using the passwords of company executives on more than 100 occasions.He became increasingly desperate as he lost ever-larger sums of money and in one three-day period he withdrew almost £500,000 which "simply slipped by unnoticed".The accountant used the internet up 30 times per day to make bets from work. His "very high risk" addiction to spread betting saw him place bets on sporting events as well as the performance of the stock markets.Chu pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to 28 counts of theft between January 1 2000 and August 18 2004 and asked for 74 similar offences to be taken into consideration. A further 28 charges of false accounting, which he denied, were not proceeded with.Passing sentence, Judge Peter Fingret told the tearful defendant: "This offending must have had an impact on the trust placed in the company by those with whom they dealt and inevitably on your fellow employees, particularly those who were exploited directly by you."Caroline English, defending, said Chu's gambling addiction began as a child in Hong Kong. After coming to England, his debts spiralled out of control and he ran up £27,000 on a range of credit cards.By the end of 2003, the accountant, who was earning £50,000 a year, had spent £5m of Charter plc's money. But his thefts accelerated between January and August last year, when he stole a further £4.2m to fund his "pathological obsession" with gambling.The court heard that though most of Chu's £850,000 winnings went to his gambling account, £96,851 was used towards a £600,000 five-bedroom house he bought in Farnham Common, Berkshire, just six weeks before his arrest.Chu also bought two cars, including a £60,000 BMW, and spent £59,000 on paying off credit card debts.
