The high court yesterday ordered the Ministry of Defence to disclose to lawyers key documents about the circumstances surrounding the death of Baha Mousa, an Iraqi who died in British custody in Basra four years ago. The move came after the lawyers for Mr Mousa's family and the families of 10 other Iraqis detained by British soldiers accused the MoD of "obfuscation and delay" in providing vital information.The family demanded the documents after an MoD offer for them to take part in an inquiry into incidents in Basra in 2003. The information they wanted includes the background of military training regarding treatment of detainees, and the orders given in Iraq. "It was a shameful episode for the British army and for Britain itself," Jason Coppel, counsel for the families, told Mr Justice Jackson .The defence secretary, Des Browne, promised an inquiry after the collapse of a court martial in which the judge referred to a "closing of ranks" within the MoD and the army. Mr Mousa, a Basra hotel receptionist, suffered 93 injuries and died in British custody. Evidence about abuse emerged during the court martial of Colonel Jorge Mendonca and five soldiers who were acquitted of negligence and abuse.Lawyers for the families say they could not participate in an inquiry - which the MoD would like to hold as much as possible behind closed doors - unless they have the same access to relevant documents and information as the MoD.
