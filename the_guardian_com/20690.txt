Detectives are hunting the killers of a husband and wife who were found murdered at their home.Avtar Kolar, 62, and his wife Carole, 58, were found in the Handsworth Wood area of Birmingham at 8am on Wednesday by their police officer son, West Midlands police said.Investigators have not ruled out the possibility that the killings were a revenge attack linked to their son's work with the force.Detective Superintendent Richard Baker, who is leading the inquiry, said: "It was obvious from the scene the couple had been assaulted and had more than likely died of their injuries."He added: "We currently have over 60 detectives from West Midlands police CID along with a lot of our uniform colleagues working around the clock to catch the offenders responsible for this and bring them to justice."I can assure the local communities and the family that we will catch the people who have done this horrendous crime."The couple, who have four sons, were discovered in their home on Friary Road. One son, who serves with the West Midlands force, found them after his parents failed to answer the phone.Baker said one family member spoke to Carole Kolar on Tuesday night and there were no apparent problems.He said the couple, who had been married for 40 years, had eight grandchildren and that this was a very difficult time for the family.Postmortem examinations will be carried out on Thursday or Friday, police said.Baker said: "We're appealing for anybody who may have seen or heard anything suspicious within the Friary Road area of Handsworth Wood to come forward with any information they have, and please can I stress that any information could prove vital to coming to a very quick and swift conclusion to this inquiry."I'm absolutely convinced that local people within the area of Handsworth Wood have that vital bit of information that will lead to the identity of these offenders and bring them to justice as quickly as we possibly can."When asked if it might be a revenge attack linked to their son's police work, he said: "We are looking at that as a possibility but we have no information to suggest it is the case at this stage."Baker said the couple had lived in the Handsworth Wood area for most of their lives and were heavily involved in the care of their grandchildren.He appealed for information from anyone who saw or heard something unusual in the area over recent days."The local community so far – and the family – have been extremely supportive and forthcoming in what they are telling us and how they are co-operating with us," Baker said."We will catch the people responsible but we would like to make that appeal for information."We have a full team of experts and forensic scientists at the address. It is very early days and we don't want to miss any opportunity."He said officers were keeping an open mind about what kind of weapon was used.
