The government was tonight forced to backtrack over radical plans to force youngsters caught with knives to face stabbing victims in A&E departments.Downing Street said that those caught carrying knives would be made to visit "health professionals" rather than those seeking treatment on emergency wards.The "clarification" of the government's position came after the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, was asked in an interview with Sky's Adam Boulton yesterday if one of the measures planned to tackle the issue was to make people caught carrying knives visit stabbing victims in hospital."It is," replied Smith.Opposition parties and health experts branded the idea "half-baked" and "ill-thought through".Tonight the prime minister's official spokesman insisted: "The aim is to make sure that perpetrators of knife crime are made aware of the consequences of their actions, including talking to doctors and healthcare professionals, but this has to be handled with common sense and sensitivity." But Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, said: "It's yet another government announcement that took three days to conjure up and three days to collapse. Gimmicks will not solve this problem." Earlier today, Gordon Brown defended his proposals on tackling knife crime and insisted that those carrying knives were more likely to be caught, prosecuted and punished than ever before.The prime minister used his monthly press conference to set out the government's response to the recent spate of fatal stabbings as he promised tougher measures on "enforcement, punishment and prevention" regarding knife crime."Too many people, young and old, do not feel safe in the streets, and sometimes even in their homes, as a result of the behaviour of a minority," he said."We need to make it absolutely clear to everyone, but especially young people, that in our country there are boundaries of acceptable behaviour, that it is completely unacceptable to carry a knife."Money would be made available for stop-and-search procedures, and a new presumption to prosecute offenders would mean they were ever more likely to be punished. Brown said that community sentences were being strengthened to make them "tough, visible and effective" and that the government would do more to prevent youngsters "falling into crime". Early intervention would be extended to 20,000 families, who would face the threat of eviction if they failed to respond positively to support.Donald MacKechnie, clinical vice-president of the College of Emergency Medicine, was among those to speak out against the idea of offenders going into hospitals to visit victims.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the proposal was impractical for a busy emergency department, whose priority was the patient."When someone is brought in having been stabbed or assaulted with a knife, it's a very emotive situation. Doctors and nurses first of all have got to assess the injuries and then manage those injuries," he said."We certainly don't think it would be a good idea if then potential or actual perpetrators of knife crime were marched through to see these patients, who are in an extremely vulnerable state."It's tantamount to secondary victimisation of someone who has already suffered a horrendous insult to them. From a practical point of view, working in an A&E department, it's very difficult to see how this would work."The government is expected to come forward with more detailed proposals tomorrow when it publishes its Â£100m youth crime action plan. Meanwhile Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alf Hitchcock of the Metropolitan police, who has been appointed to coordinate the police effort across eight "hot-spot" areas, has warned that attacks are becoming more serious while victims and assailants are getting younger.
