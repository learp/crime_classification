Ninety-five per cent of sex workers are not drug users (Sex worker reform, January 18). Women who don't use drugs don't use the Home Office-funded projects on which these figures depend. The major factors that force women into prostitution - poverty, domestic violence, homelessness and debt - are hidden. Even the government has acknowledged that 74% of sex workers cite "the need to pay household expenses and support their children as the prime motivating factor" for getting into prostitution.A single mother with two children is expected to live on Â£156 a week and can lose 40% of that benefit if she refuses to name to the Child Support Agency the often violent father of her children; women on average receive 52% of men's income (black women earn even less); 30% of children are living in poverty; thousands of asylum seekers have been made deliberately destitute; student grants have been abolished; and many industries run into the ground.No wonder women turn to prostitution to survive. In the face of these injustices and inequalities, the best the government can do is introduce a crackdown against clients which will hurt women working on the street most. The limited proposal to allow two women to work from premises is just a cover for this brutal treatment of the most vulnerable. Cari Mitchell  English Collective of ProstitutesLet's hope the Home Office listens to the sensible advice of Julie Bindel (Comment, January 18) that prostitution is the oldest oppression, not the oldest profession. Let's hope, too, that the government will put its money where its mouth is and get the police to divert their attention to pimps, traffickers and the customers of prostitutes. These practical suggestions resonate with other news items this week - the low-pay culture many women experience in the job market and the debasing porn of lad mags. Ro Oliver Elmswell, Suffolk
