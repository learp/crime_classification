A father and son have been remanded in custody, charged with helping police killer Dale Cregan while he was on the run.Cregan, 30, was at large after he murdered David Short, 46, in a gun and grenade attack last August and went on to kill police constables Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, in similar circumstances a month later.Jack Willbye, 57, of Herne Bay, Kent, and Samuel Willbye, 28, of Wythenshawe, Manchester, are accused of conspiring to assist an offender.They appeared at Manchester magistrates court on Wednesday and are next due to appear at Manchester crown court on 25 September, said Greater Manchester police.The charges relate to when Cregan and fellow killers Anthony Wilkinson and Jermaine Ward were on the run after the murder of David Short.In May last year, Cregan walked into a pub in Droylsden, Manchester, and shot dead Mark Short, 23, the son of David Short.The manhunt for Cregan reached a grisly conclusion when he ambushed the police constables following a bogus 999 call to a house in Abbey Gardens in Hattersley on 18 September.Greater Manchester police said a 41-year-old man from the London area was also arrested in the Costa del Sol area of Spain as part of the same investigation.The force worked in conjunction with the Serious Organised Crime Agency to make the arrest and extradition proceedings are now under way.Cregan was given four whole life sentences at Preston crown court in June.He has recently been moved to maximum-security Ashworth hospital in Merseyside.Wilkinson, 34, and Ward, 24, were jailed for 35 years and 33 years respectively for killing David Short at his home in Clayton, Manchester.
