The five youths suspected of the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence provided important new lines of inquiry in their controversial television interviews due to be screened tonight, the programme makers said today.The interviews, in which the five are asked publicly for the first time whether they carried out the killing, will be shown on the launch edition of ITV's new current affairs flagship, Tonight, at 10pm.Programme makers Granada hit back at criticism from both Stephen's parents, Neville and Doreen, and the Metropolitan Police Federation that the show was a "publicity stunt" which would shed no new light on the case.According to Granada, the programme revealed for the first time conflicts in the accounts of some of the five about how they spent the night of the murder.Two of the suspects Neil Acourt and Gary Dobson said they heard of the killing on the night of Stephen's death in April 1993.However, Neil's brother Jamie, who was with the other two, insisted it was not until the next day that the news reached them.Another of the five, David Norris, revealed that he probably spent the night of the murder at his girlfriend's flat in Eltham, south London.That would put him much closer to the scene of the murder than if he had been staying at his parents' home in Chislehurst in Kent, as previously thought.During the programme, Neil Acourt admitted: "We're seen in the public eye as murderers, big time gangsters, just killers. We're looked upon as scum."He also said: "If someone put trouble my way, I would not stand for it, simple as that."Norris told interviewer Martin Bashir, who famously interviewed Diana, Princess of Wales for Panorama on BBC1: "Some people would call you a Paki."Although, Granada was not revealing further details before the broadcast, all five are believed to have replied negatively when asked directly if they were involved in the unprovoked murder of Stephen, an 18-year-old A-level student.Mr and Mrs Lawrence's lawyers gave a mixed reaction to the programme after attending a special preview this afternoon.Michael Mansfield QC said: "The Lawrences themselves are concerned that such a programme should be broadcast to give a platform to people who have never taken the opportunity before."So in that sense, it is a travesty for them to be given the opportunity. However, there are lines of inquiry which we would like pursued immediately."Mr and Mrs Lawrence's anger over the five's appearance on TV is compounded by the fact that they refused to give evidence at the inquest.They also attended last year's public inquiry into the botched police handling of Stephen's murder armed with a High Court order preventing them from being asked whether they were responsible for the killing.Even then, inquiry chairman Sir William Macpherson branded their performances in the witness box "arrogant and dismissive".In his report published in February, Sir William also cited the five's numerous memory lapses, saying: "To say that they gave evidence would be to dignify their appearance."Today, Mr Lawrence told BBC1's Breakfast News: "These boys have been given several opportunities in the courts ... They even took us to the High Court to stop us asking the obvious questions."I don't see any way this programme is going to take anything forward. This is just a publicity stunt to try and say they didn't kill my son."However, Tonight editor Jeff Anderson insisted interviewing the Acourts, Dobson, Norris and Luke Knight was valid journalism.Mr Anderson also insisted the questioning had been "rigorous and detailed" with no chance for the five to confer between interviews and stressed that no subject had been off limits and no payments were made."We are pleased that Mr and Mrs Lawrence's lawyers now acknowledge that the programme does produce significant new information offering new lines of inquiry," he said.Scotland Yard refused to comment on the programme, although it is understood police have not viewed the tapes in advance of the broadcast.Detectives were expected to ask Granada for copies of the interviews tonight, including any footage which was not screened.Glen Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said earlier today: "I think the whole thing is completely unsavoury and it strikes me as a cheap publicity stunt by Granada to gain some notoriety for their new programme.""The five youths were arrested, they have had a number of opportunities to say what happened when they were interviewed, at the inquest and they could have talked about it at the public inquiry and haven't chosen to do so."Mr Smyth added: "Perhaps if they feel this strongly about it they'd like to present themselves at a police station by appointment to be interviewed by police officers and answer the difficult questions as opposed to being interviewed by a journalist."Frantic legal consultations continued during the day and a preview screening for the press due to have gone ahead at 3.30pm was cancelled suddenly. Granada said the cancellation was "for legal reasons" but refused to give details.
