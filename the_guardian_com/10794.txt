A man who murdered his 84-year-old grandmother by stabbing her 50 times in her bed and then attempted to kill a nine-year-old boy has been told he must serve minimum of 24 years in prison.A judge told Nathaniel Flynn, 27, that the most likely explanation for why he killed retired teacher Louisa Denby was that "she just got on your nerves".Flynn, a cannabis user, admitted killing Denby at their home in Shipley, West Yorkshire, in July, and stabbing Jason D'Arcy in a nearby skate park later the same day.Bradford crown court heard that Jason sustained a shallow wound to his chest and a more serious injury to his arm as he tried to defend himself.Mr Justice Keith sentenced Flynn to life in prison on Wednesday.The judge heard that three psychiatrists found Flynn had no diagnosable mental illness but said he had been influenced by his heavy, "entrenched" use of cannabis and other drugs.Flynn ordered an SAS survival guide, two knives, tarpaulin and rope from the internet in the days before he killed his grandmother, the judge was told.Police believe one of the knives he ordered was used in the attacks, although the weapon has not been recovered.The court was told that Flynn was still wearing pyjamas when he walked into Denby's bedroom on the morning of 1 July.He later told a psychiatrist that he thought his grandmother was "deteriorating" and wanted to end it for her, despite there being no evidence from anyone else in the family that she had any problems.The court heard that Flynn told a doctor: "I got her a cup of tea and said: 'I love you,' and then I attacked her."He also said: "I'd just given up on trying to talk to her."The courtroom was shown diagrams of the 50 wounds to the pensioner's body.Adrian Waterman QC, prosecuting, took the court through Flynn's movements after he left the house he shared with his grandmother.This culminated in the random attack on Jason at the Carnegie skate park, where the nine-year-old had been playing as usual and was setting off home for a drink.The court heard a dramatic account of how the boy ran home after he was stabbed twice and was then given first aid to stem the flow of blood by his father, Lee D'Arcy.There was so much blood on Lee D'Arcy's phone that he struggled to ring an ambulance, the judge was told.Jason suffered serious nerve damage to his hand which may be permanent, the court heard.The boy later told police: "He [Flynn]went for my heart."Waterman said Flynn then tried to approach an eight-year-old girl, Ellie Palomar, who was playing in her garden nearby.Later, the court heard, he moved to the Idle area of Bradford, where he attacked Terence Thackray, who challenged Flynn as he tried to climb a wall into a school.The court was also told there was evidence that Flynn had hidden for some time at a nursery school.Waterman said Flynn was finally detained by an armed police officer in the early hours of the next morning. He was carrying a set of garden shears at the time.The court heard that Bradford-born Flynn had lived in the US for much of his life. He returned to the UK about two years ago and was living with his grandmother but his relationship with her was difficult and his attitude towards her worried members of the extended family.Waterman said arguments were mainly about money and police were called to the house on two occasions by worried neighbours.The prosecutor said Flynn had a long history of drug use and he had a conviction for cocaine-related offences in the US.The judge told him: "You were an entrenched user of drugs before this and it looks as if your use of cannabis resulted in a deterioration of your mental function so you became so disinhibited that you did whatever you felt like doing, even though you knew it was wrong."The judge said: "You said you killed your grandmother, in effect, as an act of mercy. A more likely explanation was that she just got on your nerves."The judge said once Flynn had killed Denby any other inhibitions he may have had about killing others disintegrated, adding that the 84-year-old's death was "horrific".The judge fixed a 24-year minimum term for the murder. He also sentenced Flynn to 14 years for the attempted murder of Jason but said this was to run concurrently to the life sentence.Flynn admitted both offences at a previous hearing.On Thursday he sat quietly in the dock listening to proceedings, flanked by three prison officers.Wearing black-rimmed glasses and a short sleeved, open-necked blue shirt, he was watched by many members of his own family and also Jason's family for the two-hour sentencing hearing.
