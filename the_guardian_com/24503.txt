A man who wrongly claimed £88,000 in benefits while performing as a drag artist on stage has been jailed for six months.Mark Hawthorn, 49 – better known on the entertainment circuit as part of the duet Glitterlips – was jailed for making fraudulent benefit claims between November 2003 and March 2012.Sentencing him at Stafford crown court, Judge Michael Challinor said Hawthorn was guilty of "breathtaking" fraud, adding: "You should have confined your acting ability to female impersonation rather than defrauding the state."Prosecutors for the Department for Work and Pensions said an anonymous tip-off prompted its investigation into Hawthorn's "systematic fraud" of the benefits system.Trevor Meegan, for the DWP, said Hawthorn failed to declare his status as a self-employed drag artist and claimed to have a host of health problems that meant he needed help "both night and day".The judge heard that Hawthorn, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, was claiming disability living allowance, income support, council tax benefit and housing benefit, and failed to pay income tax or national insurance contributions from his on-stage earnings as alter-ego "Tilly".Admitting five counts relating to benefit fraud and non-payment to Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs, Hawthorn, wearing a black suit, looked over to loved ones in the public gallery as he was led away to prison.Meegan said Hawthorn fully admitted wrongdoing when confronted with the facts of the case. The DWP found he had been performing on and off for 25 years, but failed to tell the DWP of a more recent change in circumstances from 2003."He made several declarations on a claim form in 2001, declaring the information to be true, but never notifying of a change in circumstances despite an annual reminder," he said.Meegan said Hawthorn claimed the highest level of disability living allowance, stating he was only able to walk a short distance, suffered from nausea, mood swings and headaches and needed to use inhalers three or four times every two hours.These declarations, Meegan said, were contradicted by DWP surveillance showing Hawthorn at the gym loading up and lifting weights, using the cross-trainer and taking part in step aerobics – sometimes while using dumb-bells.Hawthorn drove to the gym in his car provided under the Motability scheme, said Meegan.Hawthorn pleaded guilty to failing to notify the DWP about a change in circumstances relating to his claims for disability living, income support, and failing to notify North Warwickshire council in relation to housing benefit and council tax benefit claims. In total, he fraudulently claimed £84,534.He admitted two further counts of knowingly and fraudulently evading national insurance payments and income tax of £3,759.The judge was told Hawthorn had repaid £4,100 to date.Judge Challinor decreased Hawthorn's sentence from a possible 18 months, taking into account his troubled early life and his mental health issues.
