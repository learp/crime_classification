As the man dubbed the British Josef Fritzl is sentenced to life in jail, questions are being raised as to how Sheffield council and social agencies allowed two girls to suffer 25 years of abuse at the hands of their father.David Blunkett, the MP for Sheffield and former home secretary, has called for an inquiry into all the organisations and services involved with the family."Who knew, what they knew, and above all, what they did about it has to be top of the agenda," he said.Relatives of the family claim police officers failed to act after they were told of the abuse following the birth of the first child to the man's daughter.They say the girls' grandmother was told she could be sued for slander for telling officers that the girl's father, a 56-year-old self-employed businessman, had got her pregnant.The relatives also said they alerted the police when the youngest daughter, who was around five years old at the time, was taken to hospital with a broken leg after allegedly being thrown down the stairs by her father.The rapist's sister-in-law told the Sheffield Telegraph: "The police could have stopped it. They let those girls down. Our family has gone to the police a number of times over the years."We all suspected what was going on, did not agree with it, and it was reported to the police when the oldest daughter first gave birth."People may ask, 'How could the family not do anything about this?'. But we tried to get it to stop. We went to the police but nothing was done."She said the girl's mother had left the family home shortly after the family moved from South Yorkshire to Lincolnshire because she was the victim of her husband's violent abuse."Her husband was wicked - he would beat her up, lock her in the house and throw her down the stairs. He was a violent, violent man. On the day she left he threw her down the stairs," the sister-in-law said."The dad turned the girls against their mum and although we suspected what was happening, the girls never said anything, probably through fear of what he would do."The sister-in-law's husband said that the girl's grandmother told South Yorkshire police about the situation repeatedly."I know that my sister - the girls' mother - was visited by police at her home after she left the area and they talked to her about the claims but again nothing happened."A police spokesman said: "The incest allegations have been rigorously and thoroughly investigated, supported by the Sheffield safeguarding children's board and partner agencies."An independent review has been announced by Sheffield council, examining the work of agencies involved. South Yorkshire police will support the review. It would be inappropriate to comment further."The sister-in-law added that the family were always moving around in case their secret came out.Concerns were raised when the oldest daughter's school became suspicious about her upbringing when she arrived for lessons hungry and covered in bruises at the age of 10.The family said the deputy headteacher sent a letter voicing concerns home to an aunt, who had a child at the school as well, and she called police.But when staff raised the matter, the father pulled his daughters out of school and moved the family to another area.
