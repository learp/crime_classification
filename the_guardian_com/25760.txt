Kate and Gerry McCann were due to fly home to Britain this morning amid mounting speculation that they were involved in the disappearance and possible death of their daughter, Madeleine.It is believed the McCanns fear they could be charged with their daughter's death after they were named as official suspects this week by Portuguese police. But sources close to the investigation told The Observer that DNA evidence that led to the couple being considered suspects was incomplete and not a perfect match to their daughter.Although evidence from blood found on the floor of the family's holiday flat was said to be 'very strong', it was not conclusive.The first authoritative account of the sudden change of direction in the search for the missing four-year-old came last night from a senior source who is close to both the British and Portuguese police teams.In a dramatic sign of the growing tension surrounding the fast-moving investigation, it also emerged that family and friends of the McCanns were in contact with the Foreign Office in the hope of securing support from the Foreign Secretary, David Miliband.The McCanns spoke to Miliband a month ago, and family sources said he had been 'very supportive'. Now, they are hoping he might help head off any decision to lay charges against the McCanns on the basis of what one relative branded as 'repulsive' suggestions they were involved in their daughter's disappearance.Revealing the details behind the decision to shift the focus of the investigation onto the McCanns, the source said that in addition to the blood at the holiday flat, DNA evidence had been found in a car rented by the McCanns more than two weeks after Madeleine went missing.He said that while both samples had matched Madeleine's DNA, since they had degraded over time, this was based on an incomplete picture - only 15 of the available 20 genetic markers usually used for such analysis were found: 'Nineteen out of 20 is what we consider conclusive. In this case, they could extract only 15 - but all of the 15 exactly matched Madeleine's DNA.' He also dismissed as 'simply wrong' recent media reports that blood had been found in the car.He said the Portuguese police were taking the sample recovered from the flat seriously - in part because of 'contradictions and changes' in the accounts given by the McCanns and their friends of what happened the night Madeleine disappeared.It was the arrival last week of the DNA test results from Britain's Forensic Science Service laboratory in Birmingham that prompted Portuguese police to call in the girl's parents for questioning - and the decision, confirmed yesterday morning, to name both of them as arguidos, or formal suspects.The source said the DNA from the rental car had come from the interior of the vehicle and not from blood. Given the passage of time, it 'could have come from any item, [such as] clothing, which Madeleine had contact with before she went missing'.But the key sample, he said, came from blood found in the flat where the family was staying at the Mark Warner resort in Praia da Luz. 'It was a small quantity and was found on the floor, which had been washed a number of times since Madeleine's disappearance,' he said.The source added that it was the 'very strong' probability from the DNA results of a direct match with Madeleine that convinced police to put 'detailed and specific questions' to her parents'. Their answers 'did not provide a satisfactory explanation, which is why it became virtually inevitable under the Portuguese legal system that they would be named arguidos before further questioning'.Amid the shock of the shift in the investigation and alarm over the possibility of formal charges, the McCanns' family and closest friends yesterday rallied in support. One friend, describing the 'ordeal' of hours of police questioning on Friday and Saturday, remarked last night: 'They did not give Portuguese police the satisfaction of crying.'Kate McCann's uncle, Brian Kennedy, said: 'We still say as a family and friends that this suggestion that in some way they were responsible for the death of Madeleine is just nonsense, pure and simple.'Portuguese police, meanwhile, last night described as 'absolutely absurd' reports that Kate McCann was offered a plea bargain during questioning should she admit to the accidental death of her daughter.The McCanns' Portuguese lawyer, Carlos Pinto de Abreu, said that the newspaper reports were due to a 'misunderstanding' that had arisen during questioning.
