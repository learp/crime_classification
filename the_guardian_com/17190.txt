Crime dramas such as CSI and Waking the Dead may have helped fuel a rise of nearly a third in the number of students taking degree courses in forensic and archaeological science.The explosion in fictional and documentary screen portrayals of scientific analysis of crime scenes and cold case reviews has coincided with a 32.4% increase in undergraduates, figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency revealed yesterday.Nearly 5,750 students were following such courses last year, and though this was lower than the 11,045 following chemistry or 9,348 doing physics, the growth dwarfed the 2% and 0.9% rise in these more traditional subjects. Overall numbers of undergraduates in the UK went up 3.3%, with only computer science and astronomy showing big drops."We don't know the definite cause," said Brian Emsley, of the Royal Society of Chemistry. "But there is a rise in programmes like Waking the Dead and CSI and there is a sort of glamour involved."We don't want to knock it because chemistry is part of it. But it would be useful to know how many jobs there are in forensic science. We point to the number of jobs there are out there for [people on] chemistry courses, not only in science. Because they have a command of numeracy, mass data handling and analytic skills, they also go into banking, insurance and the City."But other figures suggest the television gloss of fingerprinting, blood analysis and weapons analysis is wearing off. Applications for forensic courses fell this year by just over 4%, while those for physics and chemistry went up by 12.2% and 11.3%.
