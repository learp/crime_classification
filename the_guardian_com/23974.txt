The police are sometimes accused of being invisible when you really need them, but Scotland Yard is set to take the maxim to new heights after hiring a magician to perform two 'magic shows' for senior officers.Michael Vincent, a former postman who has appeared on Jim'll Fix It and the Paul Daniels Magic Show, will perform a range of card tricks and illusions in front of an audience of chief superintendents in an effort to boost confidence and encourage leadership skills.The two five-hour courses will cost Â£3,000 and are intended to help officers build better relations with members of the public.Mr Vincent, a former magician of the year, said he will use illusions as a metaphor for real life situations when he performs for the officers at the London Chamber of Commerce on May 17 and 24.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'This trial event uses the communication skills learned by a professional magician to encourage delegates to develop their own abilities to communicate and develop rapport.' But not everybody appears so convinced. Dave Rodgers, vice-chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: 'We all love a magic trick, but will bobbies be pulling rabbits out of helmets or making poodles out of balloons? The Met needs to get value for money and should think carefully about where it is spent.'Norman Brennan, a police officer and spokesman for the pressure group Protect the Protectors, said: 'Perhaps he could make several thousand more police officers appear on the streets of the capital to help combat the number of burglaries and robberies and help us to protect the public.' The training course, entitled the Magic of Networking, was suggested by a Met worker who watched the show and recommended it to superiors. Mr Vincent, 37, who has performed for, among others, Muhammad Ali, will demonstrate a number of illusions, including one involving mixing oil with water and a trick in which rope is cut in half and then put back together again.
