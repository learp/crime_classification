The former glam rock star Gary Glitter today lost his appeal against a three-year prison sentence in Vietnam for sexually molesting two girls."No justice here in Vietnam," the 62-year-old singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd, shouted at reporters as he left the courtroom in Ho Chi Minh City. "They did not listen to the defence at all."Glitter was sentenced in March following a day-long trial which heard that he had kissed and fondled girls identified only as "D", aged 11, and "Ng", aged 10.Lawyers for the singer, who has consistently maintained his innocence and claims he is the victim of a media conspiracy, had lodged an appeal. This was turned down today by a panel of three judges."The appeal court has decided not to accept the appeal," said the judge Truong Vinh Thuy. "The appeal court confirms the sentence of three years. The appeal court decided to expel the accused after serving the sentence."Glitter could be eligible for parole less than a year from now, having been kept in Phuoc Co prison since being arrested in November in Ho Chi Minh City as he was about to board a flight out of Vietnam.After serving his sentence Glitter will be deported to Britain, where he was jailed for two months in 1999 after admitting possessing a collection of 4,000 photographs of children being abused.
