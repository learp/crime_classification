A suspected drugs trafficker who claimed that an ice cream van and other small businesses had earned him three homes and a fleet of luxury cars has become one of the biggest victims of criminal assets recovery law.A painstaking audit of Andrew Pickering's accounts by police in Middlesbrough and the Asset Recoveries Agency convinced a judge that the property, along with jewellery, expensive furnishings and several bank accounts could only have come from the proceeds of crime.Almost £650,000 in assets will be confiscated from Pickering, 38, and sold partly to finance extra policing on Teesside, where he was accused four years ago of belonging to a cartel of local drugs barons. He was acquitted of trafficking class A drugs a year later, but Cleveland police turned to the Proceeds of Crime Act instead.The seizure authorised by Mr Justice Coulson at the royal courts of justice in London includes Pickering's home in the choice Nunthorpe area of Middlesbrough, two smaller rented houses in the town centre, all their furnishings, and cars including a BMW M3 coupe.His ice cream van was on hire and is therefore not affected.Det Chief Supt Mark Braithwaite, the head of crime for Cleveland police who organised the joint operation, said that the verdict was a huge fillip for the force's newly launched tip-off operation, Too Much Bling? Give Us A Ring. Neighbours are being encouraged to use anonymous phone lines to alert police to those suspected of profiting from crime.Braithwaite said: "Pickering carried out his activities under the guise of a respectable businessman, but the court was satisfied that the wealth he amassed could only have been acquired through illegal means. The lifestyle he led was typical of the type of person the Too Much Bling campaign is aimed at."He drove high-powered cars, furnished his home with expensive items and effectively lived in the lap of luxury in an affluent area. Yet his legal income did not support this lifestyle."To those intent on profiting from the proceeds of crime let me say this: we are coming after you and we will hit you where it hurts, in the pocket."The court heard that Pickering's legal annual income from his ice cream business and car dealing had fallen to as low as £7,500 in the previous eight years.He had also run a pub for a time but his maximum earnings had not risen higher than £30,000.The judge heard that the houses and cars had been fitted with top-of-the-range gadgets and extras whose cost far exceeded Pickering's declared income. He issued an order authorising seizure of goods to the value of £648,372, under civil legislation which requires a lower standard of proof than the criminal courts.The chair of Cleveland police authority, Dave McLuckie, said after the verdict: "Even though he was acquitted in the criminal trial, it is quite clear that there was enough evidence there to prove that he was unable to legitimately fund his lifestyle."This sends out a clear message to people who don't earn their money in a bona fide way - that we will do everything in our capacity to seize their assets. The success of the case means that a third of the recovered money will return to the force to be invested in frontline policing."
