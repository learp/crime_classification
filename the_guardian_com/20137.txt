The father of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by a police marksman, was so overwhelmed by grief after his son died that he gave up his "fight" against cancer, an inquest has heard.One of the lawyers for the family, Leslie Thomas, read a statement by Mr Duggan's mother, Pamela, at the inquest into his death.She went into the witness box at the royal courts of justice to confirm that the contents of the document were correct, including her description of the impact on Duggan's father, Bruno Hall.Pamela Duggan said: "Bruno passed away on 7 July 2012, some 11 months after Mark was tragically killed. In my mind, I believe this was the final straw for him as the grief was so intense."When Mark died, Bruno stopped talking and would not say anything to anybody except, 'They killed my son, they killed my boy.' I believe it completely finished Bruno, and he didn't have the will or the strength to fight the cancer. He just gave up."She said Mark's four children had become "anxious" since their father's death.Her statement went on: "As a mother, you think you're going to go before your child; you never think your child will go before you. No mother deserves to bury their child. I am so confused, and I don't understand why this has happened to me and my family."Mark may not have been an angel, but I do not believe he should have died in the way he did."The jury heard that on the day Mark Duggan, 29, was killed, his former girlfriend Semone had called his aunt Carole, "screaming frantically".He was shot when a taxi he was travelling in was stopped by armed police in Tottenham, north London, in August 2011.Initially, his family was wrongly told that he had been taken to hospital, and media reports suggested an Asian man had died.Pamela Duggan said she "went into total shock" when she heard the news, and her GP had put her on Valium, anti-depressants and sleeping tablets."They have helped a little, although I still find myself waiting for Mark to walk through the door," she said in her statement.The inquest continues.
