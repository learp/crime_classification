To the inmates of Perth prison there can be little architectural merit in the ancient bricks and mortar that surround them; prisoners in parts of the A-listed structure still have to slop out each morning.However, the 19th century building is considered so important to Scotland's heritage that prison bosses are being stopped from knocking it down to make way for a more modern facility. The Scottish prison service wants to replace the prison's C-wing with a 21st century facility, complete with toilets in the cells. But architectural campaigners have opposed the plans, because the building has listed status. Perth and Kinross council's development control committee recently refused an application to knock down C Hall, the former governor's house and a section of the original prison wall, after conservationists said the structures were historically and architecturally important. C Hall was built to house prisoners from the Napoleonic wars. "I believe slopping out is absolutely barbaric," said architectural campaigner Bill Beaton. "But to simply propose that the building is knocked down in order to provide sanitation and electric power in each cell, is quite preposterous." Tom Fox, of the SPS, said previous experience showed that trying to refurbish historic jails brought a host of problems. His chief executive, Tom Cameron, has said the jail might have to be closed if the issue cannot be resolved, because he could not justify spending huge sums of money to create a historic monument.
