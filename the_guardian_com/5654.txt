Three people are expected to appear before Lancaster magistrates today in connection with the Morecambe Bay tragedy which claimed the lives of 21 Chinese cocklers in February, Lancashire police said.The three people - two men and a woman, all from Liverpool - were charged in the early hours of this morning with various offences. The charges included manslaughter, conspiracy to commit facilitation and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Lin Liang Ren, 27, is charged with manslaughter, conspiracy to commit facilitation and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Zhao Qing Xiao, 19, also known as Eva, is charged with conspiracy to commit facilitation and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Lin Mu Yong, 29, is charged with conspiracy to commit facilitation. All three had been arrested earlier in the year and released on bail for further inquiries. They were rearrested yesterday in the Liverpool area. Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell, leading the inquiry, said: "This does not signal the end of the investigation, as a number of other people remain on police bail." Mr Gradwell added: "Our inquiries into exactly what happened on the night of February 5, and into the events leading up to this tragedy are very much the focus of a detailed criminal investigation." The 21 cocklers died after becoming stranded on sand banks and cut off from the shore by a fast-rising tide. Police believe a total of 23 people drowned after they became trapped while working at Hest Bank, near Morecambe, but officers have so far recovered only 21 bodies. An inquest into the deaths was opened and adjourned last week in Lancaster, when the identities of the victims were announced. At the inquest, police told how the victims were identified by means of good luck charms, watches, wallets, photos and jewellery which were found on their bodies.
