The national gun amnesty has yielded its most bizarre weapon: an apparently homemade, fully working 3ft cannon.It fires two and a half-inch cannon balls and arched many an eyebrow when its unnamed owners trundled it into Castle Vale police station in Birmingham on Monday. A spokesman for West Midlands police said yesterday that the cannon, which is set on a carriage and painted a camouflage green, was "probably the strangest item we've had handed in" although they did earlier receive a gun fashioned into a walking stick. The force, which initiated the scheme, also received a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. Merseyside police and officers in Aberdare, south Wales, both received rocket launchers, an AK-47 appeared in Scotland, and hand grenades were produced at a station in Cumbria. Nationally more than 17,000 weapons had been handed in by the third week of the month-long amnesty, which ends today. The fatal shootings of Letisha Shakespeare, 17, and Charlene Ellis, 18, at a New Year party in Aston, Birmingham, prompted the amnesty. The teenagers were cut down by bullets believed to be from an automatic weapon. The final haul is expected to exceed 20,000 weapons and more than half a million rounds of ammunition, which compared with 23,000 firearms and and 700,000 rounds of ammunition in the last amnesty in 1996, after the Dunblane massacre.
