Nineteen foreign women thought to have been tricked into becoming prostitutes were rescued during a raid last night, police said today.West Midlands police said a special task force of female officers raided Cuddles massage parlour in Birmingham to free the women.A safe was found in the premises containing a number of passports and a force spokesman said it was suspected the women had been "tricked into the sex industry".Two people, believed to be customers, were detained during the operation, which started at around 7pm. A sawn-off shotgun was recovered.Three people were arrested including the owner of the premises, a 50-year-old man from Stourbridge, Birmingham, and two managers, a 50-year-old woman and a 22-year-old man. The owner's 4x4 Mercedes was also seized.West Midlands police originally thought all of the women were from eastern Europe, but later said they came from Latvia, Poland, Japan, Hong Kong, Italy, Greece, and Turkey."The women were locked into the venue during the evening to work and taken away during the day and locked in a house," a police spokesman said.It was reported that the back of premises, on Hagley Road, was protected by an electric fence.Amnesty International welcomed today's raid but called on the British government to do more to protect victims of trafficking. The human rights group said the Sexual Offences Act and the Asylum and Immigration Act, both of which came into force last year, were helping police to catch and prosecute traffickers but it urged ministers to do more.Spokeswoman Sarah Green said there was no protection in law for victims of trafficking who were classed as illegal immigrants and deported."Most are deported without any care or support or assessment of the risks they face if sent back. Communities might not want these women back if they know what has happened to them and there is evidence of people being re-trafficked ... they are thrown back into the fire," she said.Ms Green appealed to the government to sign up to the Council of Europe's convention on action against trafficking in human beings. She said the convention gave victims the right to emergency housing and medical care and a temporary residence permit in the country they found themselves in."There's is no reason why Britain should not sign up," she said.Detectives have warned of a growing influx of eastern European prostitutes, especially in London. Many of the women are forced to have sex for as little as Â£30 a time.It has become a common tactic for pimps and traffickers to trick women into working in brothels under the illusion that they were taking jobs as waitresses, au pairs or dancers.Some of the trafficked women are raped, beaten and threatened, and made to have sex with up to 40 men a day. It is not unusual for the pimps and traffickers to take almost all of the money they earn.Women are often told they have to work to pay off inflated or invented debts created to keep them trapped, which sometimes amount to tens of thousands of pounds. If the traffickers are from the same country of origin, police say it is easy for them to convince the women they could murder their families if they ran away or went to the police.Analysts say that European Union expansion has made it easier to bring the women to the UK as they can arrive at any port or airport with passports in their own names.Around 80% of the thousands of prostitutes who work in London's sex industry are foreign nationals, most of them from eastern Europe and south-east Asia.Anna Johansson of the Poppy Project, a scheme which provides support to women trafficked into prostitution, told the Guardian earlier this year that she was aware of more women from Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and the Czech Republic being trafficked.Ms Johansson said she was concerned about the rising number of foreign women forced to provide very cheap, unprotected and "rough" sex, which was forcing many other prostitutes to offer similar services.
