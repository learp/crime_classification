Victims of miscarriages of justice will have to prove their innocence in future or endure damaged reputations, human rights groups and Labour's parliamentary frontbench are warning.None of the Birmingham Six or Guildford Four, who spent more than 10 years in jail having been wrongfully convicted of pub bombings in the 1970s, would be entitled to payments under government reforms that will narrow the test for compensation, according to opponents.Proposed changes attached to the antisocial behaviour, crime and policing bill governing compensation – due to come before the Commons on Monday – could be ruled illegal by the courts, it is also claimed.The government's amendment to section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 would redefine the compensation test for a miscarriage of justice, limiting it to 'if and only if the new or newly discovered fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that the person was innocent of the offence'.Inserting the need to demonstrate the claimant's innocence shifts the burden of proof too far, according to critics including the civil rights groups Justice and Liberty, the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, and shadow attorney Emily Thornberry as well as prominent Sinn Féin politicians.An amendment has been tabled for Monday's Commons debate by the Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn, signed by among others the Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Jack Dromey, which would remove any reference to being 'innocent of the offence' and instead define a miscarriage of justice as being when 'no reasonable court properly directed as to the law, could convict on the evidence now to be considered'.The government maintains its new version reverses the impact of recent court judgments, returning the definition to what it was before May 2011 when it says the test was only "clear innocence". Figures provided by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) accompanying the bill show that annual compensation paid out for miscarriages of justice has more than doubled from £6.2m in 2001-02 to £13.2m in 2011-12. Only two or three applications out of around 40 made every year are found to be eligible for compensation.Jodie Blackstock, the director of criminal justice at the civil rights group Justice, said the government's new test may contravene the European convention on human rights, which provides for the presumption of innocence. In a report published last week, parliament's own joint committee on human rights also warned that in its view the government's new clause was "incompatible" with the convention.Blackstock added: "There are already very few people receiving compensation once they have been acquitted. Many of these people have spent significant periods in prison and have endured hardship, stigma and deprivation as the result of wrongful conviction. It is unfair and unreasonable to deny them compensation for that treatment."If compensation is not awarded following the quashing of a conviction because the secretary of state is not satisfied of the applicant's innocence, this will be a clear interference with the presumption of innocence that the person is entitled to."Liberty said the government's bill would would significantly restrict the availability of compensation for miscarriages of justice and undermine the existing presumption of innocence unless a defendant was proved guilty.Emily Thornberry MP said: "Under these proposals, the Birmingham Six would not only fail to qualify for compensation but their ordeal would not even be recognised as a miscarriage of justice. After wrongly wasting 16 years of their lives in prison, they would have to re-open their own cold case, New Tricks style, and provide fresh evidence that proved their innocence beyond reasonable doubt."The Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy said: "It is hard to believe that the Tory-led coalition is planning to further penalise those who have already suffered a miscarriage of justice. What liberal society could accept this proposed change, which goes against the key principle of the presumption of innocence?"An MoJ spokesperson said: "We are clarifying the law to create, for the first time, a statutory definition of a miscarriage of justice that is clear and easy to understand. This will bring to an end the current reliance on case law that is open to interpretation and leads to a large number of unsuccessful judicial reviews, which are expensive to taxpayers and can cause great distress to those involved."
