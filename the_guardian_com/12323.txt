An investigation into the republican dissident murder of a Catholic police recruit in Northern Ireland has widened to north-west England, it has emerged.The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has confirmed that searches have been carried out in Cumbria as part of an investigation into the killing of Constable Ronan Kerr in April 2011.A PSNI spokesman said further searches were also being conducted in Omagh, the County Tyrone town where the 25-year-old police officer died after a booby-trap bomb exploded in his car.In a statement, the PSNI said: "Detectives from the PSNI's serious crime branch, with assistance from officers in Cumbria Constabulary and the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, are conducting a number of searches in Northern Ireland and north-west England."The search activity is in connection with the wider investigation into the murder of PSNI Constable Ronan Kerr in April 2011 and linked incidents."The terror group behind his murder was an independent republican unit which used to belong to the East Tyrone Brigade of the Provisional IRA. Members of this unit are also thought to have been involved in the murder this month of the prison officer David Black. The terror unit has since merged into an alliance with the Real IRA and other factions to form the so-called New IRA.Kerr was the second PSNI officer targeted and killed by republican paramilitaries opposed to the peace process. The Ulster Unionist party (UUP) will meet the PSNI chief constable, Matt Baggott, later to discuss the security situation.The UUP leader, Mike Nesbitt, and party security spokesman, Tom Elliott, say there is "grave concern" over the threat from dissident republican factions.They point out that as well as killing Black, anti-ceasefire republicans almost killed an off-duty soldier in west Belfast this month with a booby-trap bomb.Nesbitt added that they would also be meeting Northern Ireland's justice minister, David Ford, next week to raise their concerns.He said: "We will impress on both the chief constable and justice minister that there is an absolute need to have a proper security plan in place that will deal with the increased terrorist activity throughout Northern Ireland."
