A self-styled lord was jailed for eight years today for his part in a "bold and sophisticated" attempt to hack into City bank accounts and siphon off £229m.Hugh Rodley, 61, teamed up with a gang of international cyber raiders to target the London offices of the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.Rodley styled himself Lord Hugh Rodley after purchasing a lord of the manor title, but has now been branded the 'Lord of Fraud'.He was described by the judge at London's Snaresbrook crown court as the "chief executive" of the scam, presiding over a complicated array of overseas front companies and accounts to launder the money.Rodley, who chose not to give evidence during the trial, used others, including David Nash, a Soho sex shop owner, as fronts, to distance himself from the operation, while an insider at the bank unlocked its London offices so that hackers – using security cards belonging to other staff – could make surreptitious night-time visits.Rodley also tampered with CCTV cameras and severed cables, but his bid to prevent the gang's illicit activities being recorded proved unsuccessful when recovered footage showed him laughing and joking with his fellow conspirators.Once inside the bank the two computer experts used pirated software to "corrupt" the bank's system, record the keystrokes of staff and reveal user names and passwords.That provided access to the accounts of a number of companies including Toshiba International, Nomura Asset Management, Mitsui OSK Lines and Sumitomo Chemical UK.Repeated attempts followed to wire up to €13.9m at a time around the world, but errors in filling out electronic forms prevented the transfers going through.If successful, it would have been the largest bank raid ever.Rodley, 61, who lives in a £2m house near Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to transfer criminal property.While in prison Rodley, who underwent triple heart bypass surgery in 2004, will be subject to a financial reporting order requiring him to regularly update the authorities on his financial position.Nash, from Durrington, West Sussex, who "fronted" some of the bank accounts, was sentenced to three years for conspiracy to transfer criminal property.Three other gang members admitted conspiracy to steal. Bank insider and security supervisor Kevin O'Donoghue, 34, from Birmingham, was sentenced to four years, four months, a Belgian computer expert, Jan Van Osselaer, 32, was sentenced to three and a half years, and his "recruiter", Gilles Poelvoorde, from France was sentenced, in his absence, to four years.Another man, Bernard Davies, 74, had been due to stand trial with the others but he committed suicide last month.
