A police officer investigating the murderer Jeremy Bamber was told by a senior detective to add crucial hand swabs to a batch of items sent to the forensic science laboratory, despite their already being rejected as contaminated, the court of appeal heard yesterday.Scientists who analysed the swabs - taken from the body of Sheila Caffell, Bamber's sister, and one of his five victims - were unaware they had already dismissed them as forensically unsound as they tested if they contained traces of lead which would indicate she had handled the murder weapon and so was the killer. And the detective who received the exhibit at the laboratory said it had every appearance of being fresh evidence - an impression compounded since the form identifying it had been numbered inaccurately. The way the "contaminated" swabs made their way back into the lab was explored at length by Bamber's QC, Michael Turner, as he argued it was part of a "series of deceits" that cast doubt on the police investigation and was one of 15 grounds for appeal. Bamber, now 41, was convicted 16 years ago of shooting his parents Nevill and June, his adoptive sister, and her six-year-old twin sons, at White House Farm, in Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex, in order to inherit a Â£500,000 fortune. But he has consistently argued his sister, a model known as "Bambi" with a history of mental illness, killed her family before turning the .22 semi-automatic rifle on herself. Yesterday, Lord Justice Kay, sitting with Mr Justice Wright and Mr Justice Henriques, heard Sergeant Neil Davidson say he had resubmitted the swabs to the lab in Huntingdon, after receiving an urgent phone call from the head of scenes of crime, Detective Chief Inspector Ian Wright, whom the court has heard had "not been happy" when they were rejected. Sgt Davidson said the senior detective did not tell him they had been spurned or even that they were being resubmitted, and so he had not conveyed this on the form attached to the exhibit, which he had hastily written. The appeal continues.
