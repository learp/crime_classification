Police in Gateshead have arrested six people on suspicion of inciting racial hatred after a video appearing to show Qur'ans being burned appeared on the internet.Officers from Northumbria police detained two men on 15 September and four more yesterday, a force spokesman said. All six have been bailed pending further inquiries."The arrests followed the burning of what are believed to have been two Qur'ans in Gateshead on 11 September," the spokesman said. "The incident was recorded and a video placed on the internet."In a video posted on YouTube, six young men in hooded tops and scarves can be seen pouring petrol on a book and setting it alight, before burning another.On the video, which appeared to have been filmed behind a pub, they cheer as the first book bursts into flames.Northumbria police said the men were not arrested for watching or distributing the video, but on suspicion of burning the Qur'an.Gateshead council and the force issued a joint statement to stress that community relations in the area were good. It said: "The kind of behaviour displayed in this video is not at all representative of our community as a whole."Our community is one of mutual respect and we continue to work together with community leaders, residents and people of all faiths and beliefs to maintain good community relations."The arrests come after Florida-based pastor Terry Jones sparked an international outcry by threatening to burn the Islamic holy book on September 11. He did not go ahead with the plan.
