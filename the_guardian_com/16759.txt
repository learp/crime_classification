Detectives investigating the murder of the Hull jobcentre worker Joanne Nelson confirmed yesterday that a body found in woodland is that of the 22-year-old, who went missing on Valentine's Day. A postmortem examination revealed the cause of death to be "manual strangulation". The body was found concealed in woodland a mile north of Brandsby, near Easingwold in the Howardian hills, North Yorkshire, at 4pm on Thursday. It was taken to a mortuary where a postmortem was carried out by the Home Office pathologist Professor Christopher Milroy. The body was found by Detective Superintendent Ray Higgins, who is leading the murder inquiry, and Detective Constable Phil Gadd, both of the Humberside police. The two officers were passing a remote woodland track at Brandsby when they saw a tube metal gate. The police had asked the public to look out for just such a gate at the beginning of their inquiry. The officers went into the wood and found the woman's body concealed by branches. The search for Miss Nelson's body involved hundreds of police officers, specialist rescue teams, soldiers and volunteers who scoured huge tracts of east and north Yorkshire. Heavy snow hampered the earlier searches and Det Supt Higgins eventually scaled down the operation, putting smaller teams to work on specific leads. Miss Nelson's wood machinist boyfriend, Paul Dyson, 30, was remanded in custody at Hull crown court last month, charged with her murder. He is due back in court on May 4. Miss Nelson's family said in a statement last night: "We are so relieved to finally have our darling daughter Joanne back. "We want to thank everyone who called the police to help. We have to come to terms with this now ... and grieve alone as a family."
