Last week an 18-year-old homeless man was jailed for life for setting fire to two wheelie bins in north Devon. The 'indeterminate sentence' - which will cost the taxpayer the best part of Â£100,000 a year - was handed down to Christopher Brown after he threatened to commit more crimes if released. The same week, 24-year-old Damien Hanson was found guilty of the murder of banker John Monckton. Hanson, a serial offender who had been jailed for attempted murder, was out of prison on licence, despite the fact he was thought to pose a high risk of reoffending.It is difficult to square these two cases. In the former, we have a man in need of mental help, not prison. In the latter, we have an apparent failure on the part of the authorities to assess an evident threat to the public.What links the two is a disproportionate assessment of the risk each man poses. Much of the blame lies in a lack of resources. Mental health services have long suffered from under-investment. The result is many with mental health problems receive inadequate treatment, creating a vortex of problems which end in prison sentences. Currently some 5,000 people in Britain's prisons have profound mental health problems.Likewise, the problems facing a severely overstretched London probation service mean inadequate supervision of criminals out on licence. As we report today, an alarming 400 of the service's 3,000 positions are currently unfilled. The government must decide what value it places on fewer Browns and Hansons entering - and re-entering - the prison population. As with everything in life, you get what you pay for. Probation and mental health services are no exception.
