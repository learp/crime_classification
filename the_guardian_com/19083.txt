Black people are eight times more likely to be stopped by police than white people, a significant rise on two years ago, figures showed today.Of the 714,000 stop and searches recorded in England and Wales during 2001/2002, 12% were of black people, 6% Asians and 1% other ethnic minorities.The figures show the over representation of blacks has increased since the aftermath of the 1999 Stephen Lawrence inquiry, when they were five times more likely to be stopped than whites.Compared with 2000/2001, the number of stops and searches conducted by the Metropolitan police rose 8% for whites, 30% for blacks and 40% for Asians.The rest of England and Wales showed 2% fewer whites were stopped and searched, while there was a 6% rise for blacks and a 16% rise for Asians.Asians are now three times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, the Home Office figures showed.Black people were also four times more likely to be arrested than whites or other ethnic minority groups.Ravi Chand, the president of the National Black Police Association, said: "It's been alarming levels for the last number of years, and very little seems to have been done to address the real concerns the black community has."The figures indicate to us at this stage that the biggest drop in stop and search is for white [people]," he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.Home Office minister John Denham said a new government unit being set up to examine why the figures are disproportionate would "flush out" racism and discrimination in the criminal justice system.He also announced that officers in Merseyside, Nottingham, Sussex, West Midlands, West Yorkshire, North Wales and the Metropolitan police will begin issuing certificates to every person they stop in the street from April next year even if they do not search them.The procedure was recommended in the Lawrence inquiry to help avoid disproportionate stopping of blacks and Asians.But he warned against people jumping to the conclusion that the figures showed there was racism within the police or indicated levels of criminality in particular communities."We have got to move the debate beyond the sterile argument there usually is whenever you have figures about race and the criminal justice system, with one set of people saying 'Well it's all about criminality isn't it?' and the other set of people saying 'It's all about racism'."We know for example that ethnic minority people are less likely to be satisfied with the police response if they are victims of crime."We want to get to grips with a whole series of issues about the different experiences of black and ethnic minority people in the criminal justice system."All the race statistics contrast with the official breakdown of race in the population of England and Wales, which puts the proportion of blacks at 2%, Asians at 3% and other ethnic minority groups at 1%.
