A gambling-mad accountant was able to pocket £9m from under his bosses' noses because it was nothing more than "peanuts" to them, Southwark crown court in London heard yesterday.Wing Kit Chu's ever larger thefts to fund his addiction "simply slipped by unnoticed" next to the £800m turnover of engineering giant Charter plc. His actions only came to light after he handed in his notice and was asked to help a replacement to reconcile some figures, the court was told. After repeatedly failing to explain the inconsistencies, he sent a late-night email to one of his superiors, in effect confessing his guilt, the court was told. Chu, 32, pleaded guilty to 28 counts of theft between January 2000 and August 2004. He asked for 74 similar offences to be taken into consideration. Twenty-eight false accounting charges, which he denied, were not proceeded with. The case was adjourned until today for sentencing.
