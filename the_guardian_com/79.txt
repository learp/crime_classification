The British computer hacker Gary McKinnon will learn today whether he is to be extradited to the US where he could face a sentence of up to 60 years in a high security prison.The high court will deliver judgments in two judicial reviews, one against the director of public prosecutions and the other against the home secretary, that will determine the fate of the 43-year-old who has Asperger's syndrome.McKinnon has admitted hacking into the computer systems of the US defence department and Nasa, but a high-profile campaign backed by leading politicians and celebrities has argued his obsessions led to his misguided hacking activities from his flat in Wood Green, north London, and that he should be tried in Britain.His mother Janis Sharp, who has pledged not to "give up this fight until the government intervenes to protect my vulnerable son", was yesterday using her Twitter account to thank supporters for their good wishes prior to today's court rulings.If the judicial reviews go against McKinnon it could prove the end of the legal road, although his lawyers will be scanning the judgments to see if there is scope for a further appeal to the new supreme court justices, who are to replace the law lords.Alan Johnson, the home secretary, is unlikely to halt the extradition if McKinnon's legal challenges are unsuccessful. He is not expected to take a different view from his predecessor Jacqui Smith, and believes a thorough assessment was carried out to ensure that the necessary extradition criteria had been met.The Free Gary campaign  has won the support of more than 100 MPs, been given vociferous backing by celebrities such as Bob Geldof, Chrissie Hynde, Barry Norman, Jilly Cooper and Julie Christie.The government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorist legislation, Lord Carlile, also intervened to say that prosecuting McKinnon in the US would be "cruel and unconscionable" because of his medical condition.Gordon Brown's wife Sarah met McKinnon's mother to express her concern, while the prime minister last week said: "Anybody who looks at this must be sympathetic to someone who suffers from Asperger's syndrome."McKinnon admitted hacking into 97 computers, leaving a message in US military systems saying: "I will continue to disrupt."The US government said repairs had cost $700,000 (Â£430,000) and the Crown Prosecution Service said his hacking activities were not random experiments in hacking, but a deliberate effort to breach US defence systems in 2001-02.McKinnon has challenged the decision by Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, not to put him on trial in Britain, arguing that extradition would have disastrous consequences, including possible psychosis and suicide because of his medical condition on the autistic spectrum.McKinnon has spoken about his fears, saying that he wakes every morning "feeling as though someone has taken a sledgehammer to my chest during the night".His lawyers argue that extradition arrangements between Britain and the US are imbalanced. Figures released this week to the Liberal Democrats in response to parliamentary questions revealed Britain has extradited twice as many criminal suspects to the US than those who have gone the other way.Suspects in the US are also 20% less likely to be extradited than those living in Britain, which critics say indicates Britons have "second-class status" when it comes to being sent for trial in the US.
