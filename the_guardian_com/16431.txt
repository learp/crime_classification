The riots that have struck parts of Britain could knock Britain's economic recovery off course and force many small companies into bankruptcy, Labour MP Chuka Umunna warned on Wednesday.Umunna, the shadow business minister, said the UK's services sector had been hurt by the looting that began in London and spread to other cities in recent days. The MP for Streatham told Bloomberg TV he was "incredibly concerned" by the economic cost of the disruption."A large proportion of our GDP comes from services … [The services sector] has been massively dented, and that will have had an effect on the whole economy," Umunna said. Services makes up around three-quarters of total UK GDP, which grew by just 0.2% in the last three months.Umunna's comments came as Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, said he was "deeply worried and shocked" by recent events. Speaking as the Bank unveiled its latest inflation and growth forecasts, King said he was "as shocked and appalled" as anyone by the riots.King argued that it was too early for him, or anyone else, to speculate on the root causes of the troubles. He did suggest, though, that he did not believe that recent austerity cuts alone could be blamed."Four times as many jobs have been created by the private sector this year than have been lost in the public sector," he told economics journalists in London.Insurers have warned that the cost of the rioting has already reached £100m, before Manchester and Gloucester were added to the roll call of violence.Umunna urged the government, business leaders and the insurance industry to work together to ensure that insurance claims are processed urgently."Many of these small firms were already struggling. If their claims are not processed quickly, then they could go to the wall," he predicted.Umunna also said that HM Revenue and Customs should be lenient with firms who have seen vital documents damaged or destroyed by looters, which may leaving them unable to submit tax forms.Many large retailers have also suffered, with certain chains seemingly being targeted for violence. The British Retail Consortium, which represents the industry, told home secretary Theresa May of their concerns on Tuesday night."I feel like being physically sick. The way it has gone viral is so depressing," said Peter Cowgill, the executive chairman of JD Sports, according to the Daily Telegraph.Nick Bubb, retail analyst at Arden Partners, pointed out that the violence came at a bad time for the sector, when sales were already tight."Retailers of 'big-ticket' goods are having a hard enough time already without the pictures of rioters simply looting such items," he said.
