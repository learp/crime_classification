The government's plans to rehabilitate offenders are being undermined by serious flaws in the provision of basic skills training, according to a new report.The Probation Service is failing to ensure that offenders can read, write and do basic maths, harming their chances of finding work and not reoffending, the Adult Learning Inspectorate (ALI) found.ALI, which inspects education and training for young people and adults, found that many probation staff have a poor understanding of the basic skills needs of ex-offenders.Probation staff were referring few offenders for basic skills tuition and many failed to adequately monitor class attendance. While the inspectorate found many examples of good practice, it warned that much of the training provided to offenders has failed to get to grips with their specific learning needs.The methods used to assess the learning needs of offenders do not adequately gauge their reading ability, understanding of numeracy or problems such as dyslexia.The inspectors, who visited 15 probation areas in England and two in Wales, said that learning was "often disrupted or sporadic" with many offenders referred for training too late to gain a qualification before the end of their supervision order.ALI also criticised Home Office targets for placing greater emphasis on offenders gaining formal qualifications, rather than finding a job and avoiding reoffending. It called on the Probation Service to develop more sophisticated ways to assess the learning needs of offenders and to make explicit links between improved literacy, numeracy and language skills and better employment prospects and reduced reoffending.But the inspectors said that the creation of the National Offender Management Service (Noms), which will bring together the prison and probation services, could potentially improve the provision of education and training for offenders.David Sherlock, chief inspector of ALI, said: "Progress in complex areas like criminal behaviour requires many different problems being addressed at the same time - housing, employment, drug misuse and long standing educational gaps all contribute towards offending. This report suggests that necessary strategic focus has been absent, but that the Noms should be the forum for all the specialist agencies to work together."A Noms spokesman said: "The government recognises the need to do better and has already put in place new arrangements to support improvements."
