Comedian and television presenter Justin Lee Collins, on trial for domestic and emotional abuse, has told a court that he has never hit anyone in his life.The 38-year-old is accused of slapping and harassing his ex-girlfriend, Anna Larke, during their nine-month relationship.Transcripts of police interviews Collins gave after his arrest were read to the jury at St Albans crown court. In them he told officers that Larke, a recovering alcoholic, was possessive and believed he was going to go off with other women.Larke has claimed Collins attacked her in their Miami hotel room in March 2011.In court, Collins said he had only ever slapped Larke to calm her down when she was self-harming, which he claimed she did, once gouging her wrists and threatening to commit suicide.He said that "she had a screaming fit" during a relapse in the hotel room, and continued: "She would have episodes and I would try to calm her down. She was saying 'You are going to hit me, you are going to hit me', and I was saying: 'What are you talking about?'"I have never hit anyone in my life. I don't know where what she was saying comes from."He then said that a man came to the hotel room to ask if "everything was all right".Collins, who was a regular host of Channel 4's The Friday Night Project, denies harassing Larke, a former video games public relations worker.The case continues.
