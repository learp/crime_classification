A man has been sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of strangling a vulnerable woman with her hair straighteners and then driving around with her body in the boot of his car for several days.Lee Nolan, 48, from Heywood in Greater Manchester, had denied murdering Katelyn Parker until halfway through his murder trial, when he changed his plea.His change of heart on Tuesday appeared to come after a second psychiatric report found that he was sane when he killed 24-year-old Parker at her home in August 2015. He originally pleaded guilty to manslaughter but not murder on grounds of diminished responsibility.Manchester crown court heard that Nolan, a drug-using drifter and alcoholic nicknamed “Mr Happy Days” for his cheerful demeanour, had befriended Parker, who had learning difficulties but was living independently with the help of social services in Rochdale.At Parker’s home he offered to do her hair and she refused, saying that “only gay men do hair”, apparently prompting Nolan to fly into a rage.On 13 August, one day after Parker was last seen alive by her support worker, Nolan went to see a friend, Melanie Ashton, and told her he had killed a woman after she made the “gay” remark.He then re-enacted how he had killed Ashton by wrapping the cord of her straighteners around her neck five times, causing her to suffocate, and described how he had bundled her body into a duvet and carried her to the boot of his car.The same day, Nolan told an acquaintance on Heywood’s Back O’The Moss estate that he had “killed two people and there was a body in the boot”.Later, Nolan picked a man up in his blue Nissan NX100 and attempted to buy cannabis from him. While they were in the car, Nolan bragged that he had killed a woman and that her body was in the boot. When the man expressed his disbelief, Nolan pulled down one of the rear seats in the car and revealed Parker’s body.He later told another friend he had killed two people at a party. After being arrested following a police chase, detectives found Parker’s body in the back of his abandoned car.When interviewed, Nolan told officers he had killed six people, then said he had six people on a “hitlist”, of whom he had killed three. Police carried out urgent inquiries before establishing that Nolan was lying.Sentencing him to life in prison with a minimum tariff of 18 years, the judge Mr Justice Turner said the fact that Nolan had wasted police time was an aggravating factor in his case.Turner said Nolan had shown a “chilling lack of remorse” in his deceitful boasts of being a mass murderer, and then in having the audacity to plead not guilty in court. The judge described Nolan as leading an “itinerant and chaotic lifestyle” and said he had taken a cocktail of psychotropic drugs and alcohol at the time of the murder. But he stressed that two independent psychiatrists had said they did not think any mental disorder could lead them to support a plea of diminished responsibility.The court heard on Tuesday that Nolan had 28 previous convictions for 95 offences, including public order offences, burglary and handling stolen goods.The judge said Parker was a “vulnerable, naive and innocent young woman with significant learning difficulties”, whose eagerness to please rendered her particularly vulnerable.She had been brought up by a single mother who led a chaotic lifestyle and died when she was 14, leaving her in the care of her maternal uncle, Jason Parker.In a victim impact statement read to court, Mr Parker described his niece as a “vibrant and loving woman” and said his family would never come to terms with their “senseless loss”.He wrote: “The headlines have described Katelyn as ‘the body in the boot’. Katelyn was much more than that. She was loved by her family and she in turn loved us. She was a loving and genuine girl who didn’t have a bad bone in her body.”Duncan Thorpe, the senior investigating officer, said: “What happened to Katelyn was a tragedy and her friends and family went through something that nobody ever should. I know the sentence passed here today won’t change what happened but I hope it will go some way to giving them all some form of closure.”
