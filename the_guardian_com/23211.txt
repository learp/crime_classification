French police are hunting for a gunman after shots were fired outside the headquarters of Société Générale in Paris following an earlier attack at the office of the leftwing daily newspaper Libération.A 27-year-old man was seriously injured when the gunman opened fire in the lobby of the newspaper office.A police official said the motive of the attacker, who was armed with a hunting rifle, was unclear."He walked in, fired twice and left," Libération's editorial manager, Fabrice Rousselot, told reporters.The deputy editor-in-chief, Fabrice Tassel, said in a tweet that the victim, a photographer's assistant, was fighting for his life in hospital."As long as this person is still on the loose and we do not know the motives, this represents a threat," interior minister Manuel Valls told reporters outside Libération's offices after visiting the scene. "We must move fast."Later on Monday, a man fired shots outside the headquarters of French bank Société Générale in La Défense, the business district of western Paris, according to a spokeswoman for the bank."I can confirm that a man opened fire … Nobody was injured. The police are on the spot and investigating," the spokeswoman told Reuters.Shortly afterwards, a gunman hijacked a car nearby and forced the driver to drop him on the Champs-Élysées in central Paris, the driver told police. It was not clear if that incident was related to the two shootings.The incident came days after an armed intruder entered the offices of the BFM television channel, threatening journalists before disappearing. Rousselot said it was not clear whether the two incidents were linked. He said the assailant was apparently a short-haired man in his 40s.Police have deployed protection outside the offices of other media outlets in the French capital.
