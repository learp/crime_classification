Charles Clarke, the home secretary, tried yesterday to keep alive the idea of putting offenders on community punishment schemes into uniform by saying it was essential that community penalties were not seen as the soft option.Mr Clarke said he backed the idea floated at the weekend by Hazel Blears, the minister for anti-social behaviour, that the 70,000 offenders on community work punishments each year should wear uniforms so that the public could see what they were doing.But Chris Fox, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said he preferred to see the work done by offenders given more publicity so that the public could see that community punishment orders benefited local neighbourhoods.The idea was introduced on a small scale after it was first mooted by Martin Narey, now chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, in July 2003 when he suggested that offenders should wear orange bibs as part of a campaign to improve the "marketing of community punishments".Mr Clarke said he was surprised by the "brouhaha" caused by Ms Blears's comments as he had visited a project in south London before the general election where uniforms were already being used.He indicated that the use of uniforms - which critics have compared to US-style chain-gangs - could be expected to be extended.The uniforms meant offenders were seen to be doing what they were doing and putting something back in respect of the crimes they had committed.He said the idea was not only "a goer" but was already happening. "I think the idea that community service is a soft option instead of prison is one that we have got to knock on the head," he said.Mr Clarke told the BBC's Today programme: "We have got to say that community service means service to the community, which means hard work; hopefully work from which you will, both, put something back into the community -which you don't do if you are lying around a prison cell -and something by which you can gain skills that will stop you offending in the future."But Mr Fox expressed reservations."I am not so convinced about the uniforms," he said."I would prefer a little more publicity - notices, signs, etc - to show what has been done, because it is often done quietly and the public needs to see that people who have mis behaved and been antisocial have tried to think about what they did and actually repaid a little bit. What we want are a range of sentences that actually make sure that the public have trust and faith in the criminal justice system."The 70,000 offenders sentenced to community punishment orders each year work up to 240 hours unpaid on projects of value to the neighbourhood from cleaning up graffiti and other local eye sores to improving the lighting in multi-storey car parks.Mr Fox added: "The principle is that the public know that people who have been given community service have actually contributed something, whether it is a community project, painting something, restoring something. I don't think the public see what community sentences lead to, and they need to see that."
