Four men were today jailed for life at the Old Bailey for clubbing a man to death in the back of an ambulance.Judge Anthony Morris said the men must serve a minimum of between 16 and 21 years for murdering Eugen Breahna in Bounds Green, north London, on January 19 last year.Mr Breahna was clubbed to death in front of a terrified paramedic after becoming embroiled in a turf war involving rival gangs of Romanians.The 22-year-old's four killers were part of a larger mob of up to 20, who the judge said had chased Mr Breahna down the street "running as a pack, focusing on its prey".He had desperately sought protection by climbing into the ambulance, which had been attending an unrelated call.However, Judge Morris said the men had ignored the fact that ambulances were normally places of refuge and had followed him inside.The gang - armed with baseball bats, golf clubs, iron bars and possibly knives - then subjected Mr Breahna to an assault of "unbelievable brutality" the judge said. He added that they had targeted their victim's head.During the trial, the prosecution said the gang of armed Romanians - which included some local recruits - had targeted a smaller group of Romanians who lived by Bounds Green underground station.The motive could have been an attempt to win a turf war over lucrative cash machine scams, lawyers said.Once the smaller group of Romanians had been confronted, they scattered and fled, and Mr Breahna was pursued on his own."You all targeted one man who was on his own," the judge said. "You chased him down the road. Witnesses described 15 to 20 armed men running in a pack."Your victim took refuge in an ambulance," he added. "Most people would think they would be safe there, but you were not deterred by his place of refuge."The paramedic who was in the cab of the ambulance said he had never witnessed such violence in his life. It seemed everybody wanted to take part in the assault, and the focus of the assault was very definitely the victim's head."Other witnesses also gave evidence of seeing almost unbelievable brutality. Having hunted him down in a pack, you beat him to death."The four - Zak Mayanja, 18, Narcis Danila, 22, 18-year-old Christian Sakyi, and 30-year-old Gabriel Alecu, from east London - were convicted last month, but sentence had been adjourned until today. They had denied the charges.The judge today said Alecu would serve a minimum of 21 years, and the others a minimum of 16 years.
