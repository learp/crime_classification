A woman who spoke out against loyalist paramilitary intimidation has had her home in Belfast firebombed, raising questions about the validity of the ceasefire called by the Ulster Defence Association.Tracey Coulter said she and her four children were not home when UDA members set ablaze the property in the Shankill Road area of the city on Sunday evening.The fire service sent seven engines and 33 firefighters at 7.15pm as flames threatened to spread to nearby roofs."We were round the corner in my mother's in Boundary Way when my eight-year-old daughter, Ellie, came running in yelling that our house was on fire," she Coulter. "I don't know yet what the damage is to the house and whether we'll be able to move back or not for Christmas."It's the children who are suffering. They don't know whether their Christmas presents are destroyed or not."Coulter, who has campaigned against drug dealing in the loyalist stronghold, accused local elements in the UDA of targeting her home.On Friday a leading UDA member, William "Mo" Courtney, was convicted of assaulting Coulter at a government-funded community centre in west Belfast in July. That attack came a week after her cousin died from an overdose and after she accused him and his associates of supplying drugs in the Skankill area.Coulter claims her home was firebombed because she gave evidence against Courtney during the trial."It is the UDA's response to his conviction last week â€“ but I don't for one second regret what I did. I'd do it again tomorrow and I'd urge everyone to stand up to them," she said.Coulter said that following the arson attack on her home, Northern Ireland's first minister, Peter Robinson, should consider withdrawing all funding to UDA-related community projects."I will not be driven from my home by these gangsters. I am staying in the Shankill. There is no way the bully boys are forcing to force me to leave."This attack is just the latest in a long line of intimidation my family has faced since I stood up to the UDA. My four-year-old son Justin gets upset at the abuse that they hurl at us."Coulter's father, Jackie, was shot dead by the rival Ulster Volunteer Force during its 2000 feud with the UDA in the Shankill area. He drove a minibus for the families of UDA prisoners and was not an active gunman in the terror group.
