Watch the Manchester Evening News footageManchester's most senior police officer took 50,000 volts in his back after volunteering to be shot by a Taser stun gun in an attempt to demonstrate the weapon's effectiveness and safety.After collapsing in agony from the close-range strike, Chief Constable Michael Todd said: "I was completely incapacitated, and if I was carrying a weapon there was no way I could have done anything, as I just couldn't move."And yes, it hurt like hell and no, I wouldn't want to do it again."The head of the Greater Manchester force wants the controversial weapons, which Amnesty International claim can be deadly, to be issued to frontline police. Currently their use is restricted to firearms officers.Mr Todd agreed to be shot by one of his own officers after a Sunday newspaper challenged him to prove his claim that he was convinced the weapons were safe.His force introduced the units in January this year and they have already been used six times. Mr Todd contends the American-made devices save lives in critical situations where officers would otherwise have no option but to shoot a suspect with a gun."Just the physical drawing of the Taser from the holster and having the laser sight dot aimed at the subject's torso was enough on four occasions for subjects to cooperate and enable firearms officers to make the arrests safely," he said."The Taser has had to be fired on only two occasions when subjects haven't complied with firearms officers' demands. They were both disarmed and safely detained with no ill effect from the Taser."This week the Home Office announced plans to launch a 12-month trial to begin in September, subject to medical advice, to extend the use of the weapons to specially trained non-firearms officers.The home secretary, John Reid, declared to a police conference that the weapons were needed to meet the demands of modern policing.Mr Todd is keen for his force to be included. He told the Manchester Evening News: "Tasers can save people's lives, that of the police officer and the member of the public. We at GMP have saved several people's lives. We had one person in particular who came out of a house with a firearm."Immediately afterwards he told the officers he didn't know why he had done what he did, and thanked them for shooting him with a Taser."We have also had incidents in the last couple of months where people have been running down the streets with dangerous weapons like a Samurai sword."We are not talking about giving Tasers to every single police officer, but perhaps those based in the tactical aid unit, after training has been given. It could provide extra security and safety for officers and the public."
