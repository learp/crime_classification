A Mexican woman has been charged with drug smuggling after 15kg of cocaine was allegedly found strapped to the legs of two children at London's Heathrow airport, Revenue & Customs said today.Elisa Vazquez Sanchez, 40, was arrested after the drugs, with an estimated street value of Â£675,000, were discovered during a search on Tuesday. Customs officers at Heathrow's terminal four carried out the search after Sanchez, accompanied by the children, arrived on a British Airways flight from Mexico City at around midday. Bob Gaiger, a customs spokesman at Heathrow, said: "We never cease to be amazed at the lengths to which some people will go to hide drugs from us when they pass through our controls."Sanchez has been charged with attempting to smuggle a quantity of class-A drugs into the UK. A 13-year-old boy has been bailed for one month and is due to attend Heathrow police station on April 10, the spokesman added. An 11-year-old girl has been released without charge. Both children have been placed into the care of social services.Sanchez was due to appear before magistrates at Uxbridge, south-west London, later today.
