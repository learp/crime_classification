The actor Hugh Grant has been arrested over an allegation that he assaulted a paparazzi photographer with a tub of baked beans.Grant and the photographer, Ian Whittaker, reportedly clashed near the actor's west London home at 10am on Tuesday.Police would not confirm that Grant had been arrested, but said in a statement that a 46-year-old man was arrested in connection with an assault allegation on April 24 and bailed to return to a police station next month.Grant allegedly kicked Mr Whittaker three times before kneeing him in the groin. He then picked up a family-sized tub of beans and chucked them at the photographer.Yesterday the Daily Star reported that Mr Whittaker was left "bruised, battered and covered in baked beans".He told the paper: "As Grant was laying into me he asked: 'Do you have kids?'"When I told him I had two he snarled: 'I hope they die of fucking cancer'."Grant refutes the quotes that have been attributed to him.Mr Whittaker was in the area trying to take pictures of Grant's former partner Liz Hurley who lives nearby.
