Fewer women should be jailed to avoid damaging the next generation of children, Cherie Booth QC said yesterday.Calling for innovative ways of dealing with women offenders to avoid the "tragedy of wasted lives", the leading human rights lawyer said she looked forward to the day when prison was seen as a "place of last resort". "We are not helping society, victims, offenders or their children by holding so many women in prison," she told a Prison Reform Trust conference on the unmet needs of young mothers in prison. With the women's prison population in England and Wales at an all-time high, she urged the criminal justice system to explore alternatives to custody. "I believe imprisonment is rarely a constructive means of dealing with offending by women, for the offender or for society," said Ms Booth. "Being inside a women's jail is hard for a visitor, let alone for an inmate. My memories of recent visits are of drained, despairing prisoners talking about missing their children, their concerns and regrets and downtrodden lives," she said. In 1994, there were 1,811 women in prison; now there are more than 4,600, according to the PRT. Some 18,000 children in England and Wales were facing life without their imprisoned mothers, the conference heard. Half of what is known as the "female estate" were housed in prisons at least 50 miles from their homes and a quarter 100 miles from home. The conference was told that only 5% of children remained in the family home after their mother had been imprisoned. One in four women prisoners had spent time in the care of a local authority as a child, according to the PRT. Joanne Sherlock, the PRT's Young Parents in Prison project manager, said: "Children are the forgotten victims of Britain's growing obsession with imprisonment."
