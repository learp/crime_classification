Police excavating the Jersey care home where part of a child's skull was found in February have discovered two pits behind the boys' dormitory. One was filled with lime, which is often used to try to accelerate the decomposition of soft tissues in buried remains. Police said they could think of no reason for the presence of lime or the pits.The inquiry team at Haut de la Garenne, the home where more than 100 people claim they were abused, had been contacted by a man claiming he had been asked by care staff to dig and fill in the pits during the 1970s or 1980s."When he asked what the pits were for he was told it was none of his concern," said a spokeswoman for Jersey police. "According to the witness, this has played on his mind for some years and led to him coming to the States of Jersey police and pointing out where he created the holes."Last week the inquiry team excavated the first pit, which is about 1.5 metres deep. At the bottom was a large quantity of lime, and nothing else. "The inquiry team can think of no reason why this pit would have been created, nor why it was filled with lime," said the police spokeswoman. "We would emphasise that we have no evidence of any motive."The team is excavating the second pit, which is very close to what was the boys' dormitory. So far only one man has been charged with child abuse in the inquiry, but police said yesterday that they expected more arrests "in the next few weeks". There are more than 40 suspects and some 160 alleged victims involved in the investigation, about 100 of whom allege abuse at Haut de la Garenne directly.Work is also continuing on excavating the third and fourth bricked-up cellars in the building, which closed as a children's home in 1986 and was recently turned into a youth hostel.Police said a number of "significant" items, including traces of blood, had been discovered in the rooms, which corroborated accounts given by alleged abuse victims.
