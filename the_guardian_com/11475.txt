Extra security introduced after a police inquiry into a saboteur at Stepping Hill hospital has been withdrawn - as it is too costly.It is estimated that around £100,000 has been spent on security guards who have been patrolling the hospital grounds 24 hours a day since July. They have been noting down vehicle registration numbers and checking the identity of visitors.But the security operation has now ended at the hospital in Hazel Grove, Stockport, Greater Manchester. Other measures such as CCTV on wards and two nurses checking the administration of drugs will continue.It is understood that the security is being scaled back because of the expense, not because police are any nearer to catching the killer.Detectives believe 17 people have been poisoned by tainted saline that was injected with insulin. Three patients died, Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83. Nine other cases are still being reviewed, and 16 have been eliminated from the inquiry.All charges were dropped against staff nurse Rebecca Leighton, 27, in September after she spent more than six weeks on remand in Styal prison. She vehemently denied any wrongdoing and spoke of her 'nightmare' ordeal.Last month, it was revealed that the complex and lengthy police investigation has so far cost £500,000. A hospital spokesman said: "The security guards were put on 24-hour patrol at all our hospital entrances as part of a number of security measures around the saline contamination incident."We have been constantly reviewing the levels of security that are required, and since mid-October, the security guards on our entrances have just been used for peak times."The spokesman said security measures, such as CCTV in some treatment rooms, two nurses for the preparation and handling of drugs on wards, required signing-in and out for access to any treatment room in the hospital and security guards on mobile patrol within the hospital remains.Police were first called to Stepping Hill hospital in July after concerned staff reported unexplained blood sugar levels in patients on interconnected surgical wards.It is understood that the trust intends to try to recoup the cost from a central NHS fund meant to assist hospitals in crisis.Police bosses could use money from Greater Manchester Police Authority's £35m reserves to help fund the inquiry.One theory was the motivation was not to kill patients, but to cause chaos, disruption, and embarrassment.It is thought that the saboteur had medical knowledge.
