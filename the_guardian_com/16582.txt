Comedian Rory McGrath has been cautioned by police over a drunken assault against a couple.The 57-year-old, a regular panellist on BBC sports quiz They Think It's All Over, was said to have attacked a man and a woman who were trying to help him while he was "heavily in drink", police said at the time of the incident in May.The man, in his late 40s, suffered a bloody nose and a scratched face, and McGrath was subsequently arrested for common assault and assault causing actual bodily harm.The comic, who grew up in Redruth, Cornwall, and now lives in Cambridge, had been bailed until Friday over the assaults, which took place at a house in Pool, near Redruth.A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said: "A 57-year-old man from the Cambridgeshire area received three cautions in relation to offences of assault by beating."The cautions mean no further action will be taken against McGrath, but that there was enough evidence to charge him. He would also have had to admit the offences in order to accept the cautions, the police spokesman said.McGrath has also appeared alongside Dara O'Briain and Griff Rhys Jones in Three Men In A Boat.
