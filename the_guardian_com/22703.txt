A police officer today described the moment that Jean Charles de Menezes was shot dead.The surveillance officer, codenamed Ivor, told the Old Bailey it had been a "distressing" and "shocking" incident for passengers who fled the tube carriage at Stockwell station in London in July 2005.The court heard how De Menezes stood up from his seat on the Northern line train with his arms at waist level and slightly in front of him.Ivor told the jury: "I grabbed Mr de Menezes, wrapping both my arms around the torso, pinning his arms against his side, pushing him back to the seat with the right hand side of my head against the right hand side of his torso, pinning him to the seat."After a few moments I felt his head turn towards me. I was aware of a CO19 [firearms] officer kneeling on the seat to my left. I heard a gunshot very close to my left ear and was hit by a shockwave of a gun being discharged."In the confusion, Ivor was dragged to the floor by a firearms officer and a gun was pointed at him."I held out my hands and shouted 'police'," he said.The officer, dressed "virtually identically" to De Menezes in jeans, a denim jacket and trainers, was dragged out of the carriage to the rear wall of the platform from where he heard gunshots and screams."The scene was extremely violent, extremely noisy and obviously distressing," he said. "Members of the public were emptying the carriage obviously in distress. There was a lot of gunsmoke. It was obviously a shocking incident."He told the jury he had acted "instinctively" against De Menezes."Given the nature of the subject we were deployed against I had to make an assessment within seconds. I was concerned that his hands may come together and instinctively pinned his hands to his side."I was obviously concerned that he may be carrying arms or had explosives in his possession which could be a threat to the public on the carriage."De Menezes, 27, was shot seven times in the head after wrongly being identified as a terrorist.The Brazilian electrician had been followed from his home in Scotia Road, south London, an address linked to the July 21 attempted bomber Hussain Osman.Police were unsure if he was Osman but still allowed him unchallenged on to two buses and a Tube train, the jury has heard.The Office of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police denies a charge of exposing the public to risk. The hearing was adjourned to tomorrow.
