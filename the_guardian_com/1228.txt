Writs for damages were issued in the high court yesterday by lawyers for the family of Stephen Lawrence against the five men suspected of killing him and the Metropolitan police commissioner.The writs were taken out with one day to go before the sixth anniversary of Stephen's murder, to comply with the time limit for bringing civil actions for damages.Imran Khan, the family's solicitor, said: 'I can confirm on behalf of Mr and Mrs Lawrence that I have today issued protective writs in the high court of justice, London, against certain individuals considered to be responsible for the murder of Stephen Lawrence. This is for damages arising out of and in consequence of the murder'I can also confirm that I have today issued a protective writ on behalf of Mr and Mrs Lawrence against the Metropolitan police. The writ is for damages arising out of the failed investigation into the murder.'If the action against the commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, comes to court it will be a test case to establish that the police do not enjoy immunity from claims of negligence, after a similar ruling in the European court of human rights last year.But the family's lawyers are still in negotiation with Scotland Yard on a level of compensation. In the event of an acceptable offer above the estimated Â£100,000 already on the table the writ would not be proceeded with.The writs against the five suspects Jamie and Neil Acourt, David Norris, Gary Dobson and Luke Knight are unlikely to yield concrete damages as they are not wealthy. But a court case would oblige the five to account for their movements on the night of the murder for the first time in a court of law.At the inquest in 1996 they refused on legal advice to answer questions, and during the public inquiry last year lawyers were barred from asking them direct questions about the murder.Neil Acourt, Knight and Dobson, were formally acquitted of the murder of Stephen three years ago when a private prosecution brought by the Lawrences collapsed. The case against Jamie Acourt and Norris was dropped before it reached court.Lawyers acting for Duwayne Brooks, who was with Stephen the night he was murdered, yesterday issued legal proceedings against the Met for negligence and misfeasance in public office and against the five suspects for assault.He is also suing police officers involved in the bungled case for racial discrimination.
