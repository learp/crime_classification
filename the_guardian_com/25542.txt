Police have appealed for witnesses after heavy objects were dropped on to cars passing under a bridge on Scotland's busiest motorway. A woman was seriously injured in one of two similar incidents in England last week.The roof and windscreen of vehicles were badly damaged after heavy objects were dropped from a bridge over the motorway in West Lothian on Saturday and on Monday. None of the occupants were injured.A car was struck by a large object as it passed under the B792 Blackburn to Bathgate bridge shortly before 8pm on Saturday while a van's windscreen was smashed by an object thrown from the footbridge over the M8 at Blackburn at about 7.10pm on Monday."Fortunately in both incidents no one was injured, but there is every chance that this mindless vandalism could have had far more serious consequences," said Inspector Simon Bradshaw of Lothian and Borders Police."By compromising the vision of one driver, the lives of everyone on that road are put in danger. The M8 is Scotland's busiest motorway, so these incidents could potentially have caused multiple fatalities."In Essex, where an investigation is continuing into two attacks on Thursday, police have said that there may have been 30 incidents of rocks being thrown from bridges along the A12 in the county over the past three years.Two of the victims, Lisa Horne, 26, and her mother, Stella, whose Vauxhall Astra car was hit by an object near Ingatestone as they returned from a shopping trip, told journalists they felt lucky to be alive following the attack on their car on Friday.Minutes later, a lump of concrete described as being the size and shape of a bucket was dropped on another car from a bridge at Galleywood, severely injuring a 57-year-old woman in a car being driven by her husband. She was described as being in a stable condition in hospital, where she is being treated for fractures to her face and ribs and internal injuries.Part of the A12 in Essex was closed on Monday after a woman reported a man holding a concrete block on a bridge on the north carriageway between junctions 14 and 15.On Sunday, Essex police announced that new lines of inquiry had emerged following the public's response to the investigation into Thursday's incidents, which are being treated as attempted murder.
