Police investigating a former family doctor accused of murdering a cancer sufferer have exhumed the bodies of two of his other patients.The bodies are understood to be those of two elderly men who were patients of Dr Howard Martin, 70, who is awaiting trial for murder.Officers arrived at two cemeteries in the south-west area of County Durham at around midnight to excavate the graves. Last night police confirmed a third excavation at another cemetery was also planned.Durham coroner Andrew Tweddle granted warrants for the exhumations - one of which required permission from the Bishop of Durham as it was buried in consecrated ground.The recovered bodies were due to be taken to the mortuary at Bishop Auckland general hospital, where Home Office pathologist Dr Mark Eden will undertake postmortem examinations.Detective superintendent Harry Stephenson, who is leading the inquiry, said: "Serious questions have been raised about the chain of events that led to the deaths of the three pensioners and we have a duty to carry out a full investigation."The detective said the families of all three men had been fully informed.Dr Martin has denied killing 74-year-old cancer sufferer Harry Gittins, who died six years after undergoing surgery to his oesophagus.The GP was arrested in May at his surgery in Newton Aycliffe after the exhumation of Mr Gittins' body.Dr Martin, of Penmaenmawr, Gwynedd, North Wales, made a brief appearance at Teesside crown court and formally pleaded not guilty. He was granted conditional bail until his trial in March.
