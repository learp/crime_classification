Dale Cregan has changed his pleas on two murder charges to admit shooting dead two unarmed police officers.PCs Fiona Bone, 32, and PC Nicola Hughes, 23, died within moments of the 29-year-old fugitive luring them to the scene of a spurious burglary in Hattersley, Greater Manchester, last September.Cregan shot each of them in the chest as they walked up the garden path of a house he had taken over the night before. He then fired a further 30 bullets at the officers as they tried to take cover.Once they were dead he threw a fragmentation grenade towards their bodies and then drove to Hyde police station, Greater Manchester, to hand himself in.He told the counter clerk: "I'm wanted by the police and I've just done two coppers."Cregan, who still denies two other murders, had pleaded not guilty to killing the officers at the start of his trial at Preston crown court. Nine co-accused denied charges including murder and attempted murder.On Tuesday, the fourth day of proceedings, Cregan informed his defence team that he wanted to plead guilty to two charges.Simon Czoka QC rose immediately after the lunch break and told the trial judge, Mr Justice Holroyde: "I ask that counts 10 and 11 be put again to the defendant."Cregan stood impassively in the dock as the clerk asked how he now pleaded to the charge of murdering PC Bone on 18 September last year. "Guilty," he replied.He was then asked for his plea on the charge of murdering PC Hughes. "Guilty," he said again.The judge told the jury: "If you cast your minds back to the very start of the case, you will remember that I indicated to you that in due course you will be asked to record separate verdicts on each defendant on each charge that they face."Looking at it in those terms, you have heard Mr Cregan's admissions of guilt on these two charges and clearly these pleas do not change the position of the other defendants. You will also remember that all the defendants were put in your charge and that means only the jury have the power to return verdicts."The jury foreman was then asked to stand up. He confirmed the verdicts as directed by the judge.
