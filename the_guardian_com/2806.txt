A 68-year-old man was arrested in Jersey today in connection with the island's ongoing investigation into child abuse.Jersey police said the man, who has not been named, was arrested just before 7am and was being questioned over a number of alleged rapes and indecent assaults in the 1960s and 1970s.Police said his arrest was not directly related to the inquiry into alleged crimes at the Haut de la Garenne children's home, but was part of a wider historical abuse investigation.More than 100 people have claimed they were abused at Haut de la Garenne, which closed in 1986.Yesterday, police said two anthropologists and two archaeologists were due to begin a detailed excavation of two cellar rooms where bone fragments and teeth were found.The bone fragments have been delivered to the UK to ascertain their origin, and the teeth will follow this week.Fragments of a child's skull were found in February buried under a stairwell. Tests on the skull were unable to identify the child but found that the bone was placed there no earlier than the 1920s.Some of the victims claim they were kept in solitary confinement and attacked in secret underground chambers. In four underground rooms, police have found items including shackles and a bath, which they say corroborate the victims' claims.One man has been charged in connection with the abuse inquiry. Gordon Claude Wateridge is accused of three offences of indecent assault on girls under 16 between 1969 and 1979, when he was warder at the home.The 76-year-old, who is originally from Croydon, Surrey, is on bail and will appear before St Helier magistrates court on May 12. He has not yet entered a plea.There are more than 40 suspects in the inquiry, which also involves other care homes in Jersey.
