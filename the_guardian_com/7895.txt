The imprisonment of the bogus Earl of Buckingham (Report, November 9), who refuses to reveal his identity, is a frightening example of how easy it is for the unscrupulous to steal the identity of the deceased. The fact that this case went undetected for so long just goes to show how, if personal details such as passport numbers and bank details fall into the wrong hands, your identity could be used for all manner of illegal activities without your knowledge.For the last four years members of Cifas (the UK's fraud prevention service) have reported a substantial rise in deceased impersonation frauds. Impersonation of the dead is now Britain's fastest growing identity theft crime - rising from 16,000 cases in 2001 to over 26,000 from January to October last year. If no action is taken, we could expect to see a staggering 140,000 cases a year within three years. Not only will 300,000 families be affected, but deceased fraud is already costing Â£250m a year, with the cost being passed on to consumers.According to the Metropolitan police, a major contributor is the theft of junk mail during house viewings. One way to protect against this is to sign up those who have passed away to the Bereavement Register, a free national service that reduces the amount of junk mail sent to people who have died (www.the-bereavement-register.org.uk).  Mark Roy Sevenoaks, KentWhy is it a crime to adopt a different name? What has "Christopher Buckingham" done wrong? You surely shouldn't imprison someone because you can't find out what he used to be called. It shows poor judgment that he pretended to be an aristo, but he shouldn't be locked up for it. You repeatedly refer to him as a fraudster, but who has he defrauded? Is it just that this control-freak nanny state can't cope with someone who doesn't fill in their forms properly?
