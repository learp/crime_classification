The taxpayer lost up to £3bn - equivalent to nearly 1p on the basic rate of income tax - to "carousel" VAT fraud in fiscal 2005-06, pre-budget report documents revealed yesterday.Revenue & Customs said a European court of justice ruling in 2005, which outlawed its strategy for combating the losses, led to a big surge of attempted fraud in Britain. That meant losses to the government nearly doubled compared with the year before to £2bn-£3bn.The figure was not surprising given that VAT receipts in 2005-06 fell by £100m from the previous year whereas they had been expected to rise by £3.5bn. The fall was the first ever since VAT was introduced in the 1970s.Officials said the constantly changing nature of the fraud meant the department had altered the way it calculated losses. Under the old method of calculation, the losses would have been slightly less.Carousel fraud involves the import and export of small valuable goods such as mobile phones and computer chips between EU states, with VAT being reclaimed each time the goods are exported but not paid to Revenue & Customs upon import. Goods circulate many times, leading to massive VAT reclaims.This year levels of the attempted fraud have shot higher as criminals have become ever more sophisticated and used "virtual" carousels moving goods on a computer but not physically. In response, Revenue & Customs has tripled the number of investigators to 1,500, withheld repayments to anyone suspected of fraud and helped the Dutch government close a bank in Curaçao that was being used by all of Britain's fraudsters. The measures have led to a sharp decline in fraud recently.The paymaster general, Dawn Primarolo, said she was confident that Revenue & Customs was now on top of the fraud: "I absolutely believe we have got a handle on this now and have the mechanisms in place to keep a hold on it."There had been a huge jump in spring and early summer before the Revenue's clampdown, when investigators said they were losing the equivalent of "two Tonbridge robberies" - or £100m - a week.Ms Primarolo was also confident that the government would succeed in getting approval from its EU neighbours for a "reverse charge" system for mobile phones, which would see VAT only levied when the goods arrive at a retailer and thereby avoid the need for refunds to be made.
