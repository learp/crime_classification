The murder of two County Down women in Turkey had "gatecrashed" the lives of their families, a parish priest said ahead of their funerals on Friday.Marion Graham and Kathy Dinsmore will be buried after requiem masses. They were stabbed to death near Izmir while on holiday last week.The service for Marion Graham will be held at St Mary's church in Newry in the morning while Kathy Dinsmore's will take place at St Peter's church in Warrenpoint in the afternoon.Canon John Kearney, who will preside at Kathy Dinsmore's funeral mass, said the families were still in "complete and utter shock"."Children were getting ready to go back to school, people were awaiting exam results," he said."There was a great buzz in the whole community and now these tragic deaths have gatecrashed their celebration of life."But the one thing that is helping them cope is the presence of so many people."It's not the words they say, but the very fact that they come has given them strength and courage to go on."Canon Kearney said family members planned to attend both services."I was in the Dinsmore family home last night and they are going to Marion's funeral in the morning," he said."Then they will come back home to journey with Kathy to the church and the funeral mass. She will be laid to rest with her parents in Warrenpoint."Recep Cetin, the Turkish boyfriend of Marion Graham's daughter Shannon, is being held on suspicion of murder. He is said to have claimed he is 17 but there is uncertainty over his age.
