The man who was kicked by Eric Cantona at a Manchester United match more than 15 years ago was today spared jail for punching another man at a children's football game.Matthew Simmons, 36, who was on the receiving end of the kung fu kick at a game between Manchester United and Crystal Palace in 1995, attacked Stuart Cooper, the former manager of his son's football team.He was given a six-month jail term, suspended for two years, as well as 150 hours of unpaid work in the community at Kingston crown court this afternoon by Judge Michael Hopmeier. Simmons was also ordered to pay £1,000 in compensation to his victim and £2,000 in prosecution costs.On 8 April this year a jury of seven men and five women found Simmons guilty of assault causing actual bodily harm. The court heard that Simmons held a grudge because his son, now 13, was dropped from the Under-8 side when his infamous altercation with Cantona was brought to Cooper's attention.The jury rejected his defence that he was acting in self-defence when the pair crossed paths at the pre-season friendly in south-east London in August 2010, fearing Cooper was going to strike him. Passing sentence, Judge Hopmeier told Simmons his actions were like those of a "football hooligan".He said: "On 7 August 2010, families came to watch a football match. Your own son was playing as well as the son of your victim. For reasons that remain unclear, you decided to assault your victim by punching him repeatedly in the face, arms and body."It seems there been some antagonism between you and him as a result of events that had taken place some years previously. Having told the jury how keen you were on promoting football, on this occasion on 7 August, your behaviour was akin to that of an aggressive football hooligan."
