The investigation into the death of Damilola is one of the first big tests of Scotland Yard's new approach to the handling of critical incidents in the capital.With 40 officers working on the case and the Metropolitan police's full range of back-up services at their disposal, including intelligence analysts, it is already the biggest murder inquiry since the death of the TV presenter Jill Dando in April 1999. Scotland Yard, though, has three other essential considerations; supporting Damilola's family and ensuring they are kept fully briefed, keeping in contact with and referring to community leaders for advice, and handling the media. The man who is running the investigative side of the inquiry has been shielded from the press. Working from the incident room in Clapham, south London, Detective Chief Inspector Trevor Shepheard has been told to concentrate on catching the killers. Detective Superintendent David Dillnutt is officially supervising the investigation. He is briefed about developments and referred to for advice, and has been fronting press conferences. Peckham's MP, Harriet Harman, called on the home secretary, Jack Straw, to do more to increase the numbers of police in Peckham, saying recruitment would be difficult unless more was done to ease housing costs for police. She also called for the police "to mount a real crackdown against knives in the street and schools". Mike Tomlinson, the new chief inspector of schools in England, said yesterday that one of his priorities was to help schools stamp out bullying. "I think it is important that we, through inspections, identify whether schools are being effective at preventing it from happening or indeed, dealing with it effectively when it does happen," he said.Related special reportPolicing crimeRelated stories30 November: Straw appeals to public after 'evil' schoolboy murder 30 November: 'My son is dead and I am bitter' 30 November, leader: Death in Peckham 30 November: Head defends bullying record 30 November: Estate is 'one of toughest in Europe' 29 November: Death of a schoolboy 29 November: It's lawless out there Useful linksMetropolitan police The home office Ofsted report: the Oliver Goldsmith primary school Local media: South London online London borough of Southwark Photographs of the North Peckham estate
