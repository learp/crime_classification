Welfare campaigners have praised the government's decision to back down over controversial plans to dock housing benefit from unruly tenants. Housing benefit minister Chris Pond confirmed today that the plan has been dropped in the face of widespread opposition. The homelessness charity Shelter expressed relief at the u-turn. Its director Adam Sampson said: "We've consistently argued that these measures don't get to the heart of why people actually behave unacceptably but just create more poverty and more homelessness."He pointed out that 81% of councils thought the idea was counterproductive and three quarters of responses to a government consultation were negative."The sheer scale of the opposition shows just how many people are against the government's draconian measures that punish, but don't actually reduce, anti-social behaviour," said Mr Sampson.Shelter urged the government to tackle the problem through support of the kind offered by its scheme in Rochdale which featured in the Guardian last year.Mr Sampson continued: "We hope that this decision kick-starts the government into providing real solutions to the real problem of anti-social behaviour."Paula Twigg, welfare rights manager at the Child Poverty Action Group, also welcomed the climbdown. She said: "Punishing people with children does nothing to address the problem of anti-social behaviour."This proposal was unworkable, it would have led to a lot more homelessness and shunted the problem into other areas."Ms Twigg added that it would have discriminated against poorer families because anti-social homeowners would have been unaffected by the idea. The Liberal Democrats accused the government of "burying" embarrassing news on a day dominated by the top-up fees debate. The party's work and pensions spokesman, Steve Webb, said: "The government has been forced into an embarrassing climbdown and decided to bury the bad news. "There is no doubt that anti-social behaviour is a real problem, but we have said all along that these proposals were unworkable populist nonsense. Perhaps the Government will now spend some time on developing sensible proposals rather than knee-jerk ideas designed to grab headlines."
