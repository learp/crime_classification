Thousands of remand prisoners, inmates with mental health problems and children should urgently be released from prisons to relieve the growing overcrowding crisis in England and Wales, according to a damning report by MPs published today.The Commons public accounts committee says the unprecedentedly high prison population of 77,000 is due to rise even higher and will lead to higher suicide rates and a fertile environment for unrest among prisoners.The PAC chairman, Edward Leigh, says it is time for the new home secretary, John Reid, to think "long and hard" about practical alternatives to jail, including electronic tagging, for three specific groups of prisoners. They are:· The 3,900 remand prisoners who are currently in jail but who, when convicted, are not given a custodial sentence - about one third of all remand prisoners.· The rapidly rising number of children held in prison service accommodation, which has now reached 2,300 compared with only 1,600 a decade ago.· The 5,000 profoundly mentally ill people held in prison. MPs say that overcrowding limits the ability of prison to provide care for them and only 700 a year are transferred to hospital.The MPs also say that a crash building programme of temporary prison blocks to cope with the expected rise in prison numbers is urgently needed if mistakes made during the last surge in prison numbers in 2002 are not to be repeated.The PAC report reveals that senior Home Office officials have admitted that they have no confidence that the efforts to cap the relentless rise in prison numbers at 80,000 within the next two years will succeed. Indeed, it discloses that they have embarked on a deliberate policy of overcrowding prisons to cope with the extra numbers.Mr Leigh said yesterday that the 77,000 prison population in England and Wales was due to rise even higher."The prison service cannot be blamed for not being able to predict future prisoner numbers accurately. But it must not be caught flat-footed, as it was in 2002, when there was a sudden surge in demand for prison places."He said the National Offender Management Service needed detailed contingency agreements with contractors to build cost-effective and secure temporary prison accommodation at short notice."Another way of relieving the pressure is to think long and hard about practical alternatives to imprisonment for some key categories of prisoner, such as those on remand, those with mental health problems, and children," said Mr Leigh.The report, Dealing With Increased Numbers in Custody, says the number of prisoners has soared from 44,000 in 1991 to a record 77,800 in November 2005.The latest Home Office figures show that the current prison population of 77,600 is being squeezed into cells meant for only 70,500, although prison managers believe they have enough "headroom" to cope with up to 79,500.Nevertheless, officials are believed to have been working on emergency plans for a programme of "administrative release" of thousands of inmates serving short sentences which has yet to be put to ministers.A new sentence of "custody plus" is due to be introduced in November which could reduce numbers. It is designed to ensure that those who are currently given six months are instead put on community punishments combined with a short "taste of prison".Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said last night that prison overcrowding was reaching dangerous levels but panic measures would do more harm than good. Instead of seeking emergency powers for releasing prisoners, ministers should be looking for alternatives to custody for low-risk offenders. "If we want prison to work, we need a systematic approach to punishment and rehabilitation."
