Amnesty International has said that the Police Service of Northern Ireland could do more to help the victims of sex trafficking.The head of Amnesty in the province, Patrick Corrigan, said the PSNI had let down the victims because many feel they are not safe going to court in prosecutions against pimps and people smugglers."There are things that could be done here. We can better protect the women and we can better prosecute the offenders," Corrigan said.Amnesty's comments follow a recent BBC investigation in Northern Ireland that found up to Â£500,000 every week is spent on prostitution in the province.The PSNI believes there are 88 brothels in operation, with Northern Ireland having a higher demand for prostitution than most other areas of Europe.The brothels are usually run by local gangs, including paramilitaries, but there are also foreign groups involved.Corrigan said men who willingly pay for sex with these women should face charges of rape."I think that it is a case of rape when it is clear to the person buying their services that that woman is there under false pretences or under threat of violence," he added."I think those men are potentially responsible for rape. That is what it feels like on the receiving end."However, Corrigan admitted successfully prosecuting these men would be "extremely difficult".
