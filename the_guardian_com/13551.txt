Conservative leader David Cameron announced proposals today to make it easier to sack police officers who are not up to the job as part of a "fundamental shake-up of policing"."You can't be tough on crime unless you're tough on police reform," Mr Cameron said in a speech in Dalston, London, this morning.Mr Cameron promised to reform police officers' pay and conditions and end the situation where long-serving officers can only get big salaries through length of service - a move already under way as part of the government's public service reforms.Mr Cameron's support for performance-related pay echoes the policy line adopted by the government in education to increase the incentives for good teachers.Mr Cameron unveiled his plans on policing in a speech hosted by Crime Concern at Dalston Youth Project (DYP), north London this morning.He was flanked by his new police spokesman, Nick Herbert, former "Robocop" police chief Ray Mallon, now the independent elected mayor of Middlesbrough, and David Davis, the Tory shadow home affairs spokesman who lost out to Mr Cameron in the leadership race.The Tory leader welcomed the level of resources made available in recent years, claiming "spending on the police has increased under governments of both parties".But the wide disparity in police performance across the country must be challenged, he warned, claiming underperformance is leaving 4 million crimes undetected each year."There is little evidence that the performance of the police has improved in line with this increase in resources," he said.Mr Cameron said he believes only a small minority of police should be sacked. But current employment practices mean that once they have passed their 18-month probationary period it is very difficult to get rid of them.He said that greater flexibility in pay and conditions will allow officers to be rewarded for improving their skill levels, a move already underway as part of pay modernisation.The police negotiating board, responsible for negotiating the pay and terms of conditions of all 160,000 UK police officers, began talks in the autumn to overhaul the pay and rewards of police officers to reward skills and performance. Talks will conclude by the summer, when a package of measures is expected to ensure the pay system is commensurate with the new challenges, rising accountabilities, increased expectations and additional complexities the service faces.In a bid to give greater local accountability to police forces, Mr Cameron suggested scrapping the national police plan which proposes police mergers.Instead, he re-iterated Oliver Letwin's idea of elected sheriffs, police commissioners who would replace police authorities to make local forces more accountable to local communities."Police authorities are relatively powerless, and they're virtually invisible to the public," he said."Instead of police chiefs answering to central government, I want them to be formally accountable to local communities."So here is my offer to Britain's police. You make the changes which will improve police performance. And we will stop the centralisation and political interference that gets in your way."Mr Cameron will also tackle pension arrangements to allow those who are no longer physically able to fulfill a frontline role to move on to another career without losing out.Unlike other public sector workers, police officers can retire on a full pension after 30 years service.Jan Berry, who chairs the Police Federation, questioned whether the Tory leader was up to speed with current pension reforms."I'm unclear whether Mr Cameron is actually aware of the current rules or for that matter that pensions rules are changing on April 1 this year ... which should make it easier for pensions to be transportable so people do not feel they are locked into a 30-year career," she said.Ms Berry also threw doubt on the need for further reform, insisting structures were already in place to deal with "lazy" officers."The police service is not full of lazy officers - there are some really good rules already to dispense with their services but sadly chief officers choose not to use those rules," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.The federation would be happy to work with Mr Cameron on the detail of his ideas but the service was already in a "constant state of being reformed", she said.Mr Cameron, who has made a series of dramatic policy U-turns in health and education since becoming leader in December, was boosted by securing the first clear opinion poll lead the party has had in 13 years. The lastest ICM poll put the Tories four points ahead of LabourBut Mr Cameron's steady steer towards the centre ground is causing jitters within the Tory right, who are increasingly concerned by Mr Cameron's raft of soft policy announcements over the past few weeks, including his decision to rule out a return to the 11-plus and review the pupil voucher scheme.
