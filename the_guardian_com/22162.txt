The customary practice of politicians in experimenting with the variables that impact on the lives of citizens is nothing new. However, there is something unusual about the current debate on race and policing.It is bewildering how the public has been misled about the effects of the Macpherson inquiry on police morale. William Hague, the Tory leader, fiercely argues that the correlation between the inquiry and low police morale is undisputed. The Police Federation, which purportedly represents the views of the rank and file, would go as far as blaming the poor health of the station cat on the Macpherson report.The question that has yet to be asked is: what is the motive? There is an unprecedented interest in police morale - a problem hitherto deemed by politicians to be merely part and parcel of doing police work. It is fact borne out by history that when minorities begin to challenge the rituals and practices which have served a homogenised society for the benefit of the dominant group, that challenge is seen as a threat. The Kerner report was completed after the 1960's riots in the United States. It condemned and exposed police racism in many of the US police departments, in the way they dealt with the minority ethnic communities. But the report led to powerful condemnation by a number of politicians of the day. The police unions representing white officers followed the same theme, relentlessly arguing about unfair criticism and claiming that the police had lost confidence in policing the streets. The social unrest continued as police administrators remained in denial mode. They were relying on the backing of the politicians in claiming that the existence of racism was a figment of people's imagination, only asserted by the crimogenic sections of the black community. There is a simple lesson to be learned from those US events by British politicians who complain that the pendulum has swung too far in favour of the "liberal elite" who prescribe racial sensitivity. Trivialising for political gain the outcomes of any public inquiry that aims to act as a change agent to improve the quality of lives of all citizens is counterproductive. Comments of this kind, benevolent as they may be, will be used (and already have been) by the rightwing lobby as a licence to reclaim turf and return to the "good old days". In policing, that will mean the resurrection of the past. The police will do many more stop and searches but understand little about the ideas underpinning their actions. The ineffective "drag net" technique, where a net is cast over a community and then pulled in the hope of catching muggers, will become a legitimate police tactic. This was the very tactic that led to the riots in Brixton in 1981. "Driving whilst black", a fictional offence which many black people will have encountered, will again become the subject of routine practice for some officers. Furthermore, the important inroads the police have made because of the Macpherson report in investigating race hate crime and winning the confidence of all sections of the community, will be seen as an unaffordable luxury. It will become regarded as a byproduct of political correctness and discarded. Last but not least the torrent of racism which black and Asian police officers face internally but are now confident in challenging, will increase. The assertion that such officers have a "chip on their shoulders" when they confront racism will be back on the agenda. As to the sudden interest in police morale, when the Sheehy inquiry in 1993 comprehensively recommended against preserving the very few perks such as rent allowance which young officers got in joining the police - recommendations which led to a tangible and not a fictional drop in morale - the then home secretary did not bat an eyelid. When police pay failed to keep up with the challenges of policing in a way which has led to the current recruitment crises, very few politicians paid attention to the drop in police morale - even as many officers became eligible to claim social security to boost their income. The public is now told and expected to believe that police morale is regarded as important, and that a return to the golden age of policing is within our grasp if only the Macpherson report hadn't come along and if only the acceptance of institutional racism can now be edited out from police and political vocabularies.
