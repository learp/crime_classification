A teenager was today sentenced to a minimum of 17 years in prison after admitting the murder of an army cadet who was stabbed to death as he stood outside a youth club in Liverpool with friends.James Moore, 17, from the Vauxhall district of Liverpool, was sentenced at the city's crown court for killing 16-year-old Joseph Lappin in October 2008.Mr Justice Henriques told him he must serve at least 17 years behind bars before being eligible for parole.In January, Moore changed his plea to guilty shortly before the trial, with nine other defendants, was due to begin.The court heard that Lappin and his friends Callum Naden and Greg Harold were chased and attacked by a group of hooded youths outside the Church of England-run Shrewsbury House youth club in Everton, where they had been earlier listening to music.The three were chased around the building and set upon as they attempted to get back inside.Lappin, a cadet in the Liverpool Scottish Regiment, was stabbed in the heart and later died in hospital. Naden was stabbed twice but recovered from his injuries.The court was told that Moore had previously flouted antisocial behaviour orders and had been shown "remarkable leniency" by the courts.He had committed crimes on a monthly basis and broken every court order imposed against him, including referral and supervision orders, the crown court heard.Henriques said: "Joseph Lappin, Callum Naden and Greg Harold went to Shrewsbury House to listen to their friends practise and play in a band. These three were decent, law-abiding young men."Joseph Lappin was a model son with a loving family. He was very popular, with many interests including sport and music. He was a kind and thoughtful son who any family would be proud of."Callum had to watch his best friend bleed to death. Now he does not sleep, he has failed his AS-levels and has had to have counselling."The nine other defendants admitted conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and were given jail sentences ranging from four years and three months to six years.They were Anthony Greenwood, 18; 19-year-old Thomas Riding; Colin Cain, 21; Anthony Preston, 21; 23-year-old John McDonald; Colin Yell, 24, Anthony Smith, 22, Sean Doyle, 17, and Francis Jordan, 16, all from the Vauxhall area.Neil Flewitt, QC, prosecuting, said the background to the attack lay in a violent rivalry between groups of young men from the Vauxhall and Everton areas."It was, therefore, sheer chance that those three entirely innocent young men, who had absolutely nothing to do with any of the earlier attacks and nothing to do with any gangs, should find themselves in the way of an angry and armed mob determined to cause serious harm," he said.The group had brandished sticks, batons and bottles as they chased their victims around the building, he told the court.He said Moore then said: "It's going down, lads" before stabbing Lappin.As he did so, he said: "What's it like getting shivved?" – a slang term meaning stabbed. Moore stabbed Naden in the abdomen and outer thigh before Harold kicked them away.Henriques said he acknowledged Moore's troubled background – both his parents are drug users and his father is serving 10 years for armed robbery, adding: "On any view, this defendant has received no positive parenting."
