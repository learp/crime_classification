A woman who exaggerated an injury in an attempt to claim £750,000 compensation has received a three-month prison sentence.Barbara Fari lied about how badly she was hurt when she tripped on uneven paving and twisted her right knee in May 2008, said lawyers for Homes for Haringey.The organisation, which manages council housing in the north London borough, admitted liability and offered her £7,500 but she pursued a massive claim which was struck out by a judge in October 2012 after covert video evidence revealed a huge difference between how she presented at medical examinations and how she appeared when out near her home in Hornsey.The high court judge Mr Justice Spencer stayed Fari's jail term – half of which she would have to serve before her automatic release – pending any appeal. If an appeal is not lodged by 29 November, discontinued or dismissed, she will have to surrender herself into custody.Last week, Spencer ruled that Fari, who is 60 on Saturday, and her husband, Piper, were both in contempt of court. Fari had presented a "grossly false" picture of her continuing symptoms to doctors and in legal documents and her husband was complicit in the charade. He received a two-month prison sentence suspended for 12 months.Fari said the fall had aggravated her arthritis to the point where she was no longer able to look after her large family – she has 13 children – and instead needed their care.The couple denied contempt and Fari, who is illiterate, claimed she relied on the advice of solicitors and simply signed documents which were not explained properly, and that medical experts had misinterpreted what she told them.But the judge described her as a "strong and domineering" character, who actively pursued her case while her unemployed husband of 27 years foolishly went along with it.The couple's counsel, Mohammed Bashir, said the couple were the "engine room" of their family of children aged 15 to 24, two of whom are disabled. They were the sole earners, receiving income support of £190 a week, and their absence would have a far-reaching effect which would outweigh any potential deterrence, he said.He emphasised that Haringey never paid out the money which was claimed and said the couple, who were of previous good character, were essentially good people trying to do their best in difficult circumstances.The judge, who heard that the couple were legally aided, made a £100,000 costs order against them, which will not be enforced without leave of the court.
