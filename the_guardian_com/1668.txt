More than 1,000 violent and out-of-control children are too dangerous to be left alone with other young people in case they attack or sexually assault them, new research reveals. The offenders - mainly boys aged 13 to 15 - regularly commit offences ranging from threatening their parents or killing animals to sexual abuse and murder.Their behaviour is so disruptive that their parents cannot cope with them, schools refuse to accept them and foster carers won't look after them. They end up in custody or need psychiatric care. Social workers warn that a lack of specialist services for these 'bad but sad' teenagers means many go on to commit serious crimes and the public is put at risk.In the first survey of its kind, the 168 social services departments in England and Wales were found to have an average of about seven such children in their area, giving a total of more than 1,000. The research was conducted by Dr Ann Hagell, a psychologist and editor of the Journal of Adolescence, and Emily Hill, who works with young people in south London at risk of offending, and has been published in a book called Children who Commit Acts of Serious Interpersonal Violence.
