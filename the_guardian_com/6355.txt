The key witness in the Damilola Taylor murder trial, a 14-year-old girl, sang "I'm in the money" after police left the room during an interview, a jury heard today.She began giggling and sang the words in a flat tone as one of the women officers returned. Earlier, a teacher who was acting as the girl's guardian during nine hours of police interviews, had warned her: "It's like Big Brother." The girl queried: "When they go outside, the tapes are rolling?" The Old Bailey jury trying four youths for the ten-year-old's murder, are viewing video tapes of the interviews. The reference the witness made to money is one of several to a £50,000 reward offered by the Daily Mail newspaper. Two brothers aged 16, their 17-year-old friend and a 14-year-old youth deny murder, manslaughter and assault with intent to rob. The prosecution say the girl, who was 12 at the time, is the only witness to the attack.Today's remark came after the girl's statement had been written down by an officer in pain-staking detail. In the interval, she went over to the teacher and hugged her, telling her she would give her "£100 by the time you get out of here and then you're telling me to behave". Then she sang "I'm in the money" before taking her place on the solitary chair in the centre of the room. When a second officer returned she asked her: "Shall we stop now?" Earlier, the girl again broke the tension of the long interview by quipping about the money. When PC Carolyn Crooks told her: "It's really important for Damilola's family. Remember why you are doing this." The girl said: "To get some money. No, only joking." Damilola bled to death after being stabbed in the leg with a broken bottle as he walked home on the North Peckham Estate, south London, in November 2000.
