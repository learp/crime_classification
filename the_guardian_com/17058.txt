Motorists who kill somebody because they are driving while using a mobile phone would face a prison sentence of up to five years under a new offence announced yesterday.Ministers announced their intention to create a new offence of causing death by careless driving, to plug a loophole in the law under which those convicted of driving carelessly can only be given a fine. Home Office ministers are also proposing a second new offence of death resulting from illegal driving, so those who drive while disqualified or unlicensed can also be jailed for up to five years. The recommendations appear in a consultation paper in response to concerns about the devastating consequences for victims of bad driving. The Home Office minister Lady Scotland said that although the maximum 14-year sentence was available for dangerous drivers who killed, in the case of careless drivers the only option open to the courts was a fine. The Home Office estimates that the two new offences could require 800 extra prison places; but they expect the courts to use community punishments for lesser motoring offences to offset this. The proposals were welcomed by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. But the shadow home secretary, David Davis, added: "The government's example, motorists who kill while on their mobile phones, is not careless but actually dangerous. Using a mobile while driving is a wilful act and therefore a dangerous act."
