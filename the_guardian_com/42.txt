Your suggestion that Edinburgh's prostitution scene was "a model of self-regulation and safety" compared with Glasgow is mistaken (On the streets of Edinburgh, a benign view of prostitution, December 30). There are enormous differences between the type and numbers of women working in the two cities, and in the patterns of drug use, pimping and off-street trade. It is these variations, not the existence of toleration zones, which largely account for the difference.The suggestion that the removal of the Leith zone led to increases in violence, drug use and under-age girls working as prostitutes, is disingenuous. Violence against working women rarely occurs at the point where clients are picked up. Increases in the percentage of intravenous drug users among street prostitutes have been recorded in most urban areas. Toleration zones provide no disincentive to under-age girls and may encourage some desperate young women to engage in prostitution more readily. Experimental zones in a number of Dutch cities have been abandoned recently. The reasons include objections from residents and the zones becoming overcrowded, as they can act as a magnet for prostitutes, pimps, clients and drug dealers from other areas. The recurring problem of approved zones, however, is that objections from residents or businesses mean that the only places available tend to be industrial areas, docks and the like, which are often remote. It is often difficult to attract clients to these zones and the women move elsewhere. It is possible to establish designated zones, but such a strategy needs to be based on a more detailed consideration of what might work. Prof Roger MatthewsMiddlesex University
