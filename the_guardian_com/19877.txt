A 24-year-old man died after being shot in the head and neck in Peckham, south London, yesterday only a few hundred metres from where a teenager was shot in a convenience store two weeks ago, police said.The man, who had not been formally identified last night, was found in a carpark shortly before 3am yesterday in what police say is likely to be a gang-related killing. His death is the latest in a spate of violent attacks in the capital this year involving young people using guns or knives. The incident occurred a short walk from the Costcutter in Camberwell Road where Ryan Bravo, 18, was shot earlier this month."There is nothing to suggest that it is [related to the Costcutter shooting]," said Detective Inspector Tony Boughton, of Operation Trident, the specialist team that deals with gun crime. He confirmed that the victim was known to police.A postmortem was carried out yesterday and the victim's identity will be released after his next-of-kin have been notified.Police have appealed to anyone who may have been in the area between 2.30am and 3am yesterday.The latest incident comes after three more men, two aged 19 and one 17, were arrested on suspicion of Ryan Bravo's murder last week. Ashley Bucknor, 19, of no fixed address, has been charged with murder. Police recovered the gun used to kill Bravo during raids in the Brixton area last week.One witness who had been buying cigarettes in the shop said he heard up to four shots in less than 10 seconds.
