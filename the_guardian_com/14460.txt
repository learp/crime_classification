The jury in Ian Huntley's trial for double murder at the Old Bailey will retire to consider its verdicts today, when Mr Justice Moses completes his summing up of the six-week case.Yesterday he urged the jurors to put aside their emotions and reminded them that the caretaker's lies did not prove he was guilty of murder. Mr Huntley, 29, denies murdering Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman at his home in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in August last year. He admits conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. His former fiancee, Maxine Carr, denies the conspiracy charge and two counts of assisting an offender, claiming she believed her boyfriend was innocent when she gave him a false alibi. Ms Carr, 26, was a classroom assistant at the girls' school. Mr Justice Moses said the "ease" with which the couple lied between the disappearance of the 10-year-olds and their arrest was relevant in judging their courtroom testimony. But their deceit was only proof of the case against them if intended to hide their guilt over the schoolfriends' deaths, he added. He urged the jury to focus on Mr Huntley's account of how the girls died. The caretaker claims that Holly died in his bath accidentally, while Jessica died as he put a hand across her mouth to muffle her screams. Mr Justice Moses told the jurors that they could find Mr Huntley guilty of manslaughter if they believed he had killed the girls and that their deaths had not been accidents, but could not be sure that he had intended to kill them or cause them really serious bodily harm. He also said they should not consider the charges against Ms Carr unless they find the caretaker guilty of murder or manslaughter. He added: "It is idle to pretend this is not a tragic case. "[But] any emotional reaction to the events cannot and must not influence your verdict." He said if the jurors believed the deaths were accidental, they should acquit Mr Huntley entirely.
