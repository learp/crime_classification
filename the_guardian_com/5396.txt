Police today launched a nationwide amnesty in a bid to tackle rising knife crime, encouraging people to hand in their weapons without fear of prosecution.The initiative, the first of its kind for more than a decade, comes after a spate of fatal stabbings, sparking concerns that knife crime is now out of control.Until June 30 people will be able to hand in bladed weapons at secure bins in the reception areas of most police stations in England, Scotland and Wales. A three-week amnesty was also launched today in Northern Ireland.Several recent high profile stabbings have bought the issue into the spotlight, but reducing knife crime has been a home office target for the past three months. Today's launch sees every major police force join the initiative.The amnesty was announced in February by then Home Secretary Charles Clarke, who said: "The message of this campaign is simple - carrying knives on the streets will not be tolerated."More than 1,600 knives and blades have already been handed in under the amnesty. Some police forces may also leave the special red wheelie-bins in churches, supermarkets, schools and youth clubs.The chief constable of British Transport Police and knife crime spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers, Ian Johnston, said the amnesty was aimed at young people at risk of being drawn into knife crime rather than hardened gangsters."In a survey, 46% of youngsters in Newcastle said they carried around a knife with them. That's a horrifying statistic," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."We have got to get the message through: this is illegal, it is very, very dangerous. You could end up yourself being injured or, worse still, on impulse inflicting some mortal injury on a friend."Last week, a promising footballer, Kiyan Prince, 15, died after being stabbed outside the gates of his school, the London Academy in Edgware. Two weeks ago, special constable Nisha Patel-Nasri was stabbed to death outside her home in Wembley, north London.But the families of other stabbing victims questioned the effectiveness of the amnesty, noting that the previous one in 1995 had failed to stem knife crime, and called instead for tougher sentencing.Norman Brennan, director of the Victims of Crime Trust, said the amnesty was little more than a public relations exercise.He called on police chiefs to lobby ministers for mandatory prison sentences of at least five years for anyone caught carrying a knife longer than three inches without reasonable excuse.Frances Lawrence, the wife of Philip, the headmaster whose fatal stabbing outside his school in 1995 led to a knife amnesty that year, said only tougher sentences would combat the rise of knife crime.She told the Today programme: "What I am concerned about is the anomaly between gun crime legislation and knife crime legislation, in that currently knife crime is not seen as being as important as gun crime, so it carries lesser sentences."I know that a lot of young men, in particular, now are choosing to carry knives rather than guns, which they may have done because they feel they will get off with a lesser sentence or not be caught at all. That is extremely worrying."Evidence suggests that the most likely group to carry knives are boys aged between 15 and 16.A Home Office spokesman said ministers were considering proposals to raise the age at which people can legally buy knives from 16 to 18, and could also give teachers power to search pupils for weapons at school.The amnesty involves all legal knives - such as kitchen knives - and offensive weapons, including flick knives, butterfly knives and swords.The police have requested that all offending blades are wrapped in card or paper, partly to prove they are part of the amnesty and partly to prevent injury at the site of delivery.Scotland Yard said only those weapons believed to be significant to police inquiries would be forensically examined.Once the amnesty period has finished, police forces insist they will "robustly" defend the law. Anyone found carrying an offensive weapon in a public place could be imprisoned for up to six months and receive a Â£5,000 fine.Records over the 12-month period following a four-week knife amnesty in Scotland in 1993 found murders fell by 26%, attempted murder by 19% and offensive weapons possession by 23%.
