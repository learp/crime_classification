Three men will appear in court charged with the murder of two teenagers shot in an alleyway.Yahya Harun, 20, Sharmake Abdulkadir, 20 and Fuad Awale, 23, are due at Milton Keynes magistrates court on Friday.The men, who are all from Milton Keynes, are charged in connection with the fatal shooting of Mohammed Abdi Farah, 19, and Amin Ahmed Ismail, 18, on the town's Fishermead council estate on 26 May.Abdulkadir has also been charged with possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.A 17-year-old boy has been released without charge.Both victims were from the Somali community and were known to police for involvement in low-level crime.Superintendent Rob Mason said: "I still believe there are people who have crucial information, but who have not yet come forward and spoken about it."I hope that the fact we have charged three people with this offence will encourage anyone who has been previously too afraid to come forward to find the courage to speak to the police."It is still really important that anyone who has any evidence contacts us."Anyone with information in connection with the incident should contact 0845 8505 505 or Crimestoppers, where information can be given anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
