All prisoners should have access to the internet for educational, rehabilitation and recreational purposes, researchers said today.But inmates should be monitored to check they do not use the internet to plan and commit crimes or access illegal websites, according to charity the Forum on Prisoner Education.Its study, Internet Inside, said providing prisoners with internet access would enable them to pursue more educational courses and training, including Open University degrees. Giving them email would help with their resettlement and rehabilitation by allowing them to stay in touch with friends, families, tutors, lawyers and other professionals, the study added.The researchers also recommended that inmates in England and Wales wanting internet access sign up to an acceptable use policy, as has been done in Switzerland and Denmark.
