The number of prison visits by relatives has fallen at a time when the number of inmates in England and Wales has reached record levels, new figures show.Reformers are calling on the Home Office to address the fall in domestic (as opposed to official) visits.Statistics show that such visits have dropped by a third in the past five years, while in the same period the prison population has risen by 20%.A recently published study of offenders showed that stable family ties were the biggest single factor in keeping offenders out of prison.One third of all prisoners are held in jails more than 50 miles from their homes and a quarter of women prisoners are in jails more than 100 miles from home.Lucy Gampbell, director of the pressure group Action For Prisoners' Families, said yesterday: "The prison system all but ignores the importance of prisoners keeping in touch with their families."Patricia lives in Manchester. Her husband James is in the sixth year of a long sentence. For the first 20 months, he was held in Chelmsford prison, 200 miles from home. She said: "It was a nightmare. It was impossible for me to even consider taking our son." Eric Allison
