Parts of a child's body were found yesterday morning at a former children's home in Jersey. Police have said their search of the area will continue, admitting they cannot rule out the possibility that more bodies will be uncovered.The remains were discovered at the Haut de la Garenne site in St Martin, one of two areas targeted in a Jersey police investigation into alleged child abuse at two former care homes on the island.It is not yet known whether the partial remains, thought to have been buried sometime during the 1980s, are those of a boy or a girl. The remains were found inside the house but the exact location has not yet been given. The Jersey Sea Cadets and Haut de la Garenne care homes were targeted by police last November following a number of allegations of sexual and physical abuse of children aged 11 to 15, dating back over several decades.Jersey's deputy chief police officer, Lenny Harper, said the search of Haut de la Garenne was prompted by specific information received from some of the 140-plus victims and witnesses who had been spoken to as part of a child abuse inquiry.The investigation is focusing on allegations spanning a period from the 1960s up to the early years of the present decade, although the majority of the statements relate to the 1970s and 1980s.Harper said the status of the investigation has changed to a potential major crime inquiry concerning a possible homicide, and police were now in touch with more specialist assistance from the United Kingdom.Jersey's Chief Minister, Senator Frank Walker, said it was 'with deep horror and sadness' that he had learnt of the discovery. 'It is imperative that our children are safe in Jersey and I believe that today they are,' he said. 'It is, however, clear that this may not always have been the case and although we can't right the wrongs of the past, we will do everything in our power to assist the police in seeking out the person or persons responsible.' Built in Victorian times, Haut de la Garenne is a former school and orphanage that today serves as a youth hostel.
