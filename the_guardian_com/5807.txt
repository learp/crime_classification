Rhys Jones was offered a lift home from football practice on the night he was shot dead, Liverpool crown court heard today.But the 11-year-old chose to walk home and was killed after being caught in gang feud crossfire as he passed the Fir Tree pub, in the Croxteth area of Liverpool, on August 22 last year.Steve Goeghegan, the manager of the pub's football team, told the court he had offered Rhys a lift home, but the schoolboy declined and said he preferred to walk.Soon afterwards, Goeghegan heard a loud noise from the direction of the Fir Tree pub and saw Rhys falling as he crossed the pub car park."I thought he'd slipped over, but I went over and immediately realised he was in a bad condition," he told the court.Goeghegan called police and asked Rhys's football coach, Tony Edge, to contact the schoolboy's parents.The court heard a statement from Rhys's mother, Melanie Jones, 43, in which she described how Edge informed her that Rhys had been injured."He was extremely agitated and told me Rhys had been shot," she said.They then drove to the scene of the shooting, where Jones saw police and paramedics treating her son.She said she was in a state of "total shock", adding: "I didn't take anything in."I cradled [Rhys] while the paramedics dealt with him. I then went with my son to Alder Hey hospital, where he was pronounced dead." The prosecution claims Sean Mercer, 18, killed Rhys when he fired three shots across the Fir Tree's car park. He was said to be aiming at members of a rival gang who had strayed onto his territory.The jury has been told that the second bullet hit Rhys in the neck.Mercer, a member of the Croxteth Crew gang, denies murder. James Yates, 20, of Dodman Road, Croxteth, 25-year-old Gary Kays, of Mallard Close, and Melvin Coy, 24, of Abbeyfield Drive, both in the West Derby are of Liverpool, are accused of assisting an offender alongside two boys aged 16 and 17, who cannot be identified.A second 17-year-old boy has been charged with assisting an offender and possessing a firearm and ammunition.All deny the charges.
