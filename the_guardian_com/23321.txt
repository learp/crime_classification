Lembit Opik has said he was targeted by three men who threw powder in his face as he filmed a TV show â€“ and denied the incident was part of celebrations of the Hindu festival Holi taking place nearby.The 49-year-old former MP said the "irresponsible" trio ran towards him and threw the substance from about a metre away in Bloomsbury, central London, on 19 March.Holi revellers traditionally throw coloured powder at each other.

We spent a lot of time in public spaces inviting the public to express their point of view. As we were about to start filming three men ran around the corner, for about 100 feet, and when they got to within a metre they threw the powder into my face and hair and suit and then ran off without saying anything, leaving me in shock."Not one single person who witnessed it suggested for a moment that it was anything to do with the cultural celebrations. This was gratuitous, directed at me. Maybe that was why they had the powder but it was not why they threw it at me."Scotland Yard said that the investigation into the alleged assault had been closed pending the receipt of new information.
