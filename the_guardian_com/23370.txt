One of two brothers jailed for conning thousands of customers into visiting a miserable "Lapland" theme park has been found guilty of threatening a barrister involved in the trial.Henry Mears leaned over prosecuting barrister Gary Lucie and told him "mechanisms are in place" to "hold those responsible" for bringing the case against him and his brother Victor.Later, Henry Mears put his arm around Lucie and "in a jovial way" talked about punching him in the face.Mears, 60, was convicted of contempt of court and sentenced to 28 days imprisonment suspended for a year and told to pay £750 costs.The Mears brothers were jailed for 13 months each for falsely promising a "winter wonderland" at their theme park near Bournemouth.They billed their attraction – dubbed "Crapland" – as a delightful, snowy Christmas kingdom featuring picturesque log cabins, a bustling market, reindeer and even polar bears.Instead of a magical, festive treat, visitors to Lapland New Forest found mud, wooden buildings with the "lightest possible dusting" of fake snow and a broken ice rink.On the eve of their trial, Bristol crown court heard, Henry Mears threatened Lucie, who reported it to the trial judge. A second judge, Carol Hagen, ruled on Tuesday that Mears had been in contempt.She said it was "difficult" to see how Mears's words could be taken as "anything but a threat of retribution".The judge added: "I have no doubt they were spoken in the heat of the moment and that Henry Mears would not have carried out his threat, but I find that using those words in the manner he did, he intended to interfere in the course of justice."Giving evidence, Lucie said he was at his desk when he became aware of Henry Mears standing over him."The judge had risen and Henry Mears came past me and he said to me words to the effect of: 'Mechanisms are in place to hold those responsible for this [trial]. He was leaning over me and it was not said in a jovial way. He was angrily pointing at me. I was shocked, actually. It was not something I have ever experienced before.'"Lucie said the phrase "mechanisms are in place" was so unusual that it took him a few minutes to realise it was a threat.A few minutes later outside court Lucie said Mears put his arm around him and "said something about punching me in the face"."It was said in a jovial way, not very frightening, a jokey type of way which I did not take seriously given the number of people that were there."But Lucie said that the next morning – having spoken to a senior member of his chambers – he raised the matter with the trial judge and withdrew from the proceedings.Mears, of Brighton, said he may have stooped over Lucie because he suffers from a bad back and had been sitting down all day.But he denied using the phrase "mechanisms were in place". "I have never used that term in my whole life," he said. "My parents brought me up to show respect to people and I have always been respectful to Mr Lucie," he said. Mears also denied talking about punching Lucie in the face outside court.The brothers were jailed for misleading advertising but released on licence last month and placed on a home-tagging curfew until the end of their sentence.
