It was the brutal murder of Rana Faruqui, a bright, lively business analyst working in IT, by her ex-partner as she tried to phone the police for help that led Theresa May to get involved in the campaign over the law on stalking.Rana's mother, Carol Faruqui, of Maidenhead, Berkshire, went to see May as her constituency MP, before May became home secretary, and said she wanted to ensure the Thames Valley police and other forces took stalking cases such as her daughter's more seriously.Rana, 35, met Stephen Griffiths at work in 2003. A relationship started and he moved into her home. After several incidents of domestic violence, their relationship faltered. He became obsessive and controlling and she broke it off."In the following months he stalked her, took secret photos, spied on her and turned up wherever she went. He even cut the brakes on her car," her mother has said.On 21 July 2003, the day her car brakes were cut, Rana telephoned the police and reported the incident. Three days later she went into Slough police station and told them again that the brake pipes had been cut."That report passed from inbox to inbox and from officer to officer for 10 whole days. On Saturday 2 August 2003, Stephen Griffiths stabbed and brutally murdered Rana Faruqui," May told MPs when she raised the case in the Commons."I have absolutely no doubt that Thames Valley police failed Rana. They should have taken the issue of the cutting of the brake pipes more seriously. Sadly, Rana's family having had to face the tragedy of her brutal murder, are left with the feeling that had Thames Valley police acted differently, she might be alive today," May said.Griffiths was jailed for life for her murder and a misconduct investigation followed Thames Valley's admission that they should have acted on her telephoned complaint.
