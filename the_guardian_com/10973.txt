Offenders who skip bail are liable to be arrested at work, in the street or at breakfast and taken straight to court, under a crackdown on "bail bandits" which begins today.The blitzes will be run at different times around England and Wales so that defendants subject to a fail to appear (FTA) warrant will have no idea when they may get a knock on the door. Posters, leaflets and letters are already warning them and asking them to surrender of their own accord. The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, who begins the scheme in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, today, said offenders could be instantly jailed for skipping bail, even if the original crime was not serious enough to attract a jail sentence. Nearly one in eight defendants fails to show up at court and an estimated 60,000 FTA warrants are outstanding. Lord Goldsmith said: "They will see that they can't thumb their nose at the criminal justice system. Turning up at court is not optional. It is a serious obligation and we will enforce it." The blitz heralds a permanent change in the way bail bandits will be treated, he said. Courts have the option of hearing a case in the absence of the defendant, he warned.
