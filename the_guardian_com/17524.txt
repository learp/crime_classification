A three-year-old boy a couple were convicted of killing by forcing him to eat salt could have died of natural causes because of a rare condition, the appeal court heard today.Ian and Angela Gay were jailed for five years in January last year for killing Christian Blewitt, who they had planned to adopt and who was on a trial placement with them.The jury at Worcester crown court cleared the couple of murder but convicted them of manslaughter.The prosecution at the trial said the wealthy couple had force-fed the boy with between two and six teaspoons of salt, the equivalent of the salt content of at least 100 packets of salt and vinegar crisps. The Gays had given him the salt as a punishment after he had fallen short of their expectations, the prosecution had claimed.However today, opening the couple's appeal, Michael Mansfield QC told the court of appeal in London that the jury had not been permitted to consider whether the boy could have died from natural causes.He said the jury had been presented with two options: either the couple murdered Christian by blunt force to the head or were guilty of manslaughter through feeding him salt as a punishment.Mr Mansfield asked the three appeal judges to hear fresh expert evidence supporting a third option - that Christian was suffering from a rare condition that allowed sodium levels to build up in the body to the point of overload.The condition could explain why Christian was retaining sodium in his system instead of excreting it through his kidneys, which were functioning normally, he said.After last year's trial, one expert witness for the defence, Home Office pathologist Dr Peter Acland, suggested there was "significant doubt" about the guilty verdict and said he was concerned there might have been a miscarriage of justice.Christian died in hospital four days after being found unconscious in his room on December 8 2002 at the £500,000 house where the couple then lived in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire.Ms Gay, a £200,000-a-year insurance actuary, and her husband have always insisted they loved Christian and his younger brother and sister, who have since been successfully adopted elsewhere.Today Mr Gay, 39, who was an engineer before becoming a house husband, and his 40-year-old wife sat in the dock to hear Mr Mansfield present their appeal, which is expected to last three days.The hearing continues.
