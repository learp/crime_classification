The niece of the Labour MP Quentin Davies is being held in a French prison as part of a murder inquiry after a man was stabbed to death in her apartment in a smart, suburban town west of Paris.Jessica Davies, 28, the niece of the Grantham and Stamford MP who defected from the Conservative party to Labour this summer, was taken into custody last weekend after she called police to her first-floor flat in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, north-west of Versailles.Officers arrived at the flat in the early hours of Sunday morning to find the body of a 24-year-old man who had been stabbed in the throat with a knife. A source close to the investigation told the Guardian that Davies had high levels of alcohol and traces of anti-depressant drugs in her blood. She had met the victim hours earlier in a bar close to her apartment building. Davies, who was born in London and has French and British nationality, was reported to have met the local man that evening in O'Sullivan's Irish pub, where they drank together before they went to her flat. Staff at O'Sullivans said they were cooperating with police.Davies is being held in a women's prison in Versailles, where she is undergoing psychiatric assessment. The public prosecutor's office in Versailles confirmed it had opened a judicial investigation into the murder. Quentin Davies, 63, a senior Tory and former shadow Northern Ireland secretary, crossed the floor to Labour in June. His office did not reply to messages, but had earlier declined to comment.
