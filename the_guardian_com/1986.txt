A British paedophile wanted in connection with the abuse of children as young as 18 months old and selling online child pornography internationally has been arrested in Thailand after more than a decade on the run, officials said today.Charles David Taylor was due to be extradited to Britain, where he was arrested in 1998 and charged with 35 paedophilia-related offences before fleeing to north-eastern Thailand.There, the 66-year-old allegedly continued to abuse children, the Immigration Bureau said in a statement.When British police arrested Taylor at his home in Leicestershire in 1998, they found more than 10,000 pornographic photographs of children on his computer, including images of boys being tortured, sexually abused by adults and having sex with dogs, and video footage of child abuse, the statement said.Thai and British investigators tracked Taylor to the north-eastern Thai province of Nakhon Ratchasima, where he was arrested at a post office on Sunday.A Thai court had issued a warrant for his arrest and extradition in 2001 at the request of British authorities, who accuse him of sexually abusing children aged 18 months to 12 years old.Taylor led Thai police to his flat, where they seized a computer, DVDs of child porn and explicit photos of Thai children and children of other nationalities, the statement said.In Thailand, Taylor "lured children to have sexual activities and released video clips on the internet", the statement added, saying: "He confessed that he would find children to take pictures of and then sell the images on the internet."The British embassy in Thailand confirmed the arrest.
