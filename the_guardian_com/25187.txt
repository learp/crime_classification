Police visibility is going down, according to figures from the latest Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), which covers the 2012-13 financial year. One in three (34%) of UK adults reported seeing a police officer on foot patrol in their local area at least once a week, which was a drop of four percentage points on 2011-12's figure. "Medium" visibility, which the Office for National Statistics (ONS) defines as people seeing police about or less than once a month, absorbed most of the drop in "high visibility" with an increase of three percentage points on the previous year. 27% said they never saw a police officer in their local area in 2012-13. Police visibility: seeing is believingWhat's key about this is that there (pretty obviously) seems to be a direct link between police visibility and how good a job they are rated as doing. For those that reported "high" visibility of the police, 69% rated them as "excellent or good" while 31% rated them as "fair, poor, or very poor".In contrast, those who reported "low visibility", almost half (47%) said police were doing a "fair, poor, or very poor" job. Who sees the police the most?In 2012-13, those who are non-white were much more likely to see the police (53%) at least weekly than white people (31%). Unsurprisingly, those who are unemployed (48%) reported high visibility of the police more than those in employment (35%). People who said there was a high level of anti-social behaviour in their area were more likely to report high visibility (46%) than those with a low level of anti-social behaviour.
