A teenager who ran over and killed his mother has been sent to a young offender institution.Lewis Foster, 19, was drunk and emotional when he got behind the wheel of his Vauxhall Corsa. A landscape gardener, he had spent the afternoon in July last year drinking with his boss in Cornwall, but later got into an argument with his mother, Deborah Jones, when he returned to his family home in St Austell.He began revving the vehicle, causing his mother to come to the lane at the back of the house where the Corsa had been parked and beg him to stop.Foster, who had a provisional licence, said his foot slipped on the clutch, causing the vehicle to spring back and pin his mother underneath the wheels. She was taken to hospital but pronounced dead the following morning with severe multiple injuries.Judge David Ticehurst said the case was tragic, and described Foster's behaviour as reckless, adding: "Had you spent a moment or two thinking about the situation, had you not been drunk, had you not been in a temper, you would not have been here."The judge, sitting at Truro crown court, said he would "temper justice with mercy", sentencing Foster to 12 months' detention after the teenager pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving. He was also banned from driving for four years.
