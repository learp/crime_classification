Devious barristers and ignorant judges have undermined an attempt to improve the conviction rate in rape cases by excluding evidence of the victim's sexual history, with many women still facing the indignity of being cross-examined about their sex lives in court, according to research sponsored by the Home Office.The research, published yesterday, says that rules introduced in 2000 to ban defence barristers from depicting rape victims as promiscuous have been "evaded, circumvented and resisted" with the result that the reform has failed to have any impact. The finding will be a further blow to Home Office ministers and the law officers, who have tried for years to find ways of boosting the low 5.6% conviction rate in rape cases.The study of the case files of more than 400 rape trials says that defence barristers used "devious tactics" to ensure that evidence of the sexual history of the victim was raised in two-thirds of the trials that were observed.The difficulty is compounded by the fact that almost half the judges interviewed by the researchers were unaware of the crown court rules setting out how the ban should work: "Some judges had only a vague knowledge of section 41 [of the 1999 legislation which contains the ban] and few non-legal practitioners and no complainants understood the new law," say the researchers.They found some judges who said they considered the legislation "unnecessary and not a good idea".The Home Office report says that the reform has had no discernible effect on the conviction rate, which has continued to decline. "Complainants regarded the use of sexual history evidence in trials as unjust and an invasion of their privacy. Findings from case files, trial observations and interviews raise the possibility that both prosecution and defence share stereotypical assumptions about 'appropriate' female behaviour and that these continue to play a part when issues of credibility are addressed in rape cases."Defence lawyers still used evidence and "rhetorical devices" to impugn the character of rape victims and make their testimony less credible, and were often unchallenged by the prosecution or the judge.The researchers, Liz Kelly, Jennifer Temkin and Sue Griffiths, say that some defence barristers raise the issue of the previous sexual history of the victim at a very late stage of the trial instead of giving written notice before it starts as they are supposed to.Mike O'Brien, the solicitor general, said last night he had written to the criminal law procedures committee asking it to tighten the rules: "It is important that where it is essential to ask such questions that notice is given before the trial so that victims are not taken by surprise." He said the Bar Council had agreed to set up a training course for barristers involved in rape cases to ensure they deal with the issues involved with greater sensitivity.
