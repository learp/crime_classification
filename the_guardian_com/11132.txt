David Cameron accused Labour yesterday of being in denial about violent crime and urged ordinary citizens to join his "fightback" against the belief that social breakdown is an irreversible fact of modern life.Making his third statement in eight days on what he has dubbed "anarchy in the UK", the Tory leader unveiled a series of measures intended to restore order in the streets but also in the classroom and the music industry.His most eye-catching initiative would put a Tory government in conflict with the music, film and video game industries which, Mr Cameron believes, should show greater social responsibility and less "extreme, casual and callous violence".Some of yesterday's proposals unveiled at a press conference at Westminster predated the recent spate of gun and knife murders. Others reflected thinking to address what the Tories say is a "step change in violent crime on the street" since the mid-90s.For the first time the Tory leader, who was an adviser to Michael Howard when the latter was a hardline home secretary, gave his backing to "honesty in sentencing", a policy that would see criminals serve either a full sentence or a term between a stated minimum and maximum. Officials admit it could lead to renewed overcrowding in cells.Other measures included a curb on police paperwork, easing restrictions on excluding disruptive pupils and tightening licensing laws.Mr Cameron, David Davis, the shadow home secretary, and Nick Herbert, the shadow justice secretary, who acknowledged their debt to US anti-crime strategies, admitted that ultimately only social change could deliver sustainable improvements.Asked if things were now worse than when James Bulger was murdered in Liverpool in 1993 during Mr Howard's tenure, Mr Cameron said: "I think the danger is that, yes, we will all be shocked by these terrible murders but I worry that we will stop being surprised."
