A mother who gave her severely disabled son a lethal heroin injection to end his "living hell" lost her appeal against her life sentence for murder today, but has had her sentence reduced to five years.Frances Inglis, 58, from Dagenham, east London, killed her 22-year-old son Tom in 2008 after he was left in a vegetative state by an accident when he fell out of a moving ambulance.She was ordered to serve a minimum of nine years in January after being found guilty of murder and attempted murder.Though she has never denied deliberately giving him a fatal overdose in his hospital bed – and attempting to do the same on an earlier occasion – she was appealing against both her conviction and sentence.Inglis's case prompted a public outcry and was widely compared to that of another mother, Kay Gilderdale, who helped her 31-year-old daughter to kill herself. Just a week after Inglis was sent to jail, Gilderdale walked free from court with a 12-month conditional discharge.Inglis's husband and two remaining sons backed her after her conviction and were present at the appeal court hearings.Inglis's lawyers argue that the trial judge was wrong not to let the jury decide whether her defence of provocation was valid. She believed her son was in "constant pain", her barrister told the three judges at the court of appeal in London. One of the areas of provocation related to the signs of "pain and terror that she believed from start to finish that Tom was suffering".Inglis was horrified to learn that the only legal way to let him die was to apply to the high court for an order to withhold food and nutrition, which would result in a "slow and painful death".Tom Inglis suffered severe head injuries when he fell out of a moving ambulance in July 2007. He had been trying to get out of the vehicle because he did not want to be taken to hospital after being involved in a minor pub fight.
