Penal reformers last night welcomed emergency measures to cut the record prison population of 79,094 in England and Wales by extending home leave so that up to 30,000 inmates nearing the end of their sentences are released up to 10 days early.Ministers are expected to confirm today that they will introduce the change, known as a transitional home leave, which could free up to 500 extra prison places.The prison population has soared by more than 2,100 in the past year as the courts have become increasingly punitive. There are currently only 700 spare places in the 140 prisons in England and Wales and most of them are in unsuitable low security open prisons.Although John Reid, the home secretary, has promised to provide 8,000 more prison places they may take years to deliver and prison service managers fear that unless emergency measures are taken they will face a crunch period in about six to eight weeks.The 10-day extension in the home leave provisions will not apply to serious violent or sex offenders or to foreign national prisoners.Those who are released early will be subject to recall to prison if they breach the terms of the scheme.The Youth Justice Board confirmed last week that it had asked those running young offenders' institutions to identify those juvenile offenders who could be eligible for early release to relieve the pressure on the juvenile estate.The Prison Service also faced the embarrassing situation on Monday that it could not suspend 14 prison officers facing allegations of corruption at Pentonville prison, London, without reducing the number of prisoners at the jail by more than 100 because it was so close to capacity.Juliet Lyon of the Prison Reform Trust welcomed the minister's attempts to reduce the prison population: "It is good to see the government at last considering how to reduce prison numbers to sensible, safe levels, but bad that this comes as a knee-jerk reaction to a crisis of its own making, driven not by crime rates but by tough political posturing and even harsher sentencing."The Police Federation, however, was unhappy with the move."Prisoners should serve their full sentences and if we need more prisons then let's build them. Whilst the idea being considered by the Home Office may just be to release 10 days early, that's 10 days less rehabilitation and 10 days more to re-offend," said Alan Gordon, the federation's vice-chairman.Colin Moses of the Prison Officers' Association was also critical: "It has been well documented that the prison population has reached an all-time high but that should not mean we simply let convicted prisoners out of prison."This policy has been tried and tested before and failed. The phrase 'short-term gain long-term loss' springs to mind. We currently have about 700 spaces in less secure accommodation. Surely if these prisoners pose no risk to the public they should be transferred to these prisons," he said.
