No action is to be taken against a Conservative MP who was arrested last week on suspicion of sexually assaulting a 29-year-old woman.Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, was arrested in the early hours of last Thursday before being released on bail until mid-July.Having denied any wrongdoing throughout, he was told he was being released from bail.Bridgen said that he had been informed that the woman who made the original allegation had since told officers that no incident had ever occurred.He also said he would be taking legal advice as to what action he could take against those who made the allegation, which is thought to have come from a parliamentary researcher for a different MP. The 46-year-old MP was then arrested at a flat in central London.Bridgen has been married to his wife, Jacqueline, for 11 years and they have two sons. In a statement, he spoke of the hurt the allegations had caused them.He said: "I very much welcome today's announcement from the Metropolitan police in relation to an allegation which was recently made against me. The complainant has today confirmed in an interview with the Metropolitan police that no offence occurred."From the outset, I said the allegation was without foundation, demonstrably and provably false, and I was wholly confident the outcome of the police investigation would see me exonerated. Naturally, I remain hurt and angry that such a ludicrous, false and unsubstantiated allegation should have been given the attention it has."I will now be taking further legal advice about possible action."
