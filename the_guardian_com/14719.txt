Large numbers of criminals are being wrongly acquitted at trial because police are not tape recording the statements of important witnesses, according to two experienced criminal barristers who have written extensively on witness testimony.David Wolchover and Anthony Heaton-Armstrong are calling on Gordon Brown to bring in routine sound or video recording of significant witnesses in cases involving serious offences when he takes over as prime minister.Police video record the evidence of vulnerable witnesses, such as child victims of sexual assaults, and often audio or video record key witnesses in the most serious investigations, such as murder cases.But in the great majority of cases witnesses' statements are written up by police officers supposedly at the "dictation" of the witness during interview. Sometimes statements are typed up later from notes taken during the interview and then shown to the witness for approval."The result may be a seriously distorted version of what the witness actually said, a process which has been dramatically demonstrated by field research," write the barristers in the latest New Law Journal. "Because the content of statements is controlled by what investigators, who record them, choose to include, attempts to use a statement to test consistency often degenerate into farce, with unresolved conflicts over exactly what it was the witness did or did not say to the police - a problem which may be greatly exacerbated where the witness was speaking through the filter of an interpreter."The barristers, each with more than 30 years in criminal practice, say that in their experience by far the most common reason for a not guilty verdict is prosecution witness inconsistency, exposed by defence lawyers during cross-examination."When a witness answering the prosecuting barrister's questions departs in some significant respect from an earlier statement to the police, the defending barrister in cross-examination will embark on a series of standardised ensnaring questions culminating in the witness being confronted with the inconsistency, omission, addition, elaboration or embellishment," they explain.The officer who drew up the statement will then "be torn between selling the witness short or admitting to inattention or error". Witnesses may be made to look unreliable or dishonest, when the officer may have been seriously at fault.In a significant proportion of cases in which the inconsistency relates to a crucial issue in the case, they add, witnesses blame the officer taking the statement."If a significant proportion of such witnesses be right, this will represent a potentially immense number of wrongful acquittals. This is wearily accepted by the generality of advocates, judges and experienced police officers as a fact of life and a blot on English criminal justice."The barristers urged Mr Brown in 1997 to provide funds for recording interviews if his party won the election. They were assured, in a letter from Alan Milburn, then Labour's spokesman on policing, that the party would give serious consideration to implementing it if Labour won. "Now, with Brown's imminent ascent to the highest office, this is an opportune moment to call on him to honour his commitment, reverse a decade of neglect, and at last bring justice to victims," they add.
