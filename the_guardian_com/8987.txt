Police have confirmed that the house fire which killed four people from the same family in Tipton, West Midlands, was deliberately started with an accelerant.The investigation into their deaths is being treated as a murder inquiry. Ajit Singh, 62, and his 60-year-old wife, Gurdish Kaur, died in the blaze, which began in Dudley Port shortly before midnight on Monday. Their daughter, Darshan Kaur, 30, and their 38-year-old daughter-in-law, Palvinder Kaur, also died in the fire. The couple's granddaughter Amarjeet Jaur, 20, was helped from the home by a stranger. She has been recovering in hospital with 10% burns to her body but was well enough yesterday to begin speaking to police about her recollections. Police had initially treated the blaze as suspicious because it engulfed the home with such ferocity. An ambulance arrived within 40 seconds but was unable to do anything to save the occupants.
