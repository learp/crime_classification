Forgive us if we stray onto the subject of the Olympics for a moment. Many of you may be getting a bit jaded of them already.However we just want to focus one aspect of them - ministers and organisers of the games are desperate to ensure that they are not disrupted by protesters. It seems likely that police chiefs will be frantically seeking at this time any intelligence about protests which are being planned by campaigners. It is probably fair to say that intelligence from undercover officers or informants will be at a premium at the moment.Uppermost is their mind of police chiefs will be the example of Trenton Oldfield, who halted this year's Boat Race by swimming into the path of one of the crews. Such protests get a lot of publicity for the cause which the campaigners are promoting.Many would not find it surprising if in the days running up to the Olympics or during the Games, there is a re-run of the wave of arrests which were made by police just before last year's Royal Wedding.In this respect, there was a significant High Court ruling last week.The case was launched by 20 individuals who were among scores arrested or subjected to searches before or on the day of the wedding. They argued that police were unlawfully criminalising legitimate protests before they had taken place, and were "suppressing anti-monarchist sentiment".The High Court judges dismissed their case and in effect endorsed police tactics of pre-emptive arrests - a ruling which strengthens of the hand of the police if they do start arresting campaigners they say are about to disrupt the Olympics.Key to making pre-emptive arrests is of course gathering intelligence - as we saw in the case of Mark Kennedy, who tipped off police about campaigners who were plotting to break into the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in 2009. On that occasion, 114 campaigners were arrested.Last week's High Court ruling gives a few glimpses of the intelligence which was used to arrest or search the activists before the Royal Wedding. It is of course difficult to know where this intelligence came from - it may be a simple matter of police reading websites or leaflets advertising a protest, or it may have originated directly or indirectly from undercover officers.The High Court judgment can be found here and here.Worth looking at is the case of the pair (Theodora Middleton and Dafydd Lewis) who lived at the environmental camp at Heathrow. The camp, known as Grow Heathrow, was set up in what was a derelict site two years ago, with the aim of turning the area into a market garden for the local community and to highlight the environmental damage that would be caused if the airport was expanded.The day before the Royal Wedding, police searched the camp on a warrant which said :"Intelligence provides that Sipson Camp, located at Sipson Village, West Drayton, Middlesex is occupied by activists affiliated to environmental and extreme left wing groups."Intelligence further provides that paint bombs may have been moved to the Sipson Camp for storage which may be utilized for criminal damage."Intelligence also provides that individuals who may wish to disrupt the Royal wedding are also resident at the camp."As it turned out, the intelligence was wrong, as nothing was found during the search of the camp. Who provided the intelligence - an informant or undercover officer, for instance - is not known because the police, as they routinely do, got a gagging order (or in official parlance, a public interest immunity claim) to protect the source.As the Guardian reported here, "in the months leading up to the wedding, a series of demonstrations by students, trade unionists and others saw hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets to protest against government cuts. There were outbreaks of disorder and in one case student demonstrators attacked a car carrying Prince Charles and his wife Camilla. Senior police chiefs said at the time they were planning to take pre-emptive action to ensure there was no repeat of the trouble. Lynne Owens, then assistant commissioner at the Met, told journalists: "We have both overt and covert policing activities ongoing and we will prevent people coming to London to cause criminal behaviour if that is their intention"."Note that word, covert. It is interesting that despite the controversy over Mark Kennedy and other undercover officers, senior police chiefs have attempted to signal that their undercover officers are still in place. For instance, Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, referred to current covert undercover operations when he was questioned at a Metropolitan Police Authority meeting in October 2011.
