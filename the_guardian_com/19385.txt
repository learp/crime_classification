The family of a young jockey who died with another apprentice in a suspected arson attack have paid tribute to him as a "very brave lad" with great potential.Irish-born Jamie Kyne, who was 18, and 19-year-old Jan Wilson, from Scotland, died in a fire at a block of flats in Norton, near Malton, North Yorkshire, in the early hours of Saturday.Two others were treated in hospital following the blaze, which police are treating as suspicious. It is thought to have broken out during a party in the flats.A man in his 30s who was arrested in connection with the incident was released on police bail today.Kyne, who was attached to the trainer John Quinn, was tipped to be crowned apprentice jockey of the year after 29 victories this year.Wilson had been due to ride Imperial Sword, owned by her mother, Margaret, at Thirsk.Kyne's parents, Gerry and Madeline, and his four brothers and younger sister were being comforted by relatives in Claregalway, Co Galway, over the weekend.One of the jockey's cousins, Jarlaith McDonagh, said the Kynes were devastated. "It's a terrible tragedy for the family," he said. "They really admired him. They always watched him racing on television. They were so proud of him."While they still have no confirmation from police it was him, it is nearly certain that it was him.McDonagh, a Galway councillor, said Kyne had grown up surrounded by horses."He had a great love for horses," he said. "He had great potential, he was a very brave lad and he was the right size and weight. He would have made a very fine jockey."Although police have yet to formally identify the victims, friends of Wilson, who was from Forfar in Angus, have begun to leave tributes on her Bebo webpage."I am so proud of you for following your dream, you did it, you did become a jockey. Rest in peace," wrote one.
