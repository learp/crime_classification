They were both partners at a private dental practice in Hurst Park, Cambridge. Stephen Nicoll is understood to divide his time between the Cambridge practice and his clinic in Harley Street, central London. The couple, who both qualified in 1984, met at the Royal Dental Hospital in London. They moved to Frog End about 10 years ago.A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: “They were exceptionally private but perfectly friendly.“The truth of it is they were really busy and put all their energies into their business and family.“They were devoted to the three girls which makes it even more tragic.”Emergency services were called to the house at 6.30am on Friday and sealed off the building.There were reports of a loud noise coming from the property before Nicoll’s death but the neighbour put it down to a thunderstorm that night.“The police presence was quite low-key and at first we thought it was a robbery,” he said.“There is a lot of talk in the village that this isn’t a murder at all.”
