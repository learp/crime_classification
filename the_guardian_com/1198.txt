The only senior policeman facing disciplinary charges over the bungled Stephen Lawrence murder investigation has had four counts of neglect of duty dropped, Scotland Yard said today.Detective Inspector Ben Bullock, who was second in command of the investigation, still faces three further counts at an internal disciplinary hearing, a spokeswoman said. She said: "Following defence submissions yesterday the independent Police Complaints Authority disciplinary tribunal hearing the case against DI Ben Bullock has decided that there is no case to answer on four of the charges of neglect of duty." Mr Bullock put in his retirement papers on June 25, at the start of the full disciplinary hearing, giving notice of his decision to leave the force within 28 days. The Metropolitan Police Federation said he had been advised by doctors to quit because of his failing health.
