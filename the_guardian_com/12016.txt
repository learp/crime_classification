Two brothers have been ordered to repay more than half a million pounds after investigators were unable to recover many of the valuables they snatched, police said today.Matthew and Daniel Mykoo, described as prolific, violent criminals, were jailed last year for a 15-month reign of terror in which they attacked dozens of women.They throttled and threatened victims, including designer Nicole Farhi, before stripping them of jewellery, watches and cash.The Metropolitan police said a judge at Wood Green crown court has ordered them to pay almost £562,000 in costs for stolen items which have not been found.Daniel Mykoo, 29, a crack addict from west London who is serving a life sentence, was told to pay £508,933.Matthew Mykoo, 28, from north-west London, who is serving an indeterminate sentence with a minimum of nine years, was ordered to pay £53,011.The two brothers were jailed last September for a string of robberies, many of which were committed separately, between March 2008 and June 2009.The court heard they used "sudden, terrifying violence" and targeted lone women across London.Detective constable Reg Pickering of Barnet CID said: "The substantial costs the Mykoo brothers have been ordered to pay reflect the sheer volume of offences they have committed."They will be suffering the financial and moral consequences of these crimes whilst they remain in their prison cells."I hope that this sends out a clear message that crime does not pay, and wherever possible, criminals will be ordered to pay out substantial costs which will impact on the rest of their lives."
