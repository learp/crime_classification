The only identified suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann was today being questioned again by Portuguese police.It also emerged that officers plan to interview friends of the parents of the four-year-old, who vanished from the family's holiday apartment at the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz in May.Robert Murat, the only official "arguido", or suspect, in the case, returned to police headquarters in the nearby town of Portimao this morning.Mr Murat, a 33-year-old British expat who lives in a villa around 160 metres from the Ocean Club complex, where the McCann family were staying, was also questioned yesterday.In the second week after Madeleine disappeared, he was questioned for 12 hours. Mr Murat has repeatedly insisted he has nothing to do with the child's disappearance.A spokeswoman for the McCanns said three friends of the family, Rachael Oldfield, Russell O'Brien and Fiona Payne, who were dining with them on the night Madeleine disappeared, would be interviewed by Portuguese police today.Speaking on behalf of the trio, Ms Oldfield said they were "more than happy to help the police". "All of us want to do anything we can to help find Madeleine and reunite her with her loving parents," she said.The McCanns, of Rothley, Leicestershire, have run a high-profile appeal for information about her whereabouts, backed by sports stars and wealthy business people.They have made trips to Morocco and around Europe to appeal for help, and also had a brief audience with the Pope in Rome.However, despite a number of reported sightings of Madeleine in Portugal and elsewhere, police investigating her disappearance appear to be without clear leads.
