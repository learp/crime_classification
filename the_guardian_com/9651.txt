Maximum on the spot fines for dropping litter, failing to clear up dog mess or scrawling graffiti were today increased from £50 to £80.The increase is part of a range of new powers allowing local authorities to impose stiffer penalties for antisocial behaviour.People who leave household rubbish out at the wrong times will also face fines of up to £110 from today, while so-called white van men and businesses without proper documents for disposing of rubbish can be fined up to £300. The measures came into force the day after Labour launched its manifesto for the May 4 council elections, which stressed a stance against antisocial behaviour.They are part of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act, the majority of which is now fully in force. Local authorities will now be able to enter properties to turn off blaring burglar alarms, and can require people to have alternative key holders and tell councils who they are. There are also new penalties for vehicle owners who cause a nuisance by repairing them on the street, and other measures include charging stores for the recovery of abandoned shopping trolleys and allowing councils to remove abandoned cars more quickly.Ben Bradshaw, the minister for the local environment, said authorities had asked for the powers and should use them. "The powers we have given them are easier to use, more effective and more cost efficient than anything they have had before," he said. "And I see no reason why we won't start seeing a marked difference in the quality of our neighbourhoods within the next two or three years."
