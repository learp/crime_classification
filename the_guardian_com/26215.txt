Charles Bronson, labelled Britain's most violent prisoner, suffered a court defeat yesterday in his attempt to begin a new life on the outside after 30 years behind bars.Although three appeal judges rejected his challenge to a hostage-taking conviction and a life sentence, he was given a glimmer of hope in his fight for freedom. Lord Justice Rose, sitting with two other judges at the Old Bailey, said that in light of Bronson's increasing age and maturity and his marriage, he may now be a "rather different" person to the man sentenced at his trial in 2000. The court ruled the discretionary life sentence was properly imposed by the trial judge, but the date at which "the appellant is fit for release" was now a matter for the parole board. Lord Justice Rose said Bronson, 51, had acted "calmly and with dignity" throughout the appeal hearing. Bronson, who has now converted to Islam and adopted the name of Ali Ahmed following his marriage to Saira Ali Ahmed in June 2001 at Wood hill maximum security prison in Milton Keynes, told the judges of his love for his wife. Surrounded by prison officers, he said he was now a "drastically" changed man, and announced: "I am ready to go home. I have had enough."
