A football coach was last night charged with murdering Kate Beagley, 32, the woman who was missing for five days after going on a date. Her body was found early yesterday morning at a beauty spot near Watford in Hertfordshire.Surrey Police said that Karl Joseph Taylor, 27, from central London, had been charged with murder; he was arrested on Friday night on suspicion of kidnap, and later re-arrested on suspicion of murder.Ms Beagley was last seen by her father on Wednesday at around 6.30pm at his home in south-west London.Police said that she left him planning to travel to her flat at Walton-on-Thames in Surrey, to prepare for a date with a man she had met at the CC Club at the Trocadero in Piccadilly, central London, the week before.She had called a friend on her mobile phone at 8.20pm that night, to say she was in Chiswick in west London; and she had sent a text to another friend, at 8.50pm, saying she was in Richmond.Sources said a police officer on duty that night logged Ms Beagley's grey VW Golf being driven erratically north over Chiswick bridge, in the opposite direction from her home, just before midnight.The officer made a note of the registration and logged the vehicle because of the way it was being driven. It is not known whether Ms Beagley was the driver.Forensic teams were last night continuing to examine the scene at Oxhey woods near Watford , where the body was found. Formal identification has yet to take place; a post mortem examination is due to be carried out tomorrow.Mr Taylor will appear in Staines magistrates' court today.
