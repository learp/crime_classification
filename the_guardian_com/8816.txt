Gordon Brown has ordered the restoration of a 101 national non-emergency phone number to report crime and antisocial behaviour ‑ three years after the scheme pledged in Labour's 2005 general election manifesto was axed.The prime minister also redefined the national policing pledge to promise that neighbourhood police teams will spend 80% of their time on the beat. The current policing pledge promises only that neighbourhood officers will spend 80% of their time on frontline duties "visibly working in your neighbourhood". Brown's modified formulation has alarmed senior police officers, who argued there was a significant difference in meaning. For example, attending monthly public meetings or tackling problem families ‑ both of which took officers off the street ‑ would no longer count towards the pledge.The revival of the national 101 non-emergency number is part of a pre-election law and order package that includes tightening the law surrounding antisocial behaviour orders and giving repeat victims a "guarantee of protection" to ensure that cases such as Fiona Pilkington's do not happen again.In a speech in Reading Brown said that he had asked the home secretary, Alan Johnson, to set out a new range of measures on antisocial behaviour, including clear national standards, a faster process for applying for asbos, tougher action when they are breached, and plans for the 101 number. He also accused the Conservatives of "ramping up a public sense of panic" on crime figures to fuel the fear of crime and support their claim that society is broken in Britain.Brown said the national non-emergency number was needed to make it as easy to complain about antisocial behaviour as it is to ring 999 for an emergency.The Home Office said today that it planned to have the 101 helpline in place by March 2012. The original proposal put forward in the 2005 Labour election manifesto was designed to take the pressure off the 999 emergency service by diverting less urgent calls.The scheme was piloted in five areas, with the public charged 10p a call, but was discontinued during John Reid's tenure as home secretary after a greater than anticipated £1.8m had been spent on the service. An official Home Office evaluation revealed that during the trial the hotlines were swamped with "inappropriate calls" such as "I'd like someone to test my smoke alarm" and "can you tell me the time of the next bus to Southampton?".The volume of calls to 999 in the pilot areas barely changed.The Home Office said that the new service would draw on the lessons of the more recent, and still running, 101 Cymru service in Wales, and that national rollout would depend on "a suitable infrastructure which provides value for money" for the police, Whitehall and the public.Brown also promised in persistent antisocial behaviour cases where the police or local authorities had failed to act, victims are to be given a "guarantee of protection". This is to enable them to get support in securing a court injunction, with their legal bills paid by the agency that had previously let them down.
