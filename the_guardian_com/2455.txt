Five "prime suspects" in the murder of Stephen Lawrence today issued a statement denying any involvement in the black teenager's death. The statement was issued immediately after Gary Dobson, the last of the group, finished giving his evidence to the London public inquiry into the killing. The badly-spelled, hand-written document began: "In 1993 we were all arrested for the murder of Steven [sic] Lawrence, which we all vehemently deny. We do sympathise with Mr and Mrs Lawrence and the tragic loss of their son. .. We have no knowledge of this murder, we were not involved, we did not kill Steven [sic] Lawrence." The statement continued: "Others have used the media - this case has been twisted and sensationalised. We have been powerless to have our side put across or our account given, without fear of our words being manipulated or distorted for the media's sensationalism... Throughout all these proceedings there has never been a case against us which stands up to any form of scrutiny." At 2pm, 15 minutes after Gary Dobson finished giving evidence, more than 100 demonstrators blocked three lanes of traffic on the road outside the shopping centre beneath the inquiry building. The crowds had gathered at the bottom of a ramp down which the five men were expected to leave the inquiry. Scuffles broke out as 30 police officers formed a line across the road. Some missiles were thrown at police, hitting at least one officer, but other demonstrators appealed for calm and the scuffles ended quickly.  Earlier, the mother of another suspect, David Norris, was urged not to influence her son as he gave evidence to the inquiry. Teresa Norris sat directly opposite David as he answered questions from Michael Mansfield QC, counsel for the Lawrence family. She could be seen nodding and shaking her head as her son answered questions.
