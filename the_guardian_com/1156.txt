One of the three people jailed over the death of Baby Peter lost a bid today to take an appeal over his conviction for the rape of a two-year-old girl to the highest court in the country.In an announcement lasting just a few minutes, Lord Judge, the lord chief justice, refused an application by Steven Barker for leave to appeal to the supreme court.Barker, 33, lost a court of appeal challenge over the conviction in January.Lord Judge, sitting at the same court in London today, ruled that Barker's case did not raise any "point of law of general public importance. That, therefore, is the end of the matter."Barker was handed a 12-year sentence for causing or allowing the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, but he was also jailed for life with a minimum term of 10 years after being convicted of rape at a separate trial.Barker had claimed he did not have a fair trial and his rape conviction was "unsafe".But his challenge was rejected by Lord Judge, Lady Justice Hallett and Mrs Justice Macur in January.They also dismissed his appeal against sentence.At the time Lord Judge said: "All the reports upon the appellant indicate that he is a danger to young children."Peter's mother Tracey Connelly, 28, of Tottenham, north London, and lodger Jason Owen, 37, of Bromley, south-east London, were also jailed over the child's death.Peter Connelly was found dead in a blood-spattered cot in August 2007.He had more than 50 injuries, including fractured ribs and a broken back, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, doctors and police over eight months.Barker was told by the sentencing judge he played a major role in Peter's death.Barker and Owen, who are brothers, were convicted by a jury of causing or allowing the death of a child at a trial, while Tracey Connelly pleaded guilty to the charge.
