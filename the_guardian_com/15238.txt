A murder investigation has been launched after the bodies of two men were found on a country road on the outskirts of Bradford.West Yorkshire police said the bodies were discovered by a passing motorist in New Lane near its junction with Raikes Lane in Bradford at about 10.20pm on Tuesday. Neither victim has been identified.A police spokesman said that a forensic examination of the scene was being carried out. Police cordons, each more than 200m from the scene, were in place at either end of New Lane. At the junction of New Lane and Tong Lane, the A58, a police van and a police car guarded the entrance and a helicopter circled overhead.Detective Superintendent Dick Nuttall said: "We are examining the possibility that these bodies were left on New Lane following an attack. I am particularly interested in hearing from anyone who was in the area of New Lane or Raikes Lane at the time or saw anything suspicious."This is a rural and quiet area of Bradford and people may have noticed any unusual activity, especially at this time of night. At this stage, we have not recovered any weapons; however, forensic officers are currently examining the scene."Nuttall said the two victims were in their mid-20s to 30s and his team of officers were trying to establish their identities.He would not comment on reports that the two men had been beaten. He also said he did not want to speculate on their nationalities until they had been identified.The detective said officers would be patrolling the area to offer reassurance and speak to residents about any concerns. The area where the bodies were found is open countryside – green meadows with pockets of woodland – just a mile or two from the suburbs of south Bradford.
