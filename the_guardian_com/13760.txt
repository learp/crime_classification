A man accused of plotting a terrorist attack on London believed he had a good excuse for having a bomb-making manual, the Old Bailey has heard.In a case that is being heard largely in secret, Erol Incedal has admitted possession of the five-page document, found on a memory card hidden inside his iPhone case when he was arrested last year.On Monday, Incedal, 26 – a law student from south London – also said that while he had not viewed the contents of the memory card, he accepted that he was aware of the sort of documents stored on it.Asked by Joel Bennathan QC, defending, “whether you believe you had reasonable excuse or not” for being in possession of the material, Incedal replied: “I believe I did, yes.”Due to the secrecy surrounding the case, Incedal’s explanation for this belief is expected to be heard in camera, with the public and the press excluded from court.Significant parts of the trial are being held in secret, with the prosecution describing it as an exceptional case. After media organisations appealed against plans to hold the entire trial in secret, the court of appeal ruled that its core should still be heard behind closed doors, but that the media should be able report some sessions.In an unprecedented arrangement, 10 journalists have been permitted to hear some of the secret sessions. They are prohibited from reporting what they have heard, however, and are expected to surrender their notebooks to court officials at the end of each session. The notebooks are locked in a safe inside court. A review is to be conducted at the end of the trial, to determine what the journalists may then make public.The court heard that the memory card contained a number of bomb-making instructions. In a statement, Alison Mansfield, a senior case officer at the forensics explosives laboratory at Fort Halstead, Kent, said that while some of the material was “over-elaborate and some farcical”, other parts gave accurate instructions for the production of a variety of viable explosive substances and a detonator.The jury also heard that a listening device hidden inside Incedal’s Mercedes 13 days before his arrest picked up conversations in which he discussed plans to buy a firearm, and discussed Islamic State and a trip to Syria.Giving evidence at the start of the third week of his trial, Incedal told the jury that his father’s family were Kurdish communists and that his mother was from a Turkoman background, and her family were Alawites.His father had died when he was six weeks old, and he had arrived in the UK with his mother and siblings when he was around one. An elder sister had subsequently died while fighting with the Kurdish separatist group, the PKK.Incedal told the jury that he had been excluded from his primary school and threatened with expulsion from his secondary school, and had a conviction for attempted theft, an offence committed when he was 12.He had started attending a mosque during Ramadan, aged around 14, as it was the only way he was allowed to leave school at lunchtime. Initially, he said, he would pretend to go to a mosque, but instead spend lunch in kebab shops and bookmakers’ shops. He eventually agreed to go to a mosque with other boys, but only because he “didn’t want them to grass us up”.He then became involved with the global Islamic religious movement Tablighi Jamaat, which he said gave him the opportunity for “self-rectification”, and a chance to learn more about Islam. He travelled widely with the group – to Greece, India, Bangladesh and New York.He was married at the age of 17, and he and his wife and children have experienced periods of homelessness, as well as living in temporary accommodation. After embarking on a course at London’s South Bank University, studying law and accountancy, his only income was a student loan.Incedal denies two terrorism charges. The first, brought under section 5(1) of the Terrorism Act 2006, states that between 1 February 2012 and 14 October 2013 he intended to commit acts of terrorism or assist another to commit them.The second charge, under the Terrorism Act 2000, states that he is accused of possessing a document on or before 13 October last year that is likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.Incedal was arrested in October last year after police shot out the tyres of his car, in which he was travelling with a friend, Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar.The jury has heard that Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, also 26 and from south London, has admitted possession of the documents after they were discovered on an identical memory card, also hidden inside his iPhone case. He will be sentenced after Incedal’s trial.The jury has been told that Incedal was preparing to mount an attack that could have been against a small group of people or a single prominent person. Alternatively, the prosecution alleges, he may have been planning an indiscriminate attack on a hotel, like that mounted in Mumbai, India, in 2008.The trial continues.
