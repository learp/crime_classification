A damning report on a troubled women's jail, which officials sat on for two years, today found failures by prison warders contributed to the self-inflicted deaths of six women.The report into the deaths of six inmates at Styal prison in Cheshire by the prisons ombudsman, Stephen Shaw, was completed two years ago but only published in full today.His inquiry followed the death of Julie Walsh, 39, who died two years ago while on remand at the jail. She was the sixth woman to die at the prison in just over a year.Mr Shaw's recommendations - leaked in April this year - included a warning that the current use of imprisonment for women is "disproportionate, ineffective and unkind".He said the six women were all vulnerable, and many had a history of drug abuse and in some cases unstable living arrangements or mental health problems. But failures by staff had contributed to their deaths, he added.Ms Walsh, from Liverpool, died on August 12 2003 after drinking the drug dothiepin - stolen at about 7.30pm from a drugs trolley by an unknown person or persons. At the time she was on a heroin withdrawal programme, having used the drug since the age of 18.Ms Walsh later began bleeding and fitting, and was pronounced dead at 11.40pm. Four other women who also drank the medication survived.The ombudsman said there was "inadequacy of the regime and procedures" in place at Styal at the time, particularly on the jail's Waite wing, where five of the six deaths occurred.The prison governor and Prison Service area manager should consider whether further changes should be made to the drug administration regime to avoid a repetition of the incident, said Mr Shaw.A four-page summary of his report, including an action plan, was published in January by the then prisons minister, Paul Goggins.The other women who died were identified in the report as Ms A, who hanged herself on August 10, 2002; Ms B, who hanged herself on November 26, 2002; Ms C, who apparently smuggled a dose of dothiepin into the jail on arrival and overdosed on January 18, 2003; Ms D, who died on April 20, 2003, and Ms E, who died on June 4, 2003, both of whom also hanged themselves.
