Sir Paul Stephenson insisted yesterday he would lead the Met in his own way and focus on listening to Londoners rather than forcing policing upon them.On his first day as Met commissioner, the 55-year-old former chief constable of Lancashire said he wanted the Met to be in the news for the good work it carried out rather than for what he as commissioner did or said.Stephenson, who takes over after the controversial years of Sir Ian Blair, said: "Every day you encounter things on the tricky side of difficult. The Met is always going to have difficult issues to face every day. It is our job to make sure we manage that. I am not guaranteeing there won't be turbulence in future."Stephenson, who acted as Blair's deputy for four years, said he was focused on terrorism, knife crime among young people, and volume crimes such as burglary and car theft.He said the Met - unlike many other forces - was showing a reduction in burglaries, despite the tough economic situation.Appointed by the home secretary and the mayor of London, he denied he would be beholden to politicians. "Sir Ian Blair did it his way and I was his loyal deputy now I will do it my way," he said.Securing the streets for members of the public was a key issue, he added. "The Met has been quite impressive in reducing crime and improving performance, but it has a wide range of priorities and right at the top is protectiong Londoners from terrorism, playing a national role in leading the anti-terrorism effort, tackling knife crime amongst young people, murders of young people - these are all huge priorities."He also acknowledged that restoring the morale of his 31,000 officers was important. "We need to make sure the heart of the Met is beating and the heart of the Met is pride in the badge."
