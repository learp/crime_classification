The final steps of Joanna Yeates have been reconstructed in an attempt to jog memories and catch her killer.The 25-year-old's last journey, which started after she left work on 17 December, was retraced by an actor and filmed for BBC1's Crimewatch programme.Separately, police confirmed Yeates did not eat a pizza she was seen buying on her way home, just before she went missing.The reconstruction focused on what the landscape architect did after she left the premises of her employers, BDP.She went first to the Bristol Ram pub on Park Street in Bristol city centre, where she spent about two hours having Christmas drinks with work colleagues. She left at about 8pm to make the 30-minute walk home to the ground floor flat in Canynge Road, Clifton, that she shared with her boyfriend, Greg Reardon, 27.She was seen on CCTV in a Waitrose supermarket at the Clifton Triangle, then went to a Tesco Express in Clifton village where she bought a pizza.The actor playing Yeates entered the Tesco Express dressed in the same style of cream-coloured coat as the murder victim.She also had a black rucksack and was carrying two plastic bags – a white one, which held bottles of cider Yeates bought at Bargain Booze, and a black one – its contents have not been revealed but police say they are not significant.Inside the store the actor was filmed picking up a Tesco Finest mozzarella, tomato and basil pesto pizza, then paying at a self-service till with a £10 note. After receiving her change the actor left the store and headed up Regent Street towards Yeates's home.Avon and Somerset police said she had not eaten the pizza before she was found dead on Christmas Day three miles from her flat.She had made it home to her flat because her shoes, coat, mobile phone, purse and keys were found there. The pizza, the wrapping and its box were not found.The BBC Crimewatch film will air next Wednesday.The force has received more than 1,800 leads since launching the murder investigation but key evidence including one of the ski socks she was wearing and the pizza have not been found.Detectives are investigating whether the sock was used to strangle her, then kept as a trophy.Detective Chief Inspector Phil Jones, who is leading the murder investigation, said: "The [Crimewatch] programme allows us to visually recreate the route home she took with the aim of jogging the memories of those people who may have seen her."The reconstruction may also jog the memories of those people who used Longwood Lane in Failand on Friday December 17 or over that weekend and have not come forward. This is a valuable opportunity for us to reach out to the nation in their homes."Reardon reported his girlfriend missing when he returned to Bristol on 19 December after a weekend visiting family in Sheffield.Yeates was not seen again until dog walkers found her snow-covered body in Longwood Lane, Failand, north Somerset on Christmas morning.Police have said there is no evidence Yeates was sexually assaulted but they have not ruled out a sexual motive.Her landlord was held for three days for questioning before being released on bail.Anyone with information is asked to contact the Operation Braid incident room on 0845 456 7000 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
