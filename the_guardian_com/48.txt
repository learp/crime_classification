Cash-strapped councils are switching off street lights at night to save money. It may not make us any more unsafe, but walking down unlit roads can send our fear of crime rocketing – especially at this time of year, according to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, which campaigns on personal safety. Here's its advice.• Keep on busy streets for as long as possible, where there is light from traffic or shop windows. Walk towards oncoming traffic so you are not approached by kerb crawlers. Take a torch for any sections where this is not possible.• Carry a personal alarm. If you set this off in an attacker's ear it should disorientate them so you can run away.• Don't keep your keys in your hand – you may drop them if you get frightened. Just keep them within reach.• Don't chat on your phone, as this can distract you. Instead, phone a friend and tell them where you are, and when you expect to be home.
