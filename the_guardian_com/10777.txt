A rocket launcher and a warhead have been recovered at a house in Belfast by police investigating the activities of dissident republicans, police said.The discovery was made following a search of an address in the west of the city on Monday evening.Homes in the area were evacuated while army bomb disposal officers examined the itemslater taken away for forensic examination. It was unclear if the devices were improvised.A Police Service of Northern Ireland spokesperson said: "Detectives from PSNI serious crime branch have this evening recovered a rocket launcher and warhead from a house. The search was conducted in relation to ongoing dissident republican activity."The government's choice of Northern Ireland as the location for this year's G8 summit was questioned by the chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, who described the decision as "unbelievable".Nearly 3,000 officers from forces in Britain have volunteered to take part of the security operation for the summit in June, according to the PSNI."I find it strange that Northern Ireland was chosen as a venue, bearing in mind the amount of pressure and the working conditions that the PSNI is under just now," said Brian Docherty. "Officers are under threat every day. It is a whole different form of policing from that we know back in (mainland) UK."To enter G8 into that particular mix, I find it unbelievable. I find it strange that they would do that."Earlier this month, police in the Republic of Ireland intercepted a suspected dissident haul of rocket launchers and explosives in County Tipperary which were believed to be en route to Northern Ireland. Dissident republicans were also blamed for two pipe bomb attacks in north Belfast at the end of January.
