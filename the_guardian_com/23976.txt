The maximum jail sentence for people smugglers will be increased to 14 years in a crackdown on the illegal trade in human trafficking, the home secretary, David Blunkett, announced today.Mr Blunkett revealed the tougher punishment for criminals who usually work in organised gangs and charge desperate refugees huge amounts to enter Britain illegally.The current penalty of 10 years is likely to be increased to 14 under proposals in the immigration, asylum and citizenship white paper, expected next month."We need to start getting much tougher with them," said Mr Blunkett."I'm intending to legislate to expand the penalty for smuggling and trafficking from 10-14 years to send a signal to those who actually feel there's nothing evil about the way in which they take and use the lives of others, often exploiting them when they are here, having got them here illegally claiming neither nationality of asylum status."
