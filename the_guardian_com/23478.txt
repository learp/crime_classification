A man who escaped from a prison van while travelling to a trial for firearms offences has been arrested in Amsterdam.Anthony Downes has been on the run since last July after a gang ambushed a van on Manchester's ringroad that was bound for Liverpool crown court.At the time, Downes, 26, was facing trial for conspiracy to possess firearms with intent to endanger life and conspiracy to cause damage with intent to endanger life. One of his co-defendants, Kirk Bradley, 26, from Formby, also fled from the prison van and remains wanted by Merseyside police.Six defendants, including Downes and Bradley, went on trial last May but the case was halted in its 11th week when the two men absconded during a journey from Strangeways prison.Both of the missing men were convicted in their absence last week at Woolwich crown court in London. Before the retrial, three of their co-accused admitted charges of possessing firearms and causing criminal damage with intent to endanger life. They are all due to be sentenced on Thursday.Another man on trial, Colin Fitzgibbon, faces a retrial in June after the jury was unable to reach agreement on a charge against him.Merseyside police said on Tuesday: "Downes was arrested in Amsterdam on Friday on suspicion of possession of a firearm and as a result of an outstanding European arrest warrant."During the court case at Woolwich, jurors heard how Downes and Bradley engaged in a two-year campaign of intimidation in which people were shot and grenades were thrown at family homes. Downes was said to be at the top of a gang that carried out attacks for others in the Liverpool underworld.Woolwich crown court heard that the home of a wealthy businessman living in the same street as Kenny Dalglish, the Liverpool football manager, was the target of two shootings. John Ball hired a security guard to keep watch on his home in Southport following the attacks in March and June 2009, the court was told.He is also believed to have been the target of a failed grenade attack on 26 July 2009. The device was left on Dalglish's wall by one of two men who ran off when police officers arrived at the scene, the court was told.The court also heard how a paramedic was mistakenly shot in his own home and a man had to have his leg amputated after being shot in a phone box.
