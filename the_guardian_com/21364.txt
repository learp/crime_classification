Families who commit crimes, have chronic drug abuse problems and fail at school and in the job market are being targeted by a Conservative-controlled council hoping to cut their cost to the state.Westminster council has identified 600 families who it says "have a long-term negative effect on society as a whole". The authority is looking at ways of changing their behaviour in a pilot of ideas mapped out by the Conservative leader, David Cameron.The move comes as the government is examining US initiatives which aim to focus state intervention on the most socially excluded pockets of urban areas which cost society a disproportionate amount in dealing with recurring problems of crime, drugs, mental health issues, poor education and joblessness.Westminster council's programme, set out by its leader, Sir Simon Milton, points out that some families are dealt with by up to 20 different bodies: "These are the families at highest risk of social exclusion, whose problems bring them into contact with a range of statutory and voluntary agencies, on whom a disproportionate amount of public funding is spent, and for whom the outcomes, in terms of overall quality of life, and life chances for their children, are often the worst."The council says that this 3% minority have a "marked negative effect on their community", adding: "They tend to be responsible for a significant proportion of local crime and disorder, and of low-level nuisance. In addition, factors such as low social and academic skills, low educational achievement and worklessness, while they may not directly affect others at the time, have a long-term negative effect on society as a whole."Westminster says that these families represent a "significant burden on the taxpayer in terms of welfare benefits, social care, healthcare, criminal justice and educational support". By intervening earlier, the council hopes they will become less dependent on such high-cost services.The council plan includes action by the police. Commander Steve Allen, in charge of policing in Westminster, said: "The police will be part of a forum who will identify families and neighbourhood groups who represent the biggest demand on public services. "Some of the responses might involve enforcement for things like persistent antisocial behaviour, domestic violence, or drugs coming in and out of an address."We will be looking to shift resources from paying for failure to giving people an opportunity to succeed. "In some circumstances individuals might be given conditional cautions, meaning that if they breach the conditions they'll be brought back to court. "It will be a halfway house, giving people the opportunity to ameliorate their behaviour."The council hopes to have multi-agency teams in place by the beginning of next year.
