A string of foreign politicians and officials were named today as having received corrupt payments from a major British export firm. The company admitted it had systematically paid the bribes around the world to win contracts.The bridge-building firm, Mabey & Johnson, is the first major British company to be convicted of foreign bribery. Many of its contracts were financially backed by the British taxpayer.The bribery allegations were first revealed in the Guardian five years ago.At Southwark crown court, London, John Hardy QC, for the Serious Fraud Office, told the judge that more than a dozen named top officials in six countries could be implicated in bribe payments by the Reading-based firm, owned by one of Britain's wealthiest families.In Ghana several former ministers and officials were identified by the SFO. Ministers and officials in Angola, Mozambique, Bangladesh, and Jamaica were also bribed, Hardy told the court.One of those on the list is Zina Andrianarivelo-Razafy, a diplomat who represents Madagascar at the United Nations and was previously the country's ambassador to the United States.Jamaican politician Joseph Hibbert, identified as an alleged recipient of the bribes last year, has now resigned from the government, saying he would clear his name.The court was told the firm routinely paid bribes through covert middlemen to foreign politicians to get export orders. The Mabey family built up a fortune of more than £300m by selling steel bridges around the world.This first conviction has been hailed as a landmark by the British government, which has been heavily criticised for failing to prosecute any British firm for foreign bribery. The government pledged in 1997 to crack down on corrupt exporters, but no one has been prosecuted until now.Mabeys pleaded guilty to corruption in a pioneering deal with the SFO. It is the first time that the agency has concluded such a US-style plea bargain for corruption.With the agreement of the SFO, the firm has offered to pay total penalties of £6.5m. Some would be paid as a form of reparations to the foreign governments.A monitor would also be installed at the firm for three years to check that no more bribes are paid. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin is due to sentence the firm at the end of today's proceedings.Mabeys say it has reformed its behaviour and stopped making corrupt payments.Anti-corruption campaigners The Corner House were the first to level allegations of bribery at Mabey & Johnson in 2004. Mabeys, which has made donations to the Conservative party, denied the claims, dismissing the campaigners as "a self-professed anti-corporate NGO based in Dorset and boasting just three members".Sue Hawley, of The Corner House, said today: "A remarkable pattern of corruption has now been exposed. It is time for other companies to clean up their act."Mabeys has also pleaded guilty to sanctions-busting by paying £363,000 to Saddam Hussein's government in 2001-2 – the first time the British government has prosecuted a company for breaking those sanctions.Overseas politicians and officials named by the SFO as implicated in bribery by Mabey & Johnson included the following:GhanaAto Quarshie (former roads minister)Saddique Boniface (minister of works)Amadu Seidu (former deputy roads minister)Edward Lord-Attivor (chairman inter-city transport corp)George Sipa-Yankey (health minister)MadagascarZina Andrianarivelo-Razafy (permanent representative at the UN)Lt-Col Jean Tsaranazy (former public works minister)JamaicaJoseph Uriah Hibbert (former works minister)AngolaAntonio Gois (former general manager state bridges agency)João Fucungo (former director state bridges agency)MozambiqueCarlos Fragoso (former head of DNEP, directorate of roads and bridges)BangladeshKhandaker Rahman (chief engineer, roads & highways department)
