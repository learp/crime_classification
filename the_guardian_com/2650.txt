The independent communities and victims panel, convened by Nick Clegg in place of an official inquiry into England's riots in August, has begun collecting evidence for its report, which is expected in March 2012.The panel, convened two weeks ago, is launching a website accepting submissions from anyone affected by the disturbances or others who wish to express a view. Contributors are invited to give their views on the motivation of rioters, why riots happened in some areas and not others, the role of public services and policing, and what could be done to prevent future riots.All evidence received by the panel will be made public, unless there are particular reasons, such as victim confidentiality, for not doing so.Jobcentre Plus chief executive Darra Singh will chair the panel, which comprises Simon Marcus, who chairs the Boxing Academy charity, Heather Rabbatts, the barrister and businesswoman, and Maeve Sherlock, who has been chief executive of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Refugee Council. Panellists were nominated by England's three major political parties.Singh said the team would produce an initial report in November and a final document in March, so as to contribute to policy making in the wake of the disturbances.."We're casting a very wide net," he said. "We want to create mechanisms so anyone who wants to give their views can do so. We don't want to pre-judge, we want to listen to victims and communities."One objective is to understand the motivations of the small minority who rioted, either by speaking to organisations working with them, or to those individuals directly â€“ but we haven't worked out how yet."Singh stressed his panel was independent of government, but would use information from studies commissioned by the Cabinet office, plus Ministry of Justice statistics, to inform his report when they were available.The Guardian and LSE's Reading the Riots collaboration, which aims to speak to hundreds of rioters and their families to build a picture of the causes and consequences of England's riots, would also be followed closely by the official report team, Singh said.
