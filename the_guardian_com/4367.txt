Key scientific evidence allegedly linking two men to the murder in Northern Ireland of two soldiers who were preparing to fly out to Afghanistan has been ruled out.A judge ruled on Wednesday that soil samples the crown claims connect the accused to the fatal shooting outside Massereene army base in Antrim two years ago cannot be admitted in court.Mr Justice Anthony Hart said it would be prejudicial to the defence if reports from Dr Patricia Wiltshire were admitted without her being present. She is unable to attend for cross-examination because of ill health. There is also expert evidence that contradicts her findings.Brian Shivers and the Lurgan republican Colin Duffy deny the murder of Sappers Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar, who died in a sustained gun attack outside the military base in March 2009.Quinsey, 23, and Azimkar, 21, were shot dead by the Real IRA as they collected pizzas with comrades.Duffy, 44, from Forest Glade in Lurgan, Co Armagh, and Shivers, 46, from Sperrin Mews in Magherafelt, Co Derry, deny two charges of murder and the attempted murder of six others â€“ three soldiers, two pizza delivery drivers and a security guard.Hart told Belfast crown court sitting at Antrim on Wednesday: "I am satisfied that to admit Dr Wiltshire's reports without her being present to give evidence would result in a situation where the defence would be irredeemably and significantly disadvantaged by not being able to press her on all those matters that are clearly at issue."The method analyses soil samples found at the scene and tries to link them to the accused. Evidence included material taken from vehicle wheel arches, which may have accumulated over many years.Wiltshire examined soil samples and fungal spores from Duffy's boots, a holdall and other items recovered by investigators.Material was also taken from the accelerator, brake and clutch of the car believed to have been used as a getaway, a Vauxhall Cavalier, as well as its footwells and wheel arches.She also examined matted organic material from the mat of the Cavalier and vegetation was taken from inside the holdall.The defence has several expert witnesses who contradict Wiltshire's reports.The case continues.
