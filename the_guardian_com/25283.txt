A culture of fighting between teenage boys, rather than bullying, was blamed yesterday for the death of 14-year-old Luke Walmsley, who was stabbed outside a classroom in November 2003.Clashes between rival teenagers preceded the tragedy in Birkbeck school, North Somercotes, near Louth, according to a report commissioned by Lincolnshire county council. The inquiry highlighted communication failures between agencies over the behaviour of Luke's murderer, Alan Pennell, who is now 16 and serving a life sentence. Police concern about Pennell's history of fighting and self-harm had not been properly recorded. A trial in July heard that the killer was jealous of Luke's success and had repeatedly threatened to stab him. But the inquiry concluded that the murder was an "extraordinary event" which could not have been foreseen. The report was attacked by Luke's parents, who said Pennell had "constantly bullied" him and should have been expelled.
