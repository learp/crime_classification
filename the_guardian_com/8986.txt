Dartmoor jail has slipped back into a "pervasive negative culture" that is adrift from the principles and practices of a modern prison system, according to a damning report published today by the chief inspector of prisons.Dame Anne Owers, who steps down this month as chief inspector, says that despite some attempts at reform over the years, Dartmoor has made little progress since it was the subject of her first extremely critical inspection report.Owers reports that more than a third of prisoners at the Devon jail, built in 1809, said they felt unsafe, with very limited staff supervision on the wings giving little confidence that violent incidents would be prevented or reported.But the chief inspector has particular concerns about the attitudes of some staff towards minority groups: "We heard repeated and consistent accounts from prisoners about homophobic language and attitudes. Black and minority ethnic prisoners reported much worse experiences of prison, particularly in relation to safety and respectful treatment."Owers refers to examples of staff refusing to push prisoners in wheelchairs and tells of several gay prisoners reporting that staff referred to them as "girls" or "ladies". One said he had been handed a copy of Gay Times in a brown paper bag because, according to the officer, he did not want to touch it."This is undoubtedly a poor inspection report, raising some issues of serious concern. There was a clear warning at the time of the last inspection. It was not heeded," says Owers.The Prison Reform Trust said the Dartmoor report showed how a large, outdated prison had drifted back to its old ways: "We look forward to a time when, with a reduced prison population, the Ministry of Justice could consider handing Dartmoor prison over as a heritage museum, of historic interest but out of place in a modern, high achieving justice system," said the organisation's director, Juliet Lyon.
