The first Madeleine McCann suspect, Robert Murat, sat in on police interviews with friends of the missing girl's parents, it was reported today.British tabloids said Murat, named by Portuguese police as an arguido in the case, acted as a translator when officers interviewed holidaymakers who had dined with Kate and Gerry McCann on the evening Madeleine disappeared.Murat, 33, was made a suspect on May 15, less than two weeks after Madeleine vanished from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3.Two members of the so-called "tapas seven" group, Rachael Oldfield and Dianne Webster, who were eating with the McCanns at the resort when the three-year-old disappeared, were interviewed by police in the presence of Murat, the Daily Mirror and Sun reported.Murat has always denied any involvement in Madeleine's disappearance, saying he spent the evening at home with his elderly mother.The McCanns' spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, said: "We can't comment on anything that's contained within the police file and clearly records of interviews and who attended them make up part of that file."Any serious questions to be answered about the way the original interviews were conducted or who attended them will be central to our own private investigation, and the detectives who have been employed on our behalf will be looking into that."Mitchell also said any witnesses who claimed Mrs McCann shouted out "they've taken her" when she found her daughter missing were mistaken. Police have interviewed for a third time an unnamed waiter who is believed to insist that is what he heard her say.Mitchell said: "Whatever any witness may claim Kate to have done in the immediate aftermath of discovering Madeleine was gone, she did not come out saying, 'They've taken her, they've taken her.'"She said, 'Madeleine's gone, Madeleine's gone, somebody has taken her.' Any other recollection from any other person about the immediate aftermath is a mistake."
