The Pitcairn Island supreme court ruled yesterday that the trial of 13 local men accused of the sexual abuse of women and girls as young as three will go ahead under British law in New Zealand, a ruling which could threaten the existence of Britain's smallest and most isolated outpost.Defence lawyers argued that the Pitcairners, governed by the British high commissioner in New Zealand, had formed their own community and never submitted to UK law. Most of the 47 inhabitants of the two-square-mile island 3,500 miles east of Auckland are descended from the mutineers on HMS Bounty, who fled there in 1790. If all 13 suspects were imprisoned, islanders believe, there would no longer be enough adult men to operate the boats on which the island depends.
