The number of proven complaints against police officers in England and Wales has risen, according to government statistics, although the total level of complaints fell for the third year in a row.There were 15,248 complaints in the 12 months to March 2003, down 8% on the previous 12 months. Of these, 941 were substantiated, a 5% year-on-year rise. But disciplinary or misconduct allegations were proved against 1,529 officers in the same period, up 13% on the previous year, and 115 officers were dismissed or forced to leave, a 19% increase in the same period. Criminal proceedings were brought against 16 officers. A total of 27% of complaints were of assault by officers, while 15% related to other types of oppressive behaviour and 3% concerned racial discrimination. But 10% of upheld complaints related to assault. The vast majority of upheld complaints - 510 or 54% - were due to failures in duty, and 1% to racial discrimination. North Yorkshire had the highest proportion of substantiated complaints, at 15.8%, while Lancashire and Northamptonshire were joint lowest with 0.6%. A Home Office spokeswoman said there had been a downward trend since 1994. Ken Jones, Sussex chief constable and spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said the rise in upheld complaints could be partly due to changes in standards of proof, now on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond all reasonable doubt.
