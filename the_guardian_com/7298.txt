A British Transport police officer has been found guilty of driving dangerously at more than twice the speed limit when his van hit a cyclist in east London, causing "catastrophic injuries".PC David Lynch, 31, from Hertfordshire, was driving the marked police vehicle at speeds of up to 68mph in a 30mph zone as it approached a hump-backed bridge in Hackney, east London.The vehicle hit singer-songwriter Joseph Belmonte, 31, who was travelling in the same direction ahead of the officer.Witnesses described seeing the vehicle "taking off" and all four wheels leaving the ground as it crashed into the cyclist on 31 March last year.At Southwark crown court on Thursday, Judge Pegden said the accident had ruined the career of the music artist, who was still in constant pain following the incident.Belmonte underwent major surgery to correct three fractures in his spine as well as facial surgery which could have affected his singing ability, the court heard.He has also sustained a brain injury which leaves him "fumbling for words" and unable to remember lyrics to his own songs.Prosecutor Sam Brown told the court that Belmonte had to again learn both how to walk and play the guitar.A statement he read out on behalf of Belmonte said: "I can't really explain the effect it has had on my life. I am very depressed at the reality that I will never be the same person again."I miss my life as it was before."Belmonte, who was not wearing a helmet, was cycling to his girlfriend's house in Newington Green, north London, and had travelled the route on many occasions before, the court heard.Lynch and his passenger, PC Gary Thomas, were on their way to an incident in the Old Street area of east London when the collision happened on Queensbridge Road in Hackney on what was a dry and bright, sunny day.Pegden said: "The injuries are of a most catastrophic nature, he has really suffered life-changing injuries."He was a singer and songwriter whose career has been ruined."Speaking after the case, Christine Tallon, a partner at Leigh Day and Co, which represented Belmonte, said: "It is more through sheer luck than judgment that PC Lynch has not been in court facing a charge of causing death by dangerous driving."The actions of PC Lynch have left Mr Belmonte with life-changing injuries from which he continues to suffer."He was on the brink of making his musical breakthrough with his debut album at the time of the incident. He remains a talented young musician and is fighting hard to get his career and his life back on track."Lynch, of Stotfold, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, had previously admitted careless driving but denied the more serious charge of dangerous driving.Sentencing was adjourned until October. The judge warned him to expect a custodial term.
