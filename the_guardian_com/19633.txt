Three members of a 40-strong gang who killed a lone teenager in under a minute with bats, bottles, hammers and knives were convicted of murder yesterday.Five other men were found guilty of playing a part in the frenzied attack on Mahir Osman, 18, who received three fatal stab wounds to the lungs, kidneys and liver when he was set upon in an attack in Camden, north London.Jurors at the Old Bailey were shown CCTV footage of the attack, which showed Osman being punched, stamped on and stabbed near the underground station on a Saturday night in January last year.The group of predominantly Somali men which targeted Osman, because he belonged to a rival gang, bought kitchen knives from a nearby supermarket shortly before sprinting towards him through a packed street.Brendan Finucane QC, prosecuting, talked jurors through the images, saying: "Mr Osman falls to the ground at the rear of the bus and you will see the frenzy of the attack. There are weapons clearly in open view. You will see the feathers from his Puffa jacket flying through the air as his jacket was punctured by the stab wounds." The video lasted 19 seconds.Osman's assailants fled on to a double-decker bus, still carrying their weapons. As police surrounded the vehicle, weapons were flung from the bus littering the street, while a number of gang members escaped through the emergency exit, evading arrest. Officers arrested so many suspects they commandeered the bus to take them to police stations.The court heard how the attack on Osman, who came to London from Mogadishu in 1992, had been the culmination of escalating violence involving two Somali gangs from Camden and the Tottenham-Edmonton areas of north London.Reaching their verdict yesterday after the three-month trial, the jury found Ismail Mohamed, 20, of Tottenham, Liban Elmi, 20, of no fixed address and a 17-year-old who cannot be named because of his age, guilty of murder.A 25-year-old man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was cleared of murder but found guilty of conspiracy to wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and violent disorder.Mohamed Mohamud, 18, Abdirahman Mohamed, 18, and youths aged 16 and 17, who cannot be named, all from north London, were variously found guilty of violent disorder, conspiracy to wound and conspiracy to have weapons.All were remanded in custody for reports before being sentenced on May 11.
