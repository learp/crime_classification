Durham police have confirmed that more than 200 potential new victims have come forward to detectives investigating sexual and physical abuse at a now defunct detention centre.The development follows an investigation by the Guardian that revealed a prison officer at the centre, Neville Husband, may have abused hundreds of detainees over a 17-year period.Husband was jailed for 10 years in 2003 for committing sex attacks on youngsters at Medomsley detention centre, near Consett, County Durham, in the 1970s and 1980s.Husband, who died in 2010, had been in sole charge of the kitchens at Medomsley. The Guardian investigation in 2012 revealed he had raped boys on a daily basis, while other staff allegedly turned a blind eye.Durham police said there had now been 232 new calls from potential victims, bringing the total to 375. A spokesman said: "All those who have rung will be seen by an officer over the coming weeks and steered towards the appropriate support and counselling."Earlier this week, the prime minister assured the North West Durham MP, Pat Glass, that the Home Office would support local police if necessary while detectives were carrying out the investigations into what happened at the former detention centre.Glass said: "The prime minister will be aware of the investigation into the systematic beating, abuse and rape of young men and boys at the former Medomsley detention centre in my constituency."The victim toll has now topped 300 and this is the biggest investigation ever undertaken by Durham Constabulary – a relatively small police force."Will the prime minister commit that if it proves necessary, his home secretary will meet with the police and crime commissioner, the chief constable and myself to ensure that the highly successful team has the resources it needs to see this investigation to its conclusion? The victims deserve no less."Cameron replied: "I am very happy to give the honourable lady that assurance, because I don't support the police merger ideas of the past."I think some of our smaller police forces are hugely capable, but when they are doing very complex and large investigations like this on occasion they do need help and support – so we should make sure that is available."
