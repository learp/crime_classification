Mark Duggan was killed by a gunshot from a police marksman that struck his aorta, and was "fatal within 10 heartbeats", an inquest jury has heard.The jury was told police had intelligence Duggan was a member of a gang called TMD, Tottenham Man Dem, which officers believed had links to guns and nightclubs.The shooting of Duggan, 29, in north London on 4 August 2011 after armed police forced a cab he was travelling in to stop triggered the worst riots in modern English history.On Tuesday Ashley Underwood QC, counsel to the inquest, outlined the facts and issues in the case to the inquest jury.The jury heard the officer who shot Duggan twice, known only as V53, would say he had seen a gun in Duggan's right hand, and believed the suspect was preparing to use it. They were told that V53 would testify that he had acted in self-defence, fearing his own life or the lives of his colleagues were in danger from Duggan.Underwood said V53 and a second officer, W70, would say they had seen Duggan holding a gun but were surprised when they later did not find it by his body.The gun was found 10 to 20 feet away, over a fence, the jury heard.Underwood said key questions the jury would have to decide included whether Duggan had had a gun when he exited the cab after police forced it to stop.He also said the jury would be asked whether Duggan could have been holding a mobile phone when he left the cab. Seconds before the cab was made to halt, Duggan had held a three-minute-long conversation with his brother Marlon.Underwood said a key issue would be whether it had been "absolutely necessary" for V53 to open fire.In the days before the shooting, the Metropolitan police had received intelligence from the Serious Organised Crime Agency about the gang, of which Duggan is alleged to have been a member.That intelligence led to Duggan being put under surveillance, as officers were said to have feared he would try to get a gun from a man called Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, who was later convicted at a criminal trial of supplying Duggan with the gun.
