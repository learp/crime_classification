The actor Samantha Morton has revealed in today's Guardian that at 14 she was charged with attempted murder and convicted of threats to kill.Morton, 31, spent years in children's homes and has just directed her first film - about a girl growing up in a children's home. She has decided to talk publicly about her criminal conviction for the first time in a week when a Commons select committee report warned that the state is failing to adequately protect children in care from sexual exploitation, homelessness and falling into crime and concluded that there had to be greater investment in children in care.Morton was in a children's home in Nottingham when the incident occurred. She explained that there was a riot, the home was on fire, and the police were already on the scene when she picked up a knife and threatened to kill an older girl who had bullied her for a long time. "I was physically abused and I retaliated," said Morton. "The only person I hurt in the end was myself."I was locked in a cell for three days. It was terrible. I just sat there thinking, I don't want this life - I'm not a petty criminal. I'm not a thug. I was so ashamed of myself." The initial charge of attempted murder was reduced to threats to kill. She was sentenced to 18 weeks at an attendance centre, and said it turned her life round. "I felt humbled. I felt remorse, I felt embarrassed." In the interview, in Weekend magazine, Morton said in future she hoped to work with children in care. "What shocks me is that so many people leave care and become homeless, and when you're homeless you get into crime, prostitution and drugs, and it's a vicious circle. That's what we need to change."
