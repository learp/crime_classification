The So Solid Crew rapper Harvey has been ordered to do community service for fighting with a police officer who tried to arrest him. A judge in St Albans gave the rapper, real name Michael Junior Harvey, 26, of Welwyn, Herts, 100 hours' community service for driving while disqualified and 50 hours for assaulting a police officer in January. He was fined £300 for driving without insurance and £100 for a public order offence and banned from driving for nine months. Harvey said his sentence for the assault was appropriate and he looked forward to teaching pensioners about hip-hop.
