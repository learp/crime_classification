A lorry driver who smirked as he rammed cars on a busy motorway was today jailed for dangerous driving and criminal damage.Vitezslav Labounek shunted three cars out of his path with his 40-tonne articulated truck as he ploughed through a speed-restricted section of the M1 northbound, Derby crown court heard.Horrified motorists called police and turned on their hazard lights as Labounek, 44, sped between junction 22 near Kimberley, Nottinghamshire, and 33 near Sheffield, on 28 August.The drivers of the three cars he hit were left with whiplash and thousands of pounds of damage to their vehicles.Labounek, a Czech national of no fixed address, was sentenced to 15 months and disqualified from driving for three years for a dangerous driving offence described by police as one of the worst they had seen.One witness likened the incident to a scene out of Duel, the Steven Spielberg film in which a tanker truck tries to ram a car off the road.After the hearing, Sharon Palos, 53, described her ordeal as the lorry driver pursued her down the motorway."He was getting closer and closer but there was nowhere for me to go," said Palos. "There was a central reservation on one side and cars on the other."He was coming up behind me, taunting me. At one point it looked like his grill was in my back window."I was trying to move forward to move away from him, but the more I did the more he came up the back of me. I tried to continue but I was trapped. Then he rammed me."To be honest, I thought that was it. I thought I was dead."Palos, a dairy sales manager from Derbyshire, fought to keep control of her vehicle to stop it careering across all three lanes.She added: "I realised in that split second that if I lost control of the car I would have gone sideways. I was fighting for my own life and those around me."Eventually, Palos managed to pull into the middle lane to let Labounek through.She said: "I moved into the middle lane so he could pass me and he just looked down and smirked. I just thought, this guy is a nut case."Labounek eventually pulled over on to the hard shoulder in south Yorkshire and stopped.He pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and three counts of criminal damage with life-endangering recklessness.
