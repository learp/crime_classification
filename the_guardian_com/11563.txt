One of BAE's former confidential agents, Count Alfons Mensdorff-Pouilly, has been charged with bribery over arms deals in the first ever criminal case brought during long-running corruption investigations into the British arms maker.The charges were formally brought at Highbury Corner magistrates court in London by the director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), Richard Alderman.Mensdorff-Pouilly, of Austria, was accused of conspiring to make corrupt payments to promote the sale of BAE fighter jets to the governments of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Austria. He has not yet entered a plea.The attorney general, Lady Scotland, retains the power to halt the case before it reaches trial and can consult other government ministers about their view of the public interest.Controversy arose previously when the SFO was prevented from continuing its investigations into allegations of BAE corruption in Saudi arms deals. Tony Blair, who was prime minister, intervened to halt the criminal investigations on the grounds they would displease the Saudi royal family and thus threaten British national security.Scotland's office said she would be considering the public interest and the strength of the evidence before deciding whether to let the Mensdorff-Pouilly case go ahead. The move to lay charges was "an operational decision by the director of the SFO", her spokesman said, adding that "the attorney is aware of where we are".The SFO said in a statement that the count was charged with conspiracy to give corrupt payments between 2002 and 2008 to agents and officials of central European governments including those of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Austria "as inducements to secure, or as rewards for having secured, contracts from those governments for the supply of ... Saab/Gripen fighter jets by BAE Systems plc".Mensdorff-Pouilly, who has purchased a sporting estate at Dalnaglar Castle, Perthshire, was charged after an international investigation, the SFO said. Those involved in the inquiry included the Ministry of Defence, police in London, Viennese police and prosecutors, and the Europe-wide prosecutors' group Eurojust."Assistance was also provided by the Czech, Hungarian and Swiss authorities," the SFO said.The charges follow the announcement by the SFO last year that it intended to bring criminal charges against BAE for bribery in central Europe and Africa if the attorney general agreed. There was then a prolonged delay while the SFO made further inquiries and collected more evidence before submitting its dossier.The announcement that BAE would be pursued with criminal charges followed the breakdown of negotiations aimed at a US-style plea bargain under which it would have pleaded guilty to certain offences and paid a large fine. No charges have yet been brought against the company or any of its direct employees.
