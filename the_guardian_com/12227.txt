Tim Larkin, a US close combat expert who has been banned from entering Britain, is to step up a campaign to have the ban lifted by claiming that the home secretary, Theresa May, is preventing him from teaching self-defence techniques now advocated by the cabinet.Larkin claims he has been a victim of a misunderstanding and that his techniques were advocated by Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, at the Conservative conference.Grayling promised to strengthen the definition of reasonable self-defence in the home, and will make most forms of self-defence lawful.In a bid to embarrass May, Larkin is to take part in a Skype meeting in a pub in her Maidenhead constituency – broadcasting live from Las Vegas to canvass support for his cause.Larkin claims to have the support of Senate majority leader Harry Reid and is seeking a judicial review of May's decision on the grounds it was made without consulting him.May debarred Larkin after a complaint by a Labour MP that he was advertising a self-defence tour in British cities afflicted by riots in 2011 and this amounted to a form of incitement to vigilantes.The Home Office, in its defence to the courts, asserted Larkin is an advocate of a "kill or be killed" form of self-defence and his presence in the UK would be detrimental to the public good. It said it had no obligation to speak to Larkin prior to reaching a decision.Larkin has seized on comments from Grayling and David Cameron about Britons' right to protect themselves from grievous bodily harm should anybody enter their home."[That] is exactly the same situation that I've been training people to deal with, ever since I started training in the United Kingdom," he said."I just really am at a loss as to why, if that is the case with the government – if that's the government's finding – why I'm facing an exclusion order right now. I think there's been a huge mistake in understanding what it is I actually teach."Larkin was banned from the UK last year when a Home Office official travelled to Las Vegas to debar him from flying to the country.He was banned two weeks after the home secretary received the complaint from Rosie Cooper, the Labour MP for West Lancashire, in November 2011. A decision to ban him was made on 28 November last year.He insists he has never been an advocate of personal self-defence outside the home, and has in the past taught members of the UK police force, as well as the US marines.
