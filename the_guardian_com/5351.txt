The death of a man in a motorway crash may have been "more than a tragic accident", detectives said today. Mark Fleeman's death on the M74 in South Lanarkshire on Thursday is being treated as a potential murder. Police are trying to trace a dark van travelling at high speed close to Fleeman's white van. Fleeman, 32, from Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, died when his van crashed on the northbound carriageway of the motorway near the Larkhall and Hamilton junctions at around 4.35am. His passenger, 17-year-old Lee Allsup, also from Uttoxeter, is in a critical condition in hospital.
