Police have arrested three people following the deaths of two teenagers who are believed to have taken mephedrone, a legal drug which gives users a similar experience to ecstasy or cocaine.Humberside police said last night that men aged 26 and 20 and a 17-year-old boy were in custody in connection with an investigation into the case of Louis Wainwright, 18, and Nicholas Smith, 19.The teenagers are believed to have been drinking together in Scunthorpe until the early hours of Monday morning. Wainwright was found dead at his home in Winteringham, north Lincolnshire, later that day. Several hours later, police found Smith dead at his home in Scunthorpe.One of the arrested men was treated in hospital after also apparently taking the drug, known as "meow meow" or "M-cat", which has become increasingly popular among young club goers despite fears about side-effects that can include nose bleeds, joint pains, paranoia, heart palpitations, insomnia and memory problems.Detective chief inspector Mark Oliver said: "We have information to suggest these deaths are linked to M-cat. We would encourage anyone who may have taken the drug or knows somebody who has taken the drug to attend a local hospital as a matter of urgency."Anyone who knows somebody who has possession of the drug, we would encourage them to either hand it in to a local police station or dispose of the substance and contact Humberside police."Police investigating the deaths found empty mephedrone packets and packages marked "herbal highs" when they searched a property, the force said.The drug, which comes in the form of a powder, tablets, crystals or liquid, is often sold via the internet, where it can be marketed as plant food, another name for the substance. Health and drug workers and police have become increasingly concerned at its use but are unable to do anything as it remains legal.In December, Jersey banned the substance, making it a class C drug. Authorities on Guernsey said they were considering classifying mephedrone as class A.The Home Office has asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to look into whether a nationwide ban is needed.
