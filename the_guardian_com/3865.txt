Police hunting the killer of schoolboy Rory Blackhall today said they were urgently trying to identify a man who was sighted near where the 11-year-old was last seen.Rory failed to arrive at Meldrum Primary in Livingston, West Lothian, on Thursday last week and his body was found three days later in nearby woodland.A post-mortem examination showed he had been asphyxiated.Detectives said they had become "increasingly anxious" to establish the identity of a man who was wearing a bomber-style jacket and a trapper hat.Speaking at a press conference, Detective Inspector Tom Martin, of Lothian and Borders Police, said officers had received no calls or information regarding the sighting of the unknown man.Mr Martin said: "At about 8.30am on the day before Rory went missing, a member of the public was walking his child to school along the pathway which leads from the underpass where Rory was dropped off by his mother."At this time, the witness's attention was drawn to rustling in the wooded area at the side of the pathway and a man emerged from the bushes and trees beside him near to the electricity substation."The man had to push aside some large bushes to exit the wood."Police, who did not comment on whether the man was a suspect in the murder case, said he was unaccompanied and not seen to be carrying anything.Mr Martin said the witness, who regularly used the same route to walk his child to school, had never seen the man before.He added: "He made no attempt to acknowledge the witness, which he also regarded as unusual for people in that area."He appeared to be completely out of place for the area and the witness was actually concerned about his presence there."Mr Martin said the man was seen with the flaps of his trapper hat down covering his neck and ears."The witness thought this was particularly unusual given the weather conditions at the time."Mr Martin said the unknown man was described as 38 to 40 years old and 5ft 8in with a "gaunt, very pale appearance".He was also described as having "quite a pointed nose" and had light or grey stubble on his chin.His black bomber jacket was zipped up to the neck and he also wore black jeans and black boots or shoes. The trapper hat was dark green and made of waterproof nylon.Mr Martin said: "We would ask members of the public to closely consider both the description of the man along with the distinctive hat and jacket."It may be that people might recognise the description of the man but wearing only the distinctive hat, not the jacket, or, indeed, they recognise the description of them man with only the jacket and not the hat."The police officer added: "It should also be borne in mind that, while the witness saw the man with the flaps of the hat pulled down on this occasion, others may have seen the man with the hat fastened in the upright position."We would again ask that anyone who knows or believes they may know this man, or who has seen a man fitting this description and wearing either the hat or jacket, or both, to contact the police as a matter of urgency."Today's appeal came following a reconstruction on Friday of Rory's last known movements.Following the reconstruction, police said they had now traced four people - two males drinking beer on Nellburn Path on the day Rory was last seen, and two other males who were at a campfire on Dechmont Law last Saturday.Only the man wearing the bomber jacket remains unidentified.Earlier today, Rory's mother, Michelle, 41, and father, Russell, 42, paid a visit to the spot near where his body was found.They were accompanied by Rory's 14-year-old brother, Conal, and laid a bunch of thistles and lavender.They card they left read: "Rory-Pory, you are always with us in our thoughts and in our hearts."Our wee Rory, we love you."Rory's mother broke down in tears as the three family members saw the dozens of tributes and flowers left by well-wishers.One of the other tributes read: "Rory, we don't know why yet, but we will find the answer."Rest peacefully with the angels. God will take care of you now."Another stated: "One thousand words couldn't explain how sad and angry we feel. We hope you are at peace with the angels."Another card which had been left with a bunch of flowers simply stated: "WHY?"Speculation has continued to grow about what may have happened to Rory in the 76-hour gap between his disappearance and his body being found.Police have declined to comment on specific media reports that the youngster was alive for two days after he disappeared.
