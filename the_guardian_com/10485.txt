A teacher cleared of attempted murder after hitting a pupil with a dumbbell was today given a two-year community service order.Peter Harvey snapped and attacked the 14-year-old boy after being goaded by other students, one of whom covertly filmed the incident.The 50-year-old hit him on the head with a 3kg (6.6lb) dumbbell while shouting: '"Die, die, die" at All Saints' Roman Catholic high school in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire.The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, suffered a fractured skull and bleeding to the brain in the attack, which happened last July.Harvey was found not guilty of attempted murder in April after the jurors at Nottingham crown court had deliberated for less than two hours. The boy's family stormed out of the court as the verdicts were delivered.The case raised serious issues about the misuse of mobile technology in classrooms and the effect it has on teachers, with unions calling on schools to bring in tougher measures to prevent such incidents.Nottingham crown court heard that a 14-year-old girl who had smuggled the camera into class had planned to goad Harvey and show the footage around the school in order to humiliate him.During a science lesson, students had been experimenting with which materials would best protect an ice cube from heat. They began insulting Harvey, calling him a "bald-headed bastard" and "psycho"..The science teacher, who was well liked by staff and students, snapped when he attempted to wrestle a Bunsen burner stand from the 14-year-old boy, who told him to "fuck off".The court heard that the boy was a leading light in causing trouble, and had earlier been swordfighting with a ruler and playing volleyball with scrunched-up paper.He had disrupted lessons at the school on at least nine occasions in one year. When questioned in court, he said he could not recall anything about his poor disciplinary record prior to the incident.The jury accepted Harvey's claim that he was in such a state as the class's behaviour deteriorated that he could not have intended to harm the boy, who is now 15. He admitted grievous bodily harm without intent and told police that he thought he had killed the pupil.Part of the video clip filmed by the girl was shown at the trial. In one passage, she can be heard yelling to a boy to stand up so that Harvey would have to shout at him to sit down.In another section, Harvey is heard yelling at his victim moments before the attack. School CCTV footage showed students fleeing the enraged teacher.Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT union, of which Harvey is a member, said schools should introduce tougher measures to ensure hand-held and mobile phone cameras were not used in classrooms. "We don't think that schools should deem it appropriate to have mobile phones in classrooms and we would call on schools to toughen up their policies," she said."We have said schools should treat mobile phones as if they are offensive weapons. They are proving as dangerous as weapons because of what can be done with them in terms of what can be put on the internet and making allegations against teachers on the internet."The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said it was undermining if a teacher enforced discipline but was not backed up.The trial judge, Michael Stokes QC, said the verdict meant "common sense has prevailed" and that Harvey would probably receive a community service order.Midway through the trial, he expressed concern that the teacher was in court at all, saying: "Many will be surprised from the evidence that we have heard that the crown should still pursue this case against a man of previous good character."Given the considerable amount of evidence we have heard from witnesses, Mr Harvey was in such a state of mind that many might conclude that he was not 'really with it', to use the expression used by one witness."Harvey spent eight months in prison on remand before he was bailed.The four-day trial heard that he had struggled to help his wife overcome the depression that led to her abandoning her own teaching career. He had a history of mental illness and could often be heard talking to himself and could be aggressive to students.He was sent home from the school in December 2008 after he told an education adviser he had thoughts of harming someone, but was able to return to work after counselling. A therapist told him he was too peaceful and passive and needed to let his anger out.Harvey later apologised for the pain and damage he had caused. For much of his teaching career, he would arrive in class at 6.30am to prepare experiments for the day. Three years ago, he was pushed over by one student and knocked into a hedge by another when he tried to defend a colleague.As a result of the conviction, Harvey now faces a disciplinary hearing and will not be allowed to work with children again. The NASUWT said it hoped it will be a sympathetic hearing and that he will be allowed to take early retirement on the grounds of ill-health.
