The man accused of murdering teenager Hannah Foster today told a jury that he was kidnapped, bound and blindfolded, then forced to have sex with her.Maninder Pal Singh Kohli claimed he was bundled into a car by three men on the night that the 17-year-old A-level student disappeared. Hannah's body was found in a bramble-filled ditch in West End, Southampton, on March 16 2003, two days after she disappeared near her home.Kohli said he was taken to a van, where he was forced to have sexual intercourse with a woman, who he now believed to be Hannah. He told the jury at Winchester crown court he believed he had been kidnapped out of "revenge" because he owed Â£16,000 to a work colleague.The 41-year-old father of two told the court that he repeatedly borrowed sums of money from his colleague James Dennis, with whose wife he claimed he was having an affair. When Dennis asked for the money back, Kohli said he threatened to reveal the secret affair.Kohli told the trial that on March 13, 2003, the day before Hannah disappeared, Dennis's brother Jonathan threatened him, demanding that he pay his brother back. The next day Kohli said he went to work as normal before going out for a meal with his wife and children in the evening.Kohli, who said in court that he was a gambling addict, told the court that after returning his family to their home, he went to the Mitre pub in Portswood, Southampton. He said he won some money on the fruit machines before leaving at closing time.As he was returning to his work van, parked nearby, he claimed he was grabbed by two men who ordered him to get in the back of a dark-coloured car. Kohli said the men asked him if he owed money to anyone and he told them that he owed money to Dennis, adding that he would have the money the following week when the sale of his flat was completed.He said: "They said they wanted 25 grand by the 18th 'otherwise we will shoot you'."He said that after a short period of driving he was taken out of the car and told to sit in the passenger seat of a van, where another man shouted at him.He told the jury that another voice then shouted that since he was sleeping with his cousin's wife and blackmailing them, "'We will teach you a lesson you will never forget in your life."'Loud sobbing could be heard in court from the public gallery as Kohli then went on to describe the moment he had sexual intercourse with the girl against his will.Kohli a sandwich delivery van driver, has denied the murder, rape, kidnap and false imprisonment of Hannah. The trial continues.
