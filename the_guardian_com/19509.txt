As dignitaries including the then prime minister Gordon Brown and David Cameron attended a memorial service to mark the 15th anniversary of Stephen Lawrence's death, Detective Chief Inspector Clive Driscoll received a phone call. What he was told represented the breakthrough that beleaguered Metropolitan police detectives had been waiting for.Leaving St Martin-in-the-Fields church, London, he answered his mobile phone. The caller was Ed Jarman, one of the scientists on the new inquiry into the racist killing of Lawrence. A spot of blood, Jarman said, had been found on the bomber jacket belonging to one of the main suspects in the killing, Gary Dobson."It was utterly surreal and bizarre," said Driscoll. "The evidence we had been waiting for, after all these years, to come up at that particular time."The jacket, analysed twice before in 1993 and 1995 for the presence of blood with negative results, had been examined for two days in April 2008 under a low-powered microscope, and in the weave of the collar the equipment revealed a tiny blood stain measuring 0.25mm by 0.5mm."We were very aware it was a significant finding as soon as we saw it," said Jarman. When he submitted the speck of blood for DNA testing – something which was only possible from around 2003 onwards for such a small amount of blood – the results produced the breakthrough the police, scientists and the Lawrence family had waited for: an almost complete DNA match to the murdered teenager.Taken together, the evidence against Dobson and his co-defendant David Norris would not fill a teaspoon. But the microscopic hair, fibre and blood evidence produced by cutting-edge science in a cold case review contained a powerful truth.In a confrontation with a gang of white youths lasting just a few seconds, fibres from the dying teenager's clothes, spots of his blood and two tiny hairs had indelibly left their mark on his killers; the evidence had always been there but it had remained undiscovered until advances in forensic science and the increased sensitivity of DNA testing.It was only after a decision was made in 2006 to submit all the forensic items in the case to a full review by the private firm LGC Forensics – who decided to start the inquiry from scratch and pushed the boundaries of what was possible – that the new evidence emerged.The scientific work alone cost nearly £4m, and the investigation represents the largest by the Met outside of anti-terrorist investigations. Since 1993 the Met has mounted seven investigations into the Lawrence murder. The scale of their inquiries are testament to the determination of the force to make good the mistakes of the 1990s which resulted in the country's biggest and most powerful police force being branded as racist and incompetent.During the first murder investigation in 1993 sluggish detectives had failed to act on a flow of information identifying the suspects – brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt, Norris and their associates – within two days of the murder. In one of the most shocking incidents four days after the killing the police stood by and watched in a flawed surveillance operation as a young white man left the Acourts' house carrying what appeared to be clothing covered with a black bin liner.The Met's acting deputy commissioner, Cressida Dick, acknowledges that bringing Dobson and Norris to justice has helped salvage the force's reputation."This case is extraordinarily important not just to the Metropolitan police, but to society at large because of the nature of the horrific attack, the fact that no one had been brought to justice and the extraordinary effect that the public inquiry had on policing, on the law and on wider society and politics," she said."The events surrounding the first investigation of course damaged the Metropolitan police's reputation, but what the Met does do is persist and continue with murder investigations to bring people to justice a long time later. It is a matter of much regret to the Met that it has taken 18 years to get to this point."The new inquiry was in part prompted by the death of another young black boy, 10-year-old Damilola Taylor. In 2006 two teenagers were convicted of his murder following a forensic review by LGC which identified previously undiscovered spots of the dead teenager's blood on clothing and a shoe belonging to the suspects.The case forced police across the country to review scores of murders to see if breakthroughs from new scientific evidence could be found.Over the years the inquiry into the murder of Lawrence had never been wound down. A small team of officers had remained on the case even after the announcement in 2004 by the Crown Prosecution Service that a third major police investigation led by one of the Met's most experienced detectives, John Grieve, had not produced evidence for a prosecution.Following the Damilola case, Cressida Dick made the decision to send all the exhibits to LGC for a full forensic review which began in 2007 at their laboratory in Oxfordshire. Scientists embarked on an examination of all the items of clothing seized from the five suspects' homes two weeks after the killing, and those clothes that Lawrence had been wearing – around 30 items in total.The initial breakthrough came in early 2008 when taping of debris from the evidence bag containing a jacket seized from Dobson's bedroom in May 1993 were tested for blood. For the first time in the history of any of the exhibits the test was positive; several tiny flakes of blood were found, including fibres encased in blood which provided a full DNA profile of Lawrence. It was the discovery of this blood that led Jarman to subject the whole jacket to a full examination under a low-powered microscope – something that had never been carried out before – and after two days of analysing the material the crucial bloodstain on the collar appeared under the microscope.Further examination throughout 2008 led scientists to find more flecks of blood on the jacket, and 16 fibres from Lawrence's clothes on the jacket and Dobson's cardigan. In Norris's case, six fibres from the victim's clothes were found on his jumper and on his jeans two tiny hairs, one of which when sent to Pennsylvania by LGC to be tested by DNA experts, matched the Lawrence family through the maternal line."These were microscopic amounts of material found after extensive and painstaking searching on items that have been the subject of previous, very thorough examinations, so much credit goes to the scientists involved," said Alan Tribe, manager of the Metropolitan police's evidence recovery unit.Exhaustive testing of the items seized from the Acourt brothers and Luke Knight did not yield evidence to charge any of them.Once the evidence was discovered, a team of detectives led by Detective Superintendent Jill Bailey and Driscoll began working on a new murder inquiry. It is understood the suspects were put under surveillance – the third time in the history of the case – and on 7 September last year both men were arrested. The scientific findings were put to them in their police interviews and neither Dobson nor Norris made any comment.The next day they were charged with Lawrence's murder as part of a joint enterprise.At this point the prosecution and police successfully applied for an unprecedented reporting ban on the development, to ensure that nothing jeopardised the case going to trial.Under new double jeopardy laws introduced in 2005, prosecutors had to apply to the appeal court for Dobson's previous acquittal for the murder during a private prosecution in 1996 to be quashed. This was successful in May and Dobson became only one of six people to be tried again for the same offence under the Criminal Justice Act 2003.After so long the success of the Lawrence investigation has done much to mend the tattered relations between the family and the Metropolitan police."I can only say it has been a joy and a privilege to work with them," said Driscoll. "I have sat with the family today and they are happy that we have got this far. I always said I wanted to get it to a jury for them and we did. That is all we can do and we can know that we've done our very best."We have had total support from them all, from Doreen, Neville and from their children, Stuart and Georgina."
