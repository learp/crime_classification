Scotland Yard was last night investigating a suspected attempted break-in at the office of one of its biggest anti-corruption squads, home of the failed multimillion-pound investigation into Supt Ali Dizaei.In September Supt Dizaei, one of the highest ranking ethnic minority officers in Britain, was cleared of corruption at the Old Bailey. He returned to work after the force said his integrity was demonstrably intact. The four-year investigation into him, operation Helios, is now the subject of an inquiry by the Metropolitan Police Authority, which will examine whether Helios disproportionately targeted ethnic minority officers for alleged wrongdoing. The attempted break-in was discovered a fortnight ago at a Met building in Putney, south-west London, following a fire drill. The building, one of the most secure the force has, is home to CIB3, the so-called elite, anti-corruption ghost squad, and other highly sensitive units. CIB3 officers had locked up their office after the alarm went off and noticed damage to the door frame when they returned. A senior Met officer said an inside job was a possibility; there was a lot of sensitive material in the building and only one way in. "It would be very difficult to get in there." Ray Powell, chairman of the National Black Police Association which pressed for the inquiry into Helios, said he was concerned by the break-in. "It begs the questions why one would want to break into one of the most secure offices in the Met at this time," he said. Scotland Yard said security was reviewed after the incident, but declined to say if any new measures were in place. Supt Dizaei had been informed of the incident. A spokesman said: "No entry was gained into the office. It remains unclear whether the damage was caused by someone trying to check if the room was empty during the fire alarm or if it was a genuine effort to break in."
