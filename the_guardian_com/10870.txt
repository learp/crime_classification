The former Labour leader Lord Kinnock was today banned from driving for six months today after admitting two separate speeding charges on the M4.The 64-year-old politician broke a temporary speed limit of 40mph in June, when he was caught travelling at 47mph in his wife Glenys's Audi A4. In November 2005 he was caught travelling at 60mph in a 50mph speed limit.Lord Kinnock was fined £400 for each offence at Abergavenny magistrates court and ordered to pay £43 prosecution costs. Lord Kinnock had already accumulated nine penalty points for three previous speeding offences and today he was given a further six penalty points, bringing the total to 15. Speaking outside the court, Lord Kinnock said that although the sentence was "massively inconvenient", but it was nevertheless "fair". "Speeding is a killer and I have campaigned all my life against speeding ... If you break the speed limit you expect to take the consequences," he said.He said that thousands of people are killed on the roads every year and "everything that can be done to reduce that figure should be done". The former EU transport commissioner said he would manage with difficulty without a car.
