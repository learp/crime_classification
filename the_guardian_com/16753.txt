Detectives in Manchester have been given more time to question the uncle of schoolgirl Tia Rigg, who was found strangled and stabbed at his home in the city.John Maden, 37, was arrested at the scene after police answered a 999 call from the house in Cheetham Hill, on Saturday afternoon.Maden has been questioned since then on suspicion of killing the 12-year-old, who was described by neighbours as lively, sometimes boisterous and on the threshold of a life full of promise. She was a keen Manchester United fan and is thought to have gone to her uncle's to watch the Chelsea match on television.Magistrates this morning granted a warrant allowing Maden to be held for a further 24 hours, which gives officers from Greater Manchester police until 8.30am tomorrow to charge or release him. The force has released postmortem results which show that Tia died from strangulation with a ligature and a series of stab wounds to her stomach.Police have not yet given details of the murder weapons or confirmed who made the 999 call from the house, which stands in a quiet cul-de-sac built in the 1990s. But Det Supt Mary Doyle, head of the murder inquiry, has said that detectives are not at present looking for anyone else in connection with the death.She earlier described Tia as "a happy, normal, healthy 12-year-old girl, she had friends, socialised normally and was in the flush of youth". Tia's parents are separated and they and her three younger brothers and sisters were described by Doyle as "devastated, with their world falling apart".They are staying with relatives, assisted by police family support officers, while forensic teams search the house. Blue and white incident tape sealed off approaches and a tent stood in front of the house, serving as the team's base.Numbers of members are growing on Facebook's RIP Tia Rigg page which is full of griefstricken messages and tributes from schoolfriends and others.
