Black defendants are treated differently from whites at various stages of the prosecution process, according to a Â£700,000 research study published yesterday.But the report said the data available to researchers were insufficient for them to determine whether racial bias caused the differences. In some cases police rather than crown prosecutors were responsible for disparities. The independent report, commissioned by the Crown Prosecution Service, looked at 13,000 files finalised between September 2000 and August 2001 and examined 46 cases with a race element. The study, by Professor Gus John, found that more cases against Afro-Caribbean defendants than against whites were discontinued on review, raising suspicions that they were more likely to be charged inappropriately by police. Crown prosecutors were more likely to oppose bail for Afro-Caribbean defendants than white, and more likely to say it was because black defendants would "obstruct justice" if given bail. The study found police failed to recognise racial aggravation in 19 of the 46 cases. In 33 cases, the CPS acknowledged the errors. The report also found "a tendency on the part of the CPS not to take forward racially aggravated offences, often citing insufficient evidence and/or public interest as reasons for this, even when there is compelling evidence to the contrary". Prosecutors "plea bargained" a charge down to a lesser charge in 12 cases, and 17 cases were dropped or no evidence was offered. Professor John made 10 recommendations, including appointing specialist prosecutors to deal with racist and religious crime, improving the way in which decisions are recorded in case files and creating a more robust management structure.
