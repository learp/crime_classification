A senior Tory MP was told he would be hauled before a judge if he refused to co-operate with the police investigation into the former deputy Commons speaker Nigel Evans, a court has heard.Conor Burns, the MP for Bournemouth West, told Preston crown court he felt very uncomfortable when police warned him he would be brought to court as a reluctant witness if he did not give a statement about an alleged indecent assault by Evans."They said if I would not make a statement I would be required to appear before a judge and be a reluctant witness. I felt very uncomfortable about that," he told jurors.Asked in cross-examination whether he was a reluctant witness, Burns said: "Not in the slightest."Burns told police he had not witnessed the alleged indecent assault during the 2003 Conservative party conference in Blackpool, the court heard.Detectives were investigating an allegation that Evans, then the shadow Wales secretary, thrust his hand down the trousers of a young Tory activist while the MP was heavily intoxicated at a hotel bar, jurors were told.Giving evidence from the witness box, Burns told the court that police officers repeatedly asked him to make a formal witness statement despite his reluctance.Burns said he told police on separate occasions that he did not have a "robust, strong, meaningful enough recollection to make a meaningful statement".The court heard that Burns first met two officers from the Lancashire constabulary last June and told them he had "the vaguest of recollections" that something had happened: "I told them I didn't think my recollection was robust enough to make a meaningful statement."He added: "How can you give a meaningful statement about something when there was a brick wall between you and the thing that's happening?"The officers visited Burns for a second time with a typed record of the conversation and said they were going to pass it to the Crown Prosecution Service, the court heard.Later, the officers contacted Burns again. "They said if I would not make a statement I would be required to appear before a judge and be a reluctant witness," Burns said.Burns told the court he decided to write his own statement after one drafted by officers didn't "reflect the nuance of what I was saying" and would not "translate into being read out in a completely arid courtroom".Burns said he was in the hotel when the young man complained to him about Evans. "His complaint to me was that Nigel was being over-friendly and, he felt, inappropriate," he said."I asked him to wait in the area that I was in and went to have a chat with Nigel and I said to him it was very late, he had to be on the platform the following morning and it might be a good idea for him to call it a night."Then Burns and the Tory MEP Nirj Deva escorted Evans out of the bar, the court heard.In a witness statement read to the jury on Wednesday, Deva said he told Evans: "Nigel, you are pissed. Time for you to go to bed," before ushering him away.Burns is the first MP to give evidence for the crown in the Evans trial.Standing in a witness box in front of Evans, who made notes in the court dock, Burns told jurors he had known the MP for Ribble Valley for 20 years and that he was popular on both sides of the Commons.Burns told the court that Evans's ambitions of becoming the Commons speaker were "finished, regardless of the outcome of this trial".Before Evans was elected deputy speaker, Burns said he had advised the 56-year-old MP to spend more time with MPs with the power to elect him rather than drinking with researchers and secretaries."What I said to Nigel, look the thing about the House of Commons is it's an environment full of gossip and rumour â€¦ that famous line from Sir Humphrey in Yes Minister, 'a rumour is merely a premature fact'," said Burns.Evans faces nine charges concerning seven alleged victims, dating from 2002 to 1 April last year. The MP denies two counts of indecent assault, six of sexual assault and one of rape.Earlier on Wednesday, the jury heard how a young Tory activist was seen "thrashing about very violently from side to side trying to break himself free" from Evans.Mark Formosa said he was drinking with a friend at 2am in the Number 10 bar at the Imperial Hotel in Blackpool during the 2003 Tory conference when the alleged incident happened, the court heard.Formosa told the jury: "A fracas broke out. I saw the younger man thrashing around very violently from side to side trying to wrench himself free from Mr Evans's grip. Mr Evans had his hand down the front of his trousers and was maintaining his grip and it seemed obvious that the younger man was not able to get him off him."I intervened along with several others in order to assist the younger man to get Mr Evans off him. We pulled him off and pushed him back towards the bar."The case continues.
