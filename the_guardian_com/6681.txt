Police investigating two letter bombs that have exploded in the last two days in London and Berkshire are exploring the possibility that either a disgruntled motorist or a militant animal rights organisation is behind the attacks.Two people were slightly injured yesterday morning when a device exploded in the offices of the accountancy and finance company, Vantis, in Oaklands Business Centre in Wokingham, Berkshire.One man was injured by flying glass when opening the package and another person fainted from shock. Neither required hospital treatment, said a company spokesperson. The spokesperson added that the letter bomb had been sent to a client who had probably given the address as their registered office in Companies House returns. He confirmed that one of Vantis's clients is Speed Check Services which provides the technology for speed cameras. He added that Vantis itself had nothing to do with the collection or imposition of motoring fines.On Monday, a woman was injured by a letter bomb sent to the offices of Capita, which collects the congestion charge in London. "Detectives are liaising with the Metropolitan police," said a Thames Valley police spokesperson last night, "though we are keeping an open mind as to whether this incident has links to that at Capita."Thames Valley police are also examining the possibility of a link with other devices sent last month in their area and in the West Midlands which are thought to be connected with an animal rights protest. The three incidents, which took place on January 18 and 19, involved crude explosive devices contained in Jiffy bags.The devices had apparently been sent by the same person and one of the envelopes referred to Barry Horne, the animal rights activist who died in 2001 while serving an 18-year jail sentence for a firebombing campaign directed at organisations involved with animal experimentation.One of the packages had been sent to a firm in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, that deals with cell research. A second device, sent to a company in Culham, failed to ignite. A third package was addressed to a firm in the Birmingham area.
