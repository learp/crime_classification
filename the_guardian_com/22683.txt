Judges will be allowed for the first time to quit the bench and go back into practice as barristers or solicitors, the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, announced yesterday in an attempt to attract recruits from more varied backgrounds to the judiciary.A consultation exercise last year showed that some potential candidates were reluctant to sign on to a job for life. Some feared that they might miss out on promotion on the bench and fail to achieve their full potential.Lawyers now take the job on the understanding that they will serve until retirement. In the past it was almost unheard of, and severely frowned on, for a judge to leave the bench to take up any sort of alternative job.When the high court judge Sir Henry Fisher quit after three years in 1970 for a post in the City, the New Law Journal wrote that the resulting outrage "might be appropriate in the headmistress of a finishing school who hears that one of the most promising of her pupils [has] gone off to be a bunny girl".There was a furore only last year when Sir Hugh Laddie quit the high court bench, citing boredom, to become a consultant to a firm of solicitors.One appeal court judge told the Guardian at the time that the resignation was the talk of the inns of court at lunch. He added: "For some of the old school people at Lincoln's Inn, saying he was going to join a firm of solicitors was a double insult."The bar on returning to practice was thought to be necessary because of fears that an ex-judge might be treated more favourably as an advocate by former colleagues or shown excessive deference by judges at a lower level.But the lord chancellor said he trusted all judges to be impartial in line with their judicial oaths and had taken the decision to lift the ban after consultation with the judges' council.In a consultation paper issued yesterday, Lord Falconer seeks views on the length of a quarantine period before a former judge will be permitted to argue cases in court in front of judges at the same or a lower level. He suggests a period of five years, but asks whether two years might be enough.The paper also suggests that an ex-judge should not be allowed to join a law firm if a member of the firm appeared before him for a final ruling within the previous two years.Judges should probably also have to agree to serve a minimum period on the bench - say five years - to justify the expense of selecting, recruiting and training them, the paper argues. "Increasing the diversity of the judiciary, particularly the number of women and those from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, remains one of my key priorities," Lord Falconer said. "Prohibition on return to practice can act as a real barrier to people considering judicial appointment at an early stage of their career."I want to access the talents of younger lawyers with excellent skills. Removing this barrier will offer significant encouragement to them."Sitting as a judge is no longer part of the lord chancellor's job, and the move will not benefit Lord Falconer.In a speech last year he said: "I have already said I won't return to practice if there is ever a day when I am no longer lord chancellor."
