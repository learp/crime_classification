An online viral advertising campaign against hate crime has taken inspiration from computer games and virtual reality worlds such as Second Life to tell the story of the murder of Stephen Lawrence.The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust ad campaign takes the form of six viral films recreating real-life hate crime incidents from the UK, and uses the concept of a fictional computer game to push the message "Stand up to hatred".Each of the two-minute viral ads, created by creative production company Knifedge, opens as if the viewer is playing an interactive virtual reality title called "The Hate Game".The first 80 seconds of the Stephen Lawrence film, which has the backing of his mother Doreen, tells the story of his death, viewed from the point of view of the teenager as he is attacked while waiting for a bus with his friend.As the animated Lawrence's life force, represented by a heart symbol, stops, the viral ad cuts to a 40-second clip of Doreen Lawrence. "This isn't a game. This happened to my son Stephen," she says.She goes on to say: "We all must recognise when hate crime is taking place and report it."Three other viral ads tell animated versions of real-life stories involving homophobia, Islamaphobia and anti-semitism in the UK. The remaining two virals tell stories related to the holocaust and Nazi persecution.The viral ads have been launched to raise awareness about Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January – the anniversary of the liberation of Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz in 1945. The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust campaigns for racial and religious harmony."The issues addressed in these films are occurring every day across the UK and it is vitally important we begin to recognise the dangers that unchecked hatred presents to us," said Jack Gilbert, a trustee of HDMT, of which the Queen is a patron. "Every day people in the UK stereotype, discriminate, exclude, bully, persecute and attack because of race, religion, disability or sexuality."The animated clips will be used as support material for teachers, youth and community workers and local groups. They will also be made available on DVD with guidance notes.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.
