The justice secretary, Jack Straw, has refused tabloid demands to say why one of James Bulger's killers had his probation revoked. Straw insisted it was critical that Jon Venables be able to get a fair trial in future.Answering an urgent question on Venables in the Commons, Straw told MPs that divulging more details would not be in the interests of justice. He gave a clear hint that the allegations did not involve Venables killing or seriously injuring anybody.His statement came a few hours after James Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, expressed her fury at the government's handling of the case and called for the sacking of the mentoring team that was overseeing Venables' supervision.Straw told the Commons: "I fully understand the concern of James Bulger's parents and the wider public about this case and indeed the frustration voiced by James's mother, Mrs Fergus, that insufficient information has been provided to her."As I indicated earlier today, I have been giving further active consideration as to whether it would be appropriate to provide more information. But in the event, I have concluded this would not presently be in the interests of justice."He disclosed that initially it was discovered that Venables's new identity had been compromised and only then was it established that he had committed a further offence. It has been widely reported that the offence is connected with possession of computer images of child pornography but Straw made no comment on that detail.Straw did try to reassure Fergus by reiterating that if Venables was charged with a serious further offence there would be a "thorough review" of his probation supervision since he was released on a life licence in 2001.The 27-year-old was jailed in 1993 along with Robert Thompson for the murder of James Bulger, aged two, after the pair abducted him from a shopping centre in Bootle, Liverpool.In an interview with ITV's This Morning programme , Fergus renewed her demand to know why his probation was revoked, saying she was "sick of them closing doors in my face". But in a move that will undermine the tabloid campaign, she added that she would wait for the details rather than jeopardise any future trial."But then I'll be asking the question, OK then, once it's all done and dusted will I then get to know the full details of what they've been doing in the nine years since their release?"Straw's promise of a thorough review of Venables's supervision by the probation service since his release in 2001 was an attempt to meet that demand.He indicated that "active consideration" was being given to protecting Venables's safety while he is in prison.MPs from all parties supported Straw in not giving in to what they called "tabloid justice" or "lynch mob law in prison", with senior Liberal Democrat and Conservative figures saying the rule of law was more important than the interests of competing tabloid newspapers.
