Metropolitan police commander Brian Paddick last night announced he had given up his fight to return to his job in Lambeth, blaming hostile sections of the media and a lack of support in Scotland Yard.Mr Paddick was cleared of any serious wrongdoing three weeks after an eight month investigation into allegations of drug taking. He will start a new job at Scotland Yard, in the intelligence unit responsible for implementing the national intelligence model. In 15 months as commander of the south London borough, he pioneered the "softly,softly" approach to the cannabis laws to be adopted in a modified form around Britain next year. He also built up an impressive anti-crime record. There were still calls for his reinstatement this week from some Lambeth councillors. Last night Mr Paddick issued a statement: "Were I now to return to Lambeth as the borough commander, certain sections of the media, whose intentions have been clear from the start, would no doubt highlight and exaggerate the challenge that Lambeth faces. I would anticipate unreasonable and unjustified attention on the work of my colleagues in the police, and unfounded criticism of them, should crime rise for any reason." Mr Paddick is the Met's most senior openly gay officer, and there have been protests that he has been victim of a witchhunt. He said Sir John Stevens, the Met commissioner, had made it clear he should move on, and that to pressurise the commissioner to the contrary would not help the borough - however unfair and unjustified the enforced move was. It was greeted with regret by London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, who said Mr Paddick achieved impressive results in a borough regarded as one of the most challenging in London, and built an excellent relationship with the community.
