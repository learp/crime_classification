The murderAnthony Walker, also 18, died in hospital after up to four white men attacked him in Huyton, Merseyside, in July 2005. He was killed with a blow from an ice pick to the head. He, too, had been taunted with racist abuse as he waited at a bus stop with his white girlfriend and a male cousin. They fled but were set upon in a park. It was Friday night and the Sunday newspapers prominently reported the story. Comparisons were made with the Lawrence case. Police responseThe police were clear what they were dealing with from the start. Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Lawson of Merseyside police said: "What we are dealing with here is an unprovoked and vicious attack on a young black man which we believe to be racially motivated." Within two days there were arrests and before the week was out the police named two principal suspects, who had fled to Amsterdam.The outcomePublicity was fuelled by the fact that one of the suspects was the brother of the footballer Joey Barton. Four months after the murder, Michael Barton, 17, and his cousin, Paul Taylor, 20, were given life sentences.
