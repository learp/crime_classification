The former Liberal Democrat donor Michael Brown has been sentenced to six months' jail for fleeing the UK while awaiting trial over an £8m fraud.Judge Alistair McCreath sentenced Brown to six months for breaching his bail, which will be added to the seven-year sentence for fraud he received in his absence in May 2009, a court official said.Brown managed to convince a number of businesspeople that he was a successful investor with connections to royalty and the US secret services. In fact, he was a Glaswegian son of a whisky executive who had few qualifications and was being sought for fraud in Florida.A court was later told that Brown's company was wholly fraudulent and that the £2.4m donation to the Lib Dems during the 2005 election campaign was made only so that he could convince his victims, including former Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards, that he was a legitimate and well-connected businessman. The party was cleared of wrongdoing.Brown went on the run in July 2008, but was arrested in the Dominican Republic in January.Last month a judge at Southwark crown court directed Brown to start his seven-year jail sentence after he was extradited to the UK via Spain.A court official at the court said on Monday: "Michael Brown has received a sentence of six months' imprisonment for breach of bail."Nine days he spent in prison in Spain will be deducted from the sentence, which will run consecutively with the sentence he received for theft, perverting the course of justice and transferring criminal property in May 2009."
