He had attended an address in Rotherfield on Saturday lunchtime from where he was transferred to hospital. “The information we have so far has led us to treat this man, who is known to the couple, as a potential suspect in our investigation. He has not been arrested as he remains critically ill in hospital.“This is a tragic incident and we are appealing to anyone in the area who might have seen or heard anything suspicious in Maybush Drive between 9am on Friday and 8.35am when the fire started on Saturday morning.”
