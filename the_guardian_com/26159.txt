A man who attacked his heavily pregnant ex-girlfriend, killing their unborn baby, has lost his appeal against a life sentence.At the Old Bailey in December 2015, teaching assistant Kevin Wilson, 23, was convicted of child destruction and causing grievous bodily harm to Malorie Bantala.Wilson was later jailed for a minimum of 16 years after a judge heard that he took matters into his own hands after Bantala refused to have an abortion.Judge Mark Lucraft said it was a “cowardly, vile, callous attack”, which resulted in the healthy 32-week-old boy being stillborn, and Bantala needing life-saving surgery.At the court of appeal on Tuesday, three judges said that a life sentence was justified, but reduced the length of the minimum term to 14 years less time on remand.Mr Justice Spencer said it was an “unspeakably wicked act”.He added: “Here was a young man who was prepared to take the steps he did in a calculated and cold-blooded way to achieve his objective, because there was an obstacle in his way.”On the day of the assault, in June 2015, Bantala had been buying decorations for her baby shower.As she returned to her flat in Peckham, south-east London, Wilson and a 17-year-old accomplice emerged from bushes disguised in crash helmets.They kicked and stamped on Bantala’s stomach as she lay curled up on the ground, desperately trying to protect her unborn child with one hand.Bantala, who lost six pints of blood and had two fingers broken, immediately told police her child’s father was responsible, saying: “He doesn’t want the baby.”She described her son, Joel, as the “real victim”.“The moment Joel died inside me I lost everything, literally. Life as I knew it no longer made sense.”
