The prime minister's plans for tackling youth antisocial behaviour will be undermined by the relaxation of laws allowing shops and supermarkets to sell alcohol 24 hours a day, the opposition claimed today.Tony Blair this morning announced a major extension of the government's parenting orders for out-of-control children, in the first move of the planned "respect" agenda to tackle yobbish behaviour.A policy document is expected in November, as the government attempts to refocus the political debate back on to domestic issues, rather than Iraq, which has dominated headlines throughout the summer. The Labour party conference is also expected to focus heavily on the theme.But both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats condemned Mr Blair's first speech since returning from holiday as confused and a knee-jerk response.Theresa May, the Tories' family affairs spokeswoman, said the prime minister was trying to solve the problem "from the wrong end".She said: "Parents and families should be given more real support to provide a stable and solid environment, and children should know the boundaries before they cross them. The prime minister's message is confused. "How, on the one hand, can he be talking about tackling underage drinking when his proposed licensing laws would make it easier to buy alcohol from supermarkets and corner shops - the very place that most underage drinkers manage to get hold of alcohol? "It is quite clear the prime minister has not thought a lot of this through."Mark Oaten, the Lib Dems' home affairs spokesman, gave the extension of parental orders a cautious welcome, but echoed the Conservatives' concerns.He added: "Blair's announcement must be the beginning of an effort to tackle the causes of crime rather than a diet of punishments and soundbites which have proved ineffective." "If the prime minister had wanted to show real action he would have announced a suspension to the licensing legislation. In his speech in Watford, Mr Blair said that parenting contracts and orders should be available if youngsters were at risk of being involved in yobbishness, not only when they had been already. "Far too often we get heavy when the problem has got too serious," he said.Under plans to be outlined in detail in November, housing officers and local antisocial behaviour teams will be added to the list of agencies which can apply for parenting orders. Schools may also be allowed to ask parents to go on the courses, which last up to 12 months.The orders are very varied, and can hold parents responsible for ensuring that children obey dusk curfews, attend literacy and numeracy classes, or drug and alcohol education or keep away from specified shopping centres.He admitted parenting orders would have seemed "bizarre or dangerous" even a few years ago, but insisted they were not part of a "nanny state".He told an audience of social workers and childcare professionals: "People need to understand if their kids are out of control and they're causing a nuisance to the local community, something is going to happen."They can't just get away with that." Echoing his language on anti-terrorism measures before his Barbados holiday, Mr Blair pledged to "change the rules of the game" in dealing with antisocial behaviour as he announced plans to extend the use of parenting contracts and orders.
