Deaths following fights between pupils are shocking partly because they are so rare.The last child to be killed in England following a school fight is believed to be Rashid Femi, aged 12, who died after an incident at Chingford foundation school in east London in December 2002. School-related violence became a major national issue in the mid-1990s following the murder of London headteacher Philip Lawrence and the near-riots at the Ridings school in Halifax. Mr Lawrence was fatally stabbed while protecting a pupil at the gates of St George's Roman Catholic school in north London, in December 1995. The leader of a gang of youths involved was jailed for 12 years for murder. In December 1998, 16-year-old Darren Carruthers died of brain damage following a playground fight at Heworth Grange comprehensive school in Gateshead. A 15-year-old was eventually acquitted of his manslaughter at Newcastle crown court. In December 2001, Abdulkadir Maye, a 15-year-old Somali pupil at Little Ilford school in Newham, east London, was fatally stabbed following a lunchbreak row over Â£10. More than 12 years ago, in April 1991, a 16-year-old girl named Diane Watson died after being stabbed in the playground at Whitehill secondary school in Dennistoun, Glasgow.
