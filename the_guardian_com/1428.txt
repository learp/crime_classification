Police have found no evidence of crime at a seaside property where the serial killer Peter Tobin once lived.Search teams and forensic archaeologists have spent 15 days excavating a large rear garden and examining the basement areas of the house in Brighton.Sussex police said the search uncovered no evidence linking the property in Marine Parade to crimes by Tobin, who lived there in the late 1980s.A nine-day search at another property in Station Road, Portslade, ended last week without finding any link to crimes committed by the 63-year-old Scottish handyman.Tobin is serving three life sentences for murder, but is suspected of claiming more victims as he lived across Britain under different names and trawled the motorway for vulnerable female hitchhikers. Operation Anagram, a national exercise by police forces across the UK, was set up to investigate other possible killings.Detective Chief Inspector Nick Sloan, of Sussex police's major crime section, said: "As a result of work conducted under Operation Anagram, two addresses in Brighton and Hove were identified as there being enough intelligence to warrant searches of the back gardens and some interior spaces of the buildings."We have a duty to fully investigate any allegations of criminality and teams of specialists and experts undertook these complex searches."I am completely satisfied that we have conducted thorough and meticulous searches and that both addresses are unconnected to any criminality linked to Peter Tobin."Tobin is serving life sentences for killing Angelika Kluk, 23, Vicky Hamilton, 15, and Dinah McNicol, 18.He is challenging his sentence for Vicky Hamilton's murder, but failed to appear at the court of appeal in Edinburgh last week because of illness.Tobin was told in December he would die in jail after he was convicted of strangling McNicol.Police found the remains of Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol buried in the garden of a house in Margate, Kent, where Tobin moved in March 1991.The searches of the two addresses in East Sussex began on 12 July. The Station Road property was run as a cafe in 1988 by Tobin and Cathy Wilson, who later became his wife and with whom he had a son. Neighbours recalled Tobin doing a substantial amount of DIY on the property as he converted it from a junk shop and cleared the garden.Police are believed to have narrowed down their review of unsolved murders and disappearances linked to Tobin to nine cases. These may include the murders of art student Jessie Earl, 22, whose body was found in 1989, and Louise Kay, 18, whose body was never found after she vanished in Eastbourne in 1988.There are several other possible cases, including: law student Pamela Exall, 22, who vanished in Norfolk in 1974; schoolgirl Patricia Morris, 14, who went missing in Essex in 1980; and Suzanne Lawrence, 14, last seen in Essex in 1979.Other cases include the murders of three women in Glasgow in 1968 and 1969 by a figure nicknamed "Bible John", and the deaths of schoolgirls Karen Hadaway, 10, and Nicola Fellows, nine, in Brighton in October 1986.Detectives are keen to unravel further details of Tobin's life, particularly where he lived in 1977 and 1978. They tried to see him in prison, but he refused to talk.Police said Tobin used several aliases, mostly variations of the same name, during about two decades in Brighton from 1969 when he lived at homes in Dyke Road, Regency Square, Eastern Street and Chadborn Close. He lived in several other towns and cities, including Glasgow and Havant, Hampshire. Police said he may have owned more than 100 vehicles and used 40 aliases.Sloan said that "literally, no stone was left unturned" during the searches of the East Sussex properties. Ground penetrating radar was used, and two wells excavated, one at each location."Areas which necessitated further exploration were excavated and tonnes of earth and concrete have been analysed, sifted and metal-detected by Sussex police search teams and archaeologist experts from University College London," he said.Sloan said officers were still receiving calls from members of the public about Tobin and he renewed an appeal for people with information to come forward.Anyone with information can call Sussex police on 0845 6070 999, quoting Operation Anagram, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
