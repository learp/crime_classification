Barry George's sister, Michelle Diskin, has played perhaps the most important part in the effort to clear his name. Without her persistence in seeking the best legal advice and without her support during his seven years in prison, it is unlikely that George would be celebrating his freedom.As the jury foreman returned a not guilty verdict yesterday afternoon, she mouthed a "thank you" at them. She was almost speechless as she took in the news but was able to say she was "thrilled" by the verdict."This has been a seven-year uphill struggle," she said outside court. "We are really delighted to finally have justice and we would like to thank everyone who has supported us. Today we are elated."As news of the verdict spread, Diskin took a call from Paddy Hill of the Birmingham Six who had stood outside the Old Bailey after being cleared of the Birmingham pub bombings. He has visited George in prison and has offered Diskin help. Yesterday she expressed her gratitude to Hill and to the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation (MoJo) for which he works. Diskin said that she had great sympathy for the family of Dando who now have to come to terms with the fact that no one has been convicted of her death. She also made a plea for vulnerable people such as her brother not to be "targeted" by the police in such investigations in the future. Diskin has always believed in her brother's innocence. Even when he failed to have his conviction overturned at his first appeal, she always said that she would continue fighting to have him freed. Now she faces the responsibility of helping George to readjust to a world with which he has never had a very comfortable relationship.
