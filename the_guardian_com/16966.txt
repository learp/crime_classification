Police are investigating a spate of "smash and grab" raids in which thieves use diggers or four-wheel drive cars to rip out cash machines. There have been 10 such attacks in Kent since the start of the year, prompting the offer of a £30,000 reward for information.On Friday three masked raiders hauled an ATM out of a post office by strapping it to a 4x4. They succeeded in dragging the machine outside, but part of their car broke away in the process, forcing them to drive off empty-handed.On Thursday a gang used a digger to rip a cash machine from the wall of a bank before driving it away in a silver 4x4. Part of the cash machine was abandoned and the NatWest building was badly damaged.In another robbery in Gillingham more than £100,000 was stolen. Police cannot say whether the attacks are linked.Assistant chief constable Allyn Thomas of Kent police urged the public to dial 999 if they spotted any unusual movement of diggers or plant machinery at night, or saw people acting suspiciously near banks and shops with cash machines.He said police had been working with banks to improve cash machine security. "This includes the use of red dye which spoils all of the money and visibly stains the thieves in the event a cash machine is tampered with," Mr Thomas said. "Also, many freestanding machines are now bolted securely to the floor." Police have also talked to building firms about ensuring plant machinery is secured.Many detectives involved have experience of dealing with this crime after a series of similar thefts two years ago. That investigation led to seven people being convicted of stealing cash machines - receiving jail terms that totalled 33 years.
