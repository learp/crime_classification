A specialist team of four tracker dogs that are able to detect smells several weeks old will today join the search for clues to the stabbing of Abigail Witchalls.The dogs, which have been trained in enhanced search techniques, will be taken along pathways through the village of Little Bookham, Surrey, used by Ms Witchalls on the afternoon she was attacked.The 26-year-old was stabbed in the neck in front of her 21-month-old son Joseph almost six weeks ago. Detectives say the dogs, which will also search woodland surrounding the route taken by Ms Witchalls, will be looking for any "outstanding evidence", including the knife used by her attacker. The paths were searched by conventional police dogs at the time of the attempted murder. Detectives have brought in the dogs, from the Dyfed Powys and South Yorkshire police forces, because of new information that came to light during the course of the investigation into the stabbing, police said. "Due to information that has come in throughout the course of the investigation, we now have more specific knowledge of the things we would like to get these dogs to search for," a spokeswoman for Surrey Police said. The specialist tracker dogs, of which there are only a small number in the UK, were last used in Surrey during the search for the schoolgirl Milly Dowler in 2002. She was later found dead in Hampshire. Two and a half weeks after the 13-year-old's disappearance, dogs similar to those being used today were brought in to search areas of Walton-on-Thames. The four dogs and their handlers will retrace the route Ms Witchalls took on the afternoon of April 20 as she returned from the Messy Monkeys mother and toddler group, pushing Joseph in a buggy. She was followed along a narrow lane and stabbed in the back of the neck, leaving her paralysed, moments after her attacker had held a knife to the toddler's throat.
