A gunman who tried to kill a disabled woman after shooting her partner dead in a "cold-blooded, deliberate execution" has been jailed for a minimum of 42 years.Daniel Bidace Anthony, 30, fired twice at double leg amputee Amy Ashitey, 28, as she lay in bed. One bullet pierced part of her lung and remains lodged in her body, while the other missed before the gun jammed, the Old Bailey heard.Bidace Anthony, a drug dealer, had already killed Ashitey's partner, Dothan Gordon, in the living room of the couple's home in Ealing, west London, during the attack in June last year.He wanted to kill Ashitey because she recognised him, jurors were told.Bidace Anthony showed no emotion in the dock as he was given a life sentence for murdering Gordon and told he must to serve at least 42 years before being considered for parole.He was given determinate sentences of 36 years and 15 years to run concurrently for attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, respectively.Judge Timothy Pontius said on Wednesday it was difficult to imagine a case involving a murder committed with such "cold-blooded and totally merciless deliberation"."You took Dothan Gordon from the room where he and Amy Ashitey had quietly been watching television, into the living room where, the evidence makes abundantly clear, you made him kneel on the floor, forehead against a stool, and then executed him with a single shot to the back of the head," the judge said.Pontius said there was genuine and understandable public concern about the availability of guns in major cities and the sentences made it "abundantly plain that courts will punish those convicted for gun crime with exemplary severity"."In light of the horrifying brutality of these crimes I am wholly unable to regard you other than as someone to whom deliberate violence comes readily," he said.Despite having no previous convictions for violence, Pontius said the defendant's large-scale dealing in class A drugs meant he could not be treated as a person of good character.Another defendant, Antonie Joseph, walked free from court on Tuesday after he was cleared of assisting an offender.In a statement read to the court after the verdict, Ashitey paid tribute to her partner, who was known as Sunny, as the father of their "two beautiful girls".But Ashitey said she had hoped to walk down the aisle with Gordon, 32, at a wedding ceremony planned for last August. "He was such a huge part of my life," she said.In her statement, Ashitey said the bullet in her body was a constant reminder of what happened.Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC previously told the court that Gordon was shot in the back of the head as he tried to act as a middle man in a Â£100,000 drugs deal.He said: "This case involved the cold-blooded execution of a man and the callous attempted murder of a double amputee lying in her bed when she was shot. The man was trying to kill her because she had recognised the killer."Bidace Anthony, of Earl's Court, west London, denied the charges but was found guilty by majority verdict on Tuesday.
