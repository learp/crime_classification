Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, today called for the abolition of prison sentences lasting less than two months.In a speech marking the publication of a report from his Centre for Social Justice thinktank, Duncan Smith said that short jail sentences should be replaced by tougher community penalties, incorporating treatment and rehabilitation for drug and mental health problems.Dominic Grieve, the shadow justice spokesman, backed the CSJ analsyis, although the Tories are not committed to getting rid of short sentences because they do not think that robust enough community alternatives are available yet.The CSJ report, Order in the Courts, argues that the centralisation of the justice system over the last 10 years has been "an expensive failure".In a speech launching the report, Duncan Smith said: "If the criminal justice system were a business, it would have been liquidated long ago."He said that reoffending cost Britain about £11bn a year and that short sentences were a farce that were "often only handed down because community orders are even more toothless".Calling for short prison sentences to be abolished, Duncan Smith said that they ought to be replaced with tougher, longer and more tightly structured community sentences, and that courts ought to play an active role in supervising those sentences.Commenting on his proposal, Grieve said: "Iain Duncan Smith is correct that short sentences are a poor device for rehabilitation; they tend to be imposed because courts and magistrates have tried everything else and it has failed. If we are to reduce the number of short sentences then we have got to provide non-custodial alternatives that are seen to work."Jack Straw, the justice secretary, said that he would study the report but that the government had already taken steps to make community sentences more effective."A big effort has gone into tough community sentences as alternatives to short-term custody – one of the suggestions in the report – and generally these are working well," he said."The prison population for women and for under-18s is down, partly as a result."
