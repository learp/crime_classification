Britain's most senior prosecutor, who has been criticised for bringing charges against a mother cleared of trying to murder her seriously ill daughter, has defended his decision.Keir Starmer QC, the director of public prosecutions, issued a statement in which he said putting the case of Kay Gilderdale before a jury was in the public interest.Yesterday, after Gilderdale was found not guilty of attempting to murder her daughter, the trial judge, Mr Justice Bean, criticised the Crown Prosecution Service for pursuing the case. He was the second criminal judge to question the necessity of the prosecution: six months before the trial, Judge Richard Brown pointed out that Gilderdale had already admitted aiding and abetting suicide and invited the CPS to drop the attempted murder case.Gilderdale, 55, from Stonegate in East Sussex, was given a conditional discharge for assisted suicide at Lewes crown court. Her daughter, Lynn, 31, bedridden and in need of constant care after contracting a severe form of the chronic fatigue disease ME, had expressed a wish to end her life, had attempted suicide before, and, on 3 December 2008, after a failed attempt to kill herself by injecting morphine, she begged her mother for help. Reluctantly, after trying to persuade her against her decision, Gilderdale handed her daughter two syringes of morphine.Had she stopped at that point, she may never have found herself in court. However, in the eyes of the CPS, her initial attempts at helping her daughter "progressed to attempted murder" when she went on to administer morphine after Lynn lost consciousness. She was only spared a charge of murder because the toxicology tests had not been clear as to which dose of morphine or lethal drugs had killed her.In his statement, Starmer said he was satisfied there was enough evidence against Gilderdale to provide "a realistic prospect of conviction" for attempted murder.He said that he fully respected the jury's not guilty verdict and said that he recognised that she was a "devoted mother who acted out of love and devotion for her daughter".He added: "But the fact remains that where the CPS is satisfied that there is evidence to support a charge of attempted murder, the seriousness of that charge will very often mean that it is in the public interest to bring a case to court so that a jury can consider the evidence and return their verdict, as they did in this case."As the CPS assisted suicide interim policy makes clear, assisted suicide and attempted murder are very different offences. Assisted suicide involves assisting the victim to take his or her own life. Attempted murder is a step further than assisted suicide because it involves attempting to take the victim's life directly."Right-to-die campaigner Debbie Purdy, who won a landmark case last year, described the decision to bring Gilderdale to trial as frightening, and accused the CPS of ignoring public opinion and wasting public money by pressing ahead with it.Bean said interim guidelines containing a checklist of 13 mitigating factors over whether to prosecute a relative for assisted suicide, issued by the CPS last November, should have applied in this case.
