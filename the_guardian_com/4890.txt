A pregnant 14-year-old girl who went missing on Boxing Day has been found murdered and partially-stripped in the grounds of a rural church.Police launched a murder hunt yesterday after an elderly man visiting his wife's grave found the girl's body at St Michael's Church in Madeley, Shropshire. A post-mortem examination indicated she was strangled. Further tests are being carried out to determine whether she was sexually assaulted and if she was killed in the church grounds or whether her body was dumped there later.A West Mercia Police spokesman said last night that the girl had been formally identified but her identity would not be released until all her relatives had been told. However, he confirmed that she had been pregnant when she was killed. The teenager was last seen between 9pm and 10pm on Boxing Day in Southgate in the Sutton Hill area of Telford. Officers are carrying out house-to-house inquiries. CCTV footage of the area is also being examined. Det Insp Andy Parsons of West Mercia police, who is leading the murder hunt, said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen this girl after 9pm on Boxing Day night. "She was partially-clothed when she was found and we are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have seen the clothes she was wearing earlier in the evening. We would ask that people check their gardens, hedges and even their dustbins in case this clothing has been left there." The vicar at St Michael's, the Rev Henry Morris, told the Shropshire Star newspaper that he did not know who the girl was. "Everyone seems very shocked," he said.
