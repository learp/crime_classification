A South Armagh man who recently returned from the United States was today being questioned over the IRA murder of the SAS-trained army captain Robert Nairac 31 years ago.The 57-year-old suspect was arrested by the Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) serious crime squad in connection with the 1977 murder, which remains one of the most mysterious killings of Northern Ireland's Troubles.Nairac conducted undercover surveillance against the IRA in Ireland's border region at the height of the conflict.The suspect was being held at Antrim Town police station. A PSNI spokesman confirmed the man was being questioned in connection with Nairac's murder.The force is understood to be in discussions with authorities in the US about the possibility of extraditing two other suspects in the case.Nairac, who was 28 years old, was abducted by the IRA at Jonesborough, Co Armagh, on May 14 1977. He was taken across the border into a forest in the Irish Republic and shot dead. His body was never recovered, and the soldier has since been classed as "disappeared" - one of up to a dozen people who were killed and buried in secret by the IRA.One theory put forward by the IRA informer Eamon Collins, who was later murdered by the Provisional IRA's South Armagh Brigade, was that Nairac's body had been put through a mincing machine in a local meat factory.Six people were convicted in relation to Nairac's murder, five from Northern Ireland and one from the Irish Republic, but police believe three other republicans were involved. It is understood two of them are now living in the US.Nairac, who was educated at Ampleforth public school and Oxford University, was abducted from a pub in Drumintee, south Armagh. He had been in the Three Steps Inn singing republican songs.He was seized during a struggle in the pub's car park and taken across the border to a field at Ravensdale, Co Louth, where he was interrogated for more than an hour and then shot.Two years after the murder, the Queen approved Nairac's posthumous George Cross, the highest gallantry honour in peacetime.Nairac had penned an internal army document, Talking to People in South Armagh, which argued that the "war" against the IRA had to be intelligence-based rather than "out-ambushing or out-shooting" the Provisional IRA's most ruthless units.
