A former army bomb disposal expert denied trying to murder his pregnant wife in a car explosion when he appeared at Maidstone crown court today.Nicholas Fabian, 33, pleaded not guilty to the attempted murder of Victoria Fabian. He also pleaded not guilty to a charge of grievous bodily harm with intent against her, and to a charge of causing an explosion likely to endanger life.He admitted to possessing ammunition (95 rounds of 5.56mm rifle bullets) without a firearms licence.Prosecutor Graham Reeds QC told the court that the case would proceed to trial. There will be a delay before the case is heard because a number of witnesses are in the armed forces and are currently serving in Afghanistan.Mrs Fabian suffered serious leg injuries in the blast in a residents' car park in Highview in Vigo, near Meopham, on 5 March. Her unborn child was unharmed.Her eight-year-old son, who was also in the car at the time, was taken to hospital as a precaution but released after being kept in for observation.Fabian was remanded in custody to appear at the same court for trial on 31 January next year. The case is expected to last two weeks.
