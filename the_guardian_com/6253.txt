A teenager who took part in a brutal attack on a man because he asked a group of youths to stop making noise outside his flat has been jailed for more than two years.Warehouseman Andrew Toseland, 49, suffered a severe head injury, was in a coma for two months and will need care for the rest of his life following the assault near his flat in Gosport, Hampshire.Brandon Fisher, 19, held back Toseland's brother Robert as another teenager, Samuel Armstrong, kicked and stamped on their victim's head while he lay unconscious in a pool of blood, Portsmouth crown court was told.Fisher, who did not assault the brothers, was jailed for 27 months while Armstrong, also 19, will be sentenced at a later date.Matthew Lawson, prosecuting, said the teenagers had been at a party at a block of flats on 25 August last year but were kicked out. Fisher had drunk half a bottle of vodka and he, Armstrong and other youths were making a noise.The Toseland brothers came out of their flat to ask them to be quiet. After a row Robert Toseland was punched and the youths left but returned later.Again the Toselands came out of the flat and were immediately attacked by Armstrong who punched Robert Toseland and aimed a flying kick at Andrew Toseland, Lawson said.The barrister added: "Mr Armstrong punched him to the floor and was kicking and stamping on Andrew Toseland who was unconscious. While this was going on, Robert Toseland tried to intervene to stop Samuel Armstrong stamping on his brother, but was restrained by Mr Fisher and Samuel Armstrong continued to stamp on Andrew Toseland's head."The men left with Andrew Toseland unconscious in a pool of blood. He suffered blood clots to the brain and his glasses had been smashed into his face, the court heard. "The brother [Andrew Toseland] was simply trying to stop the noise outside his flat late at night," Lawson said.In mitigation, the court heard that Fisher tried to stop the attack when he realised how serious it was and that he did not attack anyone that night.But jailing him, judge Sarah Munro said he bore some responsibility for Toseland's injuries because he restrained his brother. "I accept it was never your intention that Andrew Toseland suffer anything like the injuries that he in fact did," she told him. But she added that the assault's "hideous consequences" meant jail was the only option.Fisher, of Gosport, admitted unlawful wounding on the basis that he had a subordinate role in the assault.Armstrong, also from Gosport, has admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent on Andrew Toseland and actual bodily harm on Robert Toseland.Though his family say he will never fully recover, they are pleased with the progress Andrew Tolseland has now made.Following the incident, neighbours complained that police had not done enough to tackle antisocial behaviour in the area.
