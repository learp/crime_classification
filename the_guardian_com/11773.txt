Detectives have arrested a man after a shooting in which another man was seriously wounded near his home in Gloucester. The 42-year-old, also from Gloucester, has been held on suspicion of attempted murder. A 24-year-old man was shot in the suburb of Matson on Friday night. He was treated by paramedics at the scene and taken to hospital with serious leg wounds. A police spokesman said the man was in a stable but not life-threatening condition. Detective Chief Inspector Neil Kelly said: "Thankfully incidents like this are very rare. We do not believe this was a random shooting."
