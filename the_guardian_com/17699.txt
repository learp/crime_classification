The home secretary, David Blunkett, today signalled a radical reform of Britain's outdated sex crime laws, including plans to tackle internet paedophiles.Mr Blunkett told a conference on modernising the criminal justice system that the long awaited legislation would be brought in to combat "horrendous" sex abusers. The reform will be based on a consultation paper published in 2000, called Setting the Boundaries, which proposed bringing in a specific offence of child abuse, sweeping away restrictions on homosexual indecency and reforming rape laws. The home secretary did not confirm which areas of the document would be adopted, but options include a significant relaxation of laws on gay sex by abolishing the offences of buggery, gross indecency and soliciting by men - the so-called "cottaging" laws. He said: "We will legislate in the next session of parliament on sex offences and sex offenders. "Sex offences in terms of the 19th century laws and definitions which have been consulted on in the last two years, and sex offenders in terms of updating our laws to take account of the most horrendous events that have been in the headlines in this country." Mr Blunkett's official spokesman later confirmed he was referring to the publicity on appalling paedophile rings and how the internet was being used to exploit children. He also said a white paper could be expected in the autumn, followed by a bill.
