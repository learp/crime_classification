Scotland's mainstream media have finally grasped the significance of a story about the racist abuse of a Glasgow-based journalist.The newspapers and broadcasters ignored the importance of the case last month when David Limond was convicted of "sending a threatening communication aggravated by racial and religious prejudice."They were also slow to highlight it yesterday when Limond was sentenced to six months in prison for his online broadcasting of a stream of insults directed at journalist Angela Haggerty.He referred to her as a "Taig" - a derogatory term used in Scotland to describe Irish people and those with an Irish heritage - and encouraged listeners to "hit her with everything you've got." She was then subjected to a series of abusive tweets.  Today's Daily Record splashToday's Daily Record splashed on Limond's jailing, though the angle it took suggested it did so because he happens to be the brother of Brian Limond, a comedian known widely in Scotland for his BBC series, Limmy's Show.That said, its lengthy page 9 article is comprehensive and explains the background to the case. It has certainly given the story sufficient air. By contrast, The Sun's Scottish edition did not run the story in its early editions, later giving it a couple of paragraphs at the foot of page 7. The Herald carried a page 1 mention plus a fuller report on page 3.Though BBC Scotland and STV published short online items, they evidently failed to carry reports in their broadcast bulletins.Despite the condemnation of Limond's anti-Irish racist abuse by the judge who jailed him, he received support under the Twitter hashtag #freelimmy.Tweets on the RangersChat account (@rangerscallin) also heap more abuse on Haggerty. Some also refer to "Catholic scum" and "stupid Fenians."
