A huge haul of antiques and art stolen from country houses and galleries, and worth more than £500,000, was recovered by police tackling an alleged organised crime network. After police raids on 13 properties, three people were arrested in south-east London yesterday on suspicion of money laundering and conspiring to launder money from the sale of the property. The swoop by the Met police's art and antiques unit, codenamed Copernicus, was the culmination of a two-year investigation into property theft worth £30m. It was aimed at those believed to be laundering the proceeds of high-value burglaries via an organised criminal network in south-east London. The Met worked with other forces in areas hit by burglaries, including Thames Valley, Wiltshire, Sussex and Suffolk. The investigation, which recovered property from south-east London, Essex and Kent, and was centred on activities in Catford, south-east London, culminated today in the raids, in south-east London. Two men, 46 and 73, were arrested at an auction house and a 50-year-old woman was arrested separately in south-east London. Detective Chief Inspector David Thompson said: "The operation identified a professional criminal network responsible for the wholesale theft and sale of valuable items from country houses. We hope that today's action, by dismantling the principal outlet in south-east England for the laundering of high-value stolen goods, will prevent future losses and protect both valuable property and potential victims." Among the stolen items were miniature paintings from Madresfield Court, in Worcestershire, which thieves obtained by rowing across a moat at night, and silver worth £1m taken from a dealer in Petworth, Surrey. Valuable 18th-century buckets, and precious items in an ornate box worth £150,000, stolen from a country house in Wiltshire, were also recovered along with decorative objects from a country house in Berkshire. Hundreds of other objects, believed stolen, have yet to be identified.
