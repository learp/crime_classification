A man who hoarded loose change has fallen victim to an unlikely crime. Reports state that bottles of coins amounting to a five-figure sum have been stolen from John Benzie's house in Moray.Rather than spending his coppers, Benzie appears to have saved every one of them over a 20-year-period, accruing a small fortune in the process.Most of us have jars, trays or drawers that accumulate coins. Few are likely to have built up as much as Benzie, although past research has found that more than Â£5.6bn worth of cash is kept in people's homes.How much do you think you have lying around? Are you a compulsive hoarder, or do you spend every last penny you have?Are coins a nuisance or an opportunity to put some money aside for charity, pocket money, or a rainy-day treat? As it becomes worth less and less, should the very smallest change be abolished?
