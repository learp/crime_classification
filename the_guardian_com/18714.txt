The government has announced a 10-year crime reduction plan, which aims to break the cycle of re-offending through supervised rehabilitation services.The main points of Criminal Justice: the Way Ahead are Harsher sentences for persistent offenders with judges able to take their previous convictions into account; Jail terms of 12 months replaced by the three-month custody plus sentence  prisoners receive intensive supervision after their release with better drug treatment, education, training and housing support; A new joint central body to set out a police service-wide strategic approach to information technology, scientific and technical developments; Increasing police numbers, with supperbobby bonuses for senior officers who chose to remain on the beat rather than taking a desk job; Allowing private security guards to have a role in public safety  under police supervision; An extra 2,500 prison places; The creation of a specialist cadre of prosecutors to deal with organised and serious crime: Introduction of victim personal statements, so victims (including bereaved relatives in homicide cases) can give a statement in their own words saying how the crime has affected their lives; A new role for the crown prosecution service in keeping victims informed about the progress of cases; A possible victims fund to ensure victims are more swiftly compensated; A consultation on a new victims sharter, to include whether to establish a victims ombudsman to champion victims interests.
