Police in Northern Ireland have taken the highly unusual step of naming a man they want to speak to about a paramilitary-linked murder that took place in a city centre on Thursday.The PSNI asked the public for help in tracking down Kieran McLaughlin, a 58-year-old Derry man.Barry McCrory, who was 35, was shot dead at a flat in Shipquay Street in the centre of Derry. His partner, who was forced into another room during the attack, has been left "highly traumatised".The victim was allegedly involved in criminal activities in Derry.PSNI Detective Chief Inspector Ian Harrison said: "This was a brutal execution of an individual. No person has a right to be judge, jury and executioner."Less than 24 hours after the murder, which many in Derry are blaming on the New IRA – an alliance of dissident republican splinter groups – the PSNI issued a description of Kieran McLaughlin. It said he is about 5ft 7in tall, of medium build with blue eyes and grey hair. Detectives called for McLaughlin to contact them. The public are urged not to approach him, but to contact police in Northern Ireland immediately on 0845 600 8000.There is no suggestion of any link between McLaughlin and a murder earlier this week in north Belfast for which the New IRA claimed responsibility. The group admitted it shot dead Kevin Kearney, a father of four, before dumping his body in a lake.Meanwhile, police in Derry have been dealing with a bomb alert.Up to 1,000 people had to leave their homes overnight because of the security scare. Several roads were closed because of the alert and one – Lawrence Hill – remains cordoned off.Army bomb disposal officers are stilll at the scene and most residents have been able to return home.Gary Middleton, deputy mayor of Derry and a Democratic Unionist, said: "It's disgraceful to hear that around 1,000 people had to leave their homes. The police have to do their job and I condemn whoever is behind this alert."
