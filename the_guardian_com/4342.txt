Police investigating allegations of sexual abuse in the north Wales care system have charged six more men.Five men have been charged with a total of 26 offences of indecent assault, buggery and attempted buggery.The offences relate to two boys under 16, and are said to have been committed in the Wrexham area between 1981 and 1986. A sixth as yet unnamed man has also been charged with indecent assault against one of the boys.The men are due to appear next Thursday at Mold magistrates court, the National Crime Agency (NCA) announced.The charges were made as part of Operation Pallial, the NCA's investigation into hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse against children as young as six between 1953 and 1995.The total number of men accused of offences in the investigation now stands at nine. Detectives continue to examine allegations involving 28 institutions, including 18 children's homes.The NCA named the men, and the charges they faced, as:• Mark Granger, also known as Gary Cooke, 63, from Leicester, charged with three counts of indecent assault and two counts of buggery.• Marc Roy Norry, 54, from Connah's Quay, north Wales, accused of four counts of indecent assault, one count of buggery and one count of attempted buggery.• David Lightfoot, 71, from Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, charged with three counts of indecent assault, one count of buggery and one count of attempted buggery.• Keith Stokes, 61, from Farndon, Chester, charged with three counts of indecent assault, three counts of gross indecency, one count of buggery and one count of attempted buggery.• Edward Huxley, 69, from Maidenhead, Berkshire, accused of two counts of indecent assault.In addition, a 62-year-old man from the Wrexham area, charged with indecent assault, has also been summoned to appear at the court and will be named when he does so.Latest figures show 46 people have been identified as suspects under Operation Pallial, with 20 arrests made and eight people attending police stations voluntarily for interview. A total of 16 people are believed to have died since the offences were committed.Detectives said previously that they would continue to investigate allegations made against people believed now to be dead. In such cases, victims will be told whether their testimony is likely to have led to criminal charges being brought during the abuser's lifetime.A total of 271 people have reported allegations to the NCA, and information from 221 is under active investigation.The investigation, which is being led by a team of 26 officers at the NCA's north-west headquarters in Warrington, cost £727,000 between May and November last year, police said.
