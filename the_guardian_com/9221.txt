The Portuguese attorney-general who has been overseeing the police investigation into the missing toddler Madeleine McCann will announce on Monday his decision on whether it should be shelved.Fernando Pinto Monteiro has been reviewing the final police report into the disappearance of the British girl from her parents' Algarve holiday apartment on May 3 last year, days before her fourth birthday. Yesterday he told reporters in Lisbon that he would announce "a solution" to the case, but declined to elaborate. He has the option of bringing charges, closing the case or asking the police to continue investigating the disappearance. Earlier this month a number of Portuguese newspapers reported leaks suggesting that the case was likely to be closed.Clarence Mitchell, spokesman for Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, who remain "arguidos" or official suspects in the case, told the Guardian last night that neither they nor their lawyers had been notified. "We have not been told this and we will not prejudge what he has to say. If the case is to be shelved, as has been suggested, clearly Kate and Gerry's arguido status must be lifted."The couple have been campaigning for the Portuguese authorities to release to their own private investigators the details of their inquiries.
