A jury was today shown a home video of the ringleader of the July 7 London bombings, Mohammed Siddique Khan, saying goodbye to his baby daughter before leaving to "fight jihad".In the footage, the Edgware Road bomber sits on a bed at his wife's family home, cradling his daughter and softly telling her that what he was doing was "for the sake of Islam".The video was played at the trial of three men accused of helping the four suicide bombers who murdered 52 people on London's transport network.The jury at Kingston crown court was told that the film, shot two days before Khan flew to Pakistan in November 2004, was a "farewell" before Khan left to "fight jihad".However, there was a "change of plan" during the trip and Khan returned to the UK, where he masterminded the bombings on three tube trains and a bus.In a clip shot in October 2004, Khan is seen introducing his daughter to her "uncles" â€“ his fellow bombers Shezhad Tanweer and Hasib Hussain, and one of the defendants, Waheed Ali.Ali, 24, from Tower Hamlets, east London, Mohammed Shakil, 31, and Sadeer Saleem, 27, both from Beeston, Leeds, are accused of conspiring with Khan, Tanweer, Hussain and Jermaine Lindsay and others unknown to cause explosions between November 17 2004 and July 8 2005.All three of the defendants are alleged to have carried out a two-day reconnaissance mission in the capital on December 16 and 17 2004 with bombers Hussain and Lindsay. They deny the charges.During the farewell message to his daughter, recorded on November 16 2004, Khan expresses regret that he will miss out on watching her grow up, but tells her: "I have to do this thing for our future and it will be for the best, inshallah, in the long run."The video was among a variety of items given by Khan's wife, Hasina Patel, to a friend, Faiza Rehman, who handed it to police in the aftermath of the atrocity.The jury was told there was further footage, not played to the court, in which Khan said: "Be strong, learn to fight - fighting is good. Be mummy's best friend. Take care of mummy - you can both do things together like fighting and stuff."
