The largest joint-enterprise murder prosecution in the country has ended with the conviction of the last of a group of 20 teenagers in connection with the killing of a 15-year-old boy at a busy central London railway station.Junior Bayode, now 19, was found guilty at the central criminal court of the manslaughter of Sofyen Belamouadden and of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. The victim, who was studying for GCSEs, was hunted down and set upon with knives and metal bars in front of hundreds of commuters at Victoria station in a murder captured on CCTV.Bayode was a 16-year-old student when he joined a 20-strong charge against Sofyen on 25 March 2010.The group pursued Sofyen into the station, down the escalator and into the ticket hall, where a smaller group hacked, kicked and battered him to death in front of scores of commuters.Bayode, who was convicted on Wednesday after a jury deliberated for 17 hours, had denied his role in the killing, claiming that he had tried to prevent his friends getting out of control.Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC described in court the extraordinary onslaught that took place in full public gaze."So brazen and confident were his killers … they openly carried the various weapons they used," he said. "Such was their arrogance that they carried out that kind of attack in the heart of the capital city and a public place, the terminus of the station at the height of rush hour and in the sight of scores, if not hundreds of people passing by, going to their own homes."That confidence and arrogance came too from knowing that between them they were so heavily armed that no other individual or smaller group or even a police officer or member of station staff could stop them."The verdict brings to an end – with mixed results – the biggest joint-enterprise murder prosecution ever brought to court in England and Wales.All 20 teenagers arrested in the aftermath of the killing were charged with murder on the basis of joint enterprise including those not present at the moment the victim was killed.The prosecution, which stretched over nearly two years and involved five criminal trials, has resulted in juries convicting fewer than half of the 20 originally charged with murder over the killing of Sofyen.Juries rejected the crown case that all the teenagers were equally culpable because they planned the killing on social media the night before, arrived at Victoria station together, and chased their victim as a group – some of whom were armed – before a smaller handful of them surrounded him and killed Sofyen in the ticket hall. The trial judge also intervened at one case to clear five defendants of murder because they were not in the group around Sofyen when he was killed.In the end three teenagers were convicted of murder, five, including Bayode, of manslaughter, two of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm, and seven of violent disorder. Three teenagers were acquitted of all charges.All but two of the teenagers responsible for the killing attended St Charles Catholic sixth form in west London, where they were studying for their A-levels.They planned the attack on social media the night before, the court was told, sending messages to each other on Facebook and via BlackBerry Messenger.The messages – which were retrieved by the police – revealed they were trying to source weapons including a samurai sword, flick knives, batons, metal bars and a set of kitchen knives, which were bought for £3.99 from the catalogue shop Argos by one of the accused in the school lunchbreak on the day of the murder, the court has told.On Wednesday, the jury could not decide on a murder verdict against Bayode after 17 hours of deliberation and he may now face a retrial on that charge.
