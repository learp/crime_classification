A Royal Navy reservist who was in charge of a racing yacht that collided with an oil tanker during Cowes Week has been found guilty of three counts of contravening maritime regulations.Roland Wilson, a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve, was convicted of failing to keep a proper lookout and two counts of impeding the passage of a vessel following a five-day trial at Southampton magistrates court.The court heard that the 32-year-old was in charge of the 19.8-metre (33ft) yacht Atalanta of Chester, which collided with the 265-metre (869ft) Hanne Knutsen on the first day of the sailing regatta in August 2011.Footage of the incident, in which one crew member suffered minor head injuries and another abandoned ship, was posted on YouTube and has been viewed more than 900,000 times.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest During the trial, Charles Row, prosecuting, claimed that Wilson, who owned and skippered the yacht, sailed his boat, which had seven other crew members on board, "perilously" into the path of the Hanne Knutsen.Row said Wilson failed to comply with local shipping bylaws that required him to maintain a moving prohibited zone of 1,000 metres in front and 100 metres either side of a vessel greater than 150 metres long.Wilson told the court that the tanker sounded its horn to indicate it was to turn to starboard but then did not carry out the manoeuvre, leaving him in a dangerous position in front of the vessel. The trial heard that a motor vessel, the Joy C, had lost power and caused the Hanne Knutsen to change its intended course.Wilson, a physics graduate from Stanley, Perthshire, told the court he joined the Royal Navy in 2006 and left in February this year but remained a reservist. At the time of the collision he was racing at Cowes for the fifth time, and he had a flat in the town that overlooked the Solent.The district judge Anthony Callaway said he respected Wilson and his crew, which included highly ranked former Royal Navy officers, but ruled that the skipper had made the wrong decision and placed his yacht and the tanker in danger.He said: "I accept that it may have been difficult sailing and difficult manoeuvring, but with the quality of the crew and a sound and undamaged yacht, I have no doubt their abilities were sufficient to sail that yacht, Atalanta of Chester, out of danger and avoid risk to others, in particular the Hanne Knutsen."The fact that they did not do so was not the product of lack of skills but the wrong decision at the wrong time of which the skipper must take responsibility. The skipper has the ultimate say and carries responsibility accordingly and that is the position for time immemorial."He added: "Fortuitously there was no loss of life. This was a serious incident in itself; the potential for an even greater consequence was apparent."The judge said the accident was not a reason to criticise the Cowes Week event, and said any calls to cancel or change it were unjustified. He said: "This collision must be seen in its proper context – this was an isolated incident born of its own circumstances."Wilson was fined £2,000 for the offence of failing to keep a proper lookout and £500 for each of the two offences of impeding the passage of a vessel, and ordered to pay a £15 surcharge. The maximum penalty was £5,000 on each charge. He was ordered to pay the full costs of the prosecution, which totalled £100,056.68.
