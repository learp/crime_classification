Two men are being questioned by police in the West Midlands over claims that female genital mutilation is being offered in the UK.The men, a 55-year-old and a 61-year-old, were arrested on Friday by officers from the force's public protection unit. An inquiry was launched following an investigation by the Sunday Times, which suggested that as many as 100,000 women may have undergone female genital mutilation in the UK.Police across the country are aware that young women from the African diaspora are sent to their home countries – often in school holidays – to be "cut", as it is known.But evidence that practitioners in the UK are carrying out the procedure has been harder to come by.The practice involves the surgical mutilation of female genitals and in some cases the stitching of the vaginal opening. It is illegal in the UK and carries a 14-year prison term. It is also illegal for someone to arrange female genital mutilation.Detective Inspector Caroline Marsh from West Midlands police said: "We are still in the very early stages of this investigation but I hope this morning's action sends out a clear message about how seriously we are taking these allegations."The men were arrested after officers went to three addresses; Stratford Road, Sparkhill, Birmingham, Trafalgar Road, Moseley and Kingstanding Road, Kingstanding, at around 9am.Marsh said: "We are actively working together with our partner agencies to investigate reports of female genital mutilation (FGM) and raise awareness of the practice among both professionals and communities, in order to identify and safeguard potential victims."I want to reassure people that we thoroughly investigate all allegations of FGM and I would encourage anyone who may have any information about this illegal practice to contact police."
