Two high court judges were deciding tonight whether a police officer can drive lawfully "at eye watering speeds" while familiarising himself with a new vehicle and "honing his driving skills".There was widespread condemnation last year after PC Mark Milton, 38, from Telford, Shropshire, was acquitted of speeding and dangerous driving when he drove at up to 159mph on a motorway. Today, Edmund Lawson QC told Lady Justice Hallett and Mr Justice Owen that there were no blue lights flashing or sirens sounding when PC Milton, an advanced driver and an armed response officer with the West Mercia constabulary, drove at excess speed in the early hours of December 5 2003. The police car's on-board video camera recorded that during a two-and-a-half-hour period he drove at 150mph or more on the M54, which has a speed limit of 70mph. He reached 131mph on the A5, which has a 60mph speed limit, and drove at up to 91mph in urban 30mph areas.Mr Lawson said district judge Bruce Morgan was wrong to acquit the officer at Ludlow magistrates court last May after describing him as the "creme de la creme" of police drivers.Appearing for the director of public prosecutions, Mr Lawson asked the high court judges to direct that PC Milton be convicted of both offences, or at least order a new hearing of the case. "This case raises issues of real public interest concerning whether a police officer can, with impunity, drive a police car at 'eye watering' speeds in excess of twice the relevant speed limits when not responding to an emergency or otherwise engaged in the prevention or detection of crime," Mr Lawson told the court.Arguing that he could not, Mr Lawson described PC Milton's driving as "not good for the public health". He said Judge Morgan described the speeds as "eye watering", but was wrongly sympathetic to PC Milton's defence that he was honing his driving skills and familiarising himself with his vehicle.The judge was also "evidently influenced" by evidence from an inspector and a sergeant, neither of whom described PC Milton's driving as dangerous. The judge concluded that, having regard to PC Milton's advanced driving skills, knowledge of the locality and the fact that the driving occurred on relatively deserted roads in good conditions, "dangerous driving was not established".Mr Lawson argued the judge had erred in law. To drive at twice the speed limit objectively fell "far below acceptable standards", he said.The fact that PC Milton had been honing his driving skills was "an irrelevant consideration", and he should have been convicted of dangerous driving, or at least of speeding offences. Mr Lawson said: "If, as apparently occurred here, policemen in West Mercia or elsewhere are instructed or encouraged by their superiors to hone or practise skills by such manner of driving, that practice should be disapproved of and should stop."John McGuinness QC, appearing for PC Milton, said the district judge had been entitled to take account of the officer's advanced driving skills, and to conclude that his driving "as a matter of fact" was not dangerous at the time in question. The prosecution had failed to prove the manner of his driving "fell far below that expected of a careful and competent driver". Judge Morgan had made no error of law and his decision to acquit was not perverse, he said. "Excessive speed alone is not a basis to convict for dangerous driving," Mr McGuinness argued.In reply, Mr Lawson said that, if courts were allowed to take into account the individual characteristics of the accused driver, the "floodgates" would be opened to defence arguments on that basis."It has never been a defence to what would otherwise be dangerous driving to say that you are Stirling Moss or some more recent racing driver," he said.The judgment will be given tomorrow.
