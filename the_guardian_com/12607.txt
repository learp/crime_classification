David Blunkett last night announced a £90m anti-terror expansion in police special branch and 1,300 more prison places.Mr Blunkett also hit back at liberal left critics, arguing that the country would never forgive Labour had he not taken the tough action on terrorism that was necessary."I'd rather be a tough home secretary in a compassionate Labour government than a compassionate opponent of a rightwing Michael Howard-led Tory government," he said. But he also revealed plans to make available a pioneering "weekend jail" sentence to courts across the country within 18 months, to recruit 1,800 new probation officers, and to start this week a pilot compulsory fostering scheme as an alternative to locking up the most unruly children. As Mr Blunkett addressed the Labour conference the Home Office published new figures showing that police numbers in England and Wales had topped a record 140,000 officers in March this year.He supplemented this by announcing he had won the chancellor's agreement to spend £50m to start the recruitment now rather than next April of the first 2,000 extra community support officers. A pledge to publish a draft bill to make corporate manslaughter a criminal offence received the biggest applause. But Mr Blunkett reserved pride of place for a further increase in the counter-terrorism budget, which will mean the regional network of police special branch officers will expand to service the rapid growth in MI5, which is doubling its strength. The Home Office refuses to publish the total counter-terrorism budget or the numbers of staff involved, but it claims that spending in this area has increased by £330m, or 50%, since September 11 2001 and is on track to have doubled by the end of 2008.The money will also be spent on the shadowy world of improving "resilience" to ensure that national utilities such as power stations are protected against terrorist attack. The expansion of the prison and probation budgets will finance the creation of 1,300 prison places. The government hopes to 'cap' the rise in the prison population at 80,000 and the extra 1,300 places are on top of 2,400 already being built. The extra places are to be created by refurbishing out-of-use wings rather than building jails.
