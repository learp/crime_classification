The government has been accused of undermining its crime mapping initiative after the Metropolitan police proposed almost halving the number of sergeants dedicated to neighbourhood policing from 630 to 330 to save money.Supporters of crime mapping say that, once people have information about offences in their area, they can raise concerns with neighbourhood officers.But Joanne McCartney, Labour's policing spokesperson on the London Assembly, said: "A crime map is all well and good â€“ but if there aren't police in your area when you need them most, it's difficult to see how they will make people feel safer."The reality of the cuts agenda is there will be fewer police on the streets."After the launch of the crime maps, the big question is what the public are expected to do with the details provided.One senior police officer said: "It's unclear what they are expecting people to do with this information. I'm at a loss."The officer said the information had previously been available on a ward-by-ward basis and that, in his experience, people were already aware of the levels of crime in their own neighbourhoods.Assistant chief constable Steven Mortimore, of the National Policing Improvement Agency, which is running the site, said crime mapping was part of the government's "big society" aspiration. "If local people know what's going on, they will act to take basic steps such as through neighbourhood watch groups," he said.It would improve police accountability, he said, adding: "Members of the public have the opportunity to raise issues with their neighbourhood teams. They may call a PCSO or a beat manager and ask: 'What are you doing about it?'"
