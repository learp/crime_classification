The chief inspector of prisons has accused the Prison Service of ignoring warnings of possible suicides by women inmates held in "isolated and alienating" conditions within a men's jail.The Prison Service announced the closure of the women's wing at Durham after a critical report last year. About 100 prisoners were transferred to other jails. But six remained and were moved to a former special male unit. The unit's environment and regime come in for fierce criticism in a report today of an inspection in June.The prisoners are described as "forgotten women, marooned in a corner of a man's jail".The report by Anne Owers speaks of "confusion caused by complicated senior management responsibilities" and claims the women were "out of the line of sight of the overall management of the jail".Last month Louise Giles, 20, was found hanging in her cell and died in hospital. The Guardian has learned she had a long history of self-harm and had been due to be transferred to Rampton special hospital.Juliet Lyons, director of the Prison Reform Trust, says she saw the appalling conditions herself. She described seeing a woman prisoner covered in cuts. The floor was littered with bloodstained clothing. The governor said the woman had been waiting for a transfer to a secure hospital.Phil Wheatley, director general of the Prison Service, said he did not accept there had been a lack of management attention. "The women who remain in Durham present a real ongoing risk," he said. They would be transferred shortly when accommodation had been upgraded.
