The conviction rate for sex offences has fallen sharply in England and Wales despite drives by the police and prosecutors to put more rape and other sexual assault cases before the courts.Ministry of justice figures show the conviction rate for sex offences fell from 61% in 2012 to 55% last year.The number of convictions fell by only 69, or 1%, from 5,728 to 5,659. However, that led to a six point drop in the conviction rate because an extra 998 cases, or 10,365 in total, were brought to court for trial in 2013.The justice ministry figures show the number of convictions rose for the largest single kind of sexual offence – sexual assaults on women and girls and sexual activity involving children under 13 – but the numbers went down in the categories of rape of a woman or a girl over 13.The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said it was alarming that convictions for sex offences were falling while the number of recorded offences was rising sharply: "Labour has warned David Cameron and Theresa May for some time that there is a growing justice gap and more serious criminals are getting away with their crimes without facing prosecution or the courts – let alone conviction."Overall, convictions have fallen for sexual offences, domestic violence cases and child abuse cases since 2010."A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman said the effective prosecution of rape continued to be a key priority and it had been working with the Association of Chief Police Officers for many months to investigate the reasons behind the drop in the number of rape cases referred by the police to the CPS.A joint police/crown prosecution action plan is to be published shortly to improve the way sexual offence cases are handled.Justice ministry officials said the fall in the conviction rate to 55% was the result of the 1% drop in convictions coinciding with an 11% increase in the number of prosecutions and in cases waiting to go to court."This increase could be because of the nature of these type of cases, meaning that more time is often spent building a case for a prosecution or defence, than with cases involving other offence groups," said a spokesman.Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said conviction rates could fall for a number of reasons, including more cases being brought to court."It is right to bring serious cases to trial even if the chance of conviction may be low. The key is to ensure tough sentencing for those offenders who are found guilty in order to protect the public."
