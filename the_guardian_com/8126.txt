A sex attacker who made legal history by admitting trying to rape an unknown woman was committed to a mental health unit yesterday.Farhan Osman's victim has never been traced but his attack on the woman in a deserted subway was recorded on CCTV footage. The assault was spotted by security guards monitoring the cameras but before they and police could arrive a passing man came across the incident and Osman, 27, fled, Inner London crown court was told.A video of the attack in the early hours of March 28 this year was played to the court and during the footage the defendant was seen to knock the woman to the ground and throw her hat away. He then tried to pull her clothes off.Stephen Holt, prosecuting, told the court Osman subjected the woman, believed to be in her 20s, to "fairly ferocious punches and kicks"."The defendant managed to get her trousers off and his. But for the arrival of a man on the scene, the attack would have continued until the security guard got on the scene."By the time police arrived at Elephant and Castle in south London, both the victim and her unwitting rescuer - whose identity is also unknown - had disappeared.A security guard spotted Osman and pointed him out to officers. He was arrested by police but during his interview started to give strange answers and claimed a detective and not himself had carried out the attack, the court was told.At an earlier hearing, Osman, from Borough, south London, pleaded guilty to attempting to rape an unknown person. The defendant is believed to suffer from a form of schizophrenia.Judge Jonathan van der Werff told Osman he had committed a "very, very serious crime" and if it was not for his mental illness he would have received a long prison sentence.
