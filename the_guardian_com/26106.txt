This week the whistleblower who revealed how undercover police officers infiltrated the campaign to bring the killers of Stephen Lawrence to justice gave evidence to an official inquiry.Peter Francis, a former undercover officer, gave his testimony to Mark Ellison, the barrister who has been asked by the home secretary Theresa May to examine a number of issues around the Lawrence murder.Ellison, the QC who successfully prosecuted Gary Dobson and David Norris for the murder in 2012, is examining the allegations of corruption around the hideously botched police investigation as well as the undercover infiltration of the campaign. Details of both aspects of his inquiry's remit can be found here and here.On Wednesday, Francis was questioned by Ellison for three hours over his claims. He was accompanied by Louis Charalambous, a lawyer from the London law firm Simons Muirhead & Burton who has been advising the whistleblower.Afterwards, Francis said :"I really hope that it will be a proper and thorough investigation of what I have been saying." For background on Francis's claims, published by Channel 4's Dispatches and the Guardian last June, see this, this and this.Francis agreed to give evidence to Ellison after the barrister obtained from the attorney-general Dominic Grieve a form of immunity that would protect the whistleblower from prosecution under the official secrets act.A parallel inquiry into the conduct of the undercover officers since 1968 is being conducted by a team of police officers led by Derbyshire Chief Constable Mick Creedon.It too is examining the undercover infiltration of the Lawrence campaign as part of the raft of allegations against the undercover officers, stretching from the use of sexual relationships to gain intelligence to the use of fake identities in court.However this internal police inquiry, known as Operation Herne, has not secured any immunity from prosecution for Francis so he is not giving evidence to it. Francis has asked Ellison not to pass on any of his evidence this week to Operation Herne.Meanwhile, in a related development, it was disclosed earlier this week that Creedon is trying to force Channel 4 to hand over all its correspondence with Francis, along with notes and unseen video footage. Creedon said he needs the material as he is investigating whether a breach of the official secrets act and other offences has occurred.Francis (see here) said the "threat of prosecution is designed not only to keep me quiet but also all the other hundred or so former undercover officers from ever speaking out".Among those criticising police over their legal demand was Doreen Lawrence, Stephen's mother, and her lawyer, Imran Khan, who said they were "astonished that the police are employing such strongarm, threatening tactics against someone who has exposed, on the face of it, serious misconduct in a public institution." Their comments - worth reading in full - can be found here.Creedon has responded by offering a partial apology "to anyone who saw a genuinely well-meant approach to gain further information in a negative way." His comments can be read here.On Tuesday afternoon, we asked Creedon if he still intends to pursue his legal action to get Channel 4 to surrender the material. At the time of writing, he has yet to answer.Over the past four years, Francis has been disclosing details of the work of his former unit, the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), that go wider than the infiltration of the Lawrence campaign.On the Dispatches programme, he met two women who had long-term relationships with men they later discovered were undercover police officers.It was the first time that anyone from the SDS, police or officialdom has given the two women, Helen Steel and Belinda Harvey, any sort of explanation of why they were duped by their one-time partners, John Dines and Bob Lambert respectively (for more on their stories, see this, this, and this).On Wednesday, the group of eight women who were conned into having relationships with the undercover spies issued a statement supporting Francis over the police's attempt to get Channel 4 to surrender the material.They said :"It is a scandal that rather than taking action to prevent future police abuse of campaigners, the police are instead seeking to cover up the actions of the unit. Their demands for documents and other material from Channel 4 are in stark contrast to the police refusal to disclose any documents at all in the case brought by the eight women.""The police threat to use the Official Secrets Act and failure to offer protection to whistleblowers raises serious concerns that the police are seeking to undermine this case and prevent the whole truth from emerging."They hoped that neither Francis nor other police officers "will be deterred from coming forward as witnesses against illegal and immoral abuses perpetrated by the police."Their show of support can be found here. Francis has offered to help the women in their legal claim against the police and has already provided a witness statement.
