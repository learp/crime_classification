Police today urged companies and organisations throughout the country to be alert to possible letter bombs after revealing that seven had been sent in the past three weeks, injuring six people.The warning came after a letter bomb exploded at the DVLA centre in Swansea this morning, slightly injuring a woman.It was the third such incident at organisations linked to motoring enforcement in as many days.Today's statement, from the office of Assistant Chief Constable Anton Setchell, the national coordinator for domestic extremism, said all organisations, as well as members of the public, should be on their guard."The packages received so far have caused minor injuries but could have been more serious," Mr Setchell said."I am appealing today for companies, organisations and individuals to take extra care when handling mail. If they have any suspicions about any letter or package, they should leave it unopened and call the police immediately."Mr Setchell said the bombs were of a "small, pyrotechnic nature", designed to shock rather than kill."These devices do not contain conventional explosives," he said. "Although we are still awaiting results of forensic analysis, the indications are that these devices are of a small pyrotechnic nature, the intention clearly being to cause shock and relatively minor injuries."Today's blast reinforced growing fears that a disgruntled driver, or someone else with a grudge against motoring enforcement bodies, had launched a concerted letter bombing campaign.The DVLA said the injured woman had suffered minor injuries and was being treated in hospital.Three other workers who were nearby when the bomb exploded were also taken to hospital "as a precaution", it added.The attack followed a blast at the offices of the accountancy and finance company Vantis, in Wokingham, Berkshire, yesterday. Two people were slightly injured.Speed Check Services, which provides the technology for speed cameras, is a Vantis client. A spokesman for Vantis said the accountancy company had nothing to do with the collection or imposition of motoring fines.On Monday, a bomb stuffed into a padded envelope exploded in the hands of a post room worker at the central London offices of Capita, the firm that collects the capital's congestion charge.The woman, who sustained blast wounds to her hands and stomach, is recovering in hospital.A spokesman for Thames Valley police, which is leading the investigation into the incidents, said today that officers had definitely linked the first two letter bombs but had not yet made a definite connection with the DVLA blast.Also today, police in Kent said they were investigating a letter bomb that exploded at the home of a 53-year-old man in Folkestone on Saturday. He suffered minor injuries.According to some reports, the man was the manager of a company providing security services to companies. He had collected the package from his business address before opening it at home.A police spokesman said officers were investigating any possible links to the other blasts, but added that it was "too early" to say.Three other letter bombs were also sent to companies in Oxfordshire and the West Midlands last month, according to police. In each case, the organisations received an A5 padded bag containing a crude firework-type device.Each had a similar return address. Barry Horne, an animal rights extremist who died in 2001 while serving an 18-year jail sentence for a firebombing campaign, was named on the back of one envelope.The home secretary, John Reid, said the letter bombs were "a cause for concern". "The police are on top of this," he told reporters outside the Home Office today. "They are keeping me informed here."Tony Blair, asked about the explosions at prime minister's questions, expressed his sympathies to victims and said the attacks were being investigated "very closely".This morning, police were called to an office in Pimlico, central London - close to the Capita building - following reports of a suspicious package.A police spokeswoman said the alert was now over. "Police have now been stood down," she said. "Obviously, with what has happened over the past few days, people are being more cautious than normal."
