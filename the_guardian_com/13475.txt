Police hunting the killers of teenager Stephen Lawrence today said they had released from bail two men arrested in connection with the racist murder.The pair, who were not charged with any offence, had been due to answer to police bail today. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: "We have released them from the terms of their bail. But we reserve the right, as is routine with any suspect, to re-interview them in the future should the need arise." The men, who were held on March 21, would have been informed of the decision through the normal channels, either by letter or through their solicitors, she said. The men - one was arrested in Scotland and the other in London - were questioned by detectives in March and bailed to return to a south London police station. A third man arrested in London on March 22 is still on bail to return to police on May 9. The three men are not believed to have been among the five original suspects in the case. Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old A-level student, was stabbed in an unprovoked attack by a gang of white youths at a bus stop in Eltham, south east London, in April, 1993.
