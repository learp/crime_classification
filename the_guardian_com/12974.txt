Two more suspected criminals have been mistakenly released while appearing at a Scottish court, it emerged yesterday, as police continued the hunt for a convicted killer who was allowed to walk away from a court on Thursday.The Scottish executive, already embarrassed by the crisis in the Scottish Prison Service, said in the latest case an administrative error rather than a security lapse was probably to blame for the release of two men at Glasgow district court on Monday. Both had been arrested for public order offences and were due to be transferred to face separate charges at the city's sheriff court the same day. They were released instead. Officials are due to hold a meeting today with representatives from the private security firm Reliance Custodial Services, which began escorting prisoners to and from some Scottish courts last week under an Â£11m contract. Reliance has been ordered by the SPS to review its procedures for identifying prisoners after the escape of killer James McCormick, 17 and housebreaker, Colin Watson, 32, on Thursday. McCormick, who stabbed Thomas Loughrey, 17, to death in Glasgow in July, was allowed to walk free from Hamilton sheriff court on Thursday after apparently switching papers with another prisoner. Watson, nearing the end of a two-year term for housebreaking, was set free at Glasgow sheriff court on the same day. He later handed himself into police, but McCormick is still on the run. Police have warned the public not to approach him and he has been described as potentially dangerous. A former girlfriend of McCormick's told the Daily Record newspaper that she had spent some time with him on the day of his escape and said he was enjoying a "wee holiday". The Scottish executive said the men released from Glasgow district court were not prisoners and would return to court at a later date.
