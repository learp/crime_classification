A police chief yesterday apologised personally to the wife and stepdaughter of a millionaire businessman who were put on trial for murder after he was shot dead.Ken Jones, the chief constable of Sussex police, admitted the investigation into the 1996 murder of Richard Watson was "crucially flawed".Mr Watson's wife Linda and her daughter, Amanda London-Williams, were held on remand in Holloway prison, north London, after being charged with the killing that is still unsolved.But the case was dropped on the eve of trial with the prosecution offering no evidence after ballistic evidence it hoped to rely on showing the fatal shots came from the family home was discredited.Mr Watson, 54, owned a computer firm and was killed with a shotgun as he got out from his car at the family home in East Grinstead, West Sussex. Mr Jones said detectives in the first investigation had had closed minds about who was responsible for the murder: "It was apparent that the police investigators' minds were not open to other possibilities which did not involve Linda and Amanda."Grave and lasting injustice to Linda and Amanda followed and their reputations were damaged. The force did not do enough to put right the wrong that was done to them."Richard's murder has been reinvestigated thoroughly and the case is not closed. I remain determined to get justice for Richard. We have a suspect and good intelligence."
