A Frenchman was jailed for life today after being found guilty of a frenzied knife attack on a schoolgirl as she walked through a Lancashire park earlier this year.Jessica Knight, then 14, was listening to her iPod when Kristofer Beddar, 21, launched the unprovoked assault, stabbing her 20 times in the chest, neck, stomach and back.She was left for dead in the deserted, dark park in Astley village, Chorley, but was discovered by passers-by and underwent five hours of emergency surgery as doctors battled to save her life.Jessica, now 15, had been left with "long-term physical and psychological problems", the court heard.Beddar, described as a loner with a fiery temper who habitually carried a knife, had drunk half a bottle of whisky. He tried to dispose of his blood-stained clothing.He later confessed to his mother, Marion: "Mum, I think it must have been me", and she turned him in to police.Beddar, of Adlington, Chorley, was living with members of his English family at the time of the attack.He admitted wounding with intent on January 21 this year, but claimed he had no memory of attacking Jessica and had no motive to kill her.Today, he was convicted by the jury of attempted murder after a six-day trial at Preston crown court.Judge Anthony Russell QC, recorder of Preston, sentenced Beddar to life with a minimum period of 12 years.The judge said that he attacked Jessica "for no reason that can be ascertained" and left her for dead."This was a frenzied attack with a knife that you habitually carried," the judge said."You have not only ruined her life you have ruined that of her loving family's and even succeeded in the process in ruining the life of your own family and your poor mother who had to give evidence at this trial."He added: "Your intention was to kill her, no one knows why. There is no evidence of any mental illness which could explain it. Anyone who can do what you did must be regarded as a danger to the public."The judge praised Gareth Crook, who was cycling through the park and found Jessica bleeding and injured, and whose intervention probably saved her life, the court heard.The judge said Jessica's life had been ruined; she had suffered a stroke and had permanent disabilities as a result of Beddar's actions.
