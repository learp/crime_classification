A 20-year-old man and three teenagers, all living locally, were remanded in custody today to appear at a crown court charged with the murder of a shopkeeper in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.Muawaz Khalid and the 17-year-olds, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared for a brief hearing in a packed courtroom at Huddersfield magistrates court.They spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth, watched by relatives and friends of Gurmail Singh, 63, who was hit at least nine times with a weapon, thought to have been a hammer, in the attack on 20 February in his shop in Cowcliffe where he was a well-known figure, with a name for kindness and hard work.The four were also charged with robbing the shop during the attack. The case was referred by the district judge Paul McNulty to Bradford crown court on Monday.There was no application for bail from the accused, whose families also attended the hearing.Earlier this week a 17-year-old A-level student was remanded in custody at Huddersfield magistrates court charged with stealing cigarettes from Singh's store two days before the alleged murder. Singh, whose birthday was the day before the attack, came to the UK in 1963. He leaves his wife, two grown-up sons and a daughter.Scores of bouquets and written tributes have been laid outside the family's home, not far from the store. Tributes were paid to Singh by hundreds of people at a multi-faith service on Sunday.Mehboob Khan, a local councillor and leader of Kirklees council, who knew Singh for 19 years, described him as "the kind of guy who wouldn't hurt a fly". He said: "He was down-to-earth, always cheerful, a really intelligent, friendly person. He was no spring chicken but he worked extremely hard."
