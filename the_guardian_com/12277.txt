Two brothers who conned thousands of customers into visiting a Lapland theme park by falsely promising a "winter wonderland" have been jailed for 13 months each.Victor and Henry Mears billed their attraction near Bournemouth as a delightful, snowy Christmas kingdom featuring picturesque log cabins, a bustling market, reindeer and even polar bears.Instead of a magical, festive treat, visitors who came from far and wide to Lapland New Forest found mud, wooden buildings with the "lightest possible dusting" of fake snow and a broken ice rink.Judge Mark Horton, at Bristol crown court, compared the attraction to a car boot sale and told the brothers: "You promised customers in your advertising an amazing snow-covered Lapland village which was – in your own wonderful words – 'Where dreams really do come true' and 'Where we have prided ourselves on attention to detail'.You told consumers that it would light up those who most loved Christmas. You said you would go through the magical tunnel of light, coming out in a winter wonderland."What you actually provided was something that looked like an averagely managed summer car boot sale."The failure of Lapland New Forest was caused by the unrelenting greed shown by you and your desire to squeeze every drop of profit rather than build and create the winter wonderland you promised thousands of consumers."Within days of Lapland New Forest opening in November 2008, hundreds of visitors complained to trading standards officials that they had been ripped off. Less than a week later, the attraction closed, with the brothers blaming the media and sabotage by "New Forest villains" for the decision.Dorset trading standards prosecuted Victor, 67, and Henry, 60, from Brighton, under consumer protection laws and they were found guilty of eight charges of misleading advertising. Visitors were charged £30 a ticket and with up to 10,000 advance bookings online, the Mears brothers were set to gross £1.2m overall.During the trial, Victor Mears, who has previous convictions for obtaining a money transfer by deception, VAT evasion and conspiracy to defraud, admitted he took a "bit of a gamble" in setting up Lapland New Forest without investing any money. He told the court: "I showed due diligence. I did everything I could to account for everything."Henry Mears told jurors the attraction was everything they promised customers it would be. "Whatever you do, you will find the public complain about something," he added.Judge Horton said Victor Mears had the original idea for Lapland New Forest and took all the major financial decisions but worked closely with his brother.He said: "I have had the opportunity to observe you both during the trial.I was unable to discern any remorse in your actions. You still seek to blame others for that which you failed to achieve."The court heard that since the brothers' convictions their families had been targeted by local people."Society was revolted by the fact that you had told lies and caused so much anguish to parents and children alike and it touched something on society," the judge said."I have no doubt that your families have suffered a great deal of pain and torment as society made plain the way it felt about this type of crime."Both men were disqualified from being company directors for five years.
