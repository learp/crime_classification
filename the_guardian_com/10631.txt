A 15-year-old boy was battered with a claw hammer by a gang in a scene similar to that of a Quentin Tarantino film, a court was told today.Henry Webster, now 16, sustained "life-threatening" injuries during the attack last January. He was punched, kicked and hit repeatedly on the head with the DIY tool on a tennis court at Ridgeway school in the village of Wroughton in Wiltshire.He suffered three skull fractures, one of which caused brain injury and needed surgery. Paramedics called his injuries life-threatening, the court heard.Four teenagers, Wasif Khan, 18, Amjad Qazi, 19, and two boys aged 15 and 16, who cannot be named, are charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm.The court was told how Webster's head had been struck with such force that an impression of the hammer was left on his skull. He is still suffering from injuries sustained in the attack.Opening his case at Bristol crown court today, the prosecutor, James Patrick, said: "For those there, it made a sickening sight, the sort of thing which you would expect to see in a Quentin Tarantino film - certainly not at a school in a village in Wiltshire."The victim is Henry Webster. He stood out. He is 16 and is distinctive. He was 6ft 2in and a rugby player, with bright red hair."The attack sparked protests at the school last year by parents who believed the attack was racially motivated. They said a gang called the "Asian Invasion" was behind a campaign of bullying at the school, and demanded security guards to protect pupils.The 1,450-pupil Ridgeway school has a reputation as one of the top-performing state schools in Wiltshire.Patrick said a fight had been arranged after Henry "barged" into a group of Asian boys in a school corridor. "There was trouble earlier in the day and a fight had been arranged in the school."It was to be a fair fight. A one-on-one, or so Henry thought ... As he came into the playground he was attacked by a group. He was knocked to the ground, he was kicked, punched and repeatedly hit over the head with a hammer."Webster remained conscious throughout the attack.Patrick told how a large group of Asian males, from Swindon, travelled to Wroughton for the fight, which had been co-ordinated through a sequence of phone calls and text messages.A message recorded from a phone call between a witness and one of the suspects said: "There's a big fat ginger kid who wants a fight at the school." Another text message said: "Come to the car park at 3.30."After the attack, teachers were alerted and ambulances arrived at the scene within minutes. Webster was transferred to a head injuries unit at Frenchay hospital in Bristol for emergency surgery.Webster, dressed in a dark suit, appeared in court to hear an interview he had given to police, recorded shortly after the attack. He said he could "see stars" as the gang smashed the hammer through his skull."I was curled up on the floor but they repeatedly kept hitting me. Then I felt the hammer hit the back of my head. I know it was a hammer because if it was a punch, your vision does not change. As I got hit, my vision turned to stars - it all separated, what I could see, because it was so powerful,"¬ù he said. In the footage, Webster said doctors told him his brain would never fully recover from the injuries. Before his attack, he used to enjoy playing sports.He was a prop forward for his school team, enjoyed playing tennis and was an avid Liverpool Football Club fan.The trial continues.
