Evidence has emerged that could quash the conviction of Barry George, who was given life in 2001 for murdering BBC Crimewatch presenter Jill Dando in west London two years earlier.Lawyers acting for George claim his conviction is unsafe; a fresh appeal had been launched (an appeal in 2002 was quashed). Two new witnesses say that they saw armed police at the scene when George was arrested, in direct contradiction of what officers insisted.The only forensic evidence linking George to the murder was a single particle from gunshot residue. Lawyers believe the presence of armed officers was responsible for this residue. They also say new medical reports suggest the 45-year-old was incapable of the killing because of mental disabilities.
