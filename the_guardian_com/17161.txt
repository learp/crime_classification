Some 150,000 children have a parent in jail, making them more likely to become criminals themselves, a report says.In the foreword to the Prison Reform Trust report, entitled Young Parents: From Custody to Community, which was launched at the House of Commons yesterday, Cherie Booth QC says society needs "to make sure that today's sons and daughters of prisoners don't end up tomorrow's offenders". Home Office research shows that of the 13,000 women sent to prison last year, two-thirds were mothers, averaging two children each. A quarter of the 10,816 males under 21 are fathers. In July, it was thought some 25,000 inmates were held more than 50 miles away from home. The report also shows only 5% of women prisoners' children remain in their own home once their mother has been jailed. Ms Booth said the problem of more young mothers and fathers in custody was a subject close to her heart, both "as a mother" and as someone handing down jail terms. Prisons minister Paul Goggins said the criminal parent/child syndrome could be compared with the education system. "Children whose parents went to university are themselves more likely to go on to higher education," he said.
