A woman who used £1,000 from her divorce settlement to pay for her former husband's murder was jailed for at least 20 years yesterday along with her former lover who helped mastermind the plot.Yvette Luffman and her former boyfriend Wayne Briscoe, both 40, were jailed for life at Birmingham crown court after they recruited a hitman to kill Simon Luffman. Mr Luffman, 39, was shot twice in the back and twice in the head with a sawn-off shotgun on a canal towpath in Bramcote, Nottinghamshire, on October 19 2003.The couple had hired Thomas Convery, 34, a bouncer, to carry out the murder - he had been given the shotgun by Briscoe. Convery was convicted of Mr Luffman's murder and was jailed for life three years ago. He was also told that he would serve a minimum of 20 years in prison before he is eligible for parole. He had denied murder. After the trial he told police that Luffman and Briscoe were behind the hit.He claimed the catalyst for his confession was watching Luffman comfort her former mother-in-law at the end of his murder trial.At Luffman and Briscoe's trial, the court heard how they agreed to pay the bouncer a total of £30,000 to carry out the shooting. They paid him a £1,000 deposit which had been given to Luffman by her former husband as part of her divorce settlement following their marriage breakdown in 2002.Mr Justice Teare told them: "This is a murder that was planned and deliberate. In your case, Yvette Luffman, you murdered a man who had been your husband and who was the father of your son."
