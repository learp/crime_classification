Chilling footage has been released showing a burglar standing over a sleeping pensioner as he raids her home.The footage captures Patrick Reid, 51, looming over Margaret Woodward as she naps in an armchair in front of the television at her home in Long Eaton, Derbyshire.Woodward, 68, was subjected to five burglaries on her home in a year, and said she was left feeling terrified.She told the Daily Mail: "It was very frightening to wake up knowing there was somebody in my house but I was determined not to let him get away."Reid, wearing a blue top with the hood up and a rucksack on his back, was caught on film during the April incident after police installed cameras in Woodward's home to catch the culprit.He is seen tiptoeing around Woodward, at times just inches from her face, and lifting her handbag from the basket of her mobility scooter and rummaging through the contents.In the last burglary, Woodward woke up when Reid set off an alarm and she chased him away with her walking stick.Woodward, who suffers from severe arthritis in both knees, said she wanted to break his kneecaps so he could not escape."I thought I'd be able to get him but he ran into my bedroom, jumped onto the bed and went straight out of the window like a gymnast tackling a hobby horse," she said.She was awarded Â£1,500 for her pluck from the High Sheriff's fund, Derbyshire police said.
