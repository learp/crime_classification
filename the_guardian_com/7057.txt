Joan Dean, who loved the theatre and had been an extra on the television soap Coronation Street, died on February 27 1998, four months before her neighbour and Shipman's last victim, Kathleen Grundy, was found dead at her home in Joel Lane, Gee Cross.Mrs Dean's name is on Greater Manchester police's B list along with 22 other women who may have been murdered by Shipman. Yesterday, Mrs Dean's son, Brian, said her death was unexpected. "She had never been ill for more than two days in 70-odd years. Dr Shipman said a locum had certified her death and that she'd probably died from a stroke. "He said she had gone [to the surgery] as an emergency patient. I thought initially that that was strange because my mother would not have abused Dr Shipman's time, she would have made an appointment. I asked whether she would have a post mortem. He said no. "My mother thought he was a wonderful doctor. The only time I began to have real suspicions were when Kathleen Grundy's body was exhumed." After his mother's death, Mr Dean realised that an Omega watch, two diamond rings and Â£300 were missing from her home. "In the light of the court case, I feel my mother also had a lethal injection," he said. Alice Kitchen, 70, is on the C list of 24 women and four men whose deaths may be attributable to Shipman. Her body was exhumed on November 11 1998, the day Shipman was charged with killing Marie Quinn and Ivy Lomas. Mrs Kitchen died in 1994, apparently from a stroke, after Shipman left her home without calling an ambulance. "He said she was slurring her speech," said her son Joe. "She would not go into hospital, so he left a note on the mantlepiece. When my brother got home a couple of hours later, she was dead. We felt annoyed he had left her but didn't suspect anything else untoward. He always seemed very polite and pleased to see people."
