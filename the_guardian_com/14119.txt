Mr Jones had ended their long-term relationship earlier that month.Monti had told Mr Jones she wanted to discuss their relationship, and offered him sex. When he refused, she grabbed his face and a struggle ensued. Monti was knocked to the floor, from where she pulled down Mr Jones's shorts, yanked off his left testicle and tried to swallow it, Liverpool crown court heard. She then choked and spat it out, but doctors were unable to reattach it to Mr Jones.In a statement read to the court, Mr Jones said: "Amanda attacked me in an unprovoked manner, and the attack has ruined my life."
