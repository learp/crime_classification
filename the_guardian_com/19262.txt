Six graffiti artists were jailed for a total of more than two years yesterday in the biggest crackdown on the growing cult of spray-painting trains in years.Mr Justice Scott said that it was "plainly nonsense" to describe the practice as a victim-less crime. "There are thousands of losers in this," he told Bradford crown court. "It is not just the companies which suffer, but the public, when trains have to be repaired and services are cancelled." Martin Rudland QC said that paint attacks on trains, known as graffiti-bombing, had become a sophisticated operation, with participants using the internet and mobile phone links to co-ordinate raids. The arrest of the six had been a typical example, when police stopped two cars in Skipton, North Yorkshire, on Christmas Day two years ago. Inside were hundreds of cans of spray paint, protective clothing and cameras . Zachary Turner, 30, of Manchester, Ian Rantoul, 30, of Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, Kevin Rowntree, 26, of Newcastle, Dudley Halls, 24, of Manchester, James David, 25, of York, and Adam Heiss, 20, of Manchester, all admitted intent to cause criminal damage to trains. They were sentenced to terms from nine months for Turner to 42 days in a young offenders' institution for Heiss. Twenty-two trains were in sidings at Skipton including five new commuter trains which the group considered "the summit of graffiti painting".
