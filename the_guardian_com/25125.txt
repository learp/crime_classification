Former England footballer Ian Wright said his family are safe as he arrived home from Brazil after his wife and children were burgled at knifepoint.Four men armed with knives stormed into his north-west London home on Wednesday night and held his wife Nancy and two daughters before making off with personal possessions.The 50-year-old pundit, who was in Brazil working for ITV at the World Cup, flew back to the UK following his family's ordeal and spoke to reporters after arriving home. Wright said he was unsure if he would be returning to Brazil.He said: "All I want to say, really, is that my missus, my girls, everyone's safe. The police are trying to get on doing what they are doing."Asked how his wife was feeling, he said: "She's feeling good that I am back."When asked if he would be returning to the World Cup, he shrugged before heading back indoors.Following the raid, the ex-Arsenal striker tweeted: "You won't get away with it."A spokeswoman for Wright said earlier that he was "angry and upset" by the incident, and his wife Nancy was "really shaken up".She said: "Their kids are so young that hopefully they aren't going to read into it too much. They are all physically OK â€“ Nancy and the kids."Ian is just really upset and angry and just wants to come back and be with his family at this time."She added: "We are very grateful to ITV for being so supportive and getting him back so quickly."Wright's 39-year-old wife is thought to have been put in a bedroom while the couple's two daughters were taken to another room.The Sun reported that a blade was held to Mrs Wright's throat during the ordeal, while one of the robbers shouted: "If you don't tell us where the safe is we'll cut off your kids' fingers."A spokeswoman for Ian Wright said: "I do believe they threatened to cut off fingers. I don't know if it was the children's or Nancy's."Wright's neighbours described how two police cars screeched up after the robbery and the road was "teeming" with officers.Neighbour Marianne Collinge said: "I suppose they could be a bit of a target because they do have beautiful cars."But they are very unpretentious people. They are one of us and I'm terribly sorry for them, it's awful."Chris Martin, another neighbour, said: "We were watching the Spain game when the police arrived last night and that's all we know about it."Ian is a neighbour and a decent family man. He's been living here several years and everyone around here respects his privacy."Well-wishers took flowers to Wright's door and posted messages through his letterbox, while police made door-to-door inquiries.Scotland Yard said they were investigating an aggravated burglary at an address in north-west London.Four men, believed to be armed with knives, forced their way inside the house and stole a number of items, including personal property and jewellery, a police spokesman said.The intruders are described as black, aged between 18 and 25, with London accents, wearing dark clothing and hoodies obscuring their faces, he added.No arrests have been made.Detective Chief Inspector Mick Gornall, who is leading the investigation, said: "We are trying to trace these four men, and I'd ask anyone who may know anything to get in touch with my team and help us."Fortunately no one was injured during the burglary, but it is still very frightening to have people force their way into your home and threaten you."Last [Wednesday] night officers went to the address and started carrying out house-to-house inquiries. We are also seizing and reviewing CCTV."An ITV spokesman said: "Ian travelled home immediately to be with his family on hearing the shocking news. Our thoughts and best wishes are with them."
