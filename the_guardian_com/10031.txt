Four firefighters who died in a warehouse blaze were sent into an "obviously dangerous situation" for no good reason after the site had been evacuated, a jury has heard.Members of the four-man team lost their lives not in a valiant effort to rescue anyone but having been ordered into a storage area containing cardboard boxes, labels and old furniture, Stafford crown court was told.Three Warwickshire fire service managers – the station manager Timothy Woodward and the watch managers Paul Simmons and Adrian Ashley – are accused of four counts of manslaughter, which they deny.The firefighters Ashley Stephens, 20, Darren Yates-Badley, 24, John Averis, 27, and Ian Reid, 44, went into the smoke-filled vegetable packing plant in Atherstone-on-Stour on 2 November 2007 wearing breathing apparatus and using the radio callsign Red 1.

Later, a search operation involving more than 100 firefighters was carried out for the men's bodies.After explaining to the jury that command of the incident passed between the fire service managers, Matthews said: "It's the prosecution's case that each of these defendants so badly failed to fulfil their duties to the firefighters under their command that their actions amount to what lawyers call gross negligence."He said the prosecution's case was "that the failings of each of the three defendants were a cause of deaths of those four firefighters".Matthews said it was not a case about "what some people see as the irritating trivialities of health and safety red tape". Rather, he said: "It's about the needless loss of four lives, four individuals, lost as a result of having been sent into a situation where no one was in peril … sent into what was and should have been recognised as a dangerous situation for no good reason."He said the blaze had not been properly assessed by those in command, and it should have been apparent that sending in firefighters with inadequate resources was unnecessarily dangerous.The court heard that Warwickshire fire and rescue was alerted to the blaze at 5.30pm after factory staff had tried unsuccessfully to put it out. "All employees were evacuated from the building and no person was reported missing or unaccounted for," Matthews said.The fire service initially sent two appliances, which arrived at 6pm. From that time until an emergency was declared, firefighters wearing breathing apparatus were sent into the building with orders to find and extinguish the fire.At 7.15pm, Red 1 team called an emergency over the radio and members of another four-man team were given the task of finding and rescuing their colleagues. Reid was found in a storage area in a disoriented and panicked state, and rushed away from his rescuers, the court heard. The team failed to locate the three other firefighters and were forced to retreat as conditions in the warehouse deteriorated.Other rescue teams were sent into the first-floor storage area over the next hour and a half, and a crew located two bodies before the operation was halted due to the instability of the building at 9.15pm.Simmons, 51, Ashley, 45, and Woodward, 50, from Leamington Spa, each deny four charges of manslaughter. All the charges allege that they unlawfully killed the men who died by gross negligence while acting as incident commanders.The indictment alleges that Simmons and Ashley breached their duty of care to those who died, "exposing them to substantial risk to life when no other lives were at risk". Woodward is alleged to have breached his duty of care to the firefighters by failing to end the deployment of colleagues wearing breathing apparatus for the purpose of "offensive" firefighting.Stephens and Yates-Badley were based at Alcester fire station, Reid at the Rugby and Stratford-upon-Avon stations and Averis at Stratford.The trial, which is expected to continue for 10 weeks, continues.
