The daughter of a man who was run over by thieves as he tried to stop them stealing a car stereo worth £70 yesterday made an appeal to catch his killers.Balbir Matharu, 54, was mown down and dragged for more than 40 metres as his body passed under the wheels of a Ford Mondeo last Thursday as he tried to stop the two men from making off.At a press conference yesterday, his tearful daughter Baljinder described how she and her mother, who both worked close by, stood helplessly after finding Mr Matharu dying in the street."I would not wish that on anyone, seeing him lying there and not being able to do anything," she said.Mr Matharu had returned to the family building firm in east London when he saw that two men were trying to steal something from his Mercedes van. He ran across the road to challenge the thieves, who had got into their car. Blocking their escape route, Mr Matharu tried to stop them but the driver accelerated the car and drove over his victim.Ms Matharu, 28, said they were a close-knit family, with her father, mother and brother all living and working together. She said: "My dad was a hard-working, gentle and caring man who lived and died for his family. My mother, brother and I will miss him terribly. We cannot understand why this happened to him or what made someone do this to him."She said her mother Sukhvinder, 51, was in a terrible state: "I don't think it's really dawned on her what's happened."Detective Chief Inspector John Macdonald, who is leading the investigation, said: "Balbir Matharu could have been the father or brother of any of us and he was killed over a £70 radio. The way they drove off without stopping or checking his condition shows they have no value for human life and they have caused an immense amount of grief for a lot of people."He added: "They may well have been involved in petty crime but at the same time they have got an absolute determination that they don't want to be arrested. For such a worthless radio, they ran over someone and killed him."
