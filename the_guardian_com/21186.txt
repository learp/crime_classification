A teenager was stabbed to death last night in a London street, becoming the 21st young person to die from violent crime in the capital this year.Police were called to the scene of the attack in Guildford Road, Lambeth, south London, at 7.05pm. Officers found the victim, in his late teens, with at least one stab wound.He was taken to a south London hospital, but pronounced dead on arrival.The teenager's death came only hours after a man was jailed for life for the fatal stabbing of a 17-year-old student, at a New Year's Eve party in east London last year.Nigerian-born Chester Dauda, 21, stabbed Stephen Boachie in the heart outside a pub in Barking in the early hours of January 1 2007, after a scuffle with the victim. Boachie was the first of 27 London teenagers to be murdered in 2007.Sentencing Dauda at the Old Bailey yesterday, Judge Martin Stephens QC said he must serve at least 14 years and recommended his deportation at the end of the jail term.The victim's father, Kwasi Boachie, said he had hoped his son, who was studying for his A-levels, would have a better life in Britain than their native Ghana. In a statement to the court, Boachie, 51, said: "All that has been dashed by the act of a murderer in this craze of knife-carrying gangs. "How many more lives will have to be sacrificed before people realise that killings never solve any human-related problems?"The court was told that Dauda and Boachie had a fight outside the Thatched House pub, moments before the murder occurred.Dauda, who moved to Britain in 2004, was pulled off by friends, but later fetched a knife from a car. On his return he pushed the teenager onto a car bonnet and stabbed him twice, in the stomach and chest. Meanwhile, a second man has been charged with the murder of Adnan Patel, 20, who was stabbed to death in Leyton, east London, eight days ago.Clint D'Mello, 23, from Stratford in east London, will appear at Waltham Forest magistrates' court today.
