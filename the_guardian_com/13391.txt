A Briton has been extradited from Morocco to face questioning in connection with the 2006 Securitas depot robbery in Kent, the foreign office has said tonight.The announcement came just two days after five men were jailed for their part in the £53m heist, Britain's biggest armed robbery. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is in custody after being handed over to the UK authorities. He was driven to Maidstone, Kent, in a Range Rover with blacked out windows accompanied by four police vehicles and under heavy armed guard.A Kent police spokeswoman said the man had not been charged and refused to confirm reports that he would be appearing in court tomorrow morning.Robbers disguised as police officers kidnapped depot manager Colin Dixon, his wife Lynn and their child at gunpoint in order to get access to the Tonbridge depot in February 2006.Despite the conviction of the five men, police are still hunting other suspects and almost £32m of the heist has yet to be recovered. The suspects still at large include the alleged "Mr Big" of the robbery, who is not believed to be the man currently in police custody. On Tuesday, Lea Rusha, 35, a kickboxer and former roofer, car salesman Stuart Royle, 49, unemployed Jetmir Bucpapa, 26, and garage owner Roger Coutts, 30, were all given indeterminate sentences for public protection, with a minimum of 15 years. But they were told they were likely to serve 30 years.The inside man, Emir Hysenaj, 28, who had not taken part in the actual kidnap and robbery, was given a determinate sentence of 20 years and told that he would be eligible for parole after 10.
