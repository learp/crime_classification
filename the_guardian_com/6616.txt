A rise in metal theft from churches has led to insurance claims worth more than £3.5m, with most covering the cost of damage to buildings from rain water pouring through roofs stripped of lead.Thieves have also stolen copper lightning conductors as well as bells and statues. The latest theft took place last month in Kent, where thieves climbed to the top of the Lady Chapel at St Peter's Church, Whitstable, to steal the 70-year-old Sachring bell.Increasing metal prices have sparked the crimewave, and it is thought the stolen material is shipped to countries such as China, Dubai and India where metal stocks are struggling to meet the demand of the booming economies.Ecclesiastical Insurance, which disclosed the information and covers the majority of Church of England buildings, said more than 1,000 claims related to metal thefts from churches had been received so far this year. More than 300 of these were lodged in August.A spokesman said: "We saw a similar spike in claims in the 1970s when metal prices reached a high. Because they are reaching another high at the moment we are seeing a corresponding rise in thefts, so the local parish church is becoming a victim of the worldwide demand for metals."The problem affected inner city churches as much as rural parishes, he added. One church suffered £20,000 worth of damage to its organ after rain poured in when its roof was stripped. In Leeds, the Rev Robin Paterson of St Mary's Church, Middleton, resorted to sleeping in the nave in an attempt to stop further thefts.The Ripon and Leeds diocese is holding a summit next month to discuss how to combat the thefts. The Venerable Peter Burrows, the Archdeacon of Leeds, said: "We want to see whether, in the light of recent events, there is some action we can take to try to put an end to this."
