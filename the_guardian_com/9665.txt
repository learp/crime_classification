A 21-year-old man was being questioned by police last night after a passenger was stabbed to death on a holiday train. The killing was witnessed by dozens of shocked holidaymakers.The victim, believed to be in his twenties, and travelling with a female companion, was on a Virgin Cross Country service from Glasgow to Paignton, Devon. The train was heading south through Cumbria when the man was knifed in the chest, apparently following an argument with another passenger.In a dramatic escape, witnesses saw the attacker smash a window and hang off the side of the train. When it slowed down he jumped to the ground and ran into a field pursued by passengers.A spokesman for the British Transport Police said that they were called to Oxenholme Station in Kendal shortly after midday. The station platform and the train carriage were sealed off by police while they examined the crime scene.A spokesman for Cumbria Police said the suspect left the train in the Oxenholme area, but he was stopped shortly afterwards.The 200 passengers, many of whom were in shock, were held on the train for several hours afterwards. Those who saw the stabbing were moved into a different carriage. 'Our train manager on board moved people out to a position of safety,' a Virgin spokesman said.'The manager is able to lock doors between carriages so he got people away from where the person with the knife was and made sure they were safe.'Josephine Whittaker, who witnessed the escape, said she saw a man kick out one of the train's windows. 'He actually kicked out a window and it came out in one stroke as those windows are meant to do in an emergency.'As a result of the incident, the bank holiday weekend services were disrupted on the West Coast mainline.
