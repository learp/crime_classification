"It doesn't really matter how many people are on the DNA database," a senior police officer in charge of forensics told me at a DNA conference organised by  McKay Law Conferences on Wednesday. "It's getting the right people on it that's important".This particular officer, who preferred not to be named – quite possibly because his views are entirely at odds with more than a decade of government policy of ruthlessly expanding the database as much as possible – appeared positively underwhelmed by the recent European Court of Human Rights decision that stopped plans for further expanding the database dead in their tracks.The ruling – the first to overturn the House of Lords since the Human Rights Act came into force – said the 17 European judges had been "struck by the blanket and indiscriminate nature" of the government's powers to take and keep DNA data from anyone arrested in the UK (except Scotland) – a policy that has so far led to almost a million innocent people's details being entered.The supposed justification is the investigation of crime – although worrying recent remarks have pointed towards some unidentified role for "intelligence gathering". But the government has so far failed to show that keeping the details of innocent people contributes to solving crime scene mysteries at all.Instead most crimes in which forensic evidence plays a significant role are about matching crime scene DNA with samples taken from a suspect. And where someone who wasn't a suspect becomes linked to a crime scene through a "hit" on the database, the vast majority of the time they are on the database because they have been convicted for a previous offence.I say "the vast majority of the time" – in truth I don't know exactly how often a crime is solved because of a crime scene match to one of the random innocent people on the database. And neither do the government or the police. The facts have never been collected and the research has never been done.Instead the government has steamed ahead with the largest DNA database in the world, "claiming a pioneer role", as the court described it. What the Home Office apparently failed to recognise in building this giant new vision was that it then "bears special responsibility for striking the right balance".The government is expected to unveil its new plan any day now, and experts say they expect it to be modelled on the Scottish system, which does not retain DNA from innocent people unless they have been charged with a violent or sexual crime, and even then destroys it after three years. Maybe this is what Jacqui Smith meant when she said the government would propose "a more proportionate, fair and common sense approach".Sadly, if this sounds like an admission that the current system did not get things right, I don't think it is intended to be. Word is that the Home Office is now – six years after the expansion of the database to include innocent people – determined to compile some evidence that it actually helps solve crime. That, they hope, will justify its continued expansion.Talk of "mission creep" may seem far-fetched, but there are real concerns that once your DNA sample is stashed in some lab somewhere (these by the way are private companies and you are unlikely to know anything about them), who knows what it will be used for in future. But it takes even less imagination to ask why, if police officers and forensic investigators on the front line of solving crime don't perceive the necessity of the database, Home Office officials are so utterly wedded to it.Add this to a national ID card database storing biometric information on everyone resident in the UK and an eBorders database including biometric and DNA details for everyone entering and leaving the UK, and things really start to get creepy. Even the police think so.
