The manslaughter convictions of three teenage girls who punched and kicked dance student Aimee Wellock after a drunken summer picnic were quashed by the appeal court yesterday on the grounds that they did not know the 15-year-old had a serious heart condition.Aimee's parents, Alan and Jackie, from Bradford, where she died last June, said their faith in justice had been "misplaced" and they felt "completely let down by those whose job is to protect us".Claire Colley, 19, and two other girls who cannot be named for legal reasons, will no longer have to serve their two-year sentences.
