One of the government's rising stars was forced into an embarrassing U-turn tonight, admitting she was wrong to criticise the jail sentence of paedophile Craig Sweeney.Speaking on the BBC's Any Questions last week, Vera Baird - herself a QC as well as MP for Redcar - criticised the judge in the case for giving the convicted child rapist a six-year minimum sentence.Days earlier her boss Lord Falconer, the Lord Chancellor, had said the judge - Recorder of Cardiff Judge John Griffith Williams - made the correct sentence under a system that needs changing.Ms Baird's outspoken attack deepened the crisis over "lenient" sentencing and led a senior judge to condemn her actions in public.In an apologetic letter to the Lord Chancellor, Mrs Baird said: "I should not have made those comments on the case following your statement outlining the position of the government."Accordingly I withdraw them and fully support the government's position both on this case and on the broader issues of sentencing and the sentencing framework."In his reply, also published by his department, Lord Falconer said: "Your retraction and your clear commitment to the government's position brings this matter to an end."I have complete confidence in your continuing role."Mrs Baird's original comment regarding Judge Griffith Williams was: "The way he halved the sentence from 12 to six years is wrong." She was referring to the minimum period of his life sentence that Sweeney would have to serve before being considered for parole.The junior minister told Any Questions on BBC Radio 4: "I'm critical of the judge for three reasons: starting too low; deducting too much for the guilty plea; and getting the formula wrong."Her comments contradicted Lord Falconer who, two days earlier, had insisted it was not the judge who was mistaken but the system under which he was required to operate.Mrs Baird's comments led Judge Keith Cutler to suggest that her stance could force judges to break their tradition of silence when criticised.
