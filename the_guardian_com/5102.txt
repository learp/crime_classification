Peaches Geldof could face criminal charges after she named on Twitter two women who allowed their babies to be abused by the singer Ian Watkins.South Wales police confirmed on Thursday that they were investigating whether to prosecute Geldof and other internet users who may have identified the two young victims.The mothers of the two victims, a boy and a girl, are subject to lifelong anonymity orders to prevent the identities of their children falling into the public domain.The two mothers, both in their 20s and fans of the Watkins band Lostprophets, were convicted of a series of sexual offences alongside the singer on Tuesday.In a series of tweets to her 160,000 followers on Thursday, Geldof urged newspapers to publish the names of the two women before doing so herself. She swiftly deleted the names after being bombarded with warnings from other Twitter users.Geldof, the daughter of Boomtown Rats frontman Bob, told her Twitter followers: "I can't even bring myself to comment on Watkins admitting raping babies either."As a mother of two babies myself all I can think of as I read the stories is how utterly traumatised those babies must have been during and how he has now robbed them of their childhoods all for his own sick, twisted pleasure."The papers MUST name 'woman A & B' who offered up their own babies to this monster in the hopes of being close to their (majorly talentless) musical hero without a backward glance, as they are equal in their monstrosity."It sickens me to see just how far the cult of celebrity and super fandom has come when grown women are passing their own kids round. I hate the world sometimes."Identifying victims of sexual offences is a crime under the Sexual Offences Act and carries a fine of up to Â£5,000, but publishers who flout the law often pay a further sum in compensation to the victim.South Wales police, whose detectives led the Watkins investigation, codenamed Operation Globe, said it was investigating the Twitter posts alongside lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service.Detective Chief Inspector Peter Doyle, senior investigating officer from South Wales police, said: "We are aware that the names of Ian Watkins's co-defendants have been published on social media channels. Clearly, there is strong public feeling about this case and many people are using social media forums to talk about the issues involved."We are currently in consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service regarding the matter and will take action if appropriate."Our primary objective as an organisation remains the safeguarding of vulnerable people and children. Victims of sexual abuse have a right to anonymity in order to protect their future welfare and we urge those discussing the issues raised online to be careful about using information that identifies victims in cases like this."A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman confirmed it was involved in the investigation.The CPS said in a statement: "Anonymity for victims of sexual offences is a vital component of the criminal justice process. The CPS is liaising with South Wales police in relation to their investigation into allegations that the names of two women convicted alongside Ian Watkins have been placed in the public domain, contrary to legislation that protects the identity of victims by banning the publicising of information which would identify them."
