Customs officers have dealt a devastating blow to criminals defrauding the British taxpayer of billions of pounds every year after discovering that they all channelled their funds through the same small Caribbean bank.In a joint Anglo-Dutch operation that included raids in London, the Netherlands and south Wales, First Curaçao International Bank (FCIB) was shut down after it was found that every individual arrested and charged with so-called carousel fraud in the last two years had an account there.Investigators now suspect that around 2,500 other British citizens banking at FCIB are involved in carousel fraud, a crime that is estimated to be costing taxpayers at least £5bn a year."We think the carousel fraud industry has been holed below the waterline," said a British government source, echoing comments by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, who said at the IMF conference in Singapore at the weekend that the government was getting to grips with the problem.Last night prosecutors in the Netherlands were hoping to question the bank's founder and owner, John Deuss, a Dutch oil trader. A colourful figure who has lived in Bermuda for many years, Mr Deuss, 64, was once caught breaking sanctions to help keep apartheid-era South Africa supplied with oil, and was accused of swindling the Soviet Union out of payments for oil worth around £180m at today's prices.His sister, Martina Deuss, 60, has been arrested in the Netherlands, and is being questioned about the bank and its affiliated companies, while one of her homes, in Monmouthshire, was among the properties raided by Customs.While Mr Deuss earned millions of dollars in fees from FCIB's customers, there is no suggestion that he has been involved in carousel fraud trades.He confirmed to the Guardian yesterday that the bank was facing investigation over allegations of money laundering by some of its clients, but insisted that the bank and its affiliated companies, including Transworld Oil, have always complied with all applicable laws, regulations and rules. "Accordingly, the companies deny any wrongdoing in connection with this matter and will vigorously defend their interests."The bank has since been placed into a form of administration to protect those customers who are innocent.Losses to carousel fraud, which involves the repeated import and export of items such as mobile phones and computer chips with the VAT being reclaimed each time, have shot up over the past year, to at least £100m a week, as traders have used sophisticated computer programmes to create "virtual" trades without actually moving goods.The scale of the fraud has become so colossal that it is distorting the nation's trade figures. Estimated losses during the last financial year would have been more than enough to build and equip a dozen big hospitals or 300 secondary schools, and exceeded Britain's total annual spending on overseas aid.What was not clear until now was how these virtual trades were accomplished. FCIB's turnover has risen in line with the scale of losses to the British taxpayer as well as other governments across the European Union, all of which are under attack by the fraudsters.Two years ago FCIB's volume of business was equivalent to $60m (about £32m). Before the bank was effectively closed last week, it had rocketed to $6.5bn. It had a British operation, Transworld Payment Solutions, which vetted potential FCIB clients. That company's offices in Knightsbridge, west London, were also raided by Customs officers and documents handed to the Dutch authorities.The breakthrough came when a small team of Customs investigators decided not just to investigate individual carousel fraudsters, but to follow the money trail. Using their powers under the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act - which compels British banks to report suspicions of money laundering - they found that huge sums of money were pouring in and out of FCIB via its correspondent banks which handled transactions with Europe. These were first Barclays and Dutch bank Rabobank, followed more recently by Union Bank of Switzerland. Each bank in turn shut the door on FCIB because they were anxious about the transactions.The latest rejection, by UBS, prompted FCIB to warn many of its clients last month that it was being forced to shut their accounts, as without a correspondent bank in Britain, it would not be able to move funds for them any longer. The deadline for movement of money was the end of August and accounts were finally closed last Friday.As a result of the disruption to fraudsters' banking facilities, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) last week reported a huge drop in the estimated volume of fraudulent exports of phones and computer chips in July. It said there was £1.6bn of fraudulent trade that month, down from more than £4bn a month in each of the previous four months.HMRC is optimistic that the growing number of arrests of suspected fraudsters, combined with action to disrupt their banking facilities, is finally having an impact upon the crime.
