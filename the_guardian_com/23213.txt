In the past Chief Constable Merydydd Hughes has been robust over the issue of speeding. He has warned of "anarchy" on the roads, and said he is amazed people disregard the safety limits.Not as amazed, perhaps, as the anti-speed camera campaigners who were gleeful yesterday when it emerged that Mr Hughes has been accused of driving at 90mph in a 60mph area. The chief constable of South Yorkshire has been sent a notice of prosecution for an alleged offence in north Wales. Mr Hughes is the Association of Chief Police Officers head of uniformed operations, whose responsibilities include roads policing.Mr Hughes told RoadSafe magazine this year: "It has always amazed me that people are so disregarding of speed limits when they obey other laws. We accept compromises in other parts of our lives for the greater good of society and yet many people carp at one that is most likely to save their life."An Acpo spokesperson confirmed yesterday that Mr Hughes had "received a notice of prosecution in respect of an alleged driving offence in north Wales ... while on holiday." The spokesperson said no summons had yet been received.Neither South Yorkshire nor North Wales police would confirm the speed."Captain Gatso" of Motorists Against Detection called on Mr Hughes to resign and to "resign your speed cameras".
