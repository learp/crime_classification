The parents of Madeleine McCann have rejected the claim by their official spokesman that they have accepted their missing daughter is probably dead.In an entry on his blog yesterday, Gerry McCann reaffirmed their "ongoing hope" that the four-year-old would be found alive.He wrote: "Contrary to some other reports, Kate and I do not accept that Madeleine is 'probably' dead."We know it is a possibility. However, the fact there is no evidence Madeleine has been seriously harmed gives us ongoing hope that she will be found alive."His comments contradict those of Clarence Mitchell, the McCann family spokesman, who told reporters yesterday that the couple were "realistic enough to know that there is a probability [Madeleine] is dead".In his latest blog entry on the official Find Madeleine website, Mr McCann said he also welcomed the review of the investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, which is being carried out by the deputy national director of Portuguese police, Paulo Rebelo."It is very encouraging that Mr Rebelo's officers will be seemingly reviewing all the material in the inquiry, which will hopefully identify areas for further investigation," he said.Yesterday Mrs McCann's mother, Susan Healy, said her daughter feared she was being "persecuted" by people who believed she was involved in Madeleine's disappearance because she does not look maternal enough.She said her daughter and son-in-law, who both have been named as official suspects by the Portuguese police, made a "terrible mistake" in leaving their three children alone in the family's holiday apartment.But Mrs Healy told the Liverpool Echo that her daughter believed she was being unfairly victimised."She said 'If I weighed another two stone, had a bigger bosom and looked more maternal, people would be more sympathetic'. I think it's terrible that she's having to think like that," said Mrs Healy."She does feel persecuted - not by the general public, who have been extremely supportive, but by some sections of the media, and I just feel it's important I let people know she is not this person who is in control all the time."Mrs Healy and her husband, Brian, from Allerton, Merseyside, told the Echo they were clinging to the hope that Madeleine was still alive.But they added that reports that Portuguese police were planning to search a large lake about 15 miles from where the young girl vanished 166 days ago, were "scary".
