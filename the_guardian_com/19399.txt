Harriet Harman will today step up her drive to make buying sex illegal as new figures show brothels are charging as little as £15.Harman, the minister for women and equality, will highlight cultural double standards after some respondents in a poll, particularly older men, condoned buying sex but condemned those who sell it.Trafficked women's charity the Poppy Project surveyed more than 900 brothels and found many offered high-risk "services" such as unprotected anal sex for £10 extra.Researchers posed as potential customers and phoned 921 brothels that advertised in local newspapers.Several premises offered "very young girls", the report revealed. It found the average price for full sex was £62.Harman, Labour's deputy leader, is due to release separate government figures today. The Ipsos-Mori poll, conducted in July and August, shows that more than 58% of men and women support making it illegal to pay for sex if it will help reduce the number of women and children being trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation.A Home Office-led review into the demand for prostitution, due to report this year, is looking at whether ministers should make it illegal to pay for sex. The review is looking at how to curb demand, but the Home Office minister Vernon Coaker has given a broad hint he will back criminalising the purchase of sex if there is a sign of a national consensus on the issue.The findings of the government-commissioned survey are likely to give ministers greater confidence in introducing the measure. At present the law makes it illegal to sell sex, but ministers including Coaker have visited Sweden to see if tougher laws, including banning the purchase of sex, can work.Harman has the backing of prominent ministers including the solicitor general, Vera Baird, and the attorney general, Lady Scotland.Harman said some people in the survey had double standards, indicating that they were relaxed about the principle of paying for sex but would be deeply ashamed if a female relative was working as a prostitute.The research found divergent attitudes between women and men. A clear majority of women found both paying for sex and selling it unacceptable (61% and 65% respectively), but men were much more equivocal, with just 42% and 40% respectively finding it unacceptable.More than half of those questioned (60%) from both genders would feel ashamed if they found out a family member was working as a prostitute. But men were more likely to find it unacceptable for a female relative to sell sex, while being relaxed about a male relative paying for it.This difference was most stark among men over 55, who were the most accepting of buying sex in general, but just 21% of whom thought it acceptable for a female relative to sell sex.Young people were more likely than older people to find paying for sex and selling sex unacceptable (64% and 69% respectively).Harman said: "Our survey suggests that there are double standards out there: the overwhelming majority of those people who said they thought selling sex was a reasonable choice also said they would find it unacceptable if a family member was working as a prostitute."We know that paying for sex fuels the demand for trafficked women and children, but we can't talk about tackling demand without challenging cultural attitudes more widely."Harman has been allowed to express her personal view that buying sex should be made illegal before the government review has been completed.The Poppy Project survey found 77 different ethnicities of women were being offered for sex, many from trafficking hotspots such as eastern Europe and south-east Asia.Co-author Helen Atkins said: "This research shows the disturbing prevalence of the sex industry in every corner of London - fuelled by the demand for prostitution services."Multi-media misrepresentations of commercial sex as a glamorous, easy and fun career choice for girls and women further contribute to the ubiquity of London's brothel industry."A researcher said in the report: "There was a chain of south-east London places which promised 'the lowest prices in London' and a place in Islington stood out as sounding particularly unpleasant and dodgy."
