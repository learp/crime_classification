The "phantom canoeist", John Darwin, and his wife, Anne, who are serving six-year jail terms for what a judge called calculated and callous fraud, are to repay nearly £600,000 – although Mrs Darwin will pay almost all of that sum, while Mr Darwin will repay just £1.The bill for compensation and returning the proceeds of crime was accepted today by lawyers for Mrs Darwin, 57, who claimed insurance and pension payments after her husband faked his death at sea seven years ago.The offer came at Leeds crown court, where Mrs Darwin appeared while her husband, who has no assets, remained in jail. It followed a determined pursuit by the Crown Prosecution Service.The repayment will force the sale of an estate in Panama, where the couple's plan to start a new life running an ecotourism business was foiled when a photograph of John Darwin was seen on a local estate agent's website.There will be little left for any bequest to the couple's two sons, who were never let into the plot. Darwin managed to live in hiding and disguised at the couple's home near Hartlepool until the scam unravelled shortly before Christmas 2007.Lawyers for Mrs Darwin, a former doctor's receptionist, offered repayments of £591,838 at today's Proceeds of Crime Act hearing. The money is made up of £228,138.24 in repayments to insurance and pension companies and £363,700.01 in compensation to firms and others who suffered financial loss or legal bills.John Darwin, a former teacher and prison officer with pensions in both jobs, acknowledged his part in the scam by offering a nominal payment of £1.The couple have not met since their conviction in July last year, when Anne Darwin was jailed for six and a half years and her husband, who is 58, was sentenced to six years and three months. Both were convicted of fraud, with nine additional money-laundering charges proved against Mrs Darwin and one of faking a passport against her husband.He took a canoe out in the Tees estuary and staged his own drowning, later stealing the identity of a baby called John Jones, who died in Sunderland in 1950.The fraud was copied in part from the plot of Frederick Forsyth's bestselling thriller The Day of the Jackal, but the Darwins added many complications of their own. At one stage, while officially "dead", John Darwin signed an objection to a neighbour's planning application under his false name, and also started an internet liaison with a woman in Kansas.The couple's downfall came when John Darwin decided to reappear, claiming memory loss, and walked into a London police station in December 2007. His wife pretended rapturous surprise, but police were suspicious and their fate was sealed days later when they were recognised in a Panama estate agency's online brochure.
