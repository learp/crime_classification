  The Daily Mail front page hitting out at the new child protection databaseWhat a way to start the day – waking up to find oneself in agreement with the front page of the Mail, one of the most hysterical platforms in British public life outside TV soaps where the characters shout at each other all the time.But stick around: this is going directly to affect 11 million of us.It's not that today's Mail isn't pretty hysterical and routinely pumped up with steroids. The new Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) isn't as bad as the account suggests, as you can see from its website.But the idea underpinning it is bad enough, a perfect example of the road to hell being paved with well-meaning government initiatives implemented by decent people (its chairman is a former head of Barnardo's) who may well end of wasting a lot of time and money – mostly ours.You missed the ISA? It's the new body set up as a result of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act of 2006, explanatory notes on which you can read here.But even experts seem to share some of the Mail's doubts.As of next month, the ISA will start to vet all individuals who work, as professionals or volunteers, with vulnerable people – mostly children but also some adults, the infirm or mentally ill.Splendid, splendid, although we note that it consolidates previous legislation and organisations – List 99, the Protection of Vulnerable Adults and Protection of Children acts – which apparently left gaps through which predatory people slipped past vetting by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB).Indeed, the 2006 act arises directly from the 2004 report by the Whitehall highflyer Sir Michael Bichard into the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham by their school caretaker, Ian Huntley.Ministers accepted 19 of his 31 recommendations. MPs and peers on all sides – as this Hansard extract from the Commons third reading debate suggests – accepted it in a "something must be done" mood.I note, in passing, that there were 25 new clauses, four new schedules and 250 government amendments attached to the bill at a late stage, in itself a further indication that – under all parties – modern Britain legislates too much and too hastily."I hope it works out as intended" are virtually the last words of the debate.And that's really the point, isn't it? When John Humphrys, who often sounds like a talking book version of the Mail, browbeat hapless officials and ministers on Radio 4's Today programme, none that I heard disputed the estimate that 11.3 million British adults will have to be processed by the CRB, with some them being barred by the grandly-titled Independent Barring Board (IBB) from getting near the kids or the vulnerable.That's about a quarter of us. And, do you know, the proposition is offensive and bureaucratic and won't do the job in hand.Why not? Because sadists and child molesters are usually fixated and often crafty people.They lead double lives and are practised in deceit. Ian Huntley certainly was and – as Humpo pointed out on the radio – his proclivities were known to the police on Humberside. They simple forgot to tell the police in Cambridgeshire when he applied for a job working alongside kids in Soham.That's what happens in real life. In California these past few weeks, we've been hearing about Phil Garrido, the man whose child kidnapping scam lasted 18 years.The neighbours called him "Creepy Phil" and he had form, too. But no one did anything about it and Jaycee Dugard lived on in the garden.Despite the best efforts of the ISA and the IBB – not forgetting the poor old CRB – some bad people will still do terrible things to children and vulnerable adults in old people's homes or prisons.That number would probably be higher without the complex procedures which define "regulated activities" from merely "controlled" ones – voluntary groups – and tell scoutmasters and those who read in school what defines such activities.But the price society will pay is the real cost to 11.3 million of us – the estimate was 10 million when the bill was passed, so who knows where it will stop once it starts?One in four adults being vetted is truly spooky, provoking images of a paedophile stasi peeping into every corner of our lives.Result? More paperwork, less trust, less volunteering and greater social isolation. Oh yes, and more mutual suspicion, more suspicion of adults by children, more indiscipline among children ("if you punish me I'll tell my mum you touched my naughty bits," one three-year-old was allegedly heard to say).All of it leads to more social dysfunction – and, dare I say, probably to more disturbed adults that society eventually has to deal with.And I haven't even mentioned the cost of 200 extra staff or the £64 ISA fee yet (unpaid volunteers won't have to pay it. Hurrah!).On the day when Gordon Brown apologised for the persecution and chemical castration of that remarkable mathematician, Alan Turing, of Enigma code-breaking fame, we can all hang our heads in shame at the repressed and repressive way homosexuality was treated in this country within living memory – though not by Brown (so why did he apologise?), who was a small baby when Turing was convicted for gross indecency in 1952.Yet as the authorities ruined his career and life, I'm sure all sorts of villains, many of them highly respectable, were interfering with kids with gusto – and getting away with it.If only they'd known, we could have had a Carry On Molesting film to add to that fine genre. Double entendres and titters all round. Sid James tampering with Kenneth Williams – who'd have though it, eh? Shows you can never tell.We are less innocent, wiser and generally more tolerant now, generally for the better. But our hyper-preoccupation with sexuality (for and against), combined with deep anxiety about the innocence of our children (they ain't actually that innocent) is leading us down a dangerous path strewn with good intentions.
