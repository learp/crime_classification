The prison service is facing a mental health crisis with rates of severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia, more than 10 times higher among male inmates than among the general population, ministers have been warned.More than 52,000 male prisoners across England and Wales suffer from two or more serious mental disorders, according to the Prison Reform Trust (PRT) and the mental health charity Mind. Nearly 10% suffer from schizophrenia or delusional disorders compared with less than 1% of the general population.At a conference in London today, Mind and the PRT are calling on the government to provide better mental health care within prison and alternatives to jail for severely ill offenders.The conference, Troubled Inside, is intended to highlight to government how prison staff are struggling to cope with record levels of mental illness among inmates.According to Mind and the PRT, two-thirds of male prisoners are diagnosed with a personality disorder. Two-fifths suffer from depression, anxiety and phobias - more than twice the rate among the general male population. One fifth take anti-depressants or anti-psychotic medication and the same proportion has attempted suicide at some stage or previously been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. The two charities propose more community sentences for minor offences, such as shoplifting, committed by people with mental health problems, and placing acutely ill and suicidal offenders into secure psychiatric hospital rather than prison.The policy director of Mind, Sophie Corlett, said more community services were needed to prevent people with mental health problems from being caught up in the prison system.She said: "There needs to be a big investment into mental health provision within the criminal system, so that people don't end up in prison when what they really need is care, and those in prison get the help they need."PRT's director, Juliet Lyon, said insufficient investment in community care had led to already overcrowded prisons filling up with "petty offenders with complex mental health needs". She said: "Proper investment in court diversion, mental health and drug treatment in the community and secure health provision for those who need it would lift the burden off untrained prison staff and put a stop to the cruel and unnecessary punishment of jailing vulnerable people." PRT policy officer, Enver Soloman, also called for an independent inspector, such as the new Healthcare Commission, to monitor and assess the quality of prison mental health services, which are being transferred to primary care trusts (PCTs).Among the speakers at today's conference, the full title of which is Troubled Inside - responding to the mental health needs of male prisoners in England and Wales, are the chief inspector of prisons, Ann Owers and the prisons and probation minister, Paul Goggins.Last week, Ms Owers renewed her call to remove women and girls suffering from severe mental illnesses from the prison system, after finding that yet another jail was unable to provide adequate help.A Department of Health spokesman said that giving PCTs responsibility for commissioning prison healthcare would ensure that prisoners receive the same range and quality of mental health services as the general public. He added: "A total of £10m was spent on NHS mental health in-reach services for prisons in England during the last financial year and this is expected to double to £20m a year between March 2004 and March 2006. In addition, more than 300 additional NHS staff have become involved in providing mental health services in prisons."
