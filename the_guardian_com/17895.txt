An email warning children of a serial rapist was sent out yesterday by Surrey's chief constable, Denis O'Connor. The rapist has attacked nine women - eight in the past three months - in south-east England. His victims include girls of 10 and 12. Detectives are concerned because the rapist has eluded an investigation now employing 200 officers from four forces. He has attacked in daylight, near public areas, and has not been deterred by women walking dogs or riding bicycles. On each occasion, he has grabbed his victim from behind. Mr O'Connor's email has been circulated within the force so officers can forward it to any children they know. The message has also been sent to Surrey county council, secondary schools and youth groups. It says: "In Surrey [the rapist] has committed offences in Epsom, Redhill, and the Woking area. "The offender takes considerable risks, attacking his victims on well used public footpaths or common land adjacent to nearby wooded areas, mostly in daylight hours. "Police are asking everyone to be vigilant and not put themselves in unnecessary danger by walking alone in the type of locations that the rapist uses." Mr O'Connor said yesterday: "I am aware of the potential for alarm, but feel that I have a duty to give them as much specific information about the offences as possible in order they can take steps to ensure their own personal safety." The rapist is white, aged between 30 and 50, with short dark hair. He is of medium height with a muscular build and tanned skin. Anyone with information should call 0845 601 8109.
