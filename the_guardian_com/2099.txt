The public outcry after the death of Damilola Taylor swiftly developed into a national debate about street crime and the policing of inner cities that reverberates to this day.The case marked a turning point for policy makers who have been under constant pressure in the past 18 months to provide solutions to soaring street crime. Last week the home secretary, David Blunkett, announced new powers allowing courts to lock up hundreds of persistent teenage offenders and to put child offenders into protective custody. Eighteen months ago, with law and order issues driving the agenda in the run-up to the 2001 general election, Tony Blair told MPs the attack was "appalling and brutal" and pledged to "do everything we possibly can to bring the killers to justice". Jack Straw, then home secretary, condemned the "walk-on-by society" and said it was time everyone took a stand against crime and yobbish behaviour. Within weeks, William Hague, then the Tory leader, was accused of "playing the race card" for writing an article which linked Damilola's death with the shortage of beat constables and the fallout from the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence. The police investigation highlighted the virulent teenage gang culture that exists in some deprived areas and the difficulty of getting some known offenders into court. The Met recently launched a Safer Streets Initiative in some of London's worst affected boroughs and is pushing ahead with a scheme to use hundreds of police "auxiliaries" to provide high visibility reassurance to communities. There have also been calls for action to ensure that depressing estates like North Peckham are never built again.
