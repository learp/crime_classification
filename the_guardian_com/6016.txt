David Blunkett, the home secretary, today offered repeat offenders the choice of help to mend their ways or being fast-tracked through the courts.At the launch of a government initiative to curb recidivism, he said the 5,000 most persistent offenders would be identified and targeted with programmes to help steer them away from crime but risk spending lengthy periods behind bars if they broke the law again."The message I am getting across is if you want help, we will help you, if you don't want to be helped we will come down on you like a tonne of bricks," he told an audience at Millgarth police station in Leeds.Mr Blunkett said the "common sense" initiative would give offenders a chance to mend their ways. He should have been done many years ago but it had taken a while to get all the relevant agencies working in partnership."We have to give them a way out," he said. "We have to ensure that when they come out of prison someone meets them, their immediate housing and employment needs are looked after and there is someone they can call on."Above all we can get them out of the situation that got them into jail in the first place. And that's in our interest because these people by their very nature are repeat offenders and have done this time and time again."Mr Blunkett said it was communities that paid the ultimate price for repeat offenders.The initiative received backing from Ian Rayner, who presented the home secretary with his autobiography The Biggest Issue?, which details his descent into a life of drugs and crime following an unhappy childhood.Rayner, 38, who now works as a plumber's mate and lives on the Isle of Man, spent several periods in jail, including a three-year stint for burglary to feed his drug habit."At the end of the day if you are locked up in prison, with no rehabilitation then the chances are you will re-offend once outside," he said.But Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the probation union Napo, said the Home Office still needed to increase its funding and address the underlying causes of crime."All the criminal justice agencies have been concentrating on this work for the last 30 years. Unless the Home Office fund probation and police to deliver, it will just be another empty slogan.""The government needs a strategy to tackle the underlying causes of crime, which is principally stealing to feed drug and alcohol addiction."
