Measures to increase police powers against crime - from yobbish behaviour to rape and murder - are at the heart of a new law and order bill published by the government today.Unveiling the Criminal Justice and Police bill, home secretary Jack Straw announced new police powers to deal with drink-related disorder, plans for the increased use of fingerprints and DNA, and proposals to improve the training and organisation of the police service. Under the draft legislation, fixed penalties will be introduced for a wide range of offences such as being drunk and disorderly, making hoax 999 calls and damaging property. The plans, a version of the instant fines first suggested by prime minister Tony Blair, would enable police to issue on-the-spot fixed penalties for offences including being drunk and disorderly and buying alcohol for under 18s. The level of fines was not specified. Other measures will require bar staff to request proof of age from drinkers. It will also be an offence for bar staff, as well as the licensee, to sell alcohol to drunk or disorderly customers The bill also provides scope for massive growth in the national DNA database, allowing lawfully taken DNA samples to be held indefinitely, even if acquired from volunteers during mass testing sometimes conducted during murder investigations.The bill controversially proposes raising the age for child curfews from 10 to 15, following Mr Straw's admission he was "in error" when he introduced the original law imposing curfews on misbehaving children under 10. Not a single order has been issued since the legislation was introduced in 1998. Children's groups have called on the government to scrap the curfew measure altogether, claiming it will only serve to alienate young people.The bill would also allow the confiscation of drug traffickers' passports and make it easier to arrest hit-and-run drivers, kerb-crawlers and those trying to import child pornography.New legislation aimed at animal rights extremists, announced by the home secretary on Wednesday, are not included in the bill but are likely to be introduced at the amendments stage. Publishing the bill in parliament today, Mr Straw said: "These measures are designed to help tackle crime and disorder by ensuring that the police service has the powers, training and organisation it needs to perform effectively and tackle criminal behaviour. "Drunken yobs cause misery to individuals and blight communities across the country every weekend, showing no regard for the rights of others to live in peace. It is essential that police officers have adequate powers to deal with these thugs." The bill formed the centrepiece of government initiatives to target law and order, prioritised in December's Queen's Speech outlining the legislative schedule for the year.
