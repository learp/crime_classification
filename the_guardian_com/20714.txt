A prisoner released early from jail with no money was handed an IOU for £140 but no information about where it could be redeemed, it was claimed today.A crisis in the prison service was blamed for the situation, which has seen hundreds of people freed from prison with little or no money and no accommodation.Released prisoners are often dependent on state benefits but applications usually take a month to process. Those freed early cannot put in a claim until their sentence officially ends.Probation staff have warned that the system is in disarray, with their union saying today that freed prisoners with no money for even essential needs amounted to "a recipe for reoffending".The end of custody licence scheme (ECL) was introduced in June when the prison population had soared to record levels, with several hundred convicted criminals being held in police cells and magistrates courts.Within two days 1,390 inmates were released and given up to £173 in lieu of future benefits. According to the Ministry of Justice this practice has now ceased and prisoners freed on ECL are instead given a standard discharge grant of £45.The National Association of Probation Officers (Napo) has said many prisoners are released with no money at all; and for those who receive the £45 grant it can amount to as little as £1.50 a day on which to survive until state benefits begin.The case of the prisoner handed an IOU was reported by a probation officer in south-east England. The man had been told he would be given money to sustain him until he was eligible for benefits, but on release was given an envelope containing the note promising £140.The probation officer checked with the prison and was told that although the government had said everybody released early would get money, no negotiations had taken place between the prison service and the Ministry of Justice as to where the money would come from.Another prisoner, in the north-west of England, was released early from a two-month sentence and given £3.70 to cover his bus fare to the probation office.His licence conditions stated he must live in a named hotel, but he had no money to pay for it. To avoid his recall to jail the probation service gave him £10 a night to pay for his bed and breakfast.Probation staff in Yorkshire have contacted local MPs claiming the system is a national disgrace.All prisoners released on "normal" licence are meant to be subject to risk assessment and accommodation checks. Napo claims that "since day one of the early-release scheme" these checks have not been carried out. As a consequence prisoners are being freed without anywhere to go, while others are being sent back to addresses where victims of their domestic violence still live.The Guardian has seen copies of the form filled in by inmates seeking early release and it does not address the issue of accommodation.Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of Napo, said the early releases were made at short notice without proper planning. His union had evidence that many prisoners were released with no support, no cash and no accommodation, he said."Prisoners released with the standard grant of £45 will not receive any benefit for 32 days and will be expected to survive on less than £1.50 a day. That is a recipe for reoffending. The government needs to sort this mess out now," he said.Frances Crook, the director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said ministers had known for more than a year that early releases were the only way to tackle the overcrowding crisis. "It is pretty jaw-dropping that the MoJ failed to provide the prison service with the resources to support these individuals until they can claim benefits," she said.A ministry spokesman said a prisoner leaving a full 18 days early received the standard discharge grant and subsequent payments were sent to their home address by the Department for Work and Pensions."When ECL was first introduced there was some delay in subsistence payments due to miscommunication from the Prison Service to the DWP, but this is being resolved," he said.
