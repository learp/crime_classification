A man who has used a dead baby's name for the past 23 years and refuses to reveal his true identity was jailed for 21 months for deception today.So-called Christopher Edward Buckingham assumed the identity of a nine-month-old boy who died in 1963.At Canterbury crown court, Judge Adele Williams said Buckingham was involved in "wholesale identity theft", a serious matter considering current concerns about the safety of personal data and the security situation.She said Buckingham showed "a complete lack of remorse" and had been "actively obstructive" by refusing to reveal his true identity. Buckingham only escaped the maximum two-year sentence because he pleaded guilty, she said.In January, UK immigration officials checked Buckingham's passport at Calais and realised it had been obtained by deception. He was allowed to board a ferry to Dover but was arrested on his arrival.He told police during interview that he was Lord Buckingham, a title he had inherited on his father's death in 1982, and a letterhead bearing the Buckingham coat of arms was found in his possession.The Royal College of Arms, however, confirmed that no one is currently registered to use the coat of arms, which were last held in the early 1700s.Officers then did further checks and discovered that the man had assumed the identity of a child who was born in 1962 and died the following year.Buckingham, who has worked as an IT security consultant for a large Swiss company and lives in Switzerland, pleaded guilty last month to making an untrue statement for the purpose of obtaining a passport.Speaking after sentencing, Det Con David Sprigg said he believed Buckingham was "hiding some dark secret and he does not want us to know who he is". He said police knew Buckingham had access to a safe deposit box in Zurich and police would "love to know what is in it".He said the Northamptonshire family of the real Christopher Buckingham were "traumatised" that someone had been using their dead baby's identity for so many years.Det Con Sprigg confirmed that police would continue in their hunt to trace Buckingham's true identity and his DNA, fingerprints and photo had been sent to forces in Israel and South Africa in the hope he might be on record.
