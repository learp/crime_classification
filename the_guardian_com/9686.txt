While I welcome the proposals to provide constructive community-based penalties as a direct alternative to the current negative custodial sentences (Report, 8 December), the lord chancellor must take note of the recent history of penology. Earlier such attempts were thwarted by the sentencers and the providers alike.Unless judicial discretion is clearly delineated, preferably by the use of the required community sentence subject to excepting circumstances, reinforced by appellate review and accountability, sentencers will use the "tougher" community penalties for those who previously would have been given a less demanding one, rather than sentence someone facing a custodial penalty to the new order.Those devising and delivering the new community penalty, to be rewarded by the success rate of their orders, will only recommend those who they think will succeed, thus drawing in the "safer" group who would normally have received an "ordinary" community penalty.Additionally, without this narrowly defined sentencing framework subject to accountability, any reforming sentencing policy will be annihilated by one or two ghastly cases emblazoned across newspapers and television, as happened in 1993 to the legislation designed by Douglas Hurd, and demolished by the then home secretary, one Ken Clarke.Lynne RavenscroftLondonâ€¢ Ken Clarke receives praise for his progressive stance on the imprisonment of people with mental illnesses (Comment, 8 December). It was his party that created the problem in the first place by closing mental hospitals in the 1980s.Dorothea CuerdenClayton-le-Woods, Lancashire
