Around 1,000 police and community support officers will protect children travelling to and from London schools against robbery, Scotland Yard said. Pupils starting secondary school will be given special attention, with officers outside schools, around tube stations and on buses until half-term on 21 October.There were 15,766 muggings in the capital between April and last month, with more than a third of victims aged between 10 and 19, and 8,200 mobile phones reported stolen. Police said that robberies in which mobile phones are taken from young people leaving school increase at this time of year.Ian McPherson, the Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner, said: "We take street crime very seriously â€“ being robbed can be a traumatic experience, and so tackling it is a key priority for us."He added: "I'd like to remind Londoners that street robbery is still relatively lower than in previous years, including 2006 when robbery was at peak levels."
