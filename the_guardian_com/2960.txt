Three former Dunlop executives were jailed yesterday for a highly sophisticated cartel that conned millions of pounds out of the Ministry of Defence and others for specialist marine hosing.The illicit price-fixing, believed to have been running for decades, is thought to have inflated prices by up to 18% on global orders of up to Â£75m a year.Southwark crown court heard its worldwide reach and complexity was so great that a full-time "co-ordinator" was needed to ensure the operation ran seamlessly.But despite the cartel's efforts, suspicions were aroused and a joint investigation was launched by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the US Department of Justice. It was the first prosecution brought under the Enterprise Act 2003, which was set up to bolster competition law.The operation culminated in the arrests in Houston in May last year of Bryan Allison, 52, then managing director of Grimsby-based Dunlop Oil and Marine Limited, and the company's then marketing director, David Brammar, 45. Also arrested was former colleague Peter Whittle, 51. At the same time, OFT investigators raided Dunlop's offices and Whittle's home, seizing "compelling" evidence.All three admitted "dishonestly participating in a cartel". According to the indictment, the operation involved the allocation of markets and customers, the restriction of supplies, fixing prices and rigging bids for the supply of marine hosing - used to transport oil from tankers to shore - and "ancillary equipment".Investigators believe the cartel may have been running since the 1970s.Allison, of Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, and Whittle, from Louth, Lincolnshire, were each jailed for three years and Brammar, of Humberston, received two and a half years.Passing sentence, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC told them evidence amply demonstrated they had been part of a "long-running, entrenched cartel" involving "carefully orchestrated bid rigging".
