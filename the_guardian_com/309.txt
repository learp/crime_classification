Thanks again for the ideas on our post-troubles thread. Please keep them coming. Meanwhile normal life seems to be returning, even with some bonuses. North Yorkshire police have issued a statistical snapshot which suggests that crime fell 40 percent last week as patrols were increased in the county in case of copycat violence.Less cheering is the double whammy for the three northern regions of two pessimistic reports on employment and manufacturing from the TUC and a joint study by the Chartered Institute for Personnel Management and the accountants KPMG. These coincide with the first of a three-part study of manufacturing by our Economics Editor Larry Elliott, which will be well worth reading, cutting-out and keeping. And there's a third sombre report from Manchester (see foot of post).The TUC figures are quite complicated, so maybe it will be helpful to reproduce them here, in addition to the links above and below. The number-crunchers chose December 2007 employment levels as the 'eve of the recession'. The 'jobs gap' is the difference between then and April 2011.North EastDec 2007 1,168,000Jan 2011 1,127,000April 2011 1,132,000Jobs gap -36,000Jobs gap (per cent) -3.1Yorkshire and HumberDec 2007 2,463,000Jan 2011 2,410,000April 2011 2,403,000Jobs gap -60,000Percent -2.4North WestDec 2007 3,180,000Jan 2011 3,153,000April 2011 3,120,000Jobs gap -60,000percent -1.9East MidlandsDec 2007 2,139,000Jan 2011 2,123,000April 2011 2,146,000Jobs gap +7,000percent +0.3West MidlandsDec 2007 2,501,000Jan 2011 2,407,000April 2011 2,431,000Jobs gap -70,000Percent -2.8East of EnglandDec 2007 2,821,000Jan 2011 2,840,000April 2011 2,861,000Jobs gap +40,000Percent +1.4LondonDec 2007 3,729,000Jan 2011 3,846,000April 201 3,851,000Jobs gap +122,000Percent +3.3South EastDec 2007 4,201,000Jan 2011 4,197,000April 2011 4,184,000Jobs gap -17,000Percent -0.4South WestDec 2007 2,573,000Jan 2011 2,530,000April 2011 2,506,000Jobs gap -67,000Percent -2.6UKDec 2007 29,437,000Jan 2011 29,229,000April 2011 29,279,000Jobs gap -158,000Percent -0.5Here they are divided between men and women on the same basis - if only to bring you the morsel of good news, that jobs for women nationally have increased since 2007 (but not in our regions).MENNorth East618,000598,000610,000-8,000-1.3Yorkshire and Humber1,332,0001,280,0001,275,000-57,000-4.3North West1,709,0001,684,0001,664,000-45,000-2.6East Midlands1,157,0001,151,0001,164,000+7,000+0.6West Midlands1,361,0001,284,0001,310,000-51,000-3.7East of England1,529,0001,539,0001,541,000+12,000+0.8London2,088,0002,155,0002,140,000+52,000+2.5South East2,261,0002,243,0002,252,000-9,000-0.4South West1,383,0001,345,0001,329,000-54,000-3.9UK15,912,00015,663,00015,713,000-199,000-1.3WOMENNorth East550,000529,000522,000-28,000-5.1Yorkshire and Humber1,131,0001,130,0001,128,000-3,000-0.3North West1,470,0001,469,0001,456,000-14,000-1.0East Midlands982,000972,000982,00000.0West Midlands1,140,0001,123,0001,122,000-18,000-1.6East of England1,293,0001,301,0001,320,000+27,000+2.1London1,641,0001,692,0001,711,000+70,000+4.3South East1,940,0001,954,0001,932,000-8,000-0.4South West1,190,0001,185,0001,177,000-13,000-1.1UK13,525,00013,566,00013,566,000+41,000+0.3You can read more from the TUC here and here; and from the CIPD/KPMG report here.The particularly worrying factor is the suggestion of faltering confidence in manufacturing. The loss of public sector jobs is no surprise, although it hits the north relatively hard because of the sector's importance in the economy of all our three regions, especially the North East.Sorry to heap Pelion upon Ossa, but the usually buoyant bulletin from Manchester Business Insider also passes on similar gloom from the latest report produced by the city's accountants BDO, whose heading echoes the other two. Things can change rapidly, but we continue to face hard times.
