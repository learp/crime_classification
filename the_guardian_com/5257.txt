Two young children found dead inside holdalls in the boot of their mother's car showed signs of asphyxiation, according to postmortem tests.Detectives are still waiting to question their mother, Fiona Donnison, 43, who was arrested for murder after she went to Heathfield police station in East Sussex on Wednesday and told officers to search her car.Following autopsies at King's College hospital, London, police confirmed that three-year-old Harry and two-year-old Elise Donnison had been dead for less than a day when their bodies were discovered in two large bags in the boot of their mother's silver Nissan.Their mother, a former worker at Lloyd's of London, was said to be in a stable condition at Eastbourne district general hospital with "apparent self-harm injuries".A family friend claimed the children's father, Paul Donnison, expressed concern to police for their safety before they were killed. The friend, who declined to be named, said Fiona Donnison had demonstrated alarming personal traits.She said: "He said to my husband he was very concerned about the safety of the children in her hands.""I think she had probably demonstrated personal traits that gave him cause to be concerned. He did say to me that he told police about the children's safety but I don't know under what circumstances he told them."The friend, who had known the Donnisons for five years, claimed they had been experiencing marital difficulties.Sussex police confirmed they had had "previous contact" with the couple.Officers are awaiting the results of toxicology results before the children's cause of death can be officially confirmed, a spokesman said.
