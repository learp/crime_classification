The Metropolitan police force has introduced its first trial crime map showing burglary, robbery and vehicle crime for the whole of London.The Met online crime mapping project, which uses data up to the end of June this year, is an initiative launched by the London mayor, Boris Johnson.The crime mapping project uses Google Maps technology combined with Met Police crime data, highlighting London boroughs with above- or below-average crime rates and comparing rates for different months and years.Southwark scores worst on crime levels, which increased by more than 100 individual incidents between May and June this year.Another four of London's 32 boroughs, including Westminster and Hackney, were above the overall average crime rate across the capital in June.Seven outlying boroughs, including Richmond, all saw below-average rates of crime for London in June.Users can zoom in on the map to see specific rates for their neighbourhood, or search by postcode."The Mayor made crime mapping a key manifesto commitment and it is an integral part of our strategy to make London safer, " said Kit Malthouse, deputy mayor for policing."It is a proven technique for increasing public safety and putting extra resources into crime hotspots where they are most needed."A Met spokesman emphasised that this version of the map is a test phase and will be subject to a technical review."The software development will enhance the service that we currently provide regarding the number, rate and geographical location of defined crime types within the capital," the spokesman said."The electronic crime maps will sit alongside the crime statistics that are published monthly on a ward, borough and pan-London basis."He added that the initial version will be limited to burglary, robbery and vehicle crime data and that the software will be enhanced before a formal launch in September.Malthouse said the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, had "recently converted" to the crime mapping programme following the work by the mayor's office, consequently announcing a project to introduce maps for police forces around the country.Police forces in Hampshire, Lancashire, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire are all conducting trials of their own crime maps. The government hopes the initiative will increase public confidence in the police and keep them more informed on local crime problems.· To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
