Witnesses were "bullied and browbeaten" by detectives determined to make a false case against five men they wrongly believed had murdered the Cardiff woman Lynette White, a jury heard on Thursday.Police had become convinced that the five were behind the killing of White, who was working as a prostitute, and were determined to make the evidence "fit" the theory, it was claimed.Three of the five were convicted of murdering White at a squalid Cardiff flat in 1988 but were freed on appeal and came to be known as the "Cardiff Three". Another man was eventually convicted of murdering White.On trial at Swansea crown court now are eight police officers who are accused of conspiring to pervert the course of justice by manipulating the evidence against the five.The jury has been told that the police were under pressure for a result after failing to track down the killers. From November — nine months after White's body was found — the officers began to put pressure on witnesses to change their accounts.Nick Dean QC, prosecuting, said one of the leading detectives, Graham Mouncher, became convinced that the five had killed 20-year-old White.Dean said: "Under Mouncher's guidance and with his help the police team from this point engaged in proving that their theories and beliefs were true."They were no longer actually investigating the murder, no longer keeping an open mind about who had killed Lynette."What they were doing was fitting in evidence to suit their view of what had happened to Lynette."On the second day of a three-day opening speech, Dean said: "People were brought to the police station often having been given no real choice but to attend. They were kept in the police station for very long periods of time."There was a co-ordinated and deliberate policy designed to 'break' some witnesses. The whole process was a team effort — was part of a conspiracy."The prosecution claim witnesses were "bullied and browbeaten" by detectives. Dean said the witnesses independently described "complex fictitious events". "Their accounts fitted together and complemented each other. This is simply impossible."Dean added: "The police officers were threatening and intimidating.These witnesses were given every impression that they had to remain at the police station."They were certainly in their own minds, under the physical control of the police officers who questioned them."White's boyfriend Stephen Miller along with Yusef Abdullahi and Tony Paris were jailed over the killing. Fresh DNA techniques led to the arrest of another man, Jeffrey Gafoor, who admitted to committing the murder alone and was jailed for life in 2003.Dean said Mouncher was "the man most responsible for developing the police team's view of how Lynette White had met her death."He added: "The evidence suggests too that Mouncher had become emotionally involved in the case and that he was unable to keep the professional distance from the case that was necessary for any proper investigation."The prosecutor told the jury potential evidence that did not suit the officers' theory was "airbrushed out of the picture."Former South Wales police officers Mouncher, Richard Powell, Thomas Page, Michael Daniels, Paul Jennings, Paul Stephen, Peter Greenwood and John Seaford deny conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Mouncher and two civilian witnesses deny lying under oath in court.The trial continues.
