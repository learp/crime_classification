Police in Spain investigating the disappearance of a British couple were today carrying out tests on two bodies.Tony and Linda O'Malley, of Llangollen, north Wales, went missing last year while looking for a holiday home in Benidorm. Spanish police yesterday found two bodies in the basement of a house in the El Baradello area of Alcoy, near Benidorm. The identities have yet to be confirmed, but they are thought to be Mr and Ms O'Malley, who were aged 42 and 55. The discovery came the day after four Venezuelans, two men and two women, were arrested in Alcoy.A north Wales police spokesman said: "North Wales police have been working in close cooperation with the Spanish police investigating the disappearance of Linda and Tony O'Malley. There have been developments, the full details of which are still being communicated. The Spanish police are leading a murder investigation and north Wales police are assisting with this investigation." The last positive sighting of the couple was on September 13, when they were due to fly home following a fortnight-long trip. It is believed the O'Malleys, who had been married for 15 years, had decided to buy a five-bedroom house in the area which had been repossessed and was due to be auctioned. A substantial amount of cash, enough to buy a holiday home, had been withdrawn from their joint bank account while "unusual purchases" were made on their credit card. Although there has been no sighting of the couple since September 13, when they were spotted by a property agent, Joanne Miles, police said there was continued use of their credit card up until September 19. Ms O'Malley's elder daughter, Nicola Welch, from Hampshire, and Mr O'Malley's brother Bernard, flew to Spain to help in the search and the couple's disappearance has featured on BBC's Crimewatch programme.Members of the O'Malley family today declined to comment on the discovery.
