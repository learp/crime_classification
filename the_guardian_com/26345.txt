Urgent talks between Ministry of Justice officials and chief constables are under way to use hundreds more police cells as emergency prison accommodation as the jail crisis intensifies.Prisoner numbers in England and Wales hit a new record high of 80,977 last Friday, with 439 prisoners "locked out" in emergency police and court cells, and ministers fear tonight will see a new pinch point.The Prison Service has been adamant it will not allow the crisis to be resolved by "trebling up" - increasing the number of prisoners in each cell. Tony Blair has ruled out an executive release programme and ministers are desperately trying to find spare accommodation in police stations and courts. "Prevarication is the name of the game," said a Whitehall source.A special agreement has already been reached with the court service for six centres to be used, in Bristol, Cardiff, Mansfield, Ashton-under-Lyne, west London magistrates and the inner London crown court. The ministry is trying to negotiate for two more court centres to be used for prisoners who are now in effect queueing to get into jail.The Home Office originally struck an agreement last October with the police to use 400 of the estimated 900 police cells in England and Wales as emergency prison accommodation. Although a temporary measure, they have been in almost constant use since then and the police are becoming frustrated at a use of resources that does nothing to meet their crime reduction targets. Now the National Offender Management Service, which is responsible for the prison and probation services, has started urgent negotiations to use hundreds more as a stop-gap.A spokeswoman for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: "We are in discussions. They have asked us and we are trying to help and are willing to help."At the same time the Prison Service has issued instructions that all inmates serving less than four years should be considered for a move to open prisons, where the population pressure is less acute, for the final 56 days of their sentences.Prison governors say they want urgent talks with ministers to discuss the crisis: "We seem to have exhausted all available options. Temporary facilities are slowly becoming permanent and still we have no idea what the long-term game plan is for the problem."The chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, last week warned that deaths in prison were now running at two a week because the increasing use of emergency police cells meant that there were no first-night support services for first-time prisoners in police stations. Although prisoners are supposed to spend a maximum of one night in such accommodation, evidence is emerging that some spend more than three nights there as prison vans circle the country trying to find a spare prison bed.
