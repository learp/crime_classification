A new doctor has taken over as a replacement for the serial killer Harold Shipman, but not before Shipman's family stripped his former surgery of computers, telephones, desks and chairs.Amy Cumming has been appointed as a permanent replacement for Shipman at the surgery in Market Street, Hyde, Cheshire, where he killed at least three patients with injections of diamorphine. She is working along with Amir Hannan to treat the 3,000 patients on Shipman's list. The practice has been run by locum doctors since Shipman was arrested in 1998. Dr Cumming said they faced problems after Shipman's children stripped the building of furniture at the weekend. "The family had left the furnishings while the locums were at the surgery, but decided to come and get the stuff at the weekend," she said. "They did take everything and we only had a day to replace everything, which was a headache." She said she regarded her job as a major challenge - but one she was looking forward to. "It is going to be a good practice, a smoothly run practice, and we are going to regain the trust and confidence of the patients as far as we can," she said. A public inquiry into Shipman's crimes will be held later this year.
