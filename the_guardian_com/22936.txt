This morning's press conference, in which Lord Woolf presented his report on BAE's "ethics", was an uncomfortable affair.The 75-year-old former lord chief justice bridled visibly when asked by the Economist about the £6,000-a-day BAE paid him to lead what is essentially a public relations exercise on behalf of the arms company."Have I been influenced by the amount of money?" he said. "I don't deserve to be approached on that basis." The report had taken him and his panel "nine months of hard work", he argued.Woolf also snapped, "No, I don't!" when asked whether he thought it was inappropriate for a former lord chief justice to be reporting on a company that his legal colleague, Lord Justice Moses, had recently criticised in a landmark judgment for trying to interfere with the rule of law.The text of Woolf's report emerged today as a somewhat fact-free zone. To every question about what BAE may have actually done, by way of using dodgy agents, paying inflated commissions, setting up secret offshore subsidiaries or simply paying huge bribes, Woolf's answer was the same: "We weren't given the job of looking at the past."This made the report's lists of future recommended good practice seem rather hollow. In the US, companies that hope for leniency from department of justice corruption probes are generally required to conduct searching internal inquiries, identify culprits, and make full confessions.And it is difficult to imagine how Woolf would have reacted in his former judicial role if a suspected felon had stood up in the dock and asked to be let off on the grounds that "the future is much more important than the past".Yet those were his words about BAE today, although the company continues to face unresolved criminal investigations in London, Washington, Dar es Salaam, Bucharest, Prague, Berne, Budapest and Johannesburg, over continuing multimillion-pound arms contracts.What Woolf did succeed in doing today with his report was to confirm that BAE's reputation currently stinks – largely, though he did not say so, thanks to the investigative digging of this newspaper and other media organizations throughout the world.He wrote: "While concerns regarding national security are unavoidable in many of its activities, this has led to a greater culture of secrecy on the part of the company than is necessary or desirable."He went on: "The company has continued to suffer reputational damage in respect of its business ethics. The damage flows directly from what is alleged to have happened in earlier years."Whether and to what extent any of these allegations are justified, the fact is that many of the external interested parties with whom the committee spoke still perceive the company to have been overly secretive, defensive, unwilling to explain its actions and at best lukewarm to the challenge of dealing with the major reputational issues affecting the company and industry. There is scepticism as to what extent the company has left its legacy problems behind."This is the price BAE has paid, it would appear from Woolf, for the company's apparent success at the time in getting the British police off its back, with the help of the then-prime minister, Tony Blair.When the Serious Fraud Office inquiry was called off last year on grounds of "national security", that was what led to Moses' ringing judgment denouncing the "abject surrender" of the rule of law.Critics are bound to think Woolf's own reputation as a practitioner of the rule of law has now also paid a price.
