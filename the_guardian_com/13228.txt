Metropolitan police handling of a harassment complaint from a young father, who was later shot dead, appeared to be "unacceptable", a senior officer conceded today.Peter Woodhams, a 22-year-old satellite television engineer, died near his home in Canning Town, East London, just minutes after a confrontation with a group of youths outside shops on August 21.He had gone to the police in January after being slashed with a knife, claiming he was being harassed by a gang.The deputy commissioner, Paul Stephenson, told a committee meeting of the Metropolitan police authority today that, based on initial reports, it appeared the police response to the stabbing had been "unacceptable".He said he did not want to prejudice an Independent Police Complaints Commission inquiry into how Metropolitan police officers investigated the knife attack in January.He told the committee that his force had ordered a review of all outstanding investigations into assaults resulting in grievous bodily harm across London. In the borough of Newham, where the murder took place, a review of all unsolved assaults was already under way, he added."Based on what we have seen thus far there are obviously some very serious concerns that need proper investigation."Mr Woodhams' family have said he was stabbed by a gang of youths in January after he confronted them for throwing a rock at his car. The man's fiancee, Jane Bowden, said she called the police every day for five weeks after the stabbing, but officers failed to catch his attackers.Mr Woodhams' family released a graphic photo of his injuries from the January attack, showing the serious knife wounds to his face.Scotland Yard has already publicly apologised to the family for "any hurt" caused by the way police investigated the knife attack.A 14-year-old boy arrested in connection with the fatal shooting has since been released on bail.
