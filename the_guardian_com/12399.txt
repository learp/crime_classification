   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest A man has been arrested in Cambridgeshire by police hunting for the protester at Wednesday's anti-fees march who threw a fire extinguisher from a roof at police officers on the ground below.The fire extinguisher was hurled from the roof after protesters swarmed into Millbank Tower, the Westminster building that houses the Tory party HQ.The incident, which police say could have led to the death of an officer, was caught on video.The man, 23, who is understood to be a student from Reading, was arrested by the Cambridgeshire force at the request of Metropolitan police.He was being held at Parkside police station in Cambridge, a police spokeswoman said.In a statement the Metropolitan police said: "Police in Cambridgeshire, on behalf of the Metropolitan police service, have arrested a 23-year-old man on suspicion of violent disorder on Wednesday 10 November."He is in custody at a Cambridgeshire police station. This arrest follows an investigation into public disorder on Wednesday 10 November where a fire extinguisher was thrown from the roof of Millbank Tower."Last night police said the man had been released on police bail.Today a man claiming to be a territorial support group (TSG) officer told the BBC how the metal object narrowly missed him: "It landed right behind me â€“ literally no more than six inches," he said."I think [had it hit me] somebody would have been visiting my wife and children and saying I was either dead or very seriously injured, the height that was dropped from, a solid piece of metal. I believe it took chips out of the concrete paving behind us as well."After the incident the crowd turned against those on the roof, with chants of: "Stop throwing shit". Met police assistant commissioner Chris Allison said the empty canister went down the back of the helmet of one territorial support group officer and grazed the knees of another: "The fire extinguisher concerned went very close to two territorial support group officers. Clearly that is a very serious offence and we are attempting to bring the person who did that to justice."Paul McKeever, the chair of the Police Federation, said whoever threw the fire extinguisher should be charged with attempted murder.today the Met revealed 10 of the 54 people arrested during sprawling outbreaks of disorder were aged under 18 and most of the others were students aged between 18 and 26, including 33 males and 21 females. Activist websites have published instructions to those who fear they may be identified and arrested in the aftermath of the violence.
