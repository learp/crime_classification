The parents of Rhys Jones were in court yesterday to watch as the teenager accused of their son's murder eight months ago made his first appearance. Melanie Jones, wearing a locket containing a photograph of her 11-year-old son, bowed her head and wept as she came face to face with the accused.The 17-year-old, standing alone in the dock, appeared bewildered. He spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is accused of shooting the 11-year-old in the neck in the car park of the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth Park, Liverpool, on August 22 last year. No plea was entered. He will appear, possibly by videolink, next Friday at a youth court.The accused, dressed in a black hooded tracksuit and with cropped brown hair, was flanked by two security guards. He spoke with a strong Liverpool accent. His mother sat with the boy's solicitor.A 16-year-old boy was then charged with assisting an offender, providing the alleged killer with a false alibi and hiding the murder weapon. He was also charged with being in possession of a Smith and Wesson .55 revolver, ammunition and a replica 8mm pistol. He was remanded to detention.Another 16-year-old, charged with assisting an offender, was accused of disposing of the murder weapon, clothing and a bicycle used in the killing. He was remanded to secure local authority accommodation after Merseyside's youth offending team deemed him to be vulnerable. A fourth boy, 17, appeared charged with assisting an offender by helping dispose of the murder weapon and clothing.Two adults later appeared on related charges. Melvyn Coy, 24, of West Derby, Liverpool, and Gary Kayes, 25, of West Derby, were remanded in custody.
