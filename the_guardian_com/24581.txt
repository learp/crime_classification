An eight-year-old girl alleged to have been sexually assaulted by two 10-year-olds told the Old Bailey today that the boys did not rape her.She said she had lied to her mother because she had been "naughty" and was worried she would not get any sweets.The girl was giving evidence over two days on a video screen. In a series of questions, she was asked if any parts of her body had been penetrated by the boys. She replied each time: "No."Later, she maintained that touching had taken place but the judge brought her ordeal to an end after saying she was exhausted. Mr Justice Saunders told her: "No one is suggesting you have done anything wrong â€“ and I am the judge."The prosecution allege the boys took the girl to the third floor of a block of flats in Hayes, west London, then a nearby bin shed and into some bushes in order to find a "sufficiently secluded spot", before assaulting her in October last year.The pair, now 11 and 10, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, deny two charges each of rape and two charges each of attempted rape of a child under 13.In cross-examination by defence counsel, the girl admitted that she had voluntarily been playing with the boys. She had pulled her own underwear down while the boys exposed themselves to her. Linda Strudwick, defending the older boy, asked her: "Did you ever tell your mum it was not you but it was [the boys] who took your knickers down? You didn't want your mum to think you had been naughty?"The girl replied: "Yeah."The judge asked what the girl had been worried about and she replied: "No sweets if it [sic] found out I had been naughty."The trial was adjourned until tomorrow and the girl was told she would not have to return.
