The mother of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler sobbed as she told a jury she was driven to the brink of insanity and was desperate to recall sightings of her daughter on the day she went missing.Sally Dowler, 51, a maths teacher at Milly's Weybridge school, begged to be hypnotised to see if she could recall any crucial details of her drive home to Walton-on-Thames on the day her daughter vanished.At one stage, two months after 13-year-old Milly went missing while walking home from school, her mother thought she could recall her with a "group of boys" at a road junction in Walton."I was going over and over and over the minutiae of detail. I was just driving myself mad trying to recall something," she said.After a sleepless night she rang police to say she might have caught a "fleeting glimpse" of Milly with a group of boys in her rearview mirror, and made three requests to be hypnotised to see if she was "imagining" it. "She is desperate to know if she saw her daughter," stated a police report at the time."I honestly felt on the brink of insanity at that stage," she told the jury, revealing she had suffered a nervous breakdown after Milly's disappearance and murder.Dowler was giving evidence in the trial of Levi Bellfield, 43, a former club doorman and wheel clamper who denies the kidnap and murder of Milly on 21 March 2002 and the attempted abduction of Rachel Cowles, then 11, the previous day.After an hour of cross-examination at the Old Bailey, she collapsed into the arms of her husband Robert, 59, and was helped from the court.Earlier she was asked about poems and letters written by Milly, found in a chest in her bedroom, in which she spoke of being unhappy, of running away, and her belief her parents loved her sister Gemma more than her. "It wasn't true at all," Sally Dowler sobbed.After the discovery of Milly's letters, she told her brother: "I have got a lovely daughter who has gone missing. Now I seem to have a daughter who led a double life. I can't believe she wrote that letter."Milly had not threatened suicide or running away, she said. She was not "dark and depressive", though there had been issues, including bullying at school and teenage girls often poured such thoughts into diaries, she added.She was asked what effect Milly finding a pornographic bondage magazine in her father's bedroom drawer may have had on their daughter.Dowler told police at the time she had noticed "a slight change at first, and after a while things went back to normal".She agreed Milly had the username "sexmeslow" as a chatroom logon, and she had told her to change it.The trial continues.
