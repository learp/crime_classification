Government plans to strengthen the failed agency charged with sequestering the ill-gotten gains of gangsters will leave criminals "laughing into their champagne glasses", Edward Leigh, the Conservative chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said today.He was commenting on a highly critical report from parliament's financial watchdog, the National Audit Office, which warns that the Asset Recovery Agency is set to lose even more taxpayers' money in fruitless searches for criminals' assets.Last month, anticipating the report, the government announced that the agency - which has spent £65m to recover £23m - was to be merged with the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) to strengthen its role.But today's auditor's report casts doubt on whether the agency will recover more than it spends before 2010 and reveals serious shortcomings in its organisation.Mr Leigh said: "It wouldn't be surprising if some criminals were to develop a 'they can't catch up with me' mentality given the Assets Recovery Agency's record.... The criminal fraternity must be lying back on their sun loungers laughing into their champagne glasses at the mess those trying to catch up with them are in."The agency was recently rebadged, but, without taking serious measures to get to the heart of its difficulties, such cosmetic surgery will bring little hope of a greater proportion of criminals' ill-gotten gains ever being recovered."According to the report, since the agency was set up by Tony Blair in 2003 to hit criminals hard "where it hurts most: in their pockets", it has investigated 700 cases but only managed to recover assets in 52. Auditors found that the agency kept no central record of cases referred to them by police forces and other agencies, and had a staff of turnover of 25% in the last year, rising to 50% among trained lawyers. One in three people who had been trained quit their jobs while 90% of the financial investigators had not completed the professional training they needed to keep their accreditation for doing the job.The agency also spent large sums of money - some 30% of its budget in a recent nine-month period - on employing receivers to chase assets owned by criminals.One case has already cost £1m to pursue assets worth £1.5m and seven cases have already led to receivers' bills totalling £3.5m to recover £7m.The agency's work was also hampered by a lack of confidence in its role by other organisations. Four police forces, 450 local councils and 128 trading standards offices have not referred a single case to the agency. Other agencies referred work but got little back in seized assets. The Police Service of Northern Ireland referred 99 cases but has only received money back in nine cases, netting £1.4m.Trading standards offices had referred 108 cases but only received money back from four cases totalling £200,000.The agency had more success in obtaining freezing orders on criminals' assets than getting money back.
