Organised criminal gangs are trading "sucker lists" with the personal details of several hundred thousand Britons considered susceptible to fraud, according to the director general of the Serious Organised Crime Agency.Bill Hughes warned that syndicates are increasingly moving into scam rackets by exchanging or selling the names and addresses of people deemed vulnerable to conmen.He said the sophisticated gangs are sending out vast amounts of scam mail, offering instant riches, in a ploy to tempt a reply. Those who respond, usually the elderly and poor, are being placed on a growing list of individuals ranked according to their perceived vulnerability. Victims can then receive up to 100 scam letters a day with some selling their homes to keep up with the demands of conmen – who are described as intelligent, devious and intimidating. Hughes said: "People are being suckered into a delusional world where they think these people are helping them. Some are receiving four sackloads of junk mail a day aimed at taking money off them."One scam letter scheme disrupted by Soca in April could have netted an estimated £35m a year. Officers recovered cheques from 22,000 people at a Somerset address used as a front by the fraudsters. Police believe the recession has boosted the growth of scam letters, which are often made to look like important legal documents."Lots of people are on the sucker list. Criminal gangs build them up and focus on particular individuals or types. If you respond, they can then bombard you," Hughes said.
