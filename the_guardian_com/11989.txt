A man and a boy were found guilty today of shouting "shocking and disgusting" homophobic chants at the Portsmouth defender Sol Campbell during a football match.Ian Trow, 42, of Deanshanger, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, and a 14-year-old had pleaded not guilty at Portsmouth magistrates court to indecent chanting. The charges relate to chants made at Campbell during a match against Tottenham Hotspur at Fratton Park, Portsmouth, on 28 September last year.After a three-hour trial, Georgette Holbrook, chairwoman of the panel, found the two defendants had chanted: "Come on gay boy, that's my gay boy." She said: "We find that the words used were in extremely bad taste, they were inappropriate, shocking and disgusting, and as such they were indecent."Sophie Stevens, prosecuting, said: "The police and members of the public considered there was significant abuse from the travelling Tottenham supporters, abuse above what is, perhaps wrongly, accepted at a football match."The magistrates were shown footage recorded by police showing Tottenham fans at the match.Angie Cunningham, defending, said the video footage was examined by a professional lip reader who said the youth, who was 13 at the time, could be seen pointing and shouting: "Come on gay boy, that's my gay boy."She added that Trow could only be seen saying the words: "Come on, that's my gay."But the magistrates ruled that Trow had said the same words as the boy. The pair were banned from attending football matches in Britain for three years.Ms Cunningham said it could not be assumed that the two defendants joined in other chants heard at the match. "They passionately and wholeheartedly believed their behaviour and language didn't overstep the mark of what is acceptable behaviour and language at a football match."The video footage showed other chants shouted by up to 2,500 fans, including: "Sol, Sol, wherever you may be, Not long now until lunacy, We won't give a fuck if you are hanging from a tree,"; "Sol's a wanker"; and other abuse.In a statement read to the court, Campbell said: "I felt absolutely disgusted at this and I didn't react because of my profile and I feared I might make the situation worse and cause problems."I felt totally victimised and helpless by the abuse I received on this day. It has had an effect on me personally and I do not want it to continue. I support the police in their action."Following the match Hampshire police released images of 16 people wanted in connection with the chants.Eleven were arrested and in January four pleaded guilty. They were sentenced to a three-year football ban and fines.Three men and two 15-year-old boys have been given police cautions, according to the Crown Prosecution Service. Cases of racist chanting had been prosecuted before but these were the first cases of indecent chanting brought to the courts, the CPS said.
