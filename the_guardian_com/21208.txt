The summer riots across the UK last year were "made worse" by rolling TV news channels and social media such as Twitter and Facebook, according to an independent panel set up by the government to examine the roots of the unrest.In a report published on Tuesday, the Riots Communities and Victims Panel said social networking and TV footage of police officers watching people "loot at will" helped fuel the disorder in London and other UK cities.However, the expert panel warned against knee-jerk plans to shut down social networks in time of public unrest, concluding that "viral silence may have as many dangers as viral noise".The role of online networks – such as Twitter, Facebook and BlackBerry Messenger – came under the spotlight from the government and the former acting head of Scotland Yard in August after they were said to be a key tool for rioters to organise the unrest.The panel, which visited 21 communities and interviewed thousands of people affected by the riots, concluded that there was "no question" that rioters were aided by the existence of social media."From the evidence around the August riots and from what people have subsequently told us, it seems clear to us that the spread of rioting was made worse both by televised images of police apparently watching people cause damage and loot at will, and by the ability of social media to bring together determined people to act collectively," the panel said.The panel of four experts, chaired by Darra Singh, said many people felt that 24-hour news coverage on BBC News and Sky News exaggerated the extent of rioting in their area, and helped "make rioting a self-fulfilling prophecy" by inadvertently directing rioters to trouble hotspots.Unsubstantiated rumours spread by the breaking news tickers of major news outlets may also have encouraged more rioting, the panel said.On the role of social networks, the panel concluded that rioters were aided by instant messaging services but warned against plans to shut down websites such as Twitter and Facebook. They pointed out that the UK has pledged support for the open use of social media during the Arab spring uprising across the Middle East."Mobile communications technology is continually evolving and new developments may benefit the police and authorities rather than rioters," the panel concluded. They added that some mobile networks have installed systems to detect crowds and the direction they are moving in so they can manage congestion."In the future, it may be possible to use cell congestion monitoring as a tool to tackle rioting," the report found. "What is clear from the riots is that there is no simple 'switch off' solution. Viral silence may have as many dangers as viral noise."A study by the Guardian and the London School of Economics last year, based on interviews with 270 rioters and an analysis of 2.6m riot-related tweets, found that social media was not used by rioters to incite or organise the disturbances.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
