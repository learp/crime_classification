A former financial adviser is starting a jail sentence for driving down a motorway in the wrong direction for 23 miles while drunk.Mother-of-three Deborah Hunt was imprisoned for nine months for heading in the wrong direction along the fast lane of the M5 in the dark, dodging oncoming vehicles.Hunt was an alcoholic and suffering from stress brought on by the loss of her job and an ongoing custody battle over her children.She wept in the dock at Bristol crown court as Judge Mark Horton said he would be failing in his public duty if he did not jail her for so serious an offence.The court heard Hunt, 43, joined the M5 in Somerset at junction 24 in a Peugeot 806. She briefly headed south at 11pm at night before realising she wanted to travel north.Rather than continuing to the next junction and correcting her mistake, she did a U-turn from the slow lane to the fast lane and started driving north.Terrified motorists made at least 10 calls to police, who finally caught up with Hunt almost three junctions after she had joined the motorway.Hunt then performed another U-turn from the fast lane to the hard shoulder before coming to a halt.When officers reached her she was "strongly smelling" of alcohol and apparently trying to restart her engine.The judge said it was "unbelievably fortunate" no one had been killed or injured.He told her: "You took control of the most dangerous weapon placed in the hands of members of the public in this country: a motor vehicle."You did so when you were drunk, two and a half times the legal limit. You drove for something in excess of 20 miles on the wrong side of the road, causing terror in members of the public lawfully using the motorway to travel in the right direction."You risked causing massive loss of life and huge destruction of property."You suffer from a severe illness. Alcoholism is a severe illness. It is tragic in one sense that society has forgotten, in its obsession with the damage caused by drugs, how much more damage is caused by alcohol."It is clear that the combination of the stress and alcoholism you have suffered created an extremely dangerous position, culminating in this offence."The court was told she must have been travelling for at least 20 minutes on the wrong carriageway before she stopped the car and was not even insured to drive the vehicle.John Dyer, prosecuting, told the court that police believe she had only stopped because she had run out of fuel, though Hunt disputes this.Nigel Askham, defending, said her recollection of events was "hazy".He said: "She cannot say why it is that she was driving up the wrong side of the motorway. It was a ridiculous piece of driving which, in the cold light of day, she has to acknowledge."He told the court Hunt, who had points on her licence for two previous speeding offences, had been out of work since being made redundant in May last year. He said she had a long history of alcohol abuse and is going through acrimonious court proceedings with her former partner over custody of their three children, aged 15, nine and three.The judge jailed Hunt her for seven months for dangerous driving and a further two for drink-driving. She was also banned from driving for 15 months.Under new legislation, the judge is also recommending that she be classified as having a "drink-induced disability" that would mean she would have to prove she was fit to go back on to the roads.Superintendent Ian Smith, of Avon and Somerset police's roads policing unit, said: "Deborah Hunt was lucky not to have killed someone or herself."Drink-driving is in itself an inherently dangerous act but to drive on a motorway contrary to the flow of traffic is an outrageously perilous act that could have resulted in the most catastrophic of consequences."The message is clear: we will be relentless in bringing offenders to justice and it is likely you will face not only a driving ban but a prison sentence."Hunt, of Langport, Somerset, admitted dangerous driving, driving with excess alcohol and driving without insurance on July 14 this year.
