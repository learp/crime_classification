The legal team representing the family of peace activist Tom Hurndall are to be given access to evidence that led to an Israeli soldier being charged with his manslaughter.Relatives hailed the move as significant, as their lawyers will now be able to decide whether anyone else should be indicted, or the manslaughter charge be changed to murder. The trial of Sergeant Idier Wahid Taysir, who denies shooting the 22-year-old Manchester Metropolitan University student in the head during an army operation in the Gaza Strip in April 2003, is due to resume today. Mr Hurndall, of north London, had been shepherding Palestinian children to safety at a checkpoint in Rafah refugee camp when he was shot. Sgt Taysir was arrested in December and charged with intent to cause injury. The charge was upgraded to manslaughter when Mr Hurndall died in January. The family say that the prosecution denied them access to evidence, so they lodged a petition with the supreme court. The prosecution then made an offer, which was accepted, of access to documents but only for the legal team. Carl Arrindell, for the Tom Hurndall Foundation, said: "The implications of getting access to this evidence are substantial. We took this to the supreme court when we discovered that promises from the Israeli government of transparency were ill founded." He said lawyers would want to establish if any systemic causes led to the shooting, and if responsibility for the death lies higher up the chain of command.
