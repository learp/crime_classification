Police forces across Britain have reopened a series of unsolved murder cases involving young women after an itinerant handyman was convicted today of raping and killing a schoolgirl who went missing 17 years ago.Peter Tobin, 62, was given a life sentence for murder after a jury found him guilty of abducting, raping and murdering Vicky Hamilton, 15, who disappeared in the centre of Bathgate, near Edinburgh, in February 1991. Her body was dug up in the back garden of Tobin's former home in Margate, Kent, last year.Detectives are understood to be re-examining at least four further cases involving missing girls and women after drawing up a detailed profile of Tobin's life and movements since he was born near Paisley, Renfrewshire, in 1946.Detective Superintendent David Swindle, from Strathclyde police, said Tobin had travelled "extensively" across Britain during his life, and police were working on "any potential links between Tobin's movements and outstanding missing females or victims of crime".The senior detective said there were no current plans to search houses, "but these options will be considered should the intelligence and evidence warrant it".Detective Chief Superintendent Malcolm Graham, the head of CID at Lothian and Borders police, told reporters before Tobin's conviction that police across the UK were re-examining old and unsolved cases. There had been "information sharing with a variety of other forces throughout the UK," he said. Graham said there would be "further joint work between police forces across the UK" to establish whether Peter Tobin had committed any other crimes."Although the inquiries are potentially in progress in terms of checking unsolved cases or missing persons who have not been found, it is my expectation that we will begin that work more overtly and in earnest after the conclusion of this case," he said. Tobin is already serving life for the brutal rape and murder of Angelika Kluk, a Polish student. Her body was discovered in September 2006, bound and gagged under the floor of a Catholic church in Glasgow where Tobin had been working as a handyman under an assumed name.The jury in Dundee took less than two and a half hours to deliver its guilty verdict today. This was greeted with cries of "yes" from Vicky's family and friends. Her father, Michael, shouted "Rot in hell" as the judge, Lord Emslie, sentenced Tobin to a minimum of 30 years in jail.Lord Emslie told Tobin he was guilty of a "truly evil" crime: "Yet again, you have shown yourself to be unfit to live in a decent society," he said."It is hard for me to convey the loathing and revulsion that ordinary people will feel for what you have done. You already have an appalling record of convictions for sexual and violent crimes."Abducting and killing a child on her way home from a happy weekend with her sister and then desecrating her body must rank among the most evil and horrific acts that any human being could commit."Tobin was also convicted in 1994 of raping and sexually assaulting two girls, aged 14 and 15, at his flat in Havant, Hampshire, after he drugged them with the sedative amitriptyline - the same drug found in Vicky's remains - and gave them alcohol.In a joint statement read out by her sister Lindsay Brown, Vicky's family thanked the jury, prosecutors and police. "Vicky was much more than a girl who was abducted and killed by a stranger, or the girl on a 'missing' poster. Our sister was a warm, clever, generous girl who shared many happy years with us."We will always remember Vicky as she lived, not as she died."Hamilton's dismembered body was recovered, wrapped in layers of plastic bags, in two separate portions from a carefully dug pit in the back garden of Tobin's former home in Margate, Kent, in November last year after Lothian and Borders police uncovered DNA evidence linking him to the teenager's disappearance.Forensic tests on Hamilton's purse, which was found in Edinburgh soon after she disappeared, disclosed that Tobin's son, then aged three, appeared to have bitten the purse while he was staying with his father in Bathgate. Further tests on a knife hidden in the attic of the house in Bathgate, found after police searched the property last year, detected a fragment of human tissue belonging to Vicky. Four of Tobin's fingerprints were then found on one of the plastic bags covering her remains in Margate, and partial DNA fragments similar to Tobin's were detected on her body.Tobin had denied all the charges, claiming he had been in Portsmouth on the day Hamilton disappeared. His defence advocate, Donald Findlay QC, told the jury there was "not one solitary scrap" of evidence that Tobin had met, abducted or killed Hamilton.
