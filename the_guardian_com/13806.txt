Sir Paul Stephenson will make a huge error if over the course of the next three weeks he decides to abolish the Metropolltian police's specialist unit aimed at cracking down on human trafficking, which was threatened with closure last year due to a lack of funding. It takes years of training to develop the necessary skills and expertise to help and support the often scared, vulnerable and misled victims of human trafficking. Specialist policing of this crime is essential in the same way it is required with all other major crimes, such as murder, anti-terrorism and child abuse, which all have their own unit.To demote the issue of human trafficking, when it is recognised by Interpol as the third largest crime after drugs and arms trafficking, shows not only contempt for the victims of this horrific crime but also for the members of this police unit who are internationally regarded as an example of good practice.As the MEP for London I am particularly shocked that the Met, which polices the most populous city in the European Union with almost a quarter of a million migrants each year, is shirking its duty to dedicate a specific unit to this international crime. The consequences of doing this will reverberate across the globe.The Met's Human Trafficking Team should not be folding – it should be leading the way for other nations by providing a template they can observe to develop and nurture their own resources.But instead, by threatening to discontinue the work of the Human Trafficking Team, the Met is sending a message to the international community that it doesn't have the resources, time or inclination to fight this crime in any meaningful way.If the proposed changes are given the green light from the commissioner then the unit's work will, in future, be given to ordinary Met officers, creating a lottery system on how victims and perpetrators of this crime are treated.The argument that demand for the service isn't high enough doesn't hold much clout either – in 2007 the Poppy Project, an organisation set up to provide accommodation and support to women who have been trafficked into prostitution, established an outreach team to meet the increased demand for its services. To date more than 700 women have been referred to the project, which the organisation believes to be just the tip of the iceberg because of the particular sensitivities surrounding this crime.The Met's decision is even more preposterous given trafficking is on the rise in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics, which like all other international sporting events is predicted to effect a steep rise in prostitution. Thousands of prostitutes were drawn to Germany during the last World Cup. Munich police confirmed that the number of women in licensed sex clubs went from 500 to 800, an increase of about 63%.It is our responsibility to protect victims of human trafficking – and they can only be protected by the law, and the specialist, knowledgeable dedicated team entrusted to support and manage their welfare.I have launched a petition, which you can sign up to here, and will present it to Stephenson before he makes his decision on the fate of the unit.
