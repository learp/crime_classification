Four police officers were stabbed in broad daylight on Saturday, after being attacked outside a butcher's shop in north-west London.Police had attempted to speak to a man in Kingsbury Road, when he went "berserk", according to witnesses. During the attack, at 8.40am outside the Kingsbury Halal Butchers, one was stabbed in the stomach, another suffered head injuries and a stab wound to the arm, a third was knifed in the leg while a fourth suffered a broken hand. All four were taken to hospital, and their condition is described as stable.A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in custody at a police station.Shopkeepers described how a man was chased down the street by police moments before the stabbings. One described how the man hurled a can of beans at officers in his shop being running away. Another said the attacker then ran into the butcher's and grabbed a knife before stabbing the officers.Shopkeeper Girish Modha said: "A man was shouting at police in a small alleyway next to a hairdresser's shop which neighbours mine. He grabbed a piece of tubing and brandished it at police. He then ran down Kingsbury Road, going into a cash-and-carry shop."I think he threw a brick and smashed a police car window. He then ran round the roundabout and carried on towards the tube station. He went into a butcher's, got a knife and that's when the stabbing took place."A worker at a nearby store said: "After the incident, I saw about eight police officers on top of a man. Ambulances took away the injured policemen and the man was also taken away."
