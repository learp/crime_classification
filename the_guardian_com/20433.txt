A police chief inspector accused of shoplifting makeup was "very clever and deceptive" in her efforts to carry out the alleged theft, a court was told today.Kim Molloy, of Nottinghamshire police, is alleged to have stolen Max Factor Age Renew foundation worth £12.72 from a Tesco Extra store in Nottingham last November.The 45-year-old, who denies a charge of theft, wiped away tears as her trial began at Derby crown court.David Outterside, prosecuting, told the jury Molloy was seen by a CCTV operator testing makeup on her hand in the superstore."Her trolley, at that time, was empty except for some items such as a greetings card and a Bag For Life," he said."She was spotted by a CCTV operator picking up that container of makeup. She tried it on her hand and put it, curiously, in the corner next to her bag."She went to the fruit and veg aisle and picked up some apples and put those apples directly on top of that makeup – we say to conceal it."Once at the tills, Molloy loaded 27 items on to the conveyor belt before moving the trolley to the back of the till, where she began packing her items into bags.The court was shown footage of Molloy paying for her shopping – a total of £54 – with the makeup still in the corner of the trolley after she had placed one of her full bags on top of it.Outterside said: "We say that what you have just seen is a very clever and deceptive effort on that CCTV footage to steal that container of makeup."Molloy was stopped by a security guard as she left the store. Police were called, and she was arrested about two hours later.The CCTV operator told the court he had decided to watch Molloy's movements because small makeup items were often stolen from the store.Molloy, who is currently suspended from her post, denies theft. The trial continues.
