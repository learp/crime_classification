Police in Leeds have arrested a man over a shooting incident early on Wednesday morning that left a police officer with a serious injuries to her face and neck.West Yorkshire police had launched a manhunt for James Leslie, 37, after what it described as a "shocking" shooting just after 4am in Cardigan Road in the Hyde Park district.The force confirmed it had arrested a 37-year-old man in the nearby Wood Lane in the Headingley area of the city. Police also recovered a gun.A source at the force told the local councillor Neil Walshaw: "We got him."Two uniformed officers, a man and a woman, attended a routine call to a disturbance and were confronted by a man who fired at them.Chief Superintendent Paul Money said the female officer had suffered "serious" injuries to her face, neck and right hand."Her condition is described as poorly but stable and not life-threatening," he said."Her male colleague was uninjured but thankfully was able to provide immediate care and remove the injured officer from harm's way and also summon assistance from other officers."Money added: "This morning, I have spoken and met with the officer's family at the hospital in Leeds and I have reassured them that everything possible is being and will be done to support the officer."Assistant Chief Constable Geoff Dodd said the arrest was made at 10.10am on Wood Lane, following a call from a member of the public who had spotted a man fitting Leslie's description."Any potential risk to the public has been removed. We are very grateful to members of the public who rang in with information this morning."It is right to say that incidents where police officers face threat from firearms are thankfully very rare but that does not lessen the shocking impact when an officer is injured in such a way."Ash Elliott, project manager at a translation company on Wood Lane, heard the arrest unfold and witnessed the aftermath."We were probably 200 yards away from where they arrested him," he told the Guardian. "It was very dramatic. It was like something out of a film. We heard a number of police shouting at the suspect to get down on the ground, three or four times. There were a number of dogs barking, and a yellow and blue police helicopter overhead that had been circling all morning. Then six police cars arrived, maybe 30 seconds to a minute later.""The police were looking downwards so I'm guessing they had him on the floor, but we couldn't see too much because there were so many police."The West Yorkshire police deputy chairman Ned Liddemore condemned what he described as a "cowardly attack", which he said highlighted the dangers police officers face every day.
