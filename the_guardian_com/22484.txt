A judge was criticised yesterday for lifting a curfew on a criminal convicted of attacking a police officer so that he could go abroad on a luxury golfing holiday. Judge Martin Picton allowed roofer Lee Jones to fly to Portugal after being shown a brochure of the resort, even joking that the course was too good for him. "You don't really deserve a golf course of that quality," the judge told Jones.Jones, 24, of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, was given a six-month suspended jail sentence last month and ordered to stay at home between 8pm and 5am for assaulting PC Geoffrey Lloyd.Yesterday his probation officer returned to Gloucester crown court to ask for the curfew to be suspended between May 8 and 13 so that Jones could jet off for the weekend jolly. The officer told the judge: "So far he has complied with all the requirements of the order."Lloyd had intervened after spotting Jones in a street brawl with another man. Jones punched the officer in the face.Jones admitted actual bodily harm and was given a six-month custodial sentence suspended for two years.He was also ordered to abide by a curfew, complete 150 hours' community work and pay Â£750 compensation to Lloyd.The probation service said it made the application because Jones already had the trip booked before he was sentenced. Speaking at his home, Jones said: "I didn't say much in court but the judge obviously decided to give me a chance, which was really good of him. I didn't expect that at all. I'm really embarrassed and ashamed about the whole thing. It's not the sort of thing I normally do. I just want to get my community service over with when I get back from holiday."
