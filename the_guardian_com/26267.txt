DNA found in a car belonging to a man accused of murdering five Ipswich sex workers probably came from the blood of one of his alleged victims, a court heard today.Peter Hau, a forensics expert, said seven flecks from the back seat of Steve Wright's Ford Mondeo had not come from any other "background material".Ipswich crown court heard that Hau had initially been unable to identify the origin of the sample. He said after further investigation he was satisfied it had come from the blood of Paula Clennell.Wright, 49, of Ipswich, Suffolk, denies murdering Clennell, 24, Gemma Adams, 25, Tania Nicol, 19, Anneli Alderton, 24, and Annette Nicholls, 29.Their naked bodies were discovered near Ipswich over a 10-day period in December 2006.The trial continues.
