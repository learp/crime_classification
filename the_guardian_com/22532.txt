Liverpool will be the first city in Britain to have what officials describe as a Â£3m US-style "one-stop crime-busting centre" which will deal swiftly with low-level offences, providing targeted support as well as punishment.The visit to the north-west is the first of eight that the home secretary, David Blunkett, and his six ministers will make across the country in the next 30 months. The aim is to gather "feedback from those at the sharp end [who are] delivering policy on the ground". "We have chosen Merseyside for the first visit of our entire team because it is an area seeking innovative ways to tackle difficult social problems," said Mr Blunkett. He went to the Norris Green area in north Liverpool to visit Merseyside police's yellow mobile detention centre with its two glass-doored cells. He moved on to the Norris Green estate, where many houses are burnt out, to have a private meeting with about 20 community representatives. His ministers saw projects relating to their re sponsibilities and then joined Mr Blunkett and Home Office civil servants at the Unity Theatre for a "community discussion". Questions covered policies on drugs, prisons, asylum seekers, race and policing. The community justice centre is to be housed in an as yet unidentified restored building. Plans for pilot centres were announced in a white paper in April following Mr Blunkett's visit to the Red Hook community justice centre in New York. The centre will include a court and offer advice on crime prevention, community projects and schemes to keep youths out of trouble.
