The savage murder of two French students by Dano Sonnex while he was under the parole supervision of the London probation service cannot be blamed on the frontline officers involved.His probation officer in Lewisham was newly qualified, overwhelmed by an impossible caseload of more than 127 offenders, and had little back-up. No other probation officers working in Lewisham had more than two years' experience and her immediate middle manager was himself 'acting up'. The result was a probation service in meltdown with such high sickness rates (averaging 27 days a year), stress and overwork that by last autumn a still unresolved "group grievance" was taken out.The public has a right to expect that the murder of the Chelsea financier John Monkton in 2005 by Damien Hanson and Elliot White while they were under probation supervision would prove a wake-up call to the London probation service. But it now appears that ministers and much of the senior management must have slept through that particular alarm call.Phil Wheatley, the former director general of the prison service who now runs the National Offender Management Service, insists that work with high-risk serious and dangerous offenders in London has improved since the Hanson and White case, with specialist public protection units in every London borough making sure they are a priority.He says the problem in the French student murders case was that Sonnex was wrongly classified as a medium-risk offender and so was dealt with by the general offender management unit in Lewisham, instead of by specialists.But this ignores the central finding of the official inquiry report in the Hanson and White case, which said there had been a "collective failure" in London which stemmed from the fact that they were not dealt with as high-risk offenders, despite previously been assessed as such.What has happened in London since then? There have been at least two major reorganisations, during which up to half the assistant chief probation officers and other managers were made redundant or left. The result has been that the experienced core in London probation — as in so many other public services — is no longer there. Napo, the probation union, claims the situation has been exacerbated by pressure to 'tier down' offenders from high to medium risks and to limit the number of recalls to already full prisons, against a background of one major computer failure after another.David Scott, London's hugely experienced chief probation officer, who resigned in February rather than go through the humiliation of a "performance capability procedure", says that probation now risks becoming a neglected "Cinderella service" unless urgent attention is paid to the workload, over which the service has few effective controls, as well as to its absence from key decision making about policy and resources."For real and sustained change to happen, however, these lessons must be learned at every level, including government," he said when the trial ended.Scott is right to recognise that the sheer volume and complexity of cases and the scale of the operation required in London makes it unlike any other British or European city. But the way forward is not well served by ritualistic political arguments of management failings versus lack of resources. The justice secretary, Jack Straw, responded to the trial by denying that resources were a factor in the failings in the Sonnex case and by claiming that London probation was underspent last year by £3.5m.But that fails to recognise the outstanding liabilities for redundancy payments that hang over from last year and the bigger picture in which an expanding service has failed to keep up with demand. The public recognises that the prisons are full but little light has been shed on the similar crisis that has hit ever expanding workloads in probation. Politicians rightly demand that the courts use community punishments instead of prison whenever possible and for ever more rigorous supervision of offenders in the community, but it has come at a price.The chaos and serious management failures that have come to light in the Sonnex case — whether it is the cancelled risk assessment meeting because a broken printer or the computer system that makes it almost impossible to properly complete a prison recall form — mean that the crisis in the probation service deserves a more serious response than this. Otherwise the public are entitled to ask how many more Lewishams are there in the London probation service?
