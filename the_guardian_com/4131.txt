A convicted killer dubbed the Black Dog Strangler escaped from a secure hospital on Wednesday, police said.Phillip Westwater, 44, fled St Nicholas hospital, in Gosforth, Newcastle, at 10am after asking to go to the toilet.He had been detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act following a pub fight in 1989. He strangled a fellow patient, Derek Williams, at Ashworth hospital, in Liverpool, with his dressing gown cord.He admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, having become convinced his victim had "turned into a black dog".Northumbria police warned the public not to approach Westwater.A spokesman said: "Officers are making inquiries into this individual and any risks he may or may not pose. In the meantime people are asked to contact police on the 999 emergency number if they see him, and [they should not] approach him."The police spokesman added: "At 10am on 2 January, [he] was being escorted in the hospital when he asked to go to the toilets, from where he escaped."Westwater is described as white, 6ft, of slim build, with brown to grey hair. He left his clothes in the lavatory so police have no description of what he was last seen wearing.
