Three men have been arrested on suspicion of murder over the disappearance of 15-year-old Lee Boxell, who vanished 26 years ago.The trio, aged 41, 42 and 78, are also suspected of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and indecency with children, along with a 42-year-old woman, Scotland Yard said.Lee's parents, who have never given up searching for their son, last year launched a fresh appeal for information with the Metropolitan police. A Â£20,000 reward was offered in a push to find the possible killers of the teenager, who would now be 41.Lee was last seen in Sutton High Street on Saturday 10 September 1988, and detectives investigating the disappearance originally believed he had gone to watch a football match at Selhurst Park.But it later emerged that he had never been to the ground before, and was in Sutton High Street at 2.20pm, which would not have left enough time for him to get there for a 3pm kickoff.Police also uncovered evidence that he used to hang out in an outbuilding at St Dunstan's church, known as the shed, a meeting place for teenagers that became a target for sexual predators.After the disappearance, detectives used radar to look for any disturbance in the graves surrounding the shed, and in the force's longest ever forensic archaeological dig, spent a year excavating St Dunstan's churchyard but no evidence was found.Speaking about the case last year, Det Insp John McQuade said: "The shed attracted maybe not vulnerable teenagers but bored teenagers. This was an era without mobile phones or social networking sites, so people would be drawn to a physical location to spend time with their friends."Once you get a group of youngsters in that kind of environment they are going to be vulnerable. Some of them were as young as 12 or 13. There are people out there like Jimmy Savile who will take advantage of people like that."At the time of the appeal Peter Boxell, Lee's father, said: "We, Lee's family, need answers to what happened to Lee. Someone in this community can give us those answers. Please help us bring Lee home."
