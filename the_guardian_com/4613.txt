The Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, has lost a bid to go to the highest court in the land to challenge an order that he can never be released.The serial killer's latest attempt to have his "whole life" tariff overturned was rejected by court of appeal judges. Sutcliffe had wanted to take his case to the supreme court.The lord chief justice, Lord Judge, said on Wednesday that Sutcliffe's application had been rejected. Lord Judge said the court of appeal had refused to certify that a point of general public importance was involved in the appeal.A high court judge ruled last year that Sutcliffe, who killed 13 women, must serve a "whole life" tariff.Sutcliffe, now known as Peter Coonan, was convicted at the Old Bailey in 1981. The former lorry driver from Bradford, West Yorkshire, now 64, received 20 life terms for the murder of 13 women and the attempted murder of others in Yorkshire and Greater Manchester.
