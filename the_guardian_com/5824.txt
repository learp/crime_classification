Nine people were in custody tonight after the sectarian murder of a Catholic youth worker in Northern Ireland. Up to 30 loyalists beat 49-year-old Kevin McDaid after they invaded a Catholic area of Coleraine in County Derry on Sunday evening.The PSNI confirmed that the victim was singled out simply because of his religion. A police spokesman said McDaid had worked with the police to improve community relations in the town.Another man is in a critical condition after he was assaulted by the same gang.The trouble began after the climax of the Scottish Premier League on Sunday.John Dallat, an SDLP assembly member for East Derry, said some of those behind the killing were local members of the Ulster Defence Association. He called for an inquiry into the loyalist terror group's ongoing activities in the Coleraine area.He said the mob arrived in the area and taunted locals after Rangers' 3-0 victory against Dundee United, which secured the Scottish premiership for the Ibrox side. He added that there has been sectarian tension in the neighbourhood since last summer.Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, said that a "sizeable group of loyalists" were responsible for the killing and an earlier assault. "They decided it was a good idea to attack a Catholic area," he said. "I'm dismayed at this and I think it's important that people in the community identify those responsible and co-operate with the police to bring those murderers to justice."The East Londonderry Democratic Unionist MP, Gregory Campbell, expressed his "total condemnation of this killing".Meanwhile the PSNI has said it is treating an earlier assault on a 46-year-old man in Pates Lane as attempted murder.
