Detectives investigating the murder and sexual assault of two young women 20 years ago now have a full DNA profile of their suspected killer thanks to advances in forensic science.Kent police described the development as a major new lead. Last night they appealed for anyone with suspicions about the deaths of Caroline Pierce and Wendy Knell, who were found dead six months apart, to come forward, so that any suspect could be compared with the profile, developed from evidence collected in the initial investigation.The force also used the BBC's Crimewatch to show pictures for the first time of two types of Clarks trainers, one of which they believe may have been worn by the killer. A footprint was found on a blouse at Knell's home.Pierce, 20, and Knell, 26, lived alone in basement bedsit flats in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and worked in the town's Camden Road. Postmortem examinations revealed they had been battered and strangled and police say it is highly likely the murders were linked.Knell's body was found in her Guildford Road bedsit on June 23 1987. Pierce, who lived in Grosvenor Park, was last seen at about midnight on November 24 1987, when she was dropped off by a taxi at her bedsit.She was attacked outside her home and her body was found 40 miles away by a farm worker in a remote dyke near St Mary in the Marsh on Romney Marsh on December 15 that year.Detective Chief Inspector Anne Brittain, who is leading the investigation, said: "With the new DNA profile we can eliminate or implicate anyone in connection with this inquiry. We remain committed to finding Wendy and Caroline's killer and bringing them before the courts."
