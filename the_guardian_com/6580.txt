A jury today found two ambulance workers not guilty of stealing from patients.One of their alleged victims was said to have lost £20 after passing out in his car, and an 88-year-old pensioner claimed he was left £800 poorer while being treated for a suspected heart attack.But ambulance driver Mohammed Ali, 29, of Parkview Road, Neasden, northwest London, and crewmember Michael Chaves, 38, of Redhill Street, Camden, north London, vehemently denied any wrongdoing.The jury of two women and 10 men took approximately four hours to decide the men were telling the truth.They not only cleared them of the two thefts, which were alleged to have taken place in November last year, but also found Ali not guilty of stealing a £3,000 ambulance service monitor.London's Middlesex Guildhall crown court heard that the paramedics allegedly first targeted motorist Kabir Miah.He was carried apparently unconscious into the ambulance where two ten-pound notes were said to have been taken from his wallet.But the defendants said nothing of the sort happened.Mr Chaves said the only reason he removed the patient's wallet was to check his identity.The pair were also accused of striking a second time just hours later. On that occasion their alleged victim was pensioner Thomas Forsythe, who told the court that money he had been saving for his funeral was taken from his wallet.Mr Chaves assured the jury all he did was pick it up after it had fallen from his pocket, and return it.Mr Ali told the court that a monitoring machine discovered by police in his wardrobe had been found by him on a piece of ground opposite the station where he worked.He said he took it home for safekeeping, but then forgot to return it.After the case, Mr Chaves, who wept as he was cleared, said: "I am very happy about it, but there could only be one verdict ... It was a mistake from the beginning."My main aim now is to get my job back with the London Ambulance Service and resume the life I had before all this rubbish."I was sacked in June. We asked them to hold off the decision until after the trial, but the ambulance service thought they were above the law and could sack me anyway."Now we are going to get the best legal team together that we can and get my job back," he added.Mr Ali said the jury's decision had left him "vindicated". He added: "My life has been put on hold for no reason at all apart from a lie."I have had countless sleepless nights which I now hope to put behind me."A London Ambulance Service statement issued after the men were acquitted said the defendants were dismissed for "gross misconduct ... following an internal disciplinary investigation".
