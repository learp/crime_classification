Overcrowded jails are struggling to cope with rising levels of severe mental illness, with nearly two suicides a week and epidemic levels of self-harm, the chief inspector of prisons warned today.Prisons in England and Wales can do little more than "skim the surface of the severity and breadth of mental illness" among their inmates, which last year resulted in 95 suicides and 17,678 incidents of deliberate self-harm, according to the annual review of the chief inspector, Anne Owers. Prison staff resuscitated 228 prisoners who attempted to kill themselves, she reported.The review said that, despite the NHS taking over responsibility for prison healthcare last year, the scale of mental health problems is so great that only inmates with "severe and enduring" illnesses are treated. Meant most mentally disordered prisoners still fail to receive support."In most prisons, there is inadequate provision to look after mentally ill prisoners," the report said. The chief inspector blamed jail overcrowding for the poor care of mentally ill prisoners. The prison population has levelled off at around 75,000 - still 24% over capacity - and is set to rise to 87,000 by 2009, according to the most optimistic estimates from the home office.Other problems identified in the report include:· Insufficient funds and resources to provide prisoners with adequate education, training and other purposeful activities; · Patchy efforts to find prisoners work and housing on their release; · Little if any drug testing carried out at weekends, and scarce treatment for crack and cocaine users.Ms Owers said: "Our prisons are still 24% overcrowded and are operating perilously close to full capacity. They are still recording nearly two self-inflicted deaths a week; they are still discharging prisoners who have been unable to benefit from the education, training and resettlement support they need. The levelling off of the prison population is, in reality, the difference between a manageable crisis and an unmanageable one."The key message of this report is that ours is a prison system that has progressed in many areas, and which is capable of making even more progress. But it is trying to sustain those improvements against an undertow of continuing, unremitting pressure, and an increasingly needy and demanding population."Martin Narey, chief executive of the new National Offender Management Service - which will bring together the prisons and probation services - said that, while the level of prison overcrowding is still high, it has been reduced in recent months.But he said: "We are not complacent and will continue to develop and improve on the areas highlighted in this report."
