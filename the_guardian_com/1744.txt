The health care of prisoners must become a bigger priority both for the prison service and the NHS, according to Martin Narey, director general of the Prison Service.Despite an 18-month partnership between the NHS and the prison service aimed at improving services, Mr Narey said the reality was that few prisoners had seen any real differences.Using typically outspoken language, he said he had seen conditions for some prisoners that were "worse than the kennels in which I leave my dog when I go on holiday".He admitted that improvements were being made. As of last year, new prison medical officers must now have the same qualifications as a GP practising in the community. But qualification levels are still poor across the existing workforce."Healthcare is hugely inadequate in the prison service," he told the NHS Confederation conference in Manchester. "Many of our staff are staff who [the NHS] has got rid of. As they've come down the pecking order, they've come to us."The problems lie with both the prison and health services. "Health care is not seen as a priority by prison governors," he said.But the NHS needed to "wake up" as well. He claimed that the prison service was often picking up failures of the NHS care in the community policy. "For many individuals care in the community is simply care in custody," he said.Huge numbers of prisoners have problems with mental health, substance misuse or personality disorder and represent parts of the population that have been excluded from health care. He said prison offered an opportunity to reach these people, giving the NHS an opportunity to target its services and promote healthier lifestyles.Mr Narey suggested that failure to take this opportunity was costing the NHS enormous sums. "They will be a huge drain on your resources when they come out," he said.
