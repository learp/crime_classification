An 81-year-old woman, once described by a judge as "the original neighbour from hell", was jailed for six months today.Dorothy Evans, of Abergavenny, South Wales, had been convicted of harassment and six breaches of her anti-social behaviour order.Sentencing, Judge Roderick Denyer QC said: "It seems to me, despite your age and despite your infirmities, you have deliberately, for a period going on for 10 years, made life a misery for neighbours."In my view, the consequences of your behaviour must be brought home to you."Evans' barrister, David Webster, had earlier told the court she was "fearful in a way I cannot fully describe" of going to prison.He said that, because of this, the best punishment would be a suspended prison sentence to act as a deterrent and protect her neighbours.An immediate jail term, he said, could make the problem worse."Send her to prison and the deterrent effect of that ultimate sanction will rapidly evaporate," he said."The danger in my submission is she might come out far from reformed and deterred but merely confirmed in her behaviour." Mr Webster added: "She is capable of being a good neighbour. This is a lady who has another side and there are those who have known her a long time who are prepared to speak well of her." He said the source of Evans' dispute was flooding at her home in Park Crescent which was kept under control by constant pumping operations.This prevented her from selling her home, he said, and she blamed this on whoever was living next door.The neighbours in this case were Angela and Roberto Casa.At Evans' trial in February, a jury heard how she breached the Asbo in a number of ways, including shouting abuse, calling Mrs Casa a prostitute and telling her husband to go back to Italy.Evans also told the couple's 13-year-old daughter that she was a witch and that she would cast a spell on the family, and displayed photographs of their home in the window of her garage along with a piece of paper with the word "scum" written on it.And she drew a white chalk mark around Mrs Casa's car, while she was sitting in it outside her home, and started swearing at her through the car window before hitting her with her stick.The judge told her: "Mr and Mrs Casa were eminently decent and reasonable people who did their best to get on with you."You made their life a misery as was apparent both at the trial and in subsequent victim impact statements."You have a long history of offences of this kind: in November 1999, three allegations and convictions of harassment; March 19, 2001, seven instances of harassment involving breach of a restraining order; August 6, 2004, further offences of harassment and breach of a restraining order; and most recently May 18, 2005, harassment for which you were made subject of an Asbo for five years."It's that order you breached when the jury convicted you of these offences." The judge said: "It is absolutely clear you will not change."He sentenced Evans to six months' imprisonment for each of the seven charges, to run concurrently.Evans' daughter, Barbara Thomas, who lives with her and gave evidence in her defence at the trial, was in court for the sentencing.She ran up to the dock in tears as Evans was led down to the cells.
