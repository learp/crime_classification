One of the UK's most-wanted men, who has spent more than 13 years on the run after murdering an off-duty police officer, has been arrested in the Netherlands, police said today.Dutch police arrested 45-year-old James Hurley, who was jailed for life in 1989 after shooting the policeman during a bank robbery in Hertfordshire, on November 9.The police arrested two English-speaking men in a raid. After a "subsequent investigation" they were able to identify one of them as Hurley, Scotland Yard said.The officers were investigating increased energy consumption at an address in The Hague and expected to find a cannabis factory. Instead they found a large quantity of class 'A' drugs.Hurley had been the getaway driver for an armed gang trying to rob a security van outside a Barclays Bank in Hemel Hempstead In April 1988. He shot 27-year-old Frank Mason in the back after the constable tried to grab one of the gang.Hurley escaped in February 1994 while being transferred by bus to Wandsworth prison in south-west London. He and another prisoner threatened a prison officer with a knife.Mason's widow, Jill, said today she was "really pleased to hear the news"."It doesn't bring Francis back, but Hurley needs to serve time for the crime he committed," she said.According to the Met Police wanted notice, Hurley was the only convicted murderer of a police officer in the UK to be on the run.Detective Chief Inspector Paul Maghie of Hertfordshire police said the force "still feels the loss" of Mason, who "selflessly gave his life"."We have been ruthlessly pursuing Hurley for many years and would like to take this opportunity to extend our sincere gratitude to the Dutch police," he added.
