Serco announced yesterday that it had won a government contract to carry out electronic monitoring of offenders. The Hampshire-based support services company said the Home Office had awarded the five-year deal to its wholly owned subsidiary, Premier Custodial Group. The contract is a renewal of a deal that runs out on March 31 and is likely to be worth about Â£100m if the number of offenders stays the same as at present. The monitoring carried out by Premier involves tagging offenders, tracking them and enforcing night-time curfews for a set period. Premier has a central monitoring control centre in Norwich and eight regional offices around the country. It currently delivers monitoring services in two of the four regions across England and Wales. Serco already provides court, immigration, police and prison services for the Home Office. The company's other activities range from conducting school inspections and running public transport systems - such as the Docklands Light Railway in London and Manchester's Metrolink trams - to managing the UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston, Berkshire.
