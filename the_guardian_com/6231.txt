A woman today told a court she was attacked by the alleged murderer of Sally Anne Bowman two decades ago, when he was 17 years old.The woman, who is in her 60s, said that Mark Dixie cornered her in a lift in a block of flats in June 1988 after she had tried to visit Dixie's then partner, Sandra Beckhouse, who had suffered a miscarriage.She told the Old Bailey that Dixie punched her in the face, fracturing her jaw and damaging her eye. She said she feared she would be raped when he choked her and said: "I need it, I need it."He was later arrested, and admitted indecent assault and causing actual bodily harm, the court heard.Dixie, 37, is accused of murdering fashion model Bowman, 18, outside her home in Croydon, south-west London, in September 2005. He denies the charge, claiming he found her corpse and had sex with her only after she had been stabbed by someone else.The woman said she left the block of flats in Plumstead, south-east London, when nobody answered the door at Beckhouse's property. She said Dixie then approached her, telling her that Beckhouse was home.She followed Dixie back into the flat, but when he admitted Beckhouse was not there after all he followed her into the lift and then attacked her, fumbling with his trousers.The woman, who said she had been attacked many years previously, told the court that she convinced Dixie to leave the lift with her and drive to her flat. Instead, she went to her parents' house, and Dixie ran off after she found her father in. Dixie moved to Australia with Beckhouse soon after, and the couple had two children, the court heard.His defence team suggested that the woman had "exaggerated" her evidence to the court.The trial continues.
