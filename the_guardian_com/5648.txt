A mother and daughter were yesterday forced to deny trying to smuggle their dead relative on to a budget flight to Germany, after the 91-year-old was found dead in his wheelchair, wearing a pair of sunglasses, at check-in. In fact, it isn't uncommon to encounter a corpse in flight â€“ as barrister Dan Dovar discovered a few years ago.I was coming back from Kenya to the UK after a long trip. We had a stopover in Khartoum, and were told that the plane needed some attention. Later, from a nearby hanger, we could see a man in a boiler suit sitting on the wing trying to fix the plane with a monkey wrench.Back on the flight, my friends and I decided we deserved an upgrade and went to sit in business class. When I went to the loos at the back I was glad we had moved, because there was a bit of a kerfuffle. A man had died and the cabin crew had just left him in his seat and put a towel over his head. They had moved the two people sitting on either side of him, but the people in front hadn't been moved.In London we had to fill out a form detailing our whereabouts in case he had died of something contagious. But I was never contacted, so I assume it wasn't. And no, I have never flown with that airline again.
