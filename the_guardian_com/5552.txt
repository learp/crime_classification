Terrorism suspects who must be charged or released today after two weeks of questioning have been psychologically abused by police, their solicitor has claimed.The men were arrested in a series of high-profile raids by M15 and anti-terrorism officers and have been held at the top-security Paddington Green police station in London. Mudassar Arani, a solicitor for seven of the nine Muslim men, accused the police of keeping them in solitary confinement for 12 days, and stopping three of the suspects from reading the Qur'an by removing their spectacles. Her criticism came as concern rises in the Muslim community about the handling of anti-terrorism operations. British Muslim groups have pointed out that more than 600 people have been arrested since September 11 2001, but that only 100 have been charged and 14 convicted of terrorist offences. Several cases continue. Four men who were arrested alongside the nine suspects were released without being charged under terrorism laws. Ms Arani said: "These are psychological tricks they are using to crack them. "It's an abuse; detention is not there to psychologically break them. They have been in solitary confinement for 14 days. It is tough to survive that." Ms Arani claimed that only two of the suspects had had specific allegations put to them, including that they were members of al-Qaida. Security sources in Pakistan and the US claim one of the suspects is a senior al-Qaida agent. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "The men are being treated strictly in accordance with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and the Human Rights Act." The chairman of the Council for the Welfare of Muslim Prisoners, Dawud Noiba, said the men had seemed reasonably content with their treatment when he saw them 10 days ago. He was due to see them again last night.
