A hairdresser who helped prepare disguises for the gang that carried out the Â£53m robbery of a Securitas depot in Kent was cleared of all charges relating to the raid today.Michael Demetris, 32, of Bromley, south-east London, admitted helping to make the disguises, which were used in Britain's biggest-ever armed robbery, but said he thought they were for a video game.Jurors at the Old Bailey have yet to reach a verdict in the case of Paul Allen, 30, who is said to have been "at the heart" of the plan to rob the depot in Tonbridge, Kent, in February 2006.Depot manager Colin Dixon and his family were kidnapped by the robbery gang, alleged to have been led by Allen's best friend Lee Murray.Demetris was cleared of charges of conspiracy to kidnap, rob, and possess firearms. Allen, of Chatham, Kent, denies similar charges.During the trial Demetris told the court that Murray, a leading cage fighter and a regular at his salon, had asked him to help with a project to make a video game called Hitman.Demetris worked on the hair of men who later turned out to be involved in the robbery and allowed make-up artist Michelle Hogg, who worked in his salon, to work at home creating face masks.When asked by his counsel, Joel Bennathan QC, whether he ever suspected he was aiding a criminal conspiracy, he replied: "Absolutely not."
