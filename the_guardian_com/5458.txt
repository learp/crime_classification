A 15-year-old boy who tempted a friend into a rubbish-filled enclosed skip, bolted the door and then threw in lighted paper was yesterday given four years' detention for manslaughter .Mr Justice Henriques acknowledged at Newcastle crown court that the victim's mother had written an appeal for mercy but said that there had to be a suitably heavy sentence for such a crime. The boy was convicted of the killing last week, after a jury heard how he had thrown his friend Michael Temperley's mountain bike into the skip outside a pine furniture store in Gateshead to lure him in. As the flames took hold and Michael, 15, screamed for help, the boy and another friend tried to open the skip but the bolt had jammed. The judge turned down a media application for the defendant to be named. He said he wanted him to be able to rebuild his life after finishing his sentence. The tragedy last July was described during the week-long trial as a prank that went wrong, but the judge said the boy had been trying to impress friends.
