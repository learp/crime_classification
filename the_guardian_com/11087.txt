The six Huddersfield players who were arrested in January on allegations of rape have had their bail extended until 16 April.They had initially been bailed until 18 March following an incident at the club's pre-season training camp in Newcastle, but a spokesman for Northumbria police confirmed today: "They have been rebailed until 16 April, and inquiries are ongoing."The six players from the squad were questioned by police in Newcastle after a 22-year-old woman alleged that she was raped in the early hours of 19 January.Huddersfield declined to add to the statement they made following the players' arrest in January, that the club would co-operate fully with the investigation.Northumbria police said then that a 22-year-old woman made an allegation of rape after an incident in Gosforth, Newcastle, but that they would not reveal the name of any player unless charges were made. The team had been staying at the Gosforth Marriott hotel for a team-building exercise and training. The players deny the allegations.The cloud that has been hanging over the club all season will not be lifted for at least another month, although their form has not been adversely affected as the Giants are third in the Super League table.
