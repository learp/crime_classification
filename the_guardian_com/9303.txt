Neighbours of a teenager arrested in Bristol on suspicion of committing terrorism offences will be questioned today as police begin house-to-house inquiries.After the arrest of 19-year-old Andrew Ibrahim on Thursday night, 30 residents of Comb Paddock, a cul-de-sac in Westbury-on-Trym, were evacuated so bomb disposal experts could carry out three controlled explosions.The neighbours returned to their homes yesterday. Officers from Avon and Somerset police want to speak to them about Ibrahim, who they have until Thursday to question.Ibrahim recently moved to the area, and sources say he dramatically changed his appearance over the last few months. The teenager, who once had red, spiky hair and facial piercings, has reportedly grown a long beard and been seen wearing long Muslim robes.The source, who once worked with Ibrahim, said: "He was struggling in life but I had no idea he had become a Muslim before I saw him two weeks ago."I could not believe my eyes. He was dressed in full robes and had a beard. He must have undergone a massive change in identity."Police family liaison officers spoke to Ibrahim's father, Nassif Ibrahim, over the weekend. The consultant pathologist declined to talk to reporters as he returned to the large, detached property in the affluent village of Frenchay, where Andrew once lived.His wife, Victoria, lives a few hundred yards down the road in a luxury apartment, which she shares with another man. She and her son both left the family home at least a year ago.Ibrahim, described by neighbours as heavily built and polite, was arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000. A search of his modern, redbrick terrace home found what was believed to be an explosive device.
