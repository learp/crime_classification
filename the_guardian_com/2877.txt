A Tory council candidate wearing a John Prescott mask was arrested today, after a Labour volunteer was punched and another knocked to the ground during the former deputy prime minister's campaign visit to east London.Martin Coxall, a candidate for East India and Lansbury, was led away by police after a 46-year-old woman was punched and a 61-year-old woman was knocked to the ground at about 2pm .Coxall was one of two men, both dressed in Prescott masks, involved in the incident. Police spoke to the other man but did not arrest him.The two women were campaigning with Prescott for the Labour parliamentary candidate for Poplar and Canning Town, Jim Fitzpatrick.Prescott said on Twitter: "Tory council candidate in Poplar Martin Coxall attacked two women in scuffle trying to get me. Expect this from BNP not Tories."Footage purporting to show Coxall being led away was posted on YouTube. Text accompanying the video said: "Coxall only failed to reach Mr Prescott after being held back by members of the public."Prescott continued his visit afterwards. The Conservative party chairman, Eric Pickles, said he had called for an inquiry into the incident. He sent a message to Prescott on Twitter saying: "Glad you are ok hope no one hurt – I have asked for a party investigation – physical force is unacceptable in politics."A Metropolitan police spokesman said: "Two men were spoken to by police regarding their behaviour – one of them was arrested on suspicion of assault against two women. It is alleged the younger woman was pushed to the ground and the other punched. The man, aged in his 30s, is now in custody at an east London police station."Prescott famously punched a protestor who threw an egg at him while he was campaigning in Rhyl, north Wales in 2001.The punch, thrown by Prescott after the egg hit him on the side of the face earned him the nickname "Two jabs". Craig Evans, who threw the egg, and Prescott were both questioned by police after the incident, but no further action was taken against either individual.
