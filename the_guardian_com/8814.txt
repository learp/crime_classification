Police are talking to children as young as seven to try to turn the next generation away from gun crime, a senior officer revealed yesterday as Scotland Yard launched a provocative campaign to combat shootings in London's black communities.Hard-hitting cinema, poster and radio adverts - featuring chilling images of bloodstains, bullets and victims' faces - will be seen and heard across the capital.The cinema advert, directed by the film-maker Tom Carty, shows youths unwittingly leaving bloody fingerprints over everything they touch, while Jazzy B urges people to tell police what they know or end up with "blood on their hands".The families of seven-year-old Toni-Ann Byfield, shot in Harlesden in September 2003, and Pauline Peart, 25, shot at the wheel of her car in Tottenham in March 2003, have given permission for their loved ones' photographs to be used on huge posters in the city's gun crime hotspots.In the radio advert, 20-year-old Lee Mullings reads a letter from her father, Douglas, describing his life since he was left paralysed last year after being shot in the head by a teenage gunman in Tottenham.Detective Chief Superintendent John Coles, head of Scotland Yard's black gun crime Trident unit, said officers were visiting schools, youth clubs and music events to try to get their message across. "We are looking at kids as young as young as seven, eight, nine, 10 years old in the hope that we can stop them becoming the gunmen or victims of the future," he said at the campaign launch in Brixton yesterday.DCS Coles said Trident was succeeding in driving down gun crime by working closely with communities. There were 162 Trident-related shootings last year and 18 murders in the 12 months to March this year.
