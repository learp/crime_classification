  Francecca Hardwick. Photograph: Leicestershire constabulary/Press AssociationKnown to all as Frankie, the 18-year-old had a learning difficulty, never formally diagnosed, which left her with the mental age of a young child and increasing physical problems, notably double incontinence.When not at her school, Francecca could not be left alone by her mother, and was at times extremely hard to deal with. Increasingly strong, the teenager was prone to outbursts of aggression, sometimes it seems due to frustration at being stuck inside the houseYet the hearing also learned details of Francecca's sense of fun, her joy at jumping in puddles, playing on swings and giving massages. The headteacher of her special school described a much-loved, and much-missed, pupil.
