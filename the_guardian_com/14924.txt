A woman has told the trial of Max Clifford that the PR guru ordered her to perform sex acts on him after telling her she could be the next Jodie Foster.The alleged victim, who gave evidence from behind a screen to protect her identity, said Clifford repeatedly abused her in his car when she was 15.She told jurors that she contemplated suicide after the defendant claimed a photographer had taken a picture of her giving him oral sex.The woman also said she was ordered to "talk dirty" in telephone calls to a man she believed was called Terry Miller, who told her to contact Clifford.The prosecution claims this was a bogus call made by either Clifford himself or someone operating on his behalf.The defendant, wearing a black suit, white shirt and purple tie, shook his head as he listened to her evidence using a hearing loop in the dock at London's Southwark crown court.Clifford, 70, from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of a total of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls. He denies all the charges.The woman said she met Clifford in 1977 while on holiday with her family in Torremolinos, Spain.She claims he impressed her parents and told them he could find her modelling work.Shortly after she got back to the UK, she went to his office near Bond Street in central London, where he told her "you could be the UK version" of American actor Jodie Foster, she said.The woman told the court that, as the meeting progressed, Clifford asked her to take her shirt off and then her bra, which she was reluctant to do.She recalled: "He said he could see my nipples through the lace in the bra. He said 'You are being ridiculous.'"The woman went on: "I was really uncomfortable and felt really nervous and really vulnerable, but I felt stupid because he kept talking and talking and saying 'You're being so childish.'"After believing she "couldn't get out of this situation", she did take her bra off, the court heard. When asked what happened next, she replied: "He made a derogatory comment. He said that, although I was nice, that I wouldn't be able to do topless modelling, which I was really shocked by."I was shocked, the fact he said something horrible to me about my figure, because I had been so brave to take my bra off, and I was shocked he was talking about topless modelling because we had just been talking about me being the UK's Jodie Foster."I was really confused. I didn't know what was going on."The woman recalled that Clifford would drive round to her house in south London, talk to her parents and then take her out in his yellow Jaguar to abuse her.She described him as being "very robotic and controlling" during the abuse."I remember being frightened by his distance, the way he was."It was very cool and without any kind of emotion,' she added. "I was frightened and I felt vulnerable, stupid, but also I believed him, actually, I believed him at that point that that was what I had to do."Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC asked the witness: "For him to trust you?""Yes," she replied.She said she did not report the abuse, which lasted several months."I was just completely at a loss. I didn't know really what was going on and I didn't know how to make it stop. It frightened me," she said.She went on: "The bigger it got there was no chance I could tell anybody about it. I had already missed the chance."When Cottage pressed her on why she did not tell anyone, she said: "It was just so out of my comfort zone to tell anybody else."It felt instinctively wrong and horrible and I felt if I said anything [to] my parents the reaction would be huge, it would be like a bomb going off."She said she feared being "disowned" and added: "I really thought I could end up in a children's home."The woman told the court that she could not stop seeing Clifford because he arranged the meetings and "my parents were looking forward to seeing him".She said Clifford warned her that a photographer had taken a picture of her giving him oral sex."I thought 'My life has ended'," she recalled. "I thought 'Well, whatever happens now, it's huge and it's going to be awful and I'm going to lose everything'."She added: "I said 'I want to kill myself', I thought about killing myself."The woman told jurors she had "a picture in my head" of how she was going to kill herself.She told the court that Clifford took her to a number of venues, including the Playboy Club in Park Lane, to "meet people" to further her career.Cottage asked her: "Did you ever meet anybody that you spoke to assist with a career?"She replied: "No."The woman explained that Clifford told her he needed to "trust" her before the alleged indecent assaults.Recalling what he said, she told the court: "He had to really get to know me, had to really trust me 100%, he had to know me so well that whatever he asked me to do I would do it and he would know I would do it, like he had to get inside my head."He had to know me that well. That was always the precursor to the abuse."The woman told the court that the first time she told anyone about what happened to her was in 1998.When questioned as to why it had taken her so long to break her silence, she told the court she was scared of Clifford and feared "he might try and blackmail me or harm my family. I considered him to be very dangerous."She added: "I was very very frightened of him."The trial continues.
