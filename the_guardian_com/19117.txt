Ninety people were arrested at New Year’s Eve celebrations on the banks of the river Thames in London.The Metropolitan police said a third of those people were detained because of drunken behaviour at the fireworks display, which was ticketed for the first time and attracted 100,000 people. A further 22 arrests were for assault and seven were for sexual offences.The newly introduced restrictions on numbers meant the size of the crowd was down by four-fifths from last year’s half a million.Superintendent Robyn Williams said: “Our advice to the public was to avoid the area unless they had a ticket and they appeared to take this on board as we have seen lower numbers than in previous years.”He said officers and stewards worked hard to keep people safe. “The event passed off safely and appeared to be enjoyed by the crowd.”The police said the arrest figures did not include those made during a protest at Brixton prison under the banner #blacklivesmatter.
