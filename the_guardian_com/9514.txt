The August riots would not have spread from the London to other areas in England had the police response been "more robust" in the capital, an independent report has found.While the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan by Met officers precipitated the initial Tottenham riot, the "sole trigger" for the violent disturbances elsewhere was the perception that police "could not contain" the scale of rioting in London and that "the streets were there for the taking"."Most rioters believed they would be able to loot and damage without being challenged by the police. In the hardest-hit areas they were correct," found the Riots Communities and Victims panelIn its interim report, 5 Days in August, the independent panel, set up by the government in the wake of rioting which left five dead and saw 4,000 peopled arrested, said there was "no single cause" for the disturbances, each having its "own DNA".It estimated that between 13,000 and 15,000 people were "actively involved" in the disturbances between 6-10 August. The final cost of the rioting could be £500m, it said.The report, which makes 11 key recommendations, also warned that without urgent action the riots could happen again.Examining Tottenham, the panel, which has so far visited 17 riot-hit areas and engaged with thousands of people affected, said the police handling of the death of Duggan, and in particular their communication with his family, had been the trigger.Rumours, including one that Duggan had been "assassinated", were "not countered effectively" and exacerbated by the erroneous release of information, later retracted, that there had been an exchange of fire."In this 'information vacuum' unfounded reports via social media could gain currency," said the panel. Social media fanned the rumours and increased the speed with which they spread. The report also pointed to a "fault line running between the IPCC [Independent Police Complaints Commission] and the police in this area".The "perception" that police could not contain the scale of rioting in Tottenham and then across London "went viral", helped by social media and 24-hour rolling media coverage.The authors of the report said they heard "harrowing" stories on visits to areas affected. "Lives were lost. Parents had to carry children out of burning homes, leaving a lifetime of possessions behind to be destroyed," they said. "Shopkeepers lost everything they had built up over many years. The consequences of the riots are still being felt."People in the areas seriously affected had felt "abandoned", as police numbers were not high enough and did not act quickly enough. There was "still much distress and anger" and police needed to rebuild trust.Motivations for joining the riots ranged from "the need for new trainers to a desire to attack society". Some people affected questioned whether "the issue of bankers' bonuses, MPs' expenses, and a lack of personal responsibility, had created a moral vacuum in society"."Stop and search" was cited as a major source of discontent by young black and Asian men, and immediate attention on this issue was needed, said the report."Most disturbing to us was a widespread feeling that some rioters had no hope and nothing to lose," said Darra Singh, the panel's chair. There was an absence of "hopes and dreams" among young people in many of the riot hit areas, the panel added.Three months after the disturbances there were still small businesses "which have yet to receive a penny in compensation for the losses they have experienced", said the report, which was critical of the insurance industry and also of the Riot Damages Act (1886), saying no one interviewed had yet received a payment."On current forecasts, by March 2012 – over six months after the August riots – nine out of 10 of the largest claims will still not have been processed and barely half of people with the smallest claims will have been paid."The panel said these were not "race riots" and most of the people convicted over the disturbances were not gang members. Of the 2,000 brought to court so far, 90% were male, and 74% were 24 and under, with 46% black, 42% white and 7% Asian. There was a link between deprivation and rioting, with 70% of those arrested living in the 30% most deprived areas. Around three-quarters had previous convictions.Rioters split into five categories: organised criminals, often from outside an area targeting specific branded goods and shops; violent criminals, committing arson and violent attacks on police; late night shoppers, who deliberately went out to loot; opportunists, who were drawn in through curiosity or a "sense of excitement"; and spectators, who came to watch.Police authorities should immediately review their emergency plans to ensure they properly cover public disorder on the scale of the August riots, the panel found."Our findings support the view that had the police response in Tottenham and more widely in London been more robust, the riots would not have spread elsewhere in England," said Singh. "Our research has also led us to conclude that riots of this nature will happen again unless immediate action is taken."Panel member Heather Rabbatts said scenes from Tottenham, in which it "looked as if police were backing off", led to a "perception that the streets were there for the taking", which spread to other areas.The panel will publish its final report in March.
