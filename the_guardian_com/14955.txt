The Liberal Democrats yesterday came out strongly in support of new tougher community work sentences that use the latest tagging technology to track non-violent offenders.The party's new home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said the new sentences could be used by the courts for as many as 130,000 offenders each year and as an alternative to prison for non-violent offenders.He said that community sentences had existed for 30 years but successive governments had allowed them to be seen as a "weak slap on the wrist" and they had never been a political priority.He said: "For many criminals prison is an occupational hazard. It is actually the soft option that locks them up for a few months in all-expenses paid accommodation with three meals a day, a gym, pool table and a telly. Then they are free to leave and return to a life of crime - unrepentant, undaunted and undeterred."He said the new community sentence would ensure that offenders paid back something to the communities that had suffered from their crimes.He suggested it should be local people, such as tenants' and residents' groups, rather than the probation service who decided what work gets done as part of the programme, ranging from fitting locks to the doors of burglary victims to making equipment for children's playgrounds.
