A man arrested in connection with a city centre explosion was tonight named by police as 22-year-old Nicky Reilly - who police believe had adopted the Islamic faith.Reilly was arrested by police at the scene of the lunchtime explosion in the Giraffe restaurant in the Â£230 million Princesshay shopping complex in Exeter, Devon.He suffered lacerations to his eye and some facial burning after a device he had on him partially exploded.Another device found in the vicinity of the restaurant did not explode. Deputy chief constable Tony Melville said: "Witnesses described how a male entered a toilet in the restaurant shortly before an explosion was heard."He said police and other emergency services went to the scene and the man was arrested in connection with the explosion. "This male, who we now know is called Nicky Reilly, suffered serious facial injuries but these are not life threatening. He is currently in police custody undergoing treatment at a hospital." Melville said police investigations had indicated Reilly, who had a history of mental illness, had adopted the Islamic faith and "was preyed upon and radicalised".Melville added armed police had raided an address in King Street, Plymouth, linked to Reilly and were currently searching the premises.The blast was reported just before 1pm at the Giraffe restaurant at the Princesshay shopping centre.Eyewitnesses said they believed it had come from the toilets and that they saw nails after the explosion.Officers from Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command were dispatched to the scene this afternoon. The decision was made at the request of Devon and Cornwall police. The terrorism specialists include forensics experts who can identify what caused the explosion.Juliette Joffe, a director of Giraffe, confirmed there was an explosion inside the restaurant and that one man was injured.Large map
