The Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, has been attacked by another convict at Broadmoor, the secure psychiatric hospital in Berkshire, it has been reported.Sutcliffe, who was jailed in 1981 for 13 murders, is already blind in one eye after attacks including being stabbed with a pen 10 years ago.The latest assault was on Saturday while Sutcliffe, 61, was eating his lunch in a dining hall, the Sun newspaper reported.Twenty other patients looked on as a convicted killer attacked Sutcliffe with a metal cutlery knife.According to the account, Sutcliffe managed to fling himself back in his seat and the blade went in half an inch below his right eye, bouncing off his cheekbone. Four nurses bundled the attacker away as he tried to stab Sutcliffe again.The hospital confirmed there was an attack on a patient on Saturday but declined to give details. A spokesman said: "Occasionally there are incidents where one patient assaults another and those incidents are dealt with accordingly."I can confirm that the police were informed as with any incident of this kind. The patient's injuries are not serious."A Broadmoor source told the Sun it was the fourth attack on Sutcliffe."His eyes are the target," the source told the Sun. "He has lost one eye and the other is not really working well."Sutcliffe was blinded in his left eye and his right was damaged when he was repeatedly stabbed with a pen in his room at Broadmoor in 1997 by Ian Kay, a convicted murderer.
