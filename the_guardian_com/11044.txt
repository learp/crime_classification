The total value of art and antiques stolen from property developer Harry Hyams's mansion earlier this year is believed to have been £80m, it emerged yesterday, making it the largest theft of goods in British criminal history.The haul seized by intruders who broke into Mr Hyams's house at Ramsbury Manor, Wiltshire, on February 1 was originally valued at £30m. Further examination by police and art experts has led to the re-valuation. The thieves entered his estate in 4x4 vehicles overnight and removed more than 300 museum-grade items from the building."More is now known about precisely what was taken, and their values, and it appears that the figure is closer to £80m, although this remains an estimate," the Art Newspaper reported yesterday.Mr Hyams, 78, a recluse who made his fortune in the London property market, has been collecting rare works for 50 years. He plans to leave his collection to the nation.Despite the large number of items still missing, the robbery was said to have made only a small dent in his vast collection. On March 25 around 140 items in the haul were recovered from an underground bunker at Black Hill, near Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. Some of the pieces had been badly damaged.Detectives fear many of the missing items will be difficult to sell because they are instantly recognisable to experts. They may consequently be destroyed.Police said a pair of Bow porcelain busts (c 1750) and a mantle clock by Benjamin Vulliamy (c 1805) were among the objects found. At least 200 works, including paintings, silver, clocks, barometers and porcelain, are still missing.Among them is a barometer by Daniel Delander (c 1725), bought by Mr Hyams for £275,000 in 1992; a bracket clock by Delander (c 1720) and an early Dutch table clock by Thomas Tompion (c 1675). In this year's Sunday Times Rich List, published today, Mr Hyams has fallen from his 2005 standing of 155th to 204th, owing to his recent misfortune. With his estate intact, he is said to be worth around £320m.In 1959 he bought a £50,000 stake in Oldham Estates. Years later the shares had swollen to £250m. Mr Hyams also built Centre Point in central London.
