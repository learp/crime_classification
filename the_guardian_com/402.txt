Three sailors were left to die after a ferry officer ignored signs that his ship might have swamped or sunk a yacht, a court heard today.Michael Hubble, 62, who was officer of the watch, "chose to ignore" that the 37,500-ton Pride of Bilbao ferry had passed very close to the 25ft yacht Ouzo off the Isle of Wight in August last year, and did nothing to raise the alarm, Winchester crown court was told.His lack of action led to the deaths of James Meaby, 36, Jason Downer, 35, and Rupert Saunders, 36, who would have survived if he had done the right thing and called the captain, the jury heard.Christopher Parker QC, prosecuting, said the Ouzo disappeared without a trace.Mr Meaby survived for at least 12 hours in the water before dying of hypothermia and drowning. Mr Saunders and Mr Downer survived for at least three hours before they died from either hypothermia or drowning.Mr Hubble, of Capel-le-Ferne, near Folkestone, Kent, denies the manslaughter of the three men through gross negligence and three counts of engaging in conduct as a seaman likely to cause death or serious injury to the men.He told police that he saw a yacht pass close in the early hours of August 21, but he had spotted its lights astern after the ferry passed and did not think there was a problem.Mr Parker told the court Mr Hubble knew there had been a "close quarters emergency situation" but he alleged that the officer "turned a blind eye" and "crossed his fingers" hoping everything would be all right.
