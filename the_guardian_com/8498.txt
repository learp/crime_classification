A retired police inspector beaten by baton-wielding riot officers while drinking in a pub has received £10,000 in compensation from Greater Manchester police.Russell Grayson, 55, an officer with Northumbria police for 30 years, yesterday labelled his attackers "thugs in uniform" who were a disgrace to the service. The Manchester force accepted their actions were "despicable". But none of the masked riot officers responsible for the attack on Mr Grayson and other football fans near Piccadilly station, following a 1998 FA Cup semi-final between Newcastle United and Sheffield United, has been charged or even disciplined, because they wore no identification numbers. Twelve protests were made to the police complaints authority after the incident when several Newcastle fans were injured, including Mr Grayson, from North Tyneside, and Graham Heiling, an executive for Merseyside Chamber of Commerce. It is believed Greater Manchester police has paid out £100,000 in compensation to a string of people. The PCA said that in each case complainants alleged injury "resulting from the use of excessive force by a police officer". Injuries included soreness, bruising, and, in two cases, a cut to the head caused by a blow from a baton. The PCA member who reviewed the authority's investigation said: "Such use of excessive force can never be tolerated." With other customers, Mr Grayson was waiting for a train back to Newcastle when police arrived at the pub around 7pm. He was hit over the head with a baton, went outside, and was left lying on the pavement with blood pouring from a head wound for nearly half an hour before an ambulance was called. He needed four staples inserted into his head.
