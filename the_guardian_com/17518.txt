A man who left a cat needing surgery to remove its eye after shooting it with a catapult has been jailed.Craig Nunn rode off along the street on his mountain bike after stopping to launch a glass marble at the cat, which was sitting on a wall outside its home.Nunn, 28, was jailed for eight weeks at Kidderminster magistrates court after admitting causing unnecessary suffering to an animal contrary to the Animal Welfare Act.The incident was captured by a CCTV camera outside an address in Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire, on 13 July. The 11-year-old cat, Misty, was knocked off the wall and suffered a fractured skull.Misty's owner, Terry Ruff, said the family were "disgusted" by Nunn's actions.PC Marc Ginder, of West Mercia police, said Nunn was unable to offer any excuse as to why he had carried out the "wanton act of cruelty"."I haven't seen anything as mindless as this," he said. "When we spoke to him he agreed his actions were stupid but he didn't really have an excuse for it."Nunn, of Stourport, was banned from having cats for 10 years.
