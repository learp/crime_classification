Britain's 100-year-old probation service is to be dismantled and swallowed up in an American-style 'corrections' system, according to a secret blueprint seen by The Observer.The Home Office has already announced plans to merge the prison and probation services. The new move will see large sections of the probation service outsourced to private security companies in an attempt to prove to the public that the punishment of offenders in the community is not a soft option. David Blunkett, the former home secretary, believed that by using private sector companies - seen as tougher than the 'woolly liberal' probation service - there would be greater emphasis on punitive justice, rather than 'social work'. Ministers believe the new system will persuade magistrates to send fewer people to prison. Opponents believe the reforms will force probation staff to become part of the penal system, where the main function is punishment rather than rehabilitation. There is concern that staff will devote their time to enforcing government initiatives such as curfews, anti-social behaviour orders and early release schemes. The blueprint says that a third of the 18,000 probation staff who presently work in England and Wales will be re-employed by private firms or the voluntary sector. The remaining 12,000 will become 'offender managers' working under the umbrella of the new corrections service, the National Offender Management Service. The plan was drawn up on the orders of Martin Narey, the head of the new corrections organisation. Blunkett's successor Charles Clarke has yet to make a statement on the future of the prison and probation services, but has expressed his belief that many people are in prison who should not be there. Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of Napo, the probation officers' union, said the plan could lead to an increase in offending. 'This destroys something that is working and will guarantee that people will be supervised less efficiently,' he said.
