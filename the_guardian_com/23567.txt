Brendon Fearon, the man shot and wounded by Tony Martin during a burglary at Mr Martin's remote Norfolk farmhouse, was back in custody last night.Mr Fearon, 33, appeared before magistrates in Newark, Nottinghamshire, and was remanded to face a charge of taking a Toyota Landcruiser on August 24 without the owner's consent. Mr Fearon was injured during a raid on Mr Martin's house in the summer of 1999, during which Fred Barras, 16, was shot dead. Since then he has caused controversy by claiming damages of Â£100,000 from Mr Martin, claiming the injury he suffered had prevented him from working and blighted his social life. Mr Fearon was back in the headlines in July when he was released from jail on a new government initiative after serving less than a third of an 18-month sentence, the day after Mr Martin was moved from prison. The juxtaposition of the men's release was an embarrassing coincidence for the Home Office which is under pressure to look again at the law governing householders' rights to defend their property against intruders. There was another outcry last month when a tabloid newspaper published photographs of Mr Fearon cycling and walking up steps, apparently with little difficulty. Friends of Mr Martin hope the latest twist in the saga may prompt Mr Fearon to drop the damages claim. Mr Martin's supporter, Malcolm Starr, said: "It is time this ridiculous case was discontinued." Mr Fearon, who was arrested at his home in Newark at 2am on Wednesday, did not enter a plea at the hearing. The case was adjourned until later this month. Last night Mr Fearon's brother Gary insisted he was innocent, claiming: "The whole thing is a stitch-up."
