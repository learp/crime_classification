Two British holidaymakers shot dead in a run-down Florida neighbourhood after a night on the town had been chased by two males shortly beforehand, according to court documents.The new details about the deaths of James Kouzaris, 24, and his friend James Cooper, 25, in Sarasota on 16 April came after a circuit court judge was forced to reverse an order that kept secret several search warrants and other documents relating to the investigation.Judge Rochelle Curley unsealed the records after a public records request by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune newspaper. They suggest that Shawn Tyson, a 16-year-old arrested 24 hours after the shooting and later charged with the double homicide, had an accomplice.The documents reveal that detectives believe at least one of the suspects was wearing a red bandana or ski mask at the time, and that a search of Tyson's apartment close to the crime scene later that day yielded a black mask and a .22 calibre bullet, the same kind that killed the Britons.Robbery was an unlikely motive, the documents say. "The decedents appeared to have all their personal effects (ie wallets, cash, cell phone and camera) and did not appear to have been robbed," Detective M Jackson of the Sarasota police department wrote in an affadavit for a search warrant.Cooper, a tennis coach from Warwick, and Kouzaris, of Northampton, were on a three-week holiday on the upmarket Florida barrier island of Longboat Key, 12 miles from the murder scene, when they were killed.Police have still to establish why the men were in the depressed Sarasota neighbourhood of Newtown at 3am, about an hour after they were last seen drinking in a town centre bar a few miles away."Residents in the area reported hearing a series of gunshots immediately prior to the 911 call and subsequent arrival of the officers," states another affadavit, which has names blacked out.One witness "reported seeing two white males matching the description of the decedents being chased in the area by two black males".The application for a warrant to search Tyson's residence said detectives were seeking evidence of "firearms ammunition, black clothing, mask red bandana and any blood, DNA, hair or other trace evidence relating to the crime of murder".Tyson had been arrested earlier in April for an unrelated gun crime and should still have been in jail on the night of the killings, US prosecutors have admitted. A judge said he was "a danger to the community" and should not be released but the warning was not passed on at a subsequent custody hearing and he was freed hours before he is alleged to have killed the two Britons.Curley had earlier agreed with police requests to keep the records sealed to protect the identity of witnesses but agreed to their release with certain information blacked out.Friends of Kouzaris have announced they are trying to raise Â£1m to set up a charity in memory of the former University of Sheffield students.
