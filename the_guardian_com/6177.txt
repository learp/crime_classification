A dancer who killed a man after he accidentally stood on his young son's foot at a busy tube station was jailed for three years yesterday.Michael John-Charles, 38, had denied murder, but he admitted the manslaughter of Vipula Prasanna, 40, on the grounds that he had never intended to cause any serious harm, when he appeared at the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr Prasanna, a father of four, died after he was punched at Wembley Park tube station in north London on May 2. He was airlifted to hospital where he died three days later having never regained consciousness. John-Charles, from Green ford, Middlesex, handed himself in after reading about his death in a newspaper report. The court heard that John-Charles lost his temper, swearing at him and repeatedly demanding an apology, after Mr Prasanna accidentally trod on his five-year-old son's foot. He followed him from the station and continued to swear at him, despite him saying sorry. As a gesture of conciliation and apology, Mr Prasanna knelt to touch the boy on the shoulder and apologise, but this irritated John-Charles further and he shouted: "Don't touch my son," before hitting him. Dee Connolly, in mitigation, said he was a hard working and successful man, who was the first black student to go to the Royal College of Ballet. He was also a singer and songwriter and had run a company which helped disadvantaged teenagers and pensioners in his community. Judge Giles Forrester said: "It was a trivial incident - the sort of accident which happens from time to time in public places like an underground station. Instead of putting the matter to one side, as any sensible person would have done, you lost your temper with this complete stranger. "Members of the public are entitled to travel on the underground system without being subjected to assault. In this case not only was he assaulted, but he was unlawfully killed."
