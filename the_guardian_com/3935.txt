A mother of four who admitted biting her boyfriend's scrotum during a drunken row has been given a suspended jail term.Maria Topp, 44, from Gateshead, attacked Martin Douglas at his flat in Newcastle upon Tyne in February.The 45-year-old DJ needed 19 stitches to a wound on his scrotum.The recorder at Newcastle crown court handed Topp a 12-month sentence, suspended for 18 months.He also ordered her to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and imposed a restraining order preventing her from contacting Douglas.Recorder Robin Mairs said: "This relationship is over, I think both of you accept that."Topp had previously pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm at an earlier hearing.That hearing was told that the pair, who had been in a relationship for about five years, had been drinking at the time of the attack, which Topp did not remember.Douglas has since made a full recovery.Mairs said to Topp: "You bit his scrotum with enough force to rip his skin."It must have been excruciatingly painful."
