Detectives investigating the murder of an American artist in east London six years ago have arrested two men, Scotland Yard said today.Margaret Muller, 27, who had studied and taught at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, was stabbed to death while running in Victoria Park, Hackney, on 3 February 2003.A 36-year-old man was arrested in Cambridgeshire today on suspicion of her murder, the Metropolitan police said. He remains in custody at a police station in the county.A second man, aged 46, was arrested yesterday on suspicion of assisting an offender, and has been released on bail.The pair are the eighth and ninth people to be arrested by officers investigating the attack. Muller, who died from multiple stab wounds, was found slumped on a path between a rose garden and a playground in a pool of blood after other runners heard her screams. There was no sign of robbery or sexual assault.Police launched a massive investigation after the daylight attack, carrying out more than 1,000 house-to-house inquires and taking more than 1,000 witness statements within months.A reward of Â£15,000 was offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible, and a month after the killing officers staged Scotland Yard's largest reconstruction, asking more than 100 witnesses to retrace their movements in the park.Virginia-born Muller, who was only 4ft 10ins tall, lived alone in a one-bedroom flat near the park. Police managed to identify her through her mobile phone and trace a cousin living in Britain who was able to identify the body.The artist had moved to Britain five years before her death and studied at the Slade after working as an assistant to the Washington artist Walter Kravitz.Her paintings had been shown at the Slade, at the George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, where she studied geology, and at the University of Maryland.Detectives warned that the killer had probably stalked the park looking for a victim before the attack, and, after revealing the suspect was likely to have had a history of killing animals for pleasure, appealed for burglary victims where animals had been harmed to come forward.They have since ruled out as a suspect a teenager who attacked a woman jogger in nearby Clissold Park, Stoke Newington, in December 2003. Elias Cecchetti, known as "slasher", was convicted of grievous bodily harm after he stabbed Monica Watts then chased her through the park, shouting abuse. At the time police said there was only a tiny chance that the two attacks were not linked because they were so similar.But Cecchetti, then 15, was eliminated because he was in custody at the time of the attack on Muller. A man arrested after an indecent assault in Victoria Park five months before the murder has also been ruled out.In 2005 detectives questioned Eminem impersonator Christopher Duncan, 25, over Muller's death after he was convicted of murdering law student Jagdip Najran. Duncan battered his victim over the head with a metal baseball bat and stuffed her unconscious body into a suitcase at his flat in Bethnal Green, east London.
