Anarchists have claimed responsibility for a vast blaze at the site of a partially built police firearms training centre in Bristol.The group known as the Informal Anarchist Federation (IAF) has previously claimed involvement in several other arson attacks in the south-west of England, including the destruction of six UK Border Agency vehicles on 21 June and two attacks on railway signalling in May last year.The fire at the Â£16m construction site at Black Rock Quarry in Portishead was discovered early on Tuesday and was still smouldering more than 24 hours later.Fire services bought in a special pump from Wales to deliver extra water to the training centre, which was set to be utilised by three police forces from next year.Firefighters said flames had engulfed half the building when they arrived at 4.30am. Smoke was visible 12 miles away.In a statement on the 325 website posted on Wednesday, the IAF claimed to give details of the attack. They also said they had destroyed a G4S company car that same night using paint stripper, which the company has confirmed."We left it with flames licking high," the group claimed."After climbing into the quarry we used accelerant to burn the major electrical cables at five junction points throughout the complex, and doused and lighted a pallet of electrical fittings and wires.""More than 12 hours later the fire is still burning. It put smiles on our faces to realise how easy it was to enter their gun club and leave a fuck you signature right in the belly of the beast.".Police said they had been making in-depth enquires about previous claims of responsibility but admitted that they were yet to make any arrests or ask anyone in for questioning for the previous incidents.At this stage they said there was no evidence to link previous acts of arson and destruction of property with IAF statements.Speaking about this week's destruction, Avon and Somerset assistant chief constable Dave Hayler said it was "a tragic setback"."This is a very sad day for us. We're devastated to see the impact of the fire. The training centre is a new state of the art development designed to train firearms officers across three forces."For the communities of Avon and Somerset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire whose officers will be trained there, it's a tragic setback.""The damage is extensive and we'll be working closely with fire investigators and our own forensic teams to understand what happened to cause such a large fire."The fire service will be on site for some days to come until they're absolutely satisfied that any danger of the fire relighting is exhausted."The communities in the immediate vicinity of the quarry have borne the brunt of the impact. We'd like to thank them for their patience and assure them that we're doing everything we can to minimise the disruption."
