Three men wearing "scream" masks subjected two women to a terrifying rape ordeal, a court heard yesterday.The alleged victims answered the door of their shared flat to find the trio brandishing a gun and knives, according to the prosecution. The men forced their way into the flat in Saffron Walden, Essex, tied the women to a bed and raped them. They fled with cash and phones, leaving the women bound and gagged. John Caudle, prosecuting at Chelmsford crown court, said: "One woman was raped by two of the men and the other was raped by the third. Once they had finished the men put brown sticky tape over the mouths of the girls and left with Â£1,000 cash as well as a credit card." In the dock are Hoang Le, 22, and 21-year-old Van Dong Vu. Mr Le, a student from Hackney, east London, admits aggravated burglary and theft - police say he used the stolen credit card 11 times at an ATM near his home - but he denies rape. Mr Vu, unemployed and of no fixed address, denies aggravated burglary and rape. A third man, Hung Nguyen, 24, also from Hackney, has already pleaded guilty to raping one of the women and aggravated burglary. A witness saw a car matching the description of that driven by the men in Saffron Walden shortly before the attack took place. Only the driver was visible and he was wearing a gruesome elongated skull mask, like the one featured in the 1996 Wes Craven horror film Scream. The trial is expected to last up to four weeks.
