Police are investigating a fire in which a nine-year-old boy died and his sister was injured in a house where arson has been attempted a fortnight earlier.Jefe Okobia's body was found in the gutted terrace house in Forest Hill, south-east London, early yesterday. His sister Yorhe, 13, is in hospital suffering from minor burns and smoke inhalation after jumping from a first-floor window. Two weeks earlier on the night of June 16 flammable liquid was poured through the letterbox. Although no fire was started, a box of matches were found outside. A Scotland Yard spokesman said officers were trying to trace a man - described as black, aged about 18 or 19 - who was seen running from the house. The spokesman said the fire was being treated as suspicious, but stressed that the investigation was at an early stage. Officers were keeping an open mind. The police said it was too early to make any firm link between the attempted arson attack and yesterday's fire. Jefe's mother Ejiro, a psychiatric nurse, was comforting her daughter at the Chelsea & Westminster hospital. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said no one else was believed to be in the house. Esther Mensah, 44, a cousin of Jefe's father Charles, who lives at a separate address, said: "We are very shocked. We don't know why somebody would do that to them."
