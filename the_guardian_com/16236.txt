Jon Venables, one of the killers of toddler James Bulger, was jailed for two years today after pleading guilty to charges of downloading and distributing child pornography.The 27-year-old appeared by videolink at the Old Bailey in London and spoke only to confirm his name and to plead guilty to three charges.The first offence involved downloading 57 pornographic pictures of youngsters on to his computer between February last year and February this year.The second involved distributing indecent photographs of children in February this year, while a third involved distributing 42 images in February 2008.The court heard he pretended to be a 35-year-old woman when he discussed the abuse of children online with another man.It was the first time Venables had appeared in court since being recalled to prison in February.After sentence was passed, in a statement released by his solicitor, John Gibson, Venables said he had thought about Bulger's death "every day" since 1993 and apologised for his actions.Today's sentence was "simply not enough", said a spokesman for the toddler's mother, Denise Fergus, who was in court to hear Venables admit the charges. James's father, Ralph Bulger, had also welcomed the decision to hear the case in public.Venables and his friend Robert Thompson were 10 in February 1993 when they abducted two-year-old Bulger from a Liverpool shopping centre and murdered him. After being found guilty of murder in an adult court, the boys spent eight years in secure children's homes until being released on licence in 2001 with new identities.The judge ruled that his new identity should remain secret, but decided the fact that he was living in Cheshire at the time of the offences could be reported.The court heard that, since his release, Venables had been arrested at least twice.In September 2008 he was arrested on suspicion of affray after he and another man became involved in a drunken street fight. He was given a formal warning by the probation service about breaching the good behaviour expected of him as a condition of his licence. Later the same year he was cautioned for possession of cocaine after he was found with a small amount of the class A drug, which was said to be for personal use.The images on his computer were discovered when he left it at a police station amid fears that his true identity had been discovered. Venables feared his secret had been revealed, and called a probation officer. He was told to gather his belongings in preparation to leave. When the officer arrived, he was trying to delete files from his computer and remove the hard drive.The court was told Venables used peer-to-peer computer software to download the video images in February. Louis Mably, prosecuting, said the videos showed young girls, said to be aged about eight, being raped.He said the downloads could take days or even weeks and during that time the images were accessible to other users.Mably said it was possible to restrict access to other users when downloading was complete but Venables had not chosen that option on one of the videos. He said the computer's web history "indicated the defendant had an extensive history of searching for and downloading indecent images of children using the internet". Other images found on Venables's computer involved children as young as two.Venables had tried to remove the computer's hard drive, he said, claiming he had been anxious about his personal records being accessed.In a statement to police in March this year, Venables said he considered his reaction to child pornography as "breaking the last taboo". But, asked about a video involving an eight-year-old girl, he said he had "no intention" of having sex with a girl of that age.One charge related to distributing child pornography to Leslie Blanchard, a convicted paedophile from Chelmsford, Essex, in 2008.Venables, in messages to Blanchard, claimed to be a 35-year-old married woman called Dawn who abused her eight-year-old daughter. Mably said Venables wanted Blanchard to send images of abuse to him but Blanchard wanted to abuse the girl himself. Venables offered to sell access to the child and a price was agreed but Venables then broke off contact abruptly, saying Blanchard could not see the girl.When Thompson and Venables were first released, an injunction was put in place to prevent their new names from being made public, and for nine years, despite periodic rumours about their whereabouts, there was no confirmed news about either men.In March, the Ministry of Justice issued a statement revealing that Venables had been recalled to prison after a "breach of licence conditions". For almost four months, the then justice secretary, Jack Straw, refused to reveal why Venables had been recalled, saying only that he was suspected of an "extremely serious offence". To say more could endanger Venables' right to a fair trial should the matter reach court, he added.At a preliminary hearing last month, Mr Justice Bean lifted reporting restrictions, allowing the press to reveal that Venables had been charged with offences related to child pornography.At that hearing, Gavin Millar QC, for the director of public prosecutions, said there was no evidence that anyone else had accessed the porn through Venables's actions, but he had "exposed them to acquisition" through peer-to-peer software.Venables is likely to remain in prison beyond the term given today. Because he was out on a life licence for the Bulger murder, he will have to convince the parole board that he deserves to be released into the community, and that it is safe to do so. He could remain in prison for the rest of his life, but experts suggest that is unlikely.
