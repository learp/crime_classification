The new national non-emergency number, 101, was yesterday cleared by Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, to be launched this summer as the alternative way for the public to report vandalism, noisy neighbours and antisocial behaviour, including drug dealing.The 101 number has been set up to take the pressure off the 999 service, which receives 30m calls a year, 70% of which do not require an immediate response from the emergency services.The Home Office minister Hazel Blears said yesterday that the number had been chosen as it was easy to remember, could not easily be misdialled and was helpful for those who were blind or visually impaired.Ofcom initially had concerns that 101 had "Big Brother" connotations because it featured in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four but decided that Paul Merton's more recent lighthearted television programme Room 101 had been a stronger influence on public opinion: "In the programme people's main bugbears are cast aside and therefore awareness of the number could be used in a positive spirit. The non-emergency number is also about dealing with the public's bugbears."The 101 number will be piloted in five areas from this summer - Hampshire, Northumbria, Cardiff, Sheffield and two parts of Leicestershire - and will go national in 2008. Calls are to be charged at a flat rate of 10p a time from mobiles or landlines to deter timewasters. The service will be operated around the clock and callers will be put directly through to trained operators who will provide information and advice on non-emergency matters.They will transfer the call to 999 operators if an incident, such as class A drug dealing, needs an immediate police response but they will also channel matters to local authority officers. Callers will be told the result of their call.Ms Blears said the service would deal with complaints about noisy neighbours, abandoned vehicles, graffiti, rubbish and fly tipping, people being drunk or rowdy in public places, and problems with street lighting. The service will replace a patchwork of non-emergency numbers including 112 and a batch of 0845 numbers run by different police forces which cost more than 10p a minute.The Home Office expects that the new service could increase the number of calls to the authorities by 25%, but because the 101 number eases the burden on the 999 emergency service, it will be able to respond more effectively.
