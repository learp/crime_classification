A science teacher shouted "Die, die, die" as he struck one of his pupils around the head with a metal dumbbell, a court has heard.Peter Harvey, 50, attacked the 14-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, after he had misbehaved during a science lesson at All Saints' Roman Catholic high school in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, last July.The teacher denies attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent but has admitted GBH in a trial at Nottingham crown court that began yesterday.The injured schoolboy, whom Harvey confronted over his poor behaviour in class, sustained a fractured right temple bone and bleeding on the brain after being hit with the 3kg (6.6lb) dumbbell.Pupils started misbehaving during the lesson after a girl with behavioural difficulties was removed from the class. The teacher dragged her out and allegedly kicked her.Some other students took exception to the way she had been treated and began calling Harvey a psycho. The prosecution said he did not respond and told the class to get on with their work.The lead-up to the incident was filmed by one of the teenagers in the classroom using a mobile phone, the prosecutor, Stuart Rafferty QC, told the jury.The 14-year-old started waving a wooden rule like a sword then put it down when told to do so. He then waved a Bunsen burner around his head and, as his teacher chased him around the classroom the boy told him to "Fuck off".The teacher dragged the boy out by his collar into a corridor and into a preparation room, the court heard."He threw him to the ground and armed himself with a 3kg dumbbell and began to hit the boy about the head with it," Rafferty said. "He struck at least two blows to the head which caused serious injury, really serious injury.At the time the blows were being struck Mr Harvey was only heard to say one thing. What he was saying was 'Die, die, die.'"The court heard that one pupil tried to drag the teacher off the boy, who was lying on his back looking "frightened and confused".Rafferty went on: "No one can say for one moment what happened to this boy was deserved or justified. What he [Mr Harvey] did was grossly disproportionate to the wrong inflicted on him by the boy or other members of the class."The court heard that Harvey later told police he felt like he was watching himself on television. He said he was not feeling any emotion and "couldn't think at all". The prosecution alleges he knew what he was doing and it was not a moment when "red mist" descended and he was unaware of his actions.The jury were told that prior to the incident Harvey had been off with stress after a pupil threatened him at his home.The trial continues.
