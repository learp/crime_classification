Two brothers are to appear in court today charged with the murder of an Asian man whose death led to accusations from the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, that the media are institutionally racist.Balbir Matharu was killed in London on the same day as the City lawyer Tom ap Rhys Price in January last year. The 54-year-old, who had two children, had apparently challenged thieves who had broken into his van in Stratford and was run over and dragged 40 metres. He was found lying in the road by his wife and daughter.Sir Ian contrasted the press coverage the killing received with the case of Mr Rhys Price - which became one of the biggest crime stories of the year after he was murdered on his doorstep by two black teenage muggers - claiming that the disparity revealed a racist bias in the media."That death of the young lawyer was terrible, but an Asian man was dragged to his death, a woman was chopped up in Lewisham, a chap shot in the head in a Trident murder - they got a paragraph on page 97," Sir Ian said.His comments were part of a wide-ranging attack on the media in which he also highlighted the murders of the Soham girls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman as evidence that the press devoted more column inches to white, middle-class victims than those from ethnic minorities.His remarks were criticised by some newspaper editors, who insisted the news agenda was not determined by skin colour or class. The Sun called his assertion absurd, while pressure groups attacked him for appearing to belittle the significance of the Soham case. Shy Keenan, from the Phoenix Survivors group for abused children, said Soham was a "landmark moment" and if the commissioner could not understand this "he should never have been a policeman".But several people, including the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, endorsed Sir Ian's position. "Murders and attacks on black and Asian people - with one or two very obvious exceptions - simply do not dominate the news agenda in the same way as many of those affecting white people," said Mr Livingstone.At the time the Guardian calculated that 6,061 words had been written in the national press about the killing of Mr Rhys Price and 1,385 about that of Mr Matharu in the two weeks following their deaths.Following his original remarks Sir Ian apologised for using the Soham murders to demonstrate his contention, but said he stood by his original point. But his claims led to accusations that the police themselves devoted differing resources to murders depending on their media profile. Scotland Yard denied the allegations.In November two teenagers were jailed for life at the Old Bailey after being found guilty of killing Mr Rhys Price.Today Albert Willett, 25, and Tommy Willett, 23, both of Clays Lane, Stratford, will appear at Stratford magistrates court accused of killing Mr Matharu.
