Lawyers for the two men convicted of the "Essex Boys" murders in which three drug dealers were shot dead in a Range Rover in a country lane say they are hopeful the case will be reopened as a result of fresh evidence. The case is being re-examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission and has been submitted to the European court of human rights.Michael Steele, 63, from Great Bentley, Essex, and Jack Whomes, 45, from Brockford, Suffolk, were convicted of the murders of Patrick Tate, 36, Tony Tucker, 38, and Craig Rolfe, 26, who were all shot dead in Rettenden, near Chelmsford, Essex, in 1995. The murders feature in a film out this week called Rise of the Footsoldier and in another, Essex Boys, released in 2000 and starring Sean Bean.Steele and Whomes were jailed for life in 1998. Last year, following a CCRC investigation, their appeal against conviction was turned down by the court of appeal.Henry Blaxland QC, counsel for Whomes, said yesterday that the CCRC had now agreed to look at the case again."It is an extremely important case as regards the way the police conducted themselves." Mr Blaxland added that the appeal court had not had an opportunity to examine all the facts regarding Darren Nichols, the main prosecution witness.A spokesperson for the CCRC confirmed yesterday that the case had been referred to it: "Mr Whomes has reapplied to us and we are reviewing his case."Lawyers for Steele yesterday confirmed that the case had been taken by them to the European court of human rights. Solicitor Chris Bowen described the new evidence which would be presented as "dynamite".Darren Nicholls gave evidence in the trial that he had driven Steele and Whomes to a rendezvous with the murdered men and drove them away afterwards, but had not known of any plan to kill them.Unknown to the defence at the time, Mr Nicholls, then under police protection, had entered into a contract with a journalist to collaborate on a book about the case to be published after the trial.The appeal hearing was told that Mr Nicholls was thought to have received between £15,000 and £20,000 for the book and to have received money from LWT for participating in a television film about the life of a supergrass.At last year's appeal hearing counsel for Whomes and Steele argued that if the jury had known at the time that Mr Nicholls had a media deal they might have treated his evidence differently. It was common ground that the jury could not have convicted the men unless they accepted Mr Nicholls's account.However, Lord Justice Maurice Kay, who heard the appeal with Mr Justice Openshaw and Sir Charles Mantell, said they were not persuaded that the convictions were unsafe."This is an important case and we have been careful to consider it not only as a series of separate grounds of appeal but also on a holistic basis."
