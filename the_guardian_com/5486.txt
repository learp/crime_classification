A man believed to have murdered his wife while she slept and smothered their two daughters before killing himself may have been taking an anti-smoking medication with possible side-effects of "anger" and "depression", an inquest hasheard.The bodies of delivery driver Andrew Case, 33, his wife Vicki, 31, and their two daughters Nereya, 18 months, and Phoebe, two, were found at their home in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, on 26 July last year.The inquest in Southampton heard that Vicki Case was found lying on her back on the living room floor with the two girls on either side of her. She appeared to be embracing the two girls. A blanket had been placed over them.Vicki Case had died of "catastrophic" bleeding caused by two large knife wounds to her neck and chest. The two girls had probably been smothered, the inquest heard.Andrew Case was found hanging on the staircase of the semi-detached house, which had no signs of disturbance.Their bodies were found by Vicki Case's mother, Linda Haskell, who had not been able to contact the family since the Saturday.Haskell ran from the scene shouting "They're all dead â€“ my babies are dead." Neighbours then called police.The inquest heard that Andrew Case had been prescribed the anti-smoking drug Champix because he had been trying to give up for some time.The couple, who had been married for 10 years, and their children had just returned from a week-long holiday to Weymouth, in Dorset, and Vicki Case would not allow her husband to smoke around her or in their home.On 10 July, Case was prescribed 28 Champix tablets to be taken twice a day. He was then dispensed a further 56 tablets by a chemist on 23 July, the day the family returned from holiday.The inquest heard the original prescription packet was found empty and only 28 of the extra tablets were found.The inquest continues.
