A former club doorman accused of murdering schoolgirl Milly Dowler stripped bedding and removed a mattress from his flat within yards of where the 13-year-old disappeared, a court heard.Levi Bellfield, 43, visited the rented flat in Walton-on-Thames, which looked out on to the road where Milly was last seen, in the "dead of night" just hours after she went missing. Though he and his girlfriend were house-sitting in west London, he returned to their flat in Collingwood Place between "3-4am" telling her he wanted a lie-in, the Old Bailey jury was told."So, why return to Collingwood Place in the dead of night? To walk the dog? To lie in? If the prosecution is right that he abducted and killed Milly Dowler, then he had to dispose of her body and clean up," said Brian Altman, QC, prosecuting.Bellfield, formerly of West Drayton, west London, denies the kidnap and murder of Milly on 21 March 2002, and the attempted abduction of Rachel Cowles, then 11, the previous day.The jury has been told Bellfield was convicted in 2008 of the murders of Marsha McDonnell, 19, and Amelie Delagrange, 22, in 2003 and 2004 by striking them over the head with a blunt instrument, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, then 18, in 2004, by deliberately running her over in a car.Milly vanished "in the blink of an eye", shortly after 4pm while walking home along Station Avenue, in Walton. Her naked and badly decomposed body was found six months later in Yateley Heath Wood, 25 miles away in Hampshire.Phone records showed Bellfield had his mobile switched off from 23.02 on the Thursday Milly vanished until 08.26 the following morning, "ample time for him to make the journey from Walton to the deposition site in Yateley Heath Wood and to begin the clean up", said Altman.Bellfield was "very familiar if not intimate" with Yateley Heath Wood through visiting it regularly with a previous girlfriend. Altman said that if Bellfield, as the prosecution suggested, had killed Milly in the flat, he could not leave her there, and took her body to a familiar place "where he determined to conceal forever his wicked and terrible deed".Milly's uncle, Brian Gilbertson, saw a stocky white man fitting Bellfield's description as he searched for his niece in the early hours of Friday near the Collingwood Place flats, which the jury could conclude was Bellfield, said Altman.The jury could ask themselves "what it was that was so important that in the middle of the night he [Bellfield] decided to get up and drive over to Walton", a distance of 13.7 miles. "You can be sure that it was no lie-in", said Altman.The next morning, an acquaintance was paid Â£15 to help Bellfield remove a kingsize mattress from the flat, the jury heard. Bellfield's girlfriend, Emma Mills, discovered the bed stripped when she returned shortly after. There was "no duvet cover, sheet or pillowcases", and Bellfield claimed their pet Staffordshire bull terrier had had an "accident" and he had "chucked it all," said Altman. Months later he would burn the bed and the duvet.Bellfield also decided that they would move out of the flat immediately, even though they had not planned to leave for another month at least, the jury heard.Addressing the subsequent murders Bellfield was convicted of, Altman said there were "similarities" which provided evidence that Bellfield was "to the exclusion of anyone else in the world," the offender.All victims were "vulnerable young women or lone girls" whom he had deliberately targeted on well-lit buses at night after watching them alight alone, or lone schoolgirls he chanced upon, he said.The "accelerated departure" of him and his family from the flat was also similar. After the murder of McDonnell, he suddenly took his family on holiday to Tenerife, and after that of Delagrange, he moved his family to Kent.CCTV footage of Station Avenue, where Milly was last seen by a witness, had captured no images of her, meaning she vanished within a very short time, and yards from Collingwood Place "and right on the defendant's doorstep".Concluding his opening of the case, Altman said it was "not contrary to common sense" that a man facing trial on the evidence in Milly's case, "should also go on to commit murderous attacks on young women who were complete strangers to him, as this man did, within a matter of just over two years."The convictions for murder provided the jury with "conclusive evidence that the defendant has the capacity to behave suddenly and murderously towards young women, for no obvious reason.""Moreover, those convictions provide an unchallengeable record", without which the jury could not understand "the full implications of the evidence overall: how it might be that in broad daylight, and within a flash, a 13-year-old girl can be plucked from the street unless you knew that the defendant was capable of and had indeed gone on to kill, not once but twice, and nearly a third time, with decisive speed and without real concern for being seen to do so".The trial continues.
