The Home Office will get the showcase bills in today's Queen's speech, John Reid said today.New laws expected to be contained in this year's legislative programme include legislation aimed at tackling al-Qaida plots and new powers to fine parents of recalcitrant children.The home secretary also dropped a broad hint that the time limit for detention without charge of suspected terrorists could be extended to 90 days, saying that if the case was made to him, he would have no hesitation in taking the measure - which was rejected in the last session of parliament - back to MPs.But Mr Reid, the only heavyweight contender still in the running to challenge Gordon Brown for the Labour leadership, suffered an embarrassment after Newsnight alleged that an activist within the radical Islamist group Hizb-ut-Tahrir was working at the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in Croydon.Mr Reid promised an investigation into Abid Javaid, and demanded the BBC hand over their evidence to the Home Office.The Home Office bill in today's speech goes under the theme "security in a changing world" and covers crime, immigration, antisocial behaviour and terrorism.By tradition, ministers refrain from revealing what will be in the speech, although the monarch herself only sets out a brief outline of legislation for the next 12 months in the speech, delivered in the Lords.Mr Reid said on GMTV: "We are going to bring in some degree of reassurance and reduction of insecurity, from people's front room, in their communities, right through to countering global terrorism. That is what people deserve."Mr Reid defended controversial plans to fine parents whose children commit offences. He said on-the-spot fines for such matters as parking infringements work and are being collected."Parents do have a responsibility, and if you are being responsible with your kids, why should your life be made a misery because other parents aren't?"It was not just about penalties, he said. Parenting classes to help people who are not equipped to look after their children had a 70% success rate where they had been tried.Among a raft of bills produced by Mr Reid's department is likely to be a counter-terrorism bill consolidating domestic and international law.The bill, slated for publication early next year, may see rules tightened on control orders for foreign terror suspects.It is likely to reopen the vexed question of 90-day custody without charge for terror suspects - defeated in parliament earlier this year but backed last weekend by Mr Brown and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair.Mr Reid suggested that the evidential case for an extension of the 28-day detention without charge for terrorist suspects had not yet been made to him.However, he said: "I have made plain that if it's put to me on the basis of factual or evidential material that there is a requirement to go beyond 28 days, I would be prepared to take that back to parliament."If such a case is made to me, I will reveal it ... and take it to parliament."Mr Reid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a terrorist attack in the UK was "highly likely", and agreed with MI5's claim that there are about 30 active plots."There are many other discussions, conspiracies, what you could call plots going on," he said."These 30 are the ones that they think are the most serious. They are ongoing and they are working and they have the potential, although - without going into great detail about them - some will be nearer preparation than others."The home secretary said the plots were no longer to be regarded as haphazard."They do look as though they are being directed from abroad, specifically by elements from al-Qaida," he said."Secondly, they look as though they are being prepared strategically - that is, that they fit in to a pattern."Thirdly, some of these look to me as though they are at the stage where some plots that have been uncovered were perhaps a year ago or 15 months ago, so it looks as though there is a wave of such things."A criminal justice bill may take forward ideas floated by Mr Blair to extend summary powers on antisocial behaviour, change laws to seize the assets of suspects and bring to court people who renege on promises to undergo drug treatment.And there are also likely to be measures to clamp down on illegal immigrants and limit numbers of non-EU nationals coming to the UK to work.It was reported last night that immigration officers would be given sweeping new powers of arrest to seize illegal immigrants, drug smugglers and people traffickers - and those suspected of crimes at ports and airports.
