Publication of online crime maps of England and Wales by the Home Office marks yet another short-sighted move by the coalition (Report, 1 February). At stake here is not police accountability but the very makeup of communities themselves. Maps can be troublesome devices â€“ black boxes in which the means of their generation and authorship is obscured; all we know in this instance is what the Home Office selects to make visible or absent. More importantly, maps do not merely comment on what is "out there" or not "out there"; they have a more active role, and in the case of crime maps they will be quickly appropriated by the likes of estate agents in making further claims about the safety of a community. Potential homebuyers are subsequently put off from purchasing a property in which crime is said to be prevalent, that area becomes a sink estate, and crime multiplies; the map's work goes on. I hope the map is made redundant soon.Joe GerlachJesus College, Oxford
