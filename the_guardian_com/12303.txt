Five men have been arrested in Scotland in connection with violence at last year's Uefa Cup final in Manchester, police said today.Police said the men, aged between 21 and 36, were detained in early-morning raids after an investigation into disorder at the event, in May last year, between Zenit St Petersburg and Rangers.The arrests came almost a month after police issued CCTV images of 49 men believed to have been involved in the violence. The five are being taken to Manchester for questioning. Police said more arrests would follow.This morning's arrests followed a joint operation by Strathclyde and Greater Manchester police forces.The men detained were a 24-year-old and a 21-year-old from East Kilbride, a 34-year-old from Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire, a 36-year-old from Glasgow and a 27-year-old from the Greenock area.Detective Superintendent Geoff Wessell, who is leading the investigation, said: "The appalling events of 14 May 2008 have not been forgotten by GMP [Greater Manchester police] or the people of Manchester."The operation to bring those responsible to justice has been large and complex, but we have to remember that we were dealing with wanton violence on a large scale."Trouble of that magnitude takes time to investigate properly, and it cannot be allowed to go unpunished."We want these arrests to send out a clear message: if you bring violence to the streets of Manchester, GMP will stop at nothing to bring you to justice."An estimated 150,000 Rangers fans travelled south for the match. Widespread disorder broke out after a screen in the largest fan zone in the city centre failed before kick-off. Many of the fans had been drinking heavily.The violence saw officers and supporters clash in the streets, resulting in a number of injuries and criminal damage.The force launched Operation Gale to find the people responsible.Officers sifted through hundreds of hours of CCTV, pinpointing those suspected of being involved. Officers also travelled to Strathclyde and to other Scottish police forces, showing offender images to hundreds of colleagues. Footage was placed on the file-sharing websites YouTube, Facebook and Bebo. The BBC's Crimewatch UK also featured the appeal.
