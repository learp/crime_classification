A man was arrested on suspicion of murder today after police found the bodies of a woman and her son at a house in Oxfordshire. Officers believe he is the woman's former partner.One neighbour said the attack involved an axe. It took place in front of the woman's teenage daughters, one of whom was seriously hurt.Officers discovered a "horrific scene", a detective said, when they entered the house in the Bretch Hill area of Banbury. The woman, in her 40s, and her son, in his 20s, had been fatally injured.The elder of the two daughters, in her late teens, was seriously injured and the younger girl, 13, was physically unharmed but "extremely traumatised", said Detective Inspector Steve Duffy.He said: "They have obviously been through a horrific ordeal this morning, and we would ask the media to respect their privacy."There was a "background" to the deaths, and the attacks had not happened at random, Duffy said."As you can appreciate, officers went to the address and were faced with a horrific scene. There were two people obviously dead, or very close to death, at the scene."All I can confirm is, their injuries are consistent with blunt trauma, and I can't say if an axe was used, but a firearm was not used. The police traced a suspect to an address in Wiltshire and police went to that address and effected an arrest."The man was arrested in Swindon. In Banbury, a long section of Mold Crescent around the family's home was closed off. The family, who police said had lived in the area for about a year, were not named.
