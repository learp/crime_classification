The Home Office today described forensic failures during the investigation into the killing of Damilola Taylor as "extremely regrettable".It came after an independent inquiry into the 10-year-old's death found that government scientists had made "human errors".However, the investigation, conducted by Alan Rawley QC and Professor Brian Caddy, found no systemic failures at the government's Forensic Science Service.Damilola's parents, Richard and Gloria, said they were "enormously disappointed" with the findings."The report describes the catalogue of errors as 'extremely regrettable' - a conclusion that the family feel is lame in the extreme," they said in a statement."The government should instead now act decisively to overhaul the quality of forensic science used in court."The inquiry arose after it was disclosed that the FSS had missed vital blood evidence when it investigated the murder of Damilola, who bled to death after being stabbed in the leg with a broken bottle on a south London estate in 2000.The report said the setting up of an independent forensic science regulator to define standards, monitor performance and deal with breaches in quality was "long overdue".It found that three scientists - two men and a woman - had made errors in their analysis of bloodstained clothing submitted for testing by police.In a ministerial statement, the Home Office minister Joan Ryan said she would be assessing a number of recommendations in the report."The review has concluded that there were no systemic failures in the procedures carried out by the FSS at the time, but that there were human errors made by some individual scientists, which is extremely regrettable," she said."Their report makes a number of recommendations, and I have asked the chair of the FSS to provide me with a considered response to those recommendations concerning the FSS. I will then be able to give full consideration to all the report's recommendations."Last August, Danny and Ricky Preddie were convicted of Damilola's manslaughter after two previous trials had cleared seven people - including the Preddie brothers - of his murder.After the first trial collapsed due to a lack of evidence, police appointed a new officer to lead the investigation and a different forensic firm re-examined available material.The second trial, which took place last January, heard how key forensic evidence was missed by scientists at the time of Damilola's death, only being uncovered years later.Crucially, a spot of Damilola's blood and a fibre indistinguishable from his school trousers were discovered on a trainer owned by Danny Preddie. Staff at the original laboratory had missed the evidence.In compiling today's report, the authors looked both at the Damilola investigation and a number of other cases in which the FSS had been accused of failing to find evidence.Mr Rawley, a senior barrister, and Prof Caddy, an emeritus professor of forensic science at Strathclyde University, said they carried out "an exhaustive examination" of FSS operating procedures."Our conclusions (which are without hesitation or qualification), based upon documentary evidence and oral testimony, are that there was no systemic failure in the operations of the FSS," they said."There were, however, human failures in implementing the operating procedures of the FSS which brought about the failure to recover crucial evidence."That crucial evidence was Damilola's blood on the trainer, and more blood on a black sweatshirt said to belong to Rickie Preddie.Following Damilola's killing, 441 items were sent to the FSS for examination. Most were marked "urgent", putting the service under "enormous pressure", the report said.An unnamed FSS assistant scientific officer, who was regarded as "highly competent", examined the trainer but failed to consult with her superior about the blood stain as she "undoubtedly ought to have done", the authors found.That error was compounded by the senior investigator, known as a reporting officer, "wavering" on best practice on some items.Another assistant scientific officer examined the sweatshirt, and the report said the stain "should have been found". There were "clear examples of human fallibility" in the checking of four other items.The report recommended the establishment of an independent forensic science regulator to have control and oversight of forensic issues, potentially with powers to deal with standards and performance breaches.Best practice and double-checking of items should receive "more focused treatment" in FSS training manuals and standard procedures, it said.There should be more second examinations, despite cost implications, and forensic labs should be evaluated at least once a year.In further embarrassment for the FSS, a report released yesterday revealed that a backlog of DNA profiles had left almost 200 crimes unsolved for up to 11 years.The report revealed that more than 26,000 DNA profiles were left off the national database between 1996 and 2004. The blunder was discovered in July 2005 and reported to senior officials, but ministers were not told until January.
