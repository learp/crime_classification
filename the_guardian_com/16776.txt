Small boys were scavenging for conkers beneath the chestnut tree as a young woman strolled along the central path of Twickenham Green.The pile of flowers marking the spot in south-west London where Am√©lie Delagrange was bludgeoned to death last month had been removed by yesterday afternoon. Police had taken down the yellow boards seeking witnesses. But passersby said it would take a great deal longer for the fear generated by the attack to dissipate in this quiet corner of the capital. The French student's murder - like the hammer attack on 34-year-old Edel Harbison which preceded it in April at the same spot - has left residents feeling highly vulnerable in what they had thought was a safe environment. Peter Olzov, who works in a cafe on the edge of the green, said fewer people were using it. "The police walk around every day, but there are other parks around here so it will happen again," he said. "People are more suspicious of each other now," said Yvonne, 46, who did not want to give her surname. "I have lived here 16 years and it's always been a community that was trustworthy. But you can't help feeling frightened after the attacks." Elaine, 28, who lives in Hampton - where 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell was murdered in February last year - was in Twickenham for lunch with a friend. She has become much more cautious about socialising in the evenings. "If a friend asks me for a coffee after work, I say no. I rush to get home - if it's too late, you don't know whether the hammer man is about," she said.
