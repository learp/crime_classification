A pilot scheme to protect women from domestic violence will be extended nationwide.Clare's law was trialled for 12 months from September 2012 to allow women to check police records to see if a partner has a violent past.It was named after Clare Wood, 36, who was murdered by her former boyfriend George Appleton at her home in Salford in February 2009.The mother of one had met Appleton on Facebook, unaware of his history of violence against women including repeated harassment, threats and the knifepoint kidnapping of a previous girlfriend.The law is expected to take effect from March.The home secretary, Theresa May, told the Sun that 88 women were killed by a violent partner or former partner last year, adding that there was confusion about when or if police could share information on someone's violent past with the public.May said: "Domestic abuse shatters lives - Clare's law provides people with the information they need to escape an abusive situation before it ends in tragedy."The national scheme will ensure that more people can make informed decisions about their relationship and escape if necessary. This is an important step towards ensuring we do better by women like Clare Wood in the future."The pilot scheme ran in Greater Manchester, Gwent, Wiltshire and Nottingham, where the Sun said about 400 women were given information.
