People who carry knives will face prison sentences of up to three months, after a last minute U-turn on controversial guidance to magistrates. The independent Sentencing Guidelines Council, widely criticised for suggesting the starting point for those caught in possession of a blade in public should be a fine or community service, has changed tack just before its advice was due to come into force tomorrow.It tells magistrates that they should err towards the more severe end of available punishments due to current concerns about a spate of stabbings.For a first-time adult offender pleading not guilty, that would mean 12 weeks in prison. For using a knife in so-called dangerous circumstances, such as to threaten or intimidate, defendants should be referred to the crown court where sentences could be six months or more.
