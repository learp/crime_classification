England and Wales have set their age of criminal responsibility at 10, while Scotland's is currently eight (which is set to rise to 12 soon). As such, the UK has one of the lowest ages of criminal responsibility in Europe.Richard Garside recently argued on Cif that children aged 10 are too young to be labelled a criminal, and the recall of one of James Bulger's killers to prison has reignited the debate.The children's commissioner Maggie Atkinson believes we should reconsider the age of criminal responsibility and look to other European countries' methods of dealing with young offenders that are "more therapeutic, more family- and community-based, more about reparation than simply locking somebody up". Bulger's mother Denise Fergus has responded by calling for Atkinson to be sacked for her "twisted and insensitive comments".Who do you stand on the issue? Should the age of criminal responsibility be raised to 12, left where it is, or lowered?
