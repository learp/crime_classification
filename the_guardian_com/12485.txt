A coroner recorded a verdict of unlawful killing yesterday after hearing that a 54-year-old patient of Harold Shipman died after the doctor visited her to treat an inflamed bunion.The GP alerted relatives to Valerie Cuthbert's death when he returned to her home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, in May 1996, after calling to see her earlier that day, an inquest was told. The ruling by the south Manchester coroner, John Pollard, takes Shipman's official death toll up to 20. The Hyde doctor was last year convicted of murdering 15 women patients. Since then Mr Pollard has ruled five other patients were unlawfully killed. He has yet to hear a further 22 inquests. Mrs Cuthbert's sister-in-law, Susan Cuthbert, told yesterday's hearing that Shipman had telephoned her about the death and asked her to identify the body. "He said he wanted to admit her to hospital but that she had refused and when he had come back later he found her dead," she said. Once at her sister-in-law's house Mrs Cuthbert was reluctant to enter but Shipman said it would be all right because "she looked like she was asleep", sitting upright in a chair. John Grenville, a GP, told the hearing that if the widow had died of heart failure she would have been gasping for air, trying to open windows and standing up, before collapsing to the floor. He said that although it was "theoretically possible" for her to have died of heart failure it was unlikely. When asked if an injection of morphine could lead to her dying in an upright position in a chair he replied: "The answer to that is yes because we know that has happened." It was also revealed that Shipman had made as many as eight alterations to Mrs Cuthbert's cremation certificate and that an entry in the surgery visits books, made by Shipman, stated the widow was complaining of nothing more than a sore bunion.
