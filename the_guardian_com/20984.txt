One year on from the Macpherson report, the Guardian is conducting a survey of the 43 forces in England and Wales to find out what progress has been made. We have taken our questions from data Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary asked forces to keep, as set out in Winning the Race, and recommendations by Sir William Macpherson himself.1. How many ethnic minority officers do you have now? And as a percentage of the total number of officers?2. Do your force staff appraisal procedures test individuals' attitudes towards policing a diverse community?3 Are managers within Divisional command units encouraged to provide effective, individual support to staff from ethnic minority backgrounds?4. Are all your staff trained in racism awareness and valuing cultural diversity? (Recommendation 49 of the Macpherson report)
