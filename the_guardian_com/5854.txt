Judges who threw out an appeal bid by one of Stephen Lawrence's killers have described the "remarkable determination" of the murdered teenager's parents to get justice for their son.The three court of appeal judges made their comment about Neville and Doreen Lawrence as they announced their reasons for dismissing an "unarguable" conviction challenge by David Norris.Last week, Norris made an unsuccessful renewed application for permission to appeal against his murder conviction at a hearing in London before Lord Justice Leveson, Mr Justice Foskett and Mr Justice Hickinbottom.He and Gary Dobson were tried on the basis of new scientific evidence for the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence. Dobson, who was also sentenced to life for the murder, had already dropped his appeal.A gang of five or six white young people set upon the 18-year-old A-level student in Eltham, south-east London, in 1993.Norris, now 36, was convicted at the Old Bailey in January 2012 and sentenced to serve a life term in prison with a minimum term of 14 years and three months, which he has to serve before becoming eligible to apply for parole.Last Friday, the three judges announced they were dismissing his application, saying they would give their reasons this week "having regard to the public interest in the case".In a written ruling given on Wednesday, they said: "Just over 20 years ago, an 18-year-old young man, Stephen Lawrence, was murdered in circumstances which have become seared in the minds of the public."At the start of the judgment they gave a short history of the background, including how, in 2006, advances in forensic science led to a review of the evidence in the case.Leveson, giving the ruling of the court on the application brought by Norris, said: "That short history provides the background circumstances to the commencement of these proceedings so many years after Stephen Lawrence's death."It underlines the remarkable determination with which Neville and Doreen Lawrence have pursued justice for their son."The trial judge, Mr Justice Treacy, described the murder as a "terrible and evil crime". He urged police not to close the file on catching the rest of the killers, and said the murder was committed "for no other reason than racial hatred".Treacy told Dobson and Norris: "A totally innocent 18-year-old youth on the threshold of a promising life was brutally cut down in the street in front of eyewitnesses by a racist, thuggish gang."The breakthrough in the investigation came when a cold-case team of forensic scientists was called in.
