Three policemen murdered by a gang of eastern European anarchists during a botched burglary were remembered on the 100th anniversary of their deaths today.Under grey skies and drizzle, the first memorial to the officers was unveiled near the scene of the killings at Houndsditch in the City of London.City of London police commissioner Mike Bowron paid tribute to the bravery of the men, noting that the centenary was particularly poignant in the light of the stabbing of two policemen at a bus stop in Ealing, west London, yesterday.Sergeant Robert Bentley, 36, Sergeant Charles Tucker, 46, and Pc Walter Choat, 34, were shot dead on 16 December 1910 by a gang of largely Latvian revolutionaries attempting to break into a Houndsditch jewellers.Two other officers were injured in the incident, which led two-and-a-half weeks later to the famous siege of Sidney Street on 3 January 1911.Bowron unveiled a plaque on a wall in Cutler Street, behind Houndsditch, commemorating the policemen who died, and said they would always be remembered.The siege of Sidney Street began after police were tipped off that two members of the gang responsible for the Houndsditch killings were hiding out at 100 Sidney Street in Stepney, east London.Photographs at the time show Winston Churchill with the huge crowd watching from the sidelines as hundreds of police officers and a company of Scots Guards engaged in a fierce gun battle with the suspects.The police and soldiers were debating how to end the stand-off when the besieged house caught fire.Churchill stopped firemen from putting out the blaze unless it spread to other buildings, fearing that more lives could be lost.It was only when the roof and upper floors collapsed, and it was obvious that no one inside could have survived, that the fire brigade was allowed to extinguish the flames.The charred bodies of two members of the anarchist gang, identified as Fritz Svaars and William Sokolow, were discovered in the burned-out house.Churchill was criticised for putting himself in danger by attending the siege, although historians dismiss accounts suggesting one of the bullets passed through his top hat.The events of the winter of 1910-11 were made into a 1960 film starring Donald Sinden, The Siege Of Sidney Street, and gave rise to popular East End legends about "Peter the Painter", the pseudonym for a Latvian anarchist believed by some to be the gang's leader.The siege highlighted the inadequacies of British police marksmen when faced with the new phenomenon of heavily-armed criminals, and eventually led to officers being given better firearms and improved training.
