A 16-year-old boy who fatally stabbed a former friend over a "loss of face" after they traded insults on Facebook was jailed for at least 14 years today.The killer, who was 15 at the time and cannot be named for legal reasons, stabbed 18-year-old Salum Kombo in the chest for the "pathetic" reason that the older teenager had called him a "pussy". Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith, sentencing him at Southwark crown court in London, said: "There was nothing brave about what you did. This was quite simply an act of cowardice, as so many stabbings are."Kombo stumbled and collapsed to the ground before bleeding to death near the scene of the attack in Bromley-by-Bow, east London, last December.David Jeremy QC, prosecuting, said: "A young man has lost his life following a petty dispute and a perceived loss of face by the perpetrator."He said a previous friendship between Kombo and the defendant had turned to "hostility" and they had a fight last summer after a football match in Bartlett Park, east London.In the days leading up to the stabbing there had been a trade of insults and threats between the teenagers, both directly and on Facebook."At one stage the boy who died called [the defendant] a pussy. That insult appears to have particularly incensed him," Jeremy told the court. "It was the combination of a silly argument, [the defendant's] oversensitivity about his own dignity and status, and his own willingness to carry a knife that led to the events of 20 December."The court heard that on the night of the murder the killer had been with friends outside a fish and chip shop and they had tried to calm him down when he became angry and started talking about stabbing Kombo.When Kombo turned up the two teenagers walked off, apparently to settle their differences, when the younger teenager pulled out a knife without warning and stabbed Kombo to the upper chest.Afterwards he was seen "pounding" a wall "howling at the perceived affront to his own dignity, being called a pussy", the court was told."That was the pathetic reason as to why this terrible event happened â€“ because he wanted to show he wasn't a pussy," said Jeremy.The boy later admitted the stabbing but claimed he was acting in self-defence. The jury rejected his explanation and convicted him of murder.Graham Trembath QC, in mitigation for the defendant, said that the two boys had been like "best friends" with a "strange dynamic in their relationship" but Kombo had "challenged and repeatedly challenged [the defendant] to a fight".Trembath said his client was just 15 at the time and believed he was acting in self-defence by striking a pre-emptive blow before a fight which he thought he was going to lose. He intended to cause serious bodily harm, rather than kill.Judge Loraine-Smith told the boy that he had been good friends with the victim and his family, but added: "You killed him because he called you a pussy."You were angry and humiliated and you wanted to fight him and he was quite prepared to fight you. But you knew in a fair fight you would lose."He said that his decision to use a knife in a surprise attack on Kombo was not a decision that was taken on the spur of the moment. "You thought about it for two or three days. You wound yourself up into a cold fury," he added."Your friends tried to stop you but you would not listen."Ordering him to be detained, she said he must serve a minimum of 14 years before being considered for release.
