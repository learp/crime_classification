A homeless alcoholic has admitted conning staff at a £70-a-night inn into giving him a room by claiming he was "Louis Theroux from the BBC".Allan Debenham, 39, booked a room at the Duke of York, Shepton Beauchamp, near Ilminster, Somerset, in the name of the documentary maker, South Somerset magistrates heard.He provided staff at the pub with a telephone number for the BBC's finance department and an order number to arrange payment for his three-night stay.He also pretended to be Theroux's personal assistant and persuaded staff to put two bottles of wine on his room tab. They became suspicious when the bogus PA telephoned again and asked for two bottles of wine and "some fags" to be taken to his boss's room.Debenham, from Taunton, pleaded guilty to two charges of dishonestly making a false representation by claiming he was Theroux.Prosecutor Emma Chetland told the court that on 21 April a man called the pub saying he was Theroux and made a reservation for three nights."Later the pub receives another telephone call purporting to be from Louis Theroux's PA who gives a telephone number for the BBC's finance department and an order number to arrange payment."He also asks for two bottles of wine to be left outside the room. The PA rings again and asks for two bottles of cava and some fags – to use his words – to be left outside the same room."The person taking the call becomes suspicious at the use of the word 'fags' rather than cigarettes. They go upstairs and find the door to the room locked. They call the telephone number that was left and find it to be unobtainable and they call the BBC who tell them the order number is not one they recognise."Pub staff called police and Debenham was arrested.Debenham had also booked a taxi to take him to the pub. "The taxi was booked in the name of Louis Theroux and they were told they might not recognise that person as he had put on a bit of weight but they should send the bill to the BBC," Chetland added.The court heard that Debenham defrauded the owners of the pub of £165 – the cost of two nights' stay and the two bottles of wine – and the taxi firm of a £14.70 fare.Chris Ivory, defending, described it as a sad case, with Debenham turning to alcohol after losing his job, his partner and his home at the end of last year."As a result Mr Debenham had turned to alcohol. He was desperate and he didn't have anywhere to go," he said."In desperation he tried it on. He managed to get a couple of nights' free accommodation and he accepts the prosecution case in respect of that."April was a month that was pretty much a blur to him."Ivory said Debenham is seeking help for his alcohol addiction from Turning Point and has been provided with accommodation.Magistrates adjourned sentence for the preparation of a pre-sentence report.
