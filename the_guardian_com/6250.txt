Trainee recruits are being used to prop up overstretched CID units, severely undermining investigations, according to research conducted across forces in England and Wales.The Police Federation found that in five boroughs covered by the Metropolitan police only 29 per cent of officers working within CID were fully qualified; 27 per cent were trainees while 44 per cent were constables on attachment. In one London borough, only 13 per cent of detectives were fully trained. There is also a national shortage of 2,000 detectives.Initial results of the research, will be presented at this week's Police Federation conference, representing almost 140,000 police officers.'Early indications already show a disturbing picture of how criminal investigation departments are operating throughout the country,' said Alan Gordon, vice-chairman of the federation. 'The lack of experience and properly trained detectives is of particular concern. As with uniformed colleagues, their attention is very often directed towards incidents that fulfil targets and there is frustration that they are unable to concentrate on investigative detective functions.'In recent years senior detectives have been assigned to a number of specialist units such as murder and sex offences squads. The federation says this means that often only junior recruits are available for day-to-day operations.
