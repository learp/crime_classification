A key witness in the sectarian murder of a Catholic youth worker in Northern Ireland has been told his life is under threat from loyalists.Peter Neil, who witnessed the loyalist "invasion" of The Heights area of Coleraine almost a fortnight ago, was injured in the attack.He is one of the main police witnesses in the case against a number of men charged in connection with the murder of Kevin McDaid and the attempted murder of Damien Fleming."I have been told my life is under threat because I gave evidence to police. I know they want me dead. They have wanted me dead for a long time. I will not let them intimidate me," he said.A Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) spokesman said: "When we believe someone needs to review their personal security we inform them immediately."McDaid's son Ryan has also been warned his life is under threat. The 22-year-old, who was informed of the threat against him last week, said he would not be intimidated by them.His father died of a heart attack after being beaten and kicked by a loyalist mob.Eight men have been charged in connection with the murder and attempted murder. A ninth man has been charged with affray.A 34-year-old man remained in custody last night after being arrested yesterday in relation to the attacks.Fleming remains in a critical condition in hospital after he was attacked when the mob invaded The Heights estate after the Rangers football team clinched the Scottish Premier League title.The Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland is investigating allegations that a PSNI officer sent a text message to local loyalists that Catholics had put up Irish tricolours in The Heights area. This prompted up to 30 loyalists to leave a bar where they were drinking, organise several taxis and "invade" the area.
