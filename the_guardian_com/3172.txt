An 80-year-old former soldier who killed his wife of 53 years by strangling her with a dog lead after hitting her with a hammer has been jailed for three years.Bradford crown court heard how Royal British Legion stalwart Clement Callaghan killed his wife, Eileen, 76, because he was determined to kill himself during a bout of severe depression and believed she would not be able to cope with life without him.Callaghan, who served in the Royal Artillery at the time of the Korean war but did not see active service, admitted manslaughter due to diminished responsibility at an earlier hearing.The court heard Callaghan first hit his wife with a hammer at their home in Haworth, West Yorkshire, and then strangled her with a red dog lead.Earlier that day, 4 August last year, he had taken her for her usual Saturday morning hairdresser's appointment.After killing his wife, the defendant drove to a layby outside Haworth where he tried to kill himself by cutting his neck and groin as well as taking a large amount of tablets.But, the court heard, he was found by passersby and paramedics and doctors saved his life.Judge Roger Thomas was told he had written a series of notes which were found in the car describing why he did it.On one of the packets of tablets he wrote "not the doctor's fault" and described how he been storing the pills over a period of time.He also wrote: "I'm sorry."
