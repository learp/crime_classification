Portuguese police officers in the Madeleine McCann investigation are poised to reinterview the friends who dined with Gerry and Kate McCann at a tapas restaurant on the night their daughter disappeared. Officers are expected to travel to the UK with a public prosecutor within days to question the group.Alipio Ribeiro, national director of the Policia Judiciaria, told the Spanish newspaper El País that he was "optimistic" and convinced that his team would crack the case "sooner or later". He added: "We have an idea of what happened."The McCanns say that four-year-old Madeleine was abducted from their holiday apartment in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz while they ate at a nearby restaurant with friends Rachael and Matthew Oldfield, Jane Tanner and her partner, Russell O'Brien, David and Fiona Payne, and Mrs Payne's mother, Dianne Webster, on May 3.Mr McCann and his wife are still official suspects in the disappearance, but a magistrate ruled the police had yet to gather sufficient evidence to warrant further questioning of the couple.Mr Ribeiro told El País that DNA tests might not prove the key to unlocking the case. "The test results complement other things ... They have to be looked at with calmness and objectivity."Mr McCann, a consultant cardiologist, said at the weekend that he was considering returning to work before Christmas at Leicester's Glenfield hospital.
