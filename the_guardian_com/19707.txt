An ambulance worker was charged with misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice today after being called to the home of a dying man, police said.Karl Harris, 44, of Portslade, East Sussex, was sent to the home of Barry Baker in Brighton on 29 November last year after he dialled 999 saying he thought he was having a heart attack.Harris, an employee of South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS trust, was initially arrested on 5 December on suspicion of neglecting to perform a duty in a public office contrary to common law.It is understood Baker, 59, who lived alone, collapsed on the phone to emergency controllers but the line to the control centre remained open when the crew arrived and he died.Sussex police said that a second man who was also arrested had been released without charge and would face no further police action.A spokeswoman for the trust said he had since been suspended from duty but it could not comment further.An inquest into the death of Mr Baker was opened and adjourned by the Brighton and Hove coroner on 17 December.His neighbours said he was a civil servant who had lived alone in his childhood home after the deaths of his parents. Harris, who is on bail, will appear at Brighton magistrates court on 9 March.
