Plans for new laws to stop criminals going free on appeal because of irregularities at or before their trial will be unveiled by the government today.Ministers plan to change the law which allows appeal judges to quash a conviction because of unfairness in the trial process, even if they believe the defendant committed the crime.One example is the case of the drug barons Kenneth Togher and Brian Doran, whose convictions for importing 300kg of cocaine into Britain were overturned on the basis that the trial judge's summing up was misleading. Charges against the men were dropped altogether when a retrial heard customs officers had planted bugging devices without permission.A consultation paper today from the home secretary, lord chancellor and attorney general seeks views on how to implement the reform, which ministers have already decided to take forward.The paper states: "The government wants to ensure that, where the court of appeal are of the view that a conviction is, in the normal sense of the word 'safe', it should not be possible to quash it."The government acknowledges that the court of appeal are not in the same position as the jury and may not always be able to form a view on whether the appellant committed the offence. However, where they have formed such a view the government believes they should not be empowered to allow the appeal."At present, judges will not quash a conviction simply because there was a procedural irregularity, but will if they believe there was a serious flaw in the trial or pre-trial process - regardless of their views on the defendant's innocence or guilt.Examples have included cases where, unknown to the defendant, a key witness was an undercover "participating informant", or where illegally obtained tape recordings were used in evidence.The move follows a promise by the home secretary, John Reid, to "rebalance the criminal justice system in favour of the victim"."We must, of course, ensure that we have an effective and robust appeals system so that those who are innocent can overturn wrongful convictions," he said. "Equally, however, we must have a system that punishes the guilty and delivers justice for victims."The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "Of course I welcome it but it would be better, more plausible, if they hadn't actually made so many loopholes."
