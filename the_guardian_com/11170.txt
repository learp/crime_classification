A retired family doctor was today found not guilty of murdering three of his patients by injecting them with overdoses of morphine.A jury at Teesside crown court found Howard Martin, 71, not guilty of murdering the seriously but not terminally ill patients while he was a GP in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham.Dr Martin, who now lives in Penmaenmawr, north Wales, had denied killing Harry Gittins, 74, of Newton Aycliffe, and Frank Moss, 59, of Eldon, County Durham on March 14 2003, as well as Stanley Wheldon, 74, of Coundon Grange, four days later.There were gasps and loud outcries as the jury foreman declared Dr Martin not guilty to all three charges. Members of dead men's families rushed out of court after the verdicts.Outside court, Dr Martin's solicitor Sara Mason said the murder charges had been a "bitter blow" after almost 50 years in medical practice.In a statement, she said: "Dr Martin has always maintained he was doing no more than doing his best to relieve the suffering of these three patients. He was legally entitled to do that and indeed it was his duty as their doctor to do that."Being prosecuted for murder came as a particularly bitter blow as he has spent nearly 50 years of his life caring for others, at personal sacrifice."He would like to thank his family, friends and very many of his patients for their unwavering support over the ordeal of the last 18 months. Dr Martin is now looking forward to going home."After his solicitor finished reading the statement, Dr Martin added: "I am relieved, very relieved. I've had a year and a half under house arrest and eight weeks of hell on earth."
