A drunk and jealous woman started a "devastating" fire which killed two adults and three young children, a court has heard.Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her four-year-old nephew, Bailey, and two-year-old niece, Skye, died in the blaze at their home in north Wales on 19 October last year.Firefighters managed to rescue Shiers's 15-month-old son Charlie and his father, Liam Timbrell, 23, from their first-floor flat, but they both died later in hospital.Melanie Jane Smith, 42, who lived in the flat below the victims in Maes y Groes, Prestatyn, is on trial at Mold crown court accused of their murders.She denies the five murder charges and also one count of making a threat to destroy or damage property.Opening the case for the prosecution, Ian Murphy QC said: "The prosecution say that the fire was deliberately started by the defendant who had been drinking heavily that day, and who over a period of about two months leading up to 19 October had demonstrated anger and hostility towards Lee-Anna and also jealousy of her."It is the prosecution's case that on a number of occasions which I will later describe the defendant made threats to or about Lee-Anna that she would 'set your house on fire with your kids in it'."The jury of seven women and five men were told that Shiers habitually kept Charlie's pushchair in the downstairs hallway, pushed against the door which gave access to a staircase leading to the upstairs flat.Murphy said: "This pushchair and items left on top of it were deliberately ignited with a naked flame shortly before 10pm on Friday 19 October and a devastating fire developed, rushing up the stairs to the flat above and killing all of those inside."To add greatly to the tragic consequences of this fire, not only were Lee-Anna, Liam and Charlie Timbrell upstairs but so too were two of Lee-Anna's young relatives."The court heard that Bailey and Skye were staying with the family for the night.Murphy said Smith was "particularly angry" with Shiers's habit of leaving the pushchair in the hall and with her being "noisy" in the upstairs flat and being untidy, leaving cigarette ends around the front door area."The defendant also seems to have been jealous of Lee-Anna for, the prosecution say, she accused her partner of having a sexual relationship with her â€“ an allegation for which there seems to be no basis at all," Murphy said.The jury was told that, by 19 October, Smith was also "angry and disillusioned" with her partner, Steven Clarkson, and very unhappy in her flat, which she wanted to leave and had already requested a notice to quit from her landlord.The trial continues.
