A landmark supreme court ruling yesterday opened the way for thousands of sex offenders to challenge whether they should be "labelled for life" by being included on the sex offenders register without any chance of review.The court backed a case brought by two convicted sex offenders who challenged their indefinite inclusion on the register. They claimed that the lack of opportunity to demonstrate they had reformed was a breach of their human rights.The first, referred to only as F, who was convicted in 2005 of a rape carried out when he was 11 years old, argued that being on the register had prevented him from taking his family abroad on holiday or playing rugby league. The second, Angus Aubrey Thompson, now aged 59, was jailed for five years for indecent assault 14 years ago.Current legislation says that any sex offender sentenced to a prison term of at least 30 months is placed on the register for life and has a duty to keep the police informed of any change of address or travel abroad. On the latest available figures, up to April 2009, there are more than 44,700 people on the sex offenders register for England and Wales.The supreme court decision, published yesterday, follows a challenge by the home secretary against an earlier court of appeal ruling that the lack of any review was incompatible with the European convention on human rights, in particular the right to respect for private and family life.Lord Phillips, the supreme court president, said: "It is obvious that there must be some circumstances in which an appropriate tribunal could reliably conclude that the risk of an individual carrying out a further sexual offence can be discounted to the extent that continuance of notification requirements is unjustified."The judges stressed that the ruling did not mean the sex offenders register itself was illegal and said that it was entirely reasonable and lawful to monitor someone for life if they were believed to be a danger to society. But the judges rejected the home secretary's appeal, saying there was no evidence to show it was impossible to identify which sex offenders had reformed. Home Office research submitted during the case showed that 75% of sex offenders who were monitored over a 21-year period were not reconvicted of any offence. Mike Pemberton, the solicitor for F, who was convicted of the rape of a six-year-old boy when he was 11, said his client wanted a fair chance to show that he had reformed."This case is important because it considers the right of a child to mature and develop. At present, any child who commits an offence of this type is labelled for life with no consideration being given to the effect of growing older and learning important lessons from previous mistakes." He said the men were not arguing to be automatically removed from the register, only for a chance for the risk they now posed to be reviewed.The supreme court ruling means that the incoming government will need to look again at the law and introduce a review mechanism. Home Office officials will consider the ruling before making any recommendations. The existing requirements for sex offenders to notify the police of their movements remain in force in the meantime.Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, which provided an expert witness in the case, said the ruling was an important first step in ensuring that only those who actually continued to pose a risk to the public remained on the register."The courts have long recognised that children change and develop in a shorter time than adults: it is now time for the government to reflect this in its public protection policies. This will provide motivation for young people who commit sexual offences to address their problems and get on with their lives," she said, adding that it was crucial that the next government acted on the judgment.
