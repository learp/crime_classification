The murder of a black teenager who was stabbed to death in south-east London is being treated by police as racially motivated. Stephen Laurence, aged 18, from Woolwich, was waiting for a bus in Eltham with a friend at around 10.30 on Thursday night. He had walked a short distance from the bus stop to see if it was on its way.  In what appeared to be a motiveless attack, he was set upon by between four and six white youths and stabbed twice in the upper body.  He and his friend managed to run for about 250 yards before Stephen collapsed. Attempts to resuscitate him failed.  Yesterday Detective Chief Superintendent Bill Ilsley said racist remarks had been shouted at Stephen before the attack.  Police are looking for four to six casually-dressed white men aged 18-20. One was said to be around 6ft. They were also anxious to trace a woman and two men who were standing at the bus stop at the corner of Well Hall Road and Dickson Road at the time of the attack.  Anyone with information was asked to call the incident room on 081 294 1361.  A spokesman for the Anti-Racist Alliance, which monitors racist attacks, said the murder was the ninth racially motivated killing since the start of 1992.  'It was a brutal attack which bore striking similarities to the murder of another black youth, Rolan Adams, two years ago,' said a spokeswoman.  'The Greenwich area (of south-east London) has become the racist murder capital of Britain.'  The organisation is calling for the closure of the British National Party's headquarters in nearby Welling, which they believed was 'spreading race hate among the local population'.  The BNP is planning a march through London tomorrow.
