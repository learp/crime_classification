Consumers are facing emerging threats from increasingly sophisticated online scammers, which include counterfeit goods advertised on social media and misleading listings by estate agents on online portals.The dangers are highlighted by National Trading Standards (NTS) in its annual Consumer Harm Report, which highlights the types of scams people should watch out for and how they can report suspected criminal activity.Although crackdowns by trading standards teams have saved businesses and consumers an estimated £93m over the past 12 months, officials warned that this is only the tip of the iceberg.NTS is a group of senior local government trading standards heads from across England and Wales, set up by the government in 2012 as part of the legislative shake-up of consumer protection.Its report warns that the trend of criminals selling fake products on social media platforms – where it is easier to conceal their identity and disguise contact details as well as lure victims with cheap prices – is likely to get worse. “Portal juggling” by estate agents is also expected to continue, it said. This involves misleading prospective homebuyers by removing and re-listing properties on property websites to make them appear brand new on the market, and to disguise any price cuts. This is despite the phenomenon being in breach of trading regulations and in some cases fraudulent.The continuing expansion of online marketplaces is also expected to lead to a growth in “micro-importers”, consumers in the UK who order goods online for onward sale. This can lead to fake, and often dangerous, products ending up in people’s homes, including dangerous electrical products with faulty chargers that can overheat and cause fires. Trading standards institute: consumers are no longer protected Yet not all criminals are online. The report also identifies some of the more longstanding scams, including doorstep crime, mail scams and selling secondhand cars with tampered mileage clocks.Over the past year, nearly 80 criminals were convicted and collectively sentenced to 161 years’ worth of jail time as a result of NTS investigations.“Our teams are working within the resources available to clamp down on criminals who target consumers and honest businesses,” said Lord Toby Harris, chair of National Trading Standards. “The dedicated work of our officers has prevented a £345m loss for businesses and consumers in the past two years, representing a saving of £12.63 for every £1 spent. Our work is making inroads into criminal activity, but we know that in many cases this is just tackling the tip of the iceberg.”
