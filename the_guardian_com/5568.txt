The loyalist paramilitary Michael Stone was today sentenced to 16 years in prison for the attempted murder of Sinn FÃ©in leaders Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams, in a raid on the Northern Ireland assembly.Stone's attack on Stormont in November 2006 was the second time in 20 years that Stone had tried to murder Adams and McGuinness.The 53-year-old, one of the most notorious terrorists from the Troubles in Northern Ireland, was also convicted of six charges including possession of weapons and explosive devices, at Belfast crown court today.He had claimed his attack was a work of performance art and the axe, garrotte, imitation handgun, three knives and homemade bombs he was carrying were artistic props.Handing down the sentence, Mr Justice Deeney said he had decided not to give Stone a life term on the grounds that his actions had not resulted in any serious injury, and the fact that he suffers from a degenerative muscle-wasting condition that, he acknowledged, would see him confined to a wheelchair in the future.However, the judge said he also had to take into account the serious offences that Stone had already committed before his attack on Stormont."He could hardly have a worse criminal record," Deeney said, "and I do take into account the very grave offences of which he was convicted in 1989."In mitigation, Orlando Pownall, Stone's barrister, had asked the judge to show mercy on the former Ulster Defence Association hitman, and said it should be acknowledged that his client supported the Northern Ireland peace process and had been involved in meetings which had discussed ending loyalist violence.  "He had meetings with Mo Mowlam (then Northern Ireland secretary) and others and, while I acknowledge these were not critical and it wasn't through him the peace process took place - that would be laughable - but he had taken part."He welcomes the peace process in Northern Ireland and hopes that the process will continue and power will be devolved without continuing struggle between either sides of the political divide."Stone killed three mourners in an attack on an Irish Republican Army funeral at Milltown cemetery in west Belfast in 1988. He was convicted of six murders, including those three, the following year.Later, when he was in Maze prison, he said he had meant to kill Adams and McGuinness.Eight years ago, Stone was freed early on licence, under the Good Friday agreement. However, he now faces the revocation of his licence on an outstanding 30-year tariff.
