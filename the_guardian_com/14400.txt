Serious violent assaults have fallen since the relaxation of drinking laws, according to new research based on injury data from hospital accident and emergency departments.The study, published today by Cardiff University's violence research group, says that 6,000 fewer people have needed hospital treatment since the pub opening hours changed in November 2005.The figures, based on returns from 33 accident and emergency departments in England and Wales, estimate that 364,000 people needed treatment after being assaulted in 2006 - 6,000 fewer than the previous year.The Cardiff study claims to be the first complete set of data to be published since the change in the licensing laws. The Home Office has commissioned its own evaluation of the impact on crime of the changes in pub hours.Before the changes, judges warned that alcohol-fuelled violent crime would soar and chief constables said that some British town centres would soon resemble notorious binge-drinking foreign holiday resorts such as Faliraki in Greece.The 2% drop in the A&E injury figures is less dramatic than in previous years, but is part of a consistent fall since 2000 - in sharp contrast to police recorded crime figures, which have risen over the same period.A detailed breakdown shows that there were 8% fewer female victims of violent assaults during 2006, although those involving males remained constant. As in previous years, the highest number of assaults was at weekends, with a peak in the summer months.Professor Jonathan Shepherd, the director of the Cardiff University violence research group, said the figures demonstrated that the feared effect of the licensing law changes had not materialised.Official crime figures published today are expected to confirm a further small fall in overall crime during 2006, meaning that Tony Blair will leave office having presided over the longest continuous fall in the crime rate - down by 44% since 1995. But police figures show a rise in street robberies, vandalism and criminal damage. Reported returns from 26 of the 43 police forces show a 7% rise in street crime, with thieves increasingly targeting handbags, iPods and MP3 players.
