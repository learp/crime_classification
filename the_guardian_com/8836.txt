Offenders who are ordered by the courts to undergo sex offender treatment courses or domestic violence programmes are having to wait up to a year because of a crisis in resources, a probation union survey reveals today.Napo claims that the sentencing powers of magistrates courts in 34 out of 42 probation areas in England and Wales are being undermined by the unavailability of community penalties. Courts in 14 areas have been told that places on unpaid work schemes are not available or severely restricted and in some areas there are also delays in getting on to courses to tackle drink-drivers, those who need alcohol treatment, and sex offenders.The publication of the probation union survey follows the decision by the justice secretary, Jack Straw, to pump a further £40m into community penalties in an attempt to persuade magistrates to use them as an alternative to short prison sentences. The prison population in England and Wales on Friday stood at a near-record 81,914, with 49 locked out in emergency police cells.The Napo survey suggests that while the extra £40m will come as welcome relief to the overcrowded probation service it is unlikely to resolve the immediate crisis faced by the courts.Recent Ministry of Justice figures show the waiting time to start a domestic violence course is between 13 to 42 weeks. The maximum waiting times vary between 33 and 208 weeks, and there are cases of men being convicted of further attacks on their partners while waiting to start a course to tackle their criminal behaviour, the ministry's figures show.The National Audit Office recently reported that there were serious delays in starting supervised community punishments and courses designed to tackle criminal behaviour. The Napo survey undertaken this month and last confirms that during that period there was a serious problem in 75 cases across 34 of the 42 areas. There were difficulties either with resources so the penalty was simply not available, or there were long waiting lists to start them. Harry Fletcher, Napo's assistant general secretary, said: "There is extreme concern that there are now restrictions on the ability of magistrates to impose the sentences that are required in 80% of probation areas."Responding to the Napo survey, the justice minister, David Hanson, said he was not aware of a national problem and that on top of the extra £40m probation areas had been told they could carry over money they did not spend last year. He said: "Offenders waiting for a place on a programme are under the supervision of their offender manager who will monitor the risk posed by the offender and actively manage it."
