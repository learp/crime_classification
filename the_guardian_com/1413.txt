An architect who disguised himself as a tramp to launch a string of sex attacks on young girls over a period of almost 20 years has been unmasked after being trapped by DNA profiling while under investigation for an unrelated minor crime.Anthony De Boise, 58, a senior official for Wandsworth council, had been at large for 17 years since his first attack on a girl at a beauty spot in Surrey. Yesterday at Southwark crown court he admitted to six attacks on teenage girls, who he threatened to kill. Three of his victims had knives held to their throats during the sexual assaults.De Boise thought he had got away with the attacks, but when he was questioned on an unrelated matter this year his DNA was taken and matched to the incidents.The married man was active for seven years and each attack took place during the afternoon and within a 20-mile radius of his Â£500,000 home.On three occasions he molested girls on Telegraph Hill, Oxshott, while the other assaults took place in Coulsdon Woods, Coulsdon, and Riddlesdown Common, Purley.In August 1995 he carried out a double attack on two 13-year-old girls in Oxshott by threatening one with a knife as the other was forced to perform a sex act on him. He then made them swap over. One victim was able to injure the father of two by lashing out at him with a dog chain.De Boise dressed in a stained tracksuit and dirty trainers for the attacks and was thought to be uneducated and unemployed. But in fact he was a member for the Chartered Institute of Architects and a respected council officer.De Boise remained at large until his chance arrest on an unrelated theft charge on February 21 this year.He was charged with six sex attacks and three kidnaps a few days later.Stephanie Farrimond, for the prosecution, said he had used a knife on three of the victims, tied one of them up and sexually assaulted one of them."He forced them into areas out of public view in order to carry out the assaults," she said.De Boise, of Holmbury St Mary, near Dorking, Surrey, admitted six charges of indecent assault between June 13 1989 and June 10 1996. A charge of kidnapping was left on file.He is due to be sentenced in August after psychiatric reports.Dressed smartly in a suit and tie, the white-haired defendant spoke only to confirm his name and plead to the charges as they were read out to him.Judge Christopher Elwen remanded De Boise in custody pending sentence.
