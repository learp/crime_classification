Penal reformers last night voiced fears that ministers' decision to abolish the job of chief inspector of prisons will muzzle one of Whitehall's independent watchdogs.Their concern followed an announcement from the Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart that the five separate inspectorates covering the criminal justice system are to be merged into one "super-inspector" under a cull that will see 11 Whitehall regulators reduced to four. The prisons inspectorate was set up in 1982 and successive chief inspectors have proved a thorn in the side of home secretaries, with forthright reports on conditions in prisons that have often embarrassed ministers and officials.It currently tries to inspect each of the 135 prisons in England and Wales twice every five years.Ms Mactaggart said the new "justice, community safety and custody" inspectorate would bring together the current regulators for the police, courts, crown prosecutors, probation and prisons.The Home Office consultation document published yesterday said the merger would provide the "focused, joined-up and streamlined inspection regime" that was needed to "provide the independent scrutiny required by ministers".Ms Mactaggart said the new inspectorate would have a "special duty" to inspect and report on the treatment and conditions of those in custody."An independent, professional presence able to assess the environment in depth, sometimes without prior warning, is essential to ensure that human rights are not abused," she said.The Home Office says it hopes the prisons inspectorate's overriding concern for human rights and decency will "infuse" the ethos of the new body, but penal reformers fear it will become little more than an auditing body of criminal justice processes, systems and targets.The Home Office itself acknowledges that the prisons inspectorate is an international leader in its field and that means preserving its unique role.Ministers say that includes being able to set its own detailed criteria, turn up at jails unannounced and be able to criticise unacceptable policy or practice freely in public.The new criminal justice super-inspector, whose salary package is expected to be around Â£300,000 a year, will be in charge of a staff of about 300 - including 130 involved in inspecting police forces - and will be expected to agree their programme of work with ministers. It will be a five-year appointment.The chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, said last night that she still had concerns about the plan: "There is still the worry that within a much bigger inspectorate it will be hard to hang on to the specific focus on prisons. We will lose having a chief inspector who visits prisons regularly and speaks directly to ministers and to the public. It will create an inspectorate within an inspectorate."Juliet Lyon, of the Prison Reform Trust, said prisons could go bad very quickly and the loss of a dedicated prison inspector was a retrograde step: "The sharp focus on the treatment of prisoners and prison conditions, and the immense authority carried by a succession of post holders and admired across the world, cannot but be diluted by these new suggested arrangements. The inspectorate has proved itself again and again by revealing to parliament and the public bad and unsafe practice in our prisons."The current arrangements provide an essential safeguard, able to shine a light on the darkest corners."Her concern was echoed by the Liberal Democrats' Mark Oaten, who said he was uneasy that the merger could compromise the independence and expertise of inspectors whose job was to ensure the highest possible standards in custody.
