Kate and Gerry McCann were today accused by the head of the Portuguese police federation of not helping in the search for their daughter.Carlos Anjos, president of the ASFIC federation, said he expected the parents to use their right to silence as official suspects - arguidos - if they were interviewed again by Portuguese police.He told the Portuguese newspaper Diario de Noticias that the investigation to find Madeleine may take a "very long time.""This is a difficult and complex case made worse by Madeleine's parents' attitude who do not facilitate or help the investigation," he said."There is no sense in scheduling other interrogations as Kate and Gerry have already said they will speak no more."They are arguidos, a status which allows them to remain silent and they have already said that they will make no more statements."This case is here for a long time because there is no apparent motive and it will be very difficult to prove if it was homicide if Madeleine's body is not found."The McCanns' spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, rejected accusations they were not cooperating with police. "We are not prepared to comment on Mr Anjos's remarks but Kate and Gerry have always said they are willing to return to Portugal at any time to help the police with their investigations."
