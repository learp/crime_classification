A woman helped her husband to fake his own death by convincing insurers, a coroner and the couple's own sons that he had died in a canoe accident, a court heard yesterday.Anne Darwin, 56, and her husband, John, were overwhelmed with debt and facing an increase in payments on a loan when she took part in the £250,000 fraud, Teesside crown court was told.The jury heard that the couple's sons, Mark and Anthony, believed their father was dead after their weeping mother told them: "I think I've lost him. He's gone."Darwin, from Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, denies six deception charges and nine of money laundering.In March 2002, six days after they were refused a £20,000 bank loan and were facing bankruptcy, prison officer John Darwin disappeared into the sea in a canoe called Orca.When Anne Darwin phoned the police to report her husband missing, she had in fact just dropped him off at Durham train station, Andrew Robertson, prosecuting, told the court. Within a month, her husband, who had grown his hair and a beard, was secretly living at a neighbouring property they owned. The jury was told that he was an avid reader who could not resist registering at the library, under a false name: John Jones.Darwin, it is claimed, defrauded various insurance companies by "convincing them that her husband was dead when he was very much alive and well". Robertson said she told police, their sons and the coroner that her husband had drowned.Robertson added: "Anne Darwin clearly thought nothing of lying to her sons in this way and convincing them that their own father was lost at sea and dead."According to Mark, his whole world had fallen apart. He felt he had not just lost a father, but his best friend." Anthony's reaction was the same. "In the crown's submission, Anne Darwin must have been aware of the deep distress she was causing her children, yet she was steadfast in this way in the complete absence of her husband."The initial idea may have been John Darwin's rather than Anne's, but it was a scheme in which Anne Darwin not only played an equal and vital role - but it was a role which she played with superb aplomb."Robertson showed the jury a photograph of the Darwins taken at an estate agent's office in Panama, where they were allegedly "looking for property to buy with the proceeds of the fraud".Anne Darwin will rely on a defence of marital coercion, the court heard.Robertson said that to prove this defence, a wife has to show that the crime was committed in the presence of her husband and under his coercion, to such an extent that her will was overborne. He asked the jurors to look at the picture taken in Panama and consider whether she was a woman whose will had been overborne by her husband, or if it was "indicative of a woman who was very happy at the prospects of enjoying the fruits of the fraud".The amount of money, land and property "she was sitting on in Panama was in the region of just over £500,000", the prosecutor added.In an email from Anne Darwin in Panama to friends, which was copied to her husband "John Jones", she spoke of land she had purchased and hoped to turn into a nature reserve for ecological tourism. "This land has much more to offer than I originally thought. It has deep ravines and swamps with wildlife more interesting for nature trails," she wrote.She spoke of seeing poison-dart frogs, eating mango, avocados and a small yellow fruit which was very tasty but whose name she couldn't recall.Darwin wrote that she was hoping to recoup carbon credits for trees "as I have over 460 acres [and] I hope to get something".The $1m (£500,000) market price was "an absolute bargain" as she had looked at other sites with less land that cost "Monopoly money".The prosecution claims that the land would have been paid for by fraudulently obtained funds.Robertson said: "Simple though the scheme was, it was obviously going to require a considerable amount of guile, convincing pretence and persistence, and guts on the part of Anne Darwin to see it through."In a statement to police following her husband's disappearance, she said that he was an experienced canoeist, "however he couldn't perfect an eskimo roll."A press release was issued to local media six months later in which Darwin was quoted as saying: "When he went missing I stayed up all night. I didn't go to bed for days. It was a nightmare and it's still going on. "I feel very much in limbo. People die, have a funeral, they have a headstone, there's something to mark the fact they existed on this earth, but without a body I don't know how we can mark John's life."The prosecution said of Darwin "it is clear that at no stage in the ensuing five-and-a-half years before this fraud came to light did Anne Darwin's nerve ever fail her."The trial continues.
