Police cautions are given to save the expense and logistical difficulty of a full court hearing and happen when someone admits what is usually a relatively minor offence.Since 2003 they have come in two forms, a simple caution – the sort given to Charles Saatchi – and a conditional caution, the latter of which decrees the offender must follow a certain action, for example repairing criminal damage or going for drug treatment.A caution, which is imposed by police, sometimes after consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, was formerly seen as part of a criminal record and had to be declared at job interviews. Since 2001 this has no longer been the case, although a caution will show on some enhanced criminal record checks.The guidelines over cautions for adults in England and Wales were set by the Home Office in 1994, following concerns about a lack of consistency and their use for serious offences, even attempted murder or rape.In April, the government announced it was again reviewing the use of cautions over fears they were being over-used, and used for repeat offenders. According to the Magistrates Association, a third of serious offences receive a caution and 11,000 people received cautions for violent crime in 2012.The justice minister, Damian Green, said the review could see cautions ruled out for certain offences.
