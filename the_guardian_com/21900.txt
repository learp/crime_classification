A pensioner was seriously ill in hospital today after being knifed repeatedly in a street attack.Ann Driscoll, 82, was stabbed nine times in the neck and stomach as she walked home from a shopping trip in Harlesden, north-west London. She was discovered covered in blood by a member of the public as she attempted to stagger home to her ill husband, Cornelius.Police are hunting a white man, aged between 30 and 45, with brown hair, who was wearing brown clothing. Officers believe the knifeman may have been stalking the area before the apparently random and motiveless attack took place.They have appealed for anyone who saw Mrs Driscoll in Harlesden High Street or Burns Road, where the attack took place, to contact them.Detective Inspector Ian Lott, of Brent violent crime unit, said nothing was stolen from the 5ft 2in pensioner, who was carrying several shopping bags. He said: "The investigation is in its early stages and inquiries are ongoing to fully establish the victim's movements on the day."Paramedics were called at about 3pm yesterday and Mrs Driscoll was taken to a central London hospital where she was initially in a critical condition. But police said her condition had since improved and she is now described as "stable".She was found at the junction of Fortune Gate Road and Marian Way, outside Keir Hardie House.Police said the victim had been shopping in Harlesden High Street and was seen outside Tesco at about 2.20pm before catching the number 18 bus.She was described as white, of petite build, with grey hair. She was wearing a beige skirt, off-white blouse, a linen jacket and grey shoes. Police said Mrs Driscoll was carrying two Tesco bags and a green Marks & Spencer bag.They have asked anyone who saw the victim in any of these locations or who helped her in Fortune Gate Road to come forward.Anyone with information should contact police on 020 8733 3709 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
