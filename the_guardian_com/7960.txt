The case against Conservative MP Nicholas Soames, who was due to face a court today over allegations that he gave three children a quad bike ride on a public road, has been adjourned.The MP for Mid Sussex was summonsed to appear before Crawley magistrates today, but the case was adjourned to May 14 at the request of the defence folowing a phone call to the court this morning, court officers said. Soames, 60, was summonsed after footage shot by hunt monitors appeared to show him riding a quad bike on a public road with a small child perched behind him and towing two others in a trailer as they followed a new year's day hunt in Slaugham, West Sussex. It is claimed the youngsters were not wearing crash helmets and were not strapped in. Soames faced allegations relating to insurance and safety, under Section 40a of the Road Traffic Act, said a spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service. Stills from the film were printed in the Daily Mirror on January 3, shortly after seven-year-old Elizabeth Cooke died in an accident on Boxing Day while riding a quad bike on a public road in Blackmore, Essex. Soames, a grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, told the paper at the time he did not accept he had put the children at risk. Soames was armed forces minister from 1994 to 1997. He has represented Mid Sussex since 1997 and was previously MP for Crawley.
