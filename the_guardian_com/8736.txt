A man convicted of selling hundreds of tonnes of unfit meat to firms that supplied leading supermarkets, hospitals, and schools was tonight believed to be at large overseas.Peter Roberts, 68, was found guilty in his absence of conspiracy to defraud, after a police investigation discovered his pet food processing plant had recycled £1.1 million in weight of condemned poultry into the human food chain.Nottingham Crown Court was told that Roberts, who ran Denby Poultry Products, failed to appear for trial in June and is thought to be on the continent.Jurors today convicted him of the fraud and cleared another man, ex-England schoolboy footballer Brian Paul Davies, 37, of the same offence.The jury will return tomorrow to consider majority verdicts in respect of three other men facing the same charge.The court has been told that Roberts, of Francis Street, Chaddesden, Derby, ran the pet food firm between 1994 and 2000 from rat-infested premises at Bushes Farm, Denby, Derbyshire.Ben Nolan QC, prosecuting, said that Roberts's company bought waste chicken and turkey carcasses, which in most cases where fit only for rendering, before trimming the meat into pieces and selling it on to wholesalers.He told the court: "Over the whole period of this alleged conspiracy very large quantities of condemned poultry entered the human food chain at significant risk to public health."The victims of this fraud were the companies, firms and innocent customers who bought poultry believing it to be fit for human consumption, when in reality it was condemned meat."Jurors heard that Roberts bought the waste from slaughterhouses for around £25 per tonne and later sold the meat cuts for upwards of £1,500 per tonne.The court was told that he made over £500,000 from the scam, and heard a recorded police interview, in which Roberts denied the fraud but admitted that poultry used in his pet food was "good enough to eat".Mr Nolan also told the jury that Roberts had absented himself at the start of the 12 week trial and is thought to have left the country for the continent.Jurors are still deliberating verdicts on van driver Simon Haslam, 39, of Shalfleet Drive, Derby; Brian William John Davies, 64, of Walmersley Road, Bury, and David Watson, 38, of Paxton Crescent, Shenley Lodge, Milton Keynes.Brian Paul Davies, of Moor Road, Holcombe, Bury, tonight walked free from court after he was cleared.Jurors have been told that five other men have already pleaded guilty to the same offence.
