The former rock star Gary Glitter declared his innocence yesterday as he was bundled into a court in Vietnam to answer charges that he sexually molested two girls under 13.Glitter, 61, whose real name is Paul Gadd, accused "D", aged 11, and "Ng", 12, of lying when they told the court he fondled and kissed them in his rented sea-front villa last year.Gadd, who has spent the past 15 weeks in a Vietnamese prison, has insisted he was just teaching the girls English, and repeated that he was "innocent, innocent" as he was hauled through a ruck of reporters outside the courtroom in the resort of Vung Tau, about 80 miles south-east of Ho Chi Minh City.Proceedings were closed to the public because the case involved minors, but officials said the girls faced up to the challenge well, particularly when Gadd raised his voice, which could sometimes be heard from the court grounds.In addition to evidence from the alleged victims, the state's case was supported by three witnesses, Hoang Thi Bong, 18, who officials described as a prostitute living with Gadd at the time of the incidents, Gadd's maid Nguyen Thi Anh, and Tran Thi Kim Oanh.Ms Oanh was D's aunt who, according to officials, took the girl from her home in Can Tho province 190 miles away to Gadd for sex. Ng, who is thought to have been pimped by one of her relatives who did not appear in court despite being listed as a witness, lives in Vung Tau."At the court today they all made clear statements about the guilt of Mr Glitter," said foreign ministry official Nguyen Ngoc Hung at a briefing for 50 foreign journalists and almost as many local reporters.Looking gaunt behind gold-rimmed aviator sunglasses and dressed in a black T-shirt, trousers and cap with white patent loafers, the retired singer grinned broadly and gave a victory sign on his way into the court.Gadd has lived an itinerant lifestyle since serving two months in prison in Britain in 1999 for having more than 4,000 pornographic photographs of children on his computer. He moved first to Cuba before travelling to south-east Asia. He was expelled from Cambodia in 2002 over allegations of child sex abuse but was never charged and arrived in Vung Tau in the middle of last year.He was arrested on November 19 trying to flee the country after allegations that he sexually abused the two girls appeared in British tabloids. Police confiscated his laptop which, detectives claimed, had hundreds of pornographic pictures on it. Officers considered a charge of child rape, which carries a death sentence in Vietnam, but could not find enough evidence.Asked by reporters if the girls were lying and if he had pleaded innocent, Gadd nodded in response to both questions.His defence lawyer, Le Thanh Kinh, said Gadd was "very relaxed" and had asked for a black T-shirt to wear for his court appearance. "He told me, 'I need to look very good because there will be many journalists when I appear in court,' " he said. According to Mr Kinh, prosecutors had demanded Gadd be sentenced to three or four years imprisonment and then deported. Officials said it was unlikely the judge and two jurors, who decide the verdict together, would ignore the prosecutors' demand, even though they could hand down a seven-year sentence if he is found guilty.A verdict is expected today.
