Three men have been jailed over a rape which was only discovered by the victim after she was shown mobile phone footage of the attack.Mohammed Shahjahan, 27, Nicholas Jones, 26, and Feizal Ali, 26, from Oxford, sexually assaulted the woman while she was unconscious in November.The woman said she had passed out in a flat in east Oxford after drinking three vodka and Red Bull cocktails and did not remember the attack. She did not discover she had been raped and sexually assaulted until two weeks later when she was shown the footage by one of the perpetrators and described the moment as "a big shock".The woman told the BBC that all she remembered was having the three drinks and then waking up in a bed. The court was told that the woman had been "incapable of consent".On sentencing the three men, Judge Julian Hall said: "This was a disgraceful incident which would not have come to light but for the fact that Nicholas Jones filmed it, kept it and later showed it to the victim."The judge jailed Shahjahan for eight-and-a-half years for rape at Oxford crown court while Jones was sentenced to three-and-a-half years for sexual assault and voyeurism. Ali received three years for sexual assault.Hall said Shahjahan was "an arrogant young man who was heartless, shameless and had no consideration for the victim". Jones, who pleaded guilty to the charges of sexual assault and voyeurism, was described as "a decent young man who did absolutely terrible things that night".Police described the attack as "sickening". All three will be on the sex offenders register for life. Detective inspector Simon Morton, from Thames Valley Police, said: "The victim's courage, strength and determination has been incredible. I just hope for her the justice system has worked and that she can now start to move on with her life."
