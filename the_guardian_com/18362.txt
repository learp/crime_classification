To say that prison is not working is an understatement. The number of people in jail in England and Wales hovers at record levels of around 75,000. Our overcrowded, and sometimes inhumane, institutions cannot rehabilitate inmates, with the result that half the crime in the country is carried out by ex-offenders. The Home Secretary's five-year strategy for cutting reoffences and protecting the public makes a welcome change from the overly punitive approach of many of his predecessors. While dangerous criminals will get tough sentences, others will be given rigorous, and visible, penalties in the community. Jails, in Charles Clarke's plan, will no longer be full of the mentally ill and women convicted of relatively minor offences.His critics' demand - to build many more prisons instead - has never sounded more hollow. This country jails more people than Libya, Malaysia, Burma and all its western European counterparts. We lock up twice as many people as the Scandinavians, yet no one is suggesting that Britons are twice as bad as Swedes. But this is not just a numbers game.Mr Clarke's scheme to offer offenders adequate education and health care, including drug treatment, reflects a care for decency as well as the overriding need for public safety. The stumbling block is the Treasury, which is unwilling to provide the initial investment needed without proof of results. Gordon Brown should ignore this impossible precondition and put his faith, as judges, prison reformers and many victims have, in the Home Secretary's vision.Reducing the huge burden on the taxpayer of jailing far too many people must make economic sense. The Chancellor should embrace the reforms for other reasons, too. Few government plans hold the key to a better and more humane society. This one does.
