The millionaire brother of Gary Lineker was jailed for two and a half years yesterday after admitting his part in a tax fraud plot which deprived the Inland Revenue of £90,000. Judge Stephen Robbins told Wayne Lineker, 43, he was primarily responsible for the conspiracy, in which consignments of foreign currency from the family-named bar chain in Spain and Portugal were smuggled into Britain in suitcases. A co-conspirator illicitly changed the money into sterling using the internal currency system at NatWest Stockbrokers.Lineker's employee, Dave Hodges, 43, of Waltham Abbey, Essex, admitted defrauding the tax authorities between January 1 1999 and December 31 2001 and was jailed for 20 months. Dave Stacey, 56, of Southend, Essex, who conducted the currency conversions, was convicted in February for his part in the conspiracy. He was jailed for 18 months.Southwark crown court in south London was told that the bars owned by Wayne Lineker featured memorabilia from his brother's football career. The judge told Lineker, of Fyfield, Essex: "You accepted primary responsibility for initiating this conspiracy, which was sustained over a period of 18 months during which sums of £340,000 passed through the hands of the conspirators."In addition to his imprisonment, Lineker was made the subject of a £90,000 confiscation order to the revenue.Judge Robbins told Stacey: "Akin to burglars and thieves who need fences to dispose of their ill-gotten gains, your co-defendants who wished to avoid tax liabilities benefited from the services you provided."But the judge noted that while Lineker and Hodges admitted their offences, Stacey had denied the charges. A further hearing will consider if the men should be liable for court costs.Lineker is reported to have become a millionaire from the proceeds of the eight bars he owns and the three franchised "Lineker's" establishments in Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and the Canary Islands. He set up the first of them with financial help from his brother.
