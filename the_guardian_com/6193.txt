Police today launched a murder investigation into the death of a taxi driver who died after reportedly being run over by his own cab.Kent officers believe 70-year-old Gian Chand Bajar had his taxi stolen after being assaulted in St Benedict's Avenue, Gravesend, late last night. The vehicle was later found abandoned and burnt out in a nearby road.Local resident Alan Meen, who was called to the scene by a neighbour, described seeing burn marks on the driver's arm, believed to have been caused by the car's exhaust."I put some blankets over him and a blanket underneath his head and waited for the ambulance," he said.Police forensic teams have sealed off the street, and a fingertip search of the area is being carried out."At 10.10 last night, police were called to an incident in St Benedict's Avenue involving a taxi [driver] who had been subjected to a serious assault and subsequently died from his injuries," a Kent police spokeswoman said."The taxi was stolen from the location and was abandoned and set on fire in nearby Truro Road. The incident is being treated as a murder investigation."Nirmal Thandi, co-owner of Millennium Data Cabs, for whom Mr Bajar had worked on a self-employed basis for around 10 years, said the taxi driver was married with three daughters and two sons and lived in Gravesend."From what we understand, he dropped off a customer and an argument broke out between them," he added. "What happened after that we don't know, because the police won't tell us, but we understand he was run over by his own cab. "You could not have met a nicer man. He was very family orientated and did a lot of work for the community."Taxi drivers said the attack would lead to heightened anxiety for drivers working nightshifts.
