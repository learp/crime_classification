Parliament should review the law on manslaughter to restore public confidence after an "alarming" number of deaths in custody followed by few prosecutions and no convictions, the director of public prosecutions suggested last night.Crown Prosecution Service lawyers will join such inquiries at an early stage under a new protocol between the CPS and the new Independent Police Complaints Commission.Ken Macdonald said that "gross negligence" manslaughter, under which police are prosecuted, was a "complex, difficult and opaque" legal area."Parliament needs to constantly review these areas. There is a confidence issue."A simpler, easier to prove offence of misconduct in public office is a possibility. In 97 cases considered between January 2002 and May 2004, there were only five prosecutions, and no one was convicted.Such deaths typically occur when a suspect is being restrained, but it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt that officers were grossly negligent and that their action caused the death, an often impossible task.
