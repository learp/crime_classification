Police have said that there is a “genuine risk” that innocent people could get hurt after a series of gun, grenade and machete attacks by two feuding criminal factions in Salford, Greater Manchester.The warning comes as Westminster politicians prepare to descend on Salford’s Media City for the party leaders’ TV debate on Thursday.A shooting that took place in Wigan on Monday is being linked to a grenade attack in Salford earlier on the same day, along with two serious attacks that have taken place in the Salford borough over the past few weeks.Extra patrols, including armed officers, are patrolling the area to provide some reassurance to the community.Greater Manchester police (GMP) do not currently know what the feud concerns, but believe it may involve “a respect issue” between the two factions, detectives said in a press conference in Manchester on Tuesday.A man remains stable in hospital after he sustained gunshot wounds at the shooting at a car wash in Ashton-in-Makerfield, Wigan, shortly before 5.20pm on Monday. GMP say he is “extremely lucky” to not be in a more serious state following the shooting, which happened during rush hour on a busy main road.A 50-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in connection with the incident, which police have established was a retaliatory act following a grenade attack on a house in Formby Road, Salford, at 00.50 on Monday morning.No one was injured in the incident, which caused damage to the house’s exterior.Police believe both crimes were related to a machete attack at 7.15pm on Saturday 21 March 2015 in Agecroft Road, Salford. The male victim suffered injuries to his neck, back and torso but has been discharged from hospital. A 25-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of his attempted murder.Detectives say there is no intelligence that links these crimes to police killer Dale Cregan, who committed a grenade attack on one of his victims, and who, according to police, used hand grenades as his “calling card”.A large policing and partnership operation is in place to tackle these offenders and the recent escalation of violence in the area.Ch Supt Mary Doyle from GMP’s Salford division said: “The general public may hear the words ‘rival criminals’ and think this has nothing to do with them as it is simply offenders targeting each other, but the reckless way in which these people operate means there is a genuine risk that innocent people could get hurt.”She appealed for the community to help police with their investigation: “I would say that anyone with a sense of loyalty to these people is misguided and as the bank holiday weekend approaches people need to examine their consciences and tell us what they know.”“All information we receive will be treated in the strictest of confidence, and we have a range of measures available to us to ensure you are not identified if you speak to us.”Anyone with information is asked to call police in Greater Manchester Police’s Major Incident Team on 01618569283 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800555111.• The headlines on this article were amended on 1 April 2015.
