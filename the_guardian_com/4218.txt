Police investigating an attempted letter bomb campaign against Celtic manager Neil Lennon and two high-profile supporters of the club have said that another suspect package has been discovered.The latest package, the fifth to be found and believed to be a parcel bomb, was intercepted by postal staff in Northern Ireland. It was reported that the package, which was found on 12 April, was sent to Cairde Na H'Eireann, a Republican supporters' group based in Scotland.Two other bombs were sent to Lennon, one was sent to his lawyer Paul McBride, and another was sent to the Celtic fan and former MSP, Trish Godman.The Police Service of Northern Ireland said it was alerted after the latest package was found at a sorting office in Belfast which handles returned mail.The item, which was intercepted at the National Return Letter Centre, had been returned undelivered from an address in Scotland and was "similar in nature" to the packages being investigated by Strathclyde police.It is understood the parcel did not originate in Northern Ireland.In a separate development, two men have appeared in court charged with posting bigoted and sectarian statements on the internet relating to Glasgow football.David Craig, 23, from Paisley, and Stephen Birrell, 27, from Glasgow, were charged with breach of the peace after being arrested by police at their homes early on Saturday. They made no plea and were released on bail.Their arrests, which led to the seizure of mobile phones and computers, are not connected to a police operation to identify those behind an attempted letter bomb campaign against Lennon and the others.Four viable devices, which used bottles of explosive liquids wrapped in nails and were capable of causing "real harm", were posted to Lennon, McBride and Godman over a seven-week period from the Irvine and Kilwinning areas of north Ayrshire.Meanwhile, in an unconnected development, police in Northern Ireland said they would investigate any complaint made about apparent threats against Lennon allegedly made by Steve Moore, the British National party's candidate in the Stormont assembly election.Matthew Collins from the anti-Nazi magazine Searchlight, said the comments "really eflect how stuck in the dark ages the BNP are with regard to Northern Ireland".Collins added: "A couple of months ago the BNP were backing dissident Republicans, now they're taking enjoyment in the threats to the life of a football manager. This party is suffering from time warp sickness."This is the BNP's first major foray into Ulster politics where the British far right have traditionally failed to make a breakthrough. In the early 1980s the National Front was humiliated in a local government election after their candidate in North Belfast received just 26 votes.The attempted letter bomb attacks stunned Scottish football, and the legal and political establishment, leading to the personal intervention last week of the prime minister, David Cameron, and the Lord Advocate, Elish Angiolini, the head of the Scottish prosecution system.It is understood both were in direct contact with Stephen House, the Strathclyde Police chief constable, last week. Cameron suggested the Scottish authorities had failed to tackle sectarianism.Moore said: "No idea what this is or where it came from.We certainly don't advocate violence of any kind. It is of course not the first time I or fellow members of the party have been subject to hacking, false Facebook accounts, false Twitter accounts and just downright lies. I have not had an account on Facebook for sometime, and when I did it was under my own name.
