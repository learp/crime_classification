Pictures of the camp where the suspected gunman Raoul Moat evaded police were released today.The pictures show a duvet, tent and sleeping bag, found in a secluded area on land at Wagtail Farm on the outskirts of Rothbury, Northumberland.The farm has been the subject of police searches as the hunt for Moat enters its seventh day.Moat's camping gear was recovered following the arrests of Karl Ness, 26, of Dudley, North Tyneside, and Qhuram Awan, 23, of Blyth, Northumberland.They were later charged with conspiracy to commit murder and possessing a firearm with intent and were remanded in custody yesterday by a district judge at Newcastle magistrates court. Two more men were arrested on Wednesday, accused of helping Moat.Detective Chief Superintendent Neil Adamson, who is leading the hunt for the former nightclub doorman, said: "We believe this camping equipment was left behind by Mr Moat and others just before the arrests of Karl Ness and Qhuram Awan. We're continuing to search for Moat, with inquiries taking place across the force."We continue to follow up information we receive from the public, and we believe Mr Moat is still in the Rothbury area. However, our activity continues across the force area and we'd urge anyone with information about his whereabouts to contact us as soon as possible."An RAF Tornado with imaging equipment joined the manhunt yesterday, after a request from Northumbria police, and completed a search of the area.A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the search was conducted in line with routine military assistance procedures.A man fitting the description of Moat was spotted in Rothbury last night after the fugitive threatened to widen his "war" with Northumberland police to include members of the public.The man was seen walking through the town wearing a baseball cap. He was spotted by a police officer but vanished despite a search operation.The incident was one of a number of potential sightings in and around the area last night. Police used helicopters with thermal-imaging equipment as part of the manhunt.Earlier in the evening, Rothbury residents demanded extra police protection at the town's schools at a packed public meeting.Northumbria police's temporary chief constable, Sue Sim, who attended the meeting, confirmed that the request would be granted as a priority. Yesterday she said Moat had made unspecified "threats towards the wider public".Moat is alleged to have shot his former girlfriend, Samantha Stobbart, and killed her new partner, Chris Brown, in the Scafell area of Birtley, Gateshead, early on Saturday. The next day Moat allegedly shot and seriously injured PC David Rathband as he sat in his patrol car at a roundabout.
