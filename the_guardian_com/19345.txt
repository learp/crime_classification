Your news report (Criminals on probation murdered 98 in two years, December 6) had the effect of supporting home secretary John Reid's agenda, which is to undermine the credibility of the probation service. Reid is desperately seeking support for his plans to dismantle and privatise the service - even though it is performing better than ever against all 30 ministerial targets.The article quoted the bald Home Office statistics about incidents of serious offending by people released from prison and placed under probation supervision, but does not put them into context. Since the 1991 Criminal Justice Act, there has been, year on year, a significant increase in the number of serious offenders released from prison and put on licence to the probation service. Prior to those sentencing changes, such people would simply have been released from prison at the end of their sentence without any probation supervision.The article does at least recognise that "only a small fraction - 0.2% - of the 150,000 offenders supervised by the probation service each year in the community had been convicted of a serious violent or sexual offence".My trade union and professional association, Napo, represents probation staff - dedicated and professional public servants who care passionately about their work. They are committed to the objectives of the service, to "reduce reoffending" and to "protect the public".Assessing and managing the risks posed by those who commit offences is highly skilled work. Probation officers have to meet rigorous training requirements; but for other operational probation staff there is currently no specified national training strategy, something which our union is urgently pressing for.Since 1997, under the Labour government, probation staff have struggled with ever bigger and more complex caseloads and, while there has been an increase in the number of operational staff, there has been no increase in the number of officers. What price then for public protection?The article noted yesterday's parliamentary vote "on a massive shake-up of the service including plans to open its work up to the private and voluntary sectors". Why did it not question how legislating to abolish the National Probation Service, with a view to replacing it with a mishmash of different providers from the public, private and voluntary sectors, will add one iota to public protection? Why did it not point out that the government has never produced a business case to show how reoffending will be reduced by the introduction of marketisation, by fragmenting probation provision, by replacing the principles of partnership with competition, or by replacing local probation services with a centralised commissioning model?The probation service works best when there is a genuine interpersonal professional relationship at the heart of strategies to tackle reoffending; when it is properly resourced; and when it acts as the hub, coordinating criminal justice services at local level. It would be a tragedy if the government's obsession with privatisation were to destroy an invaluable and internationally respected public service.· Judy McKnight is the general secretary of Napo, the trade union and professional association for probation staff jmcknight@napo.org.uk· If you wish to respond, at greater length than in a letter, to an article in which you have featured either directly or indirectly, email response@theguardian.com or write to Response, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.
