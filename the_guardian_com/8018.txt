Many millions of pounds are spent every year developing "less lethal weapons" – devices that can stop criminals in their tracks but not kill or seriously harm them.The Taser stun gun is an obvious example. At the end of last year, the government said funding was being made available for up to 10,000 new Tasers after extensive trials. Police welcomed the announcement but Amnesty International claims almost 350 people in the US have died in the last seven years after being stunned by one of the guns.Other devices that police and the Home Office have looked at include a beanbag gun that fires small pouches filled with lead shot. The impact is said to be like a punch from a good boxer. There are devices that temporarily blind suspects with a laser beam or entangle them in sticky foam.Also available are products designed to stop a vehicle. They bear names such as the Barracuda, the Catsclaw, Checkpoint Charlie, Piranha and Terminator.Some companies are working on devices that stop a vehicle by zapping its electronics. One British company has a prototype that can halt a stolen car – which has been fitted with its technology – by gradually cutting the fuel supply.Police forces hope that eventually they will be armed with a device that can target the electronics of any vehicle and bring it to a halt without deploying spikes and nets.
