The next Conservative government will resist Labour's habit of adding offences to the statute book, David Cameron told police officers yesterday.In a speech to the Police Federation conference in Blackpool, he promised to slow down legislative change, restore discretion to officers and cut down initiatives. "We ask a lot of the police, but increasingly, I think, we ask too much."Mr Cameron said he wanted the government to concentrate on social breakdown to allow police to tackle fighting crime. But he assured officers he had never said people should "hug a hoodie". These were "three words I never said," he told them, in a speech that "has been more misrepresented than anything I've never said."Mr Cameron went on: "So let me try again. Aggressive hoodies who threaten the rest of us must be punished. They need to know the difference between right and wrong, and it's our job to tell them."But what do we really want, a society where more and more kids are out of control, a rising tide of crime and punishment? Or do we want those kids to behave properly in the first place? If we do, we've got to stop the problems before they start, and that means making sure every child grows up in a stable, loving home."Mr Cameron said he resisted the view that "every social problem is a state solution" and condemned Labour's introduction of 30 criminal justice bills in 10 years. He vowed to repeal the Human Rights Act, which had created the impression that the authorities were on the side of criminals.But the Conservative leader also warned police forces they had to collaborate more effectively or see introduction of a national serious crime force.
