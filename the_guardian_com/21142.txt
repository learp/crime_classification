Mentoring schemes meant to cut criminal and antisocial behaviour by young people can prove counterproductive, according to research published today. There is no proof that projects to pair troubled children and teenagers with adult volunteers reduce offending or truancy, said the report published in the British Medical Journal. The schemes, which typically involve a volunteer providing support or guidance, can have negative consequences if the relationship between the adult and the child goes wrong, said researchers from City University in London, the University of York and the University of Illinois in Chicago.The study found that mentoring programmes did not always help young people at risk of or involved in antisocial behaviour or crime. A three-year follow-up study of one scheme found that some young people were more likely to be arrested after it finished than others who had not taken part. The researchers concluded that volunteer mentoring programmes "cannot be recommended as an effective intervention for young people at risk of or already involved in antisocial behaviour or criminal activities".The report called for more research to ensure that young people were not harmed by receiving help from mentoring schemes. The researchers said: "We lack full understanding of the safeguards needed to ensure that young people are not harmed by participation. For some of the most vulnerable young people, mentoring programmes as currently implemented may fail to deliver on their promises."
