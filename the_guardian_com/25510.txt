Jacqui Smith's first visit outside Whitehall as home secretary took her today to the Aylesbury estate in south-east London, the venue of Tony Blair's first speech as prime minister.He said there would be no "forgotten people" in the Britain he intended to build when he descended in May 1997 on the estate - reputed to be Europe's largest - which subsequently became an emblem of the challenge facing the new government.Ms Smith's visit was a more low-key affair. She was joined by the Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Ian Blair, police minister Tony McNulty and Southwark police borough commander Malcolm Tillyer to hear about efforts to bring down crime on the estate where a regeneration programme has been under way for seven years.She said it was important to establish local people's priorities. She said she hoped residents would work with police and police community officers in helping to bring crime levels down further.Ms Smith met resident Tony Taitte, 54, who said: "People feel much safer walking in the street and shopping. There used to be a lot of gangs that used to hang around the stairways; I think that doesn't exist anymore."Cathie MacIver, 51, a resident of the estate who also works as a health and education co-ordinator for the New Deal For Communities regeneration programme, said: "Fear of crime has actually halved. It has gone from 51% in 2002 - people fearing being mugged and robbed - down to 23%."She said she hoped the new prime minister Gordon Brown would also visit the estate. "I believe he would be absolutely delighted with the progress regeneration has made," she said.
