A man has been arrested in connection with the suspected murder of a Southampton woman in her late 80s.Family members discovered the body of the woman in her home in Ocean Village on Saturday night, prompting an investigation by about 60 officers.Police have cordoned off a wide area around her home, which overlooks a marina, to enable detectives to search for evidence.A 37-year-old local man had been arrested on suspicion of murder, Hampshire police said.Detective Chief Inspector Pete McGowan said the investigation was at an early stage and the arrest was one of several lines of inquiry. A postmortem examination will be conducted by a Home Office pathologist on Sunday to establish the cause of death.Immediate family are aware of the woman's death but other close relatives have not yet been notified as formal identification procedures are incomplete, a police spokesman said.Detective Superintendent Rachel Farrell, leading the investigation, said: "I would like to reassure residents and those who visit this area that this is an extremely rare incident which is expected to have a huge impact on the local community. There is a significant police presence in the area and this is likely to remain over the coming days. This may cause some disruption to local residents and we therefore ask for their support and understanding."Due to the waterfront location of the address, we would extend our appeal to the transient boating and sailing community who may have attended the Cowes Week celebrations on Friday or sailed into or out of Ocean Village during the weekend as they may have seen something, no matter how insignificant it might appear to be, that will assist us."The property is in an affluent part of the city and Ocean Village is popular with sailors and football players.Farrell said: "We have a dedicated team of more than 60 police officers involved in the investigation who are conducting searches, completing house-to-house inquiries and following up other lines of inquiry."Police are appealing for people to contact them if they saw anything unusual or suspicious around Ocean Way, Pacific Close and Atlantic Close between Thursday 16 August, when contact was last made with the woman, and Saturday evening.The dead woman is unlikely to be formally identified until Monday because some family members are abroad and officers have been unable to reach them.The woman was found inside a one-bedroom, ground-floor flat in a 1980s block by family members concerned for her welfare, McGowan said. They had not heard from her since Thursday.
