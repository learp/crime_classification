A con-man who was jailed in his absence for three years, for faking pilot's qualifications to get a job flying holidaymakers to the UK, was sentenced to a further month in prison on Tuesday for skipping bail and fleeing the country.Michael Fay, 61, a US national, living in Alton, Hampshire, had pleaded guilty to fraudulently working as a commercial airline pilot, flying passengers into Gatwick airport with a Libyan airline without the proper licence and medical documentation on eight occasions.But before his sentencing at Winchester crown court on 3 May the former US air-force pilot fled, first to Qatar, then to Germany and finally to Ireland using another passport, before deciding to return and face justice.Fay handed himself in at Winchester police station on Monday night after a month on the run. He had contacted authorities to say he would talk to the police.He appeared again at Winchester crown court, where the judge, Keith Cutler, said: "At last you are back to face the music."The judge heard that the sentencing judge, Frank Abbott, a recorder, had given Fay less credit for his guilty plea because he had fled on the day of sentencing.Cutler halved the sentence from two months to one month for breaching bail because, he said, there had already been "an element of punishment".Police were alerted to Fay's scam when another pilot became suspicious while chatting to him on an internet forum.Fay had been operating Airbus A320 planes for eight months on behalf of the Libyan company Afriqiyah Airways at the time of his arrest on 3 February 2011. He had forged the required pilot's licence and medical certificates.Police feared at the time he had fled the UK and that he could seek work as a pilot or flying instructor in another country. His details were broadcast across the world.His defence barrister, Peter Binder, said his client had suffered from ill health and high blood pressure.Binder said: "He accepts failing to attend. He had a conference with me on the 1 May – at that stage there was every indication he would attend for sentencing on the 3 May."But knowing he was going to prison, he had what is best described as a complete failure of nerve. He emailed me in the early hours of the 3 May saying he had left the jurisdiction, and I informed the court that day and he was sentenced in absentia."He emailed me on the 11 May that he intended to return – he had 'done the wrong thing'. He was in a jurisdiction that needed an exit visa but in due course he was granted that exit permission and he returned a week ago and surrendered himself yesterday by appointment. He panicked and he ran away, but he has now returned."Chris Thorne, a detective constable with Hampshire police, said outside court: "It's good he has returned to face justice, he put people's safety in jeopardy. People in a plane to need to know that the guy at the front is qualified and in good health."When Fay disappeared Thorne had said: "Michael Fay is a clever and resourceful man who clearly shows no concern for public safety if he's willing to work without the correct licences and medical certification."He targeted Libyan aviation at a time when the country's political and economic standing was vulnerable and volatile. Had it not been for the quick thinking of a genuine pilot on the internet forum, Fay may have continued to put the public at risk in this manner unnoticed."Fay worked for Afriqiyah Airways from 1 June 2010 to the day of his arrest on 3 February 2011.He will serve 18 months and two weeks of his sentence before he will be released.
