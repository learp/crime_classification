The home secretary, David Blunkett, has introduced two more measures today to tackle the "corrosive impact on communities" of antisocial behaviour.The criminal justice white paper launched by Mr Blunkett said that councils and police need more powers than were currently available to address problems caused by nuisance neighbours. It also conceded that more support was needed for offenders.Under the plan authorities would be able to issue new "individual support orders" aimed at changing the behaviour of young people who terrorise their neighbourhoods. The orders will involve counselling or educational activities for offenders aged under 18. The orders will be issued alongside antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos) under which people face five year prison sentences if they persistently harass their neighbours. Asbos, which have been criticised for being too draconian, have had limited success since they were introduced in 1999. The white paper said: "Currently, Asbos only prohibit, they do not support. This new measure will change that."The white paper also called for an extension of "acceptable behaviour orders" of the kind developed by Islington council. Under these orders a young person and their parents agree a contract with a council over how they should behave. The white paper conceded that such an order might be more appropriate than an Asbo where the antisocial behaviour was "less severe". The plan was welcomed by Phil Morgan, the chief executive of the Tenant Participation Advisory Service, which has campaigned for more measures to stamp out antisocial behaviour on housing estates. He said: "It's important to have a range of tools to tackle the problem. We need to find ways of changing behaviour as well as preventing it taking place in the first place. These new orders should help that."
