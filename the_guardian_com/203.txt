Gordon Brown's attempt to allow intercept evidence to be used in court seems destined to fail, a senior Whitehall official said today.Sir Paul Kennedy, a former judge who serves as the government's interception of communications commissioner, said that government pilot schemes intended to find an acceptable way of allowing intercept evidence to be used in court seemed to show that the plan was unworkable.His conclusion is embarrassing for the prime minister because Brown personally associated himself with the drive to allow this kind of evidence to be used in court cases.Britain is one of the few western countries that does not allow the use of evidence obtained by the interception of telephone calls and email traffic to be used in court.In 2007, when he became prime minister, Brown asked the former civil servant Sir John Chilcot to review the rules. Chilcot, who is now chairing the inquiry into Iraq, gave a cautious backing to the idea and in February 2008 Brown made a statement in the Commons saying that intercept evidence would become admissable provided that certain safeguards could be met.The security services are opposed to the idea because they believe that, if this evidence becomes admissable, they will be forced to reveal details of their surveillance techniques in court.Today, in his annual report as interception commissioner, Kennedy said that the Home Office had been trying to find a way of allowing intercept evidence to be admissable subject to the safeguards demanded by the government â€“ and that this seemed to be impossible.Kennedy said that during 2008 he attended various Home Office briefings at which officials discussed "the development of models" that would allow this evidence to be used in criminal cases."I know that operational live testing of these models took place in March and April 2009 followed by court role plays during May 2009. These highlighted real legal and operational difficulties inherent in using intercept as evidence within the UK; I cannot see a way to safely overcome these," Kennedy said in his annual report.Kennedy said that, if the government decided to drop the idea, he would welcome that decision.Last week, in a written statement to the Commons, Alan Johnson, the home secretary, said that his department had finished experimenting with the various "models" that would allow intercept evidence to be used in court and that work was in hand "to draw the emerging conclusions and test their validity".Johnson said that the issues were "complex" and that he would announce the government's decision soon after the summer recess.
