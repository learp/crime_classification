Your photograph of a bobby on the beat, amiably chatting to smiling children, conveys perfectly the romanticised image of "a gentler era when manners and people mattered" (Over-50s nostalgic for high tea and Rin Tin Tin, October 1). Notions of security in today's Britain might best be captured by the forbidding sight of a prison gate.The past 10 years have seen falling levels of crime, while the number of prisoners in England and Wales has increased by more than 25,000. Previously it took four decades, 1954-94, for the prison population to rise by that amount. Perhaps in this particular respect we have never since had it so good.
