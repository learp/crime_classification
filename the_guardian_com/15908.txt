A man who was acquitted of conspiring to supply cocaine and heroin has been sentenced to 21 months in jail after he was found with a bag of cocaine on him while he sat in the dock. Waqas Khan, 24, had been arrested and charged following a Bedfordshire police investigation into an organised crime gang which was supplying cocaine and heroin to people across Luton. Khan was acquitted of those charges, but during the trial at Luton crown court, he took a bag filled with personal items with him into the dock. Security staff searched the bag after he left the courtroom, only to discover that Khan had smuggled a large quantity of cocaine into court with him.Khan was subsequently charged with a single count of possession with intent to supply a class A drug, to which he admitted. DI Paul Baron said: “To turn up in the dock with class A drugs on him shows a complete and utter disregard to the law. Khan’s actions were beyond belief and I’m pleased that he will face a custodial sentence – showing that he is not in fact above the law. “Cocaine has a hugely damaging impact on people’s lives – even causing death in some cases, so it’s absolutely vital that those who supply such dangerous drugs are caught and brought to justice.”Seven members of a drug gang were jailed for a combined total of 52 years and six months in Luton on Friday. The men were part of an organised crime group which operated in the town from February 2014 until January 2015, during which time they sold heroin and cocaine with a street value of more than £5m, Luton Today reports. The gang’s criminal business spanned the whole spectrum of drug supply, from dealing at street level to bigger commercial deals.
