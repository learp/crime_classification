A sex offender was yesterday sent to jail for two and a half years after he admitted breaking a ban on his cross-dressing at night.David Harris, 37, a car clamper of no fixed address, was wearing an off-the-shoulder cream top and cotton skirt last September when he was seen by police sitting in his car at a spot said to be frequented by people looking for casual sex. Gloucester crown court was told he was in breach of an order made last June, banning him from wearing women's clothes, accessories or footwear in public places at night. He had been jailed for six years in 1998 for two convictions of night-time indecent assault on young women in Stroud. In one attack, he was wearing a pink dress and a black bra. Harris was released on licence in 2002, but recalled to prison the following year after being seen in women's clothing. Just before his re-release at the end of his sentence in June 2004, the Sexual Offenders' Order was made by magistrates. Dressed yesterday in a black jacket and trousers, Harris pleaded guilty to breaching the order. Last September he was found by police at Shab Hill in Gloucestershire. His barrister, Paul Cook, said he cross-dressed when in a "stressed state of mind". Despite acknowledging Shab Hill's reputation, he said he went there as a "quiet spot where he could sit in his car". Judge Paul Darlow told Harris he had failed to engage with those trying to help him in sex offenders' schemes, was "high risk" and that a custodial sentence was inevitable.
