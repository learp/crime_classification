Not a single "alcohol disorder zone'' has been set up 12 months after the legal powers to establish them reached the statute book, the Home Office has admitted.The idea of the zones, first announced more than four years ago, is to help local authorities and police tackle high levels of alcohol-related crime and disorder not directly attributable to a particular bar or pub. Police can ban persistent offenders from an area and levy a charge on all public drinking places to pay for the extra policing. But the Home Office minister, Alan Campbell, admitted today, in a Commons ministerial statement, that no zone had been declared yet.Councils have indicated that they already have wide powers for tackling such problems and might not have reached this "last resort", said the spokesman.But the shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling, said this was further evidence that the government's antisocial behaviour measures were not working. "Ministers have introduced a range of powers which quite clearly those in the frontline don't believe work. Meanwhile, alcohol-fuelled antisocial behaviour is just getting worse."
