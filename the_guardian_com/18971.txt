A couple repeatedly gave the heroin substitute methadone to a baby during the months before her death, a court heard today.Holly Agius died aged 14 months after being rushed to hospital from her home in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire.Holly's mother, Bonny Richards, 27, and Richards' partner, John Davies, 31, admitted cruelty. A charge of manslaughter, which they denied, was allowed to lie on the file.The case has prompted concern that parents with access to methadone are giving it to soothe children, not realising how dangerous it can be.Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, told Bristol crown court the pair gave Holly methadone on "repeated occasions".Though few details were given of the case against Richards and Davies, it is understood that they gave her methadone to calm her when she was ill or under the weather, not understanding how hazardous it could be to a youngster.Safeguarding children boards in Gloucestershire and Herefordshire are investigating the case.Margaret Styles, who chairs the Gloucestershire board, said the inquiry would consider whether similar tragedies indicated a "dangerous culture" of families with access to methadone using it to soothe children.Styles said: "Because of the tragic circumstances surrounding Holly's death, we have a duty to ask whether it could have been prevented."As a result of what has happened, users are being reminded of their responsibility for looking after their children, being educated about the safe storage of drugs and that very small amounts of methadone can kill a child."We will also be asking whether this and other national cases indicate a dangerous culture of giving children small amounts of methadone to soothe and calm behaviour."Holly's family was known to social workers. Detective Sergeant Dave Shore-Nye, of Gloucestershire police, said the force welcomed the end of what had been "a very difficult investigation".He added: "The Crown Prosecution Service has accepted the pleas of Richards and Davies as reflective of their actions and both will now have to live with what they did for the rest of their lives."Earlier this week, it emerged that a 29-year-old mother was jailed for three years for giving her 10-month-old son methadone to stop him crying. Susan Taylor's child survived, but doctors warn he may suffer from behavioural and learning difficulties as a result.The high court of justiciary in Edinburgh heard that Taylor had "no concept" of how dangerous it was to give a child methadone.Richards and Davies, of Broadwell, near Coleford, were bailed until sentencing on 12 July.An overdose of methadone can cause vomiting and breathing difficulties, leading to coma and death in the most extreme cases.
