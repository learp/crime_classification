A court in Cyprus has acquitted nine British soldiers of involvement in a pub fight at a popular holiday resort.The men, who faced charges ranging from grievous bodily harm to criminal damage, grinned and slapped each other on the back when the verdict was read today.The magistrate, Elias Georgiou, said key witnesses gave conflicting evidence and the identification process leading to their arrest was flawed."The burden was on the prosecution to prove involvement beyond reasonable doubt and that cannot be proven to the required degree," Georgiou said. Captain Nick Ulvert, deputy spokesman for British forces in Cyprus, who was in court, said the outcome was "fantastic news". The owner of the Bedrock Inn in Ayia Napa – who claimed £4m damages from the soldiers – broke down in tears and told the court the men were guilty.Police said around 20 soldiers had burst into the pub, assaulting people and trashing the place before officers intervened.In their defence, the court heard the accused had not been involved in the brawl but had stayed behind to assist injured comrades. When police arrived they were arrested. Five people were injured in the fight, with one plaintiff almost losing his sight and a soldier taken to hospital with a fractured skull from being hit with a baseball bat. The soldiers, who were serving with the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, had been celebrating "millionaire's weekend," a tradition where soldiers spend their last pay packet at the end of their tour.They were partying in an area of Ayia Napa declared off-limits to British forces after the rape and murder of a Danish tour guide, Louise Jensen, by British soldiers in 1994. The Bedrock Inn, a Flintstones-themed bar selling cheap alcohol, is at the clubbing centre of Ayia Napa, which has a reputation for sex, drugs and violence, often involving British tourists.
