In the days immediately after her murder on April 26 1999, the police were open to all theories. They examined the possibility of a jilted lover, mistaken identity, a grudge-bearing criminal who had been caught as a result of an appeal by Dando on Crimewatch, a celebrity-obsessed psychopath and - the theory that attracted the most attention - a Serbian hitman.On April 23, British and US planes had bombed the Radio-Television Serbia building in Belgrade, killing 16 employees and earlier that month, Dando had made a BBC appeal on behalf of Kosovan Albanian refugees.During George's original trial in 2001, Michael Mansfield QC told the jury: "The television station was owned and run by the Milosevic family and was deliberately targeted by Nato, using a cruise missile, because it was seen as the main purveyor of Serbian state propaganda."Jill Dando by this stage had become one of the, if not the, face[s] of the BBC. In short, she was the personification and embodiment of the BBC."The police were unconvinced by the theory for a number of reasons, not least that three days hardly seemed sufficient to plan a hit on Dando, partly because at that time she was staying with her fiance, Dr Alan Farthing, rather than in her own house and on the day she was killed was just popping home briefly.Bob Woffinden, the journalist who specialises in miscarriage of justice cases and is completing a second volume of a book on the subject, believes that the Serbian hit-man theory still holds up.In an article for the Guardian before George's first - and unsuccessful - appeal, Woffinden wrote of the short time lapse between the air strike and the shooting: "The murder certainly hadn't been planned and carried out in just three days. But the police did not examine the theory in its broader context, or seriously consider that it might have been planned weeks in advance."Woffinden continued: "On April 11, Milosevic began striking back at his perceived enemies in the media. Slavko Curuvija, the owner and editor of the independent newspaper Dnevni Telegraf, who had been critical of Milosevic and his government, was shot dead outside his home in central Belgrade. Dando was killed on April 26.At 11.09 the next morning, a caller to BBC TV Centre said: 'Yesterday I call you to tell you to add a few numbers to your list. Because your government, and in particular your prime minister Blair, murdered, butchered 17 innocent young people. He butchered, we butcher back. The first one you had yesterday, the next one will be Tony Hall [chief executive for BBC news, and thus the man ultimately responsible for coverage of the Kosovo conflict].'"Hall was given police protection and told Woffinden that he never found out whether the threat was a hoax on not.Returning to April 26, Woffinden believes that the gunman could have had an accomplice waiting for him in a car, which would explain why he was not noticed beforehand.As to the identity of the gunman, one suggestion at the time was that it was Zeljko Raznatovic, the warlord known as Arkan, who was indicted in 1997 for war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague. He was shot dead in Belgrade in 2000.The Dando murder could have been the work of a two-man team, suggests Woffinden, and the killer could have flown out of the country that afternoon.That the Serbs have never claimed responsibility is no indicator of innocence, Woffinden said: "Claims of responsibility are made by groups such as the IRA or Eta. In 60 years, there has not once been a claim of responsibility for an assassination carried out by east European secret services."
