A man who tried to exact revenge on his ex-partner by attempting to gas himself and their two children was yesterday found guilty of attempted murder.The 36-year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, tried to kill his four-year-old son and one-year-old daughter by locking them in his car and feeding in a hosepipe from the exhaust. The three were saved when police located the fume-filled car.Bristol crown court heard that the man had separated from his partner of eight years in August last year. He was due to move out on September 10. On September 3, the children's mother left the house in Swindon for a night out with a friend, leaving the man to care for the children.Before she left, he begged her to give him "one last chance", but she refused. He sent a string of text messages to the mother threatening to kill himself and the children. She ignored the first message but after reading others returned home at 3am to find the children and their father gone, prosecutor James Patrick said.She called police and a patrol car spotted the missing Renault in a local park. The "distraught" children suffered no long-term injuries.The man, who said his "naughty little plan" was just to frighten his ex-girlfriend, was convicted of two charges of attempted murder and four of making a threat to kill. Sentencing was adjourned.
