Tony Blair's drive to tackle antisocial behaviour is faltering, with plans for a "Respect" bill having to be shelved because of the lack of consensus across Whitehall over what it should contain.The prime minister promised the Labour party conference this autumn that plans "for a radical extension of summary powers for the police and local authorities to tackle the wrongdoers" would be published by the end of the year.But during a visit yesterday to Harlow, Essex, one of 60 antisocial behaviour trailblazer zones, Mr Blair confirmed that his Respect bill had been downgraded to a Home Office action plan to be published in the new year. Other Whitehall departments, including the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Department for Education and Skills, would take forward their own measures to ensure the early identification of problem families and tackle the nuisance caused by their children. As well as giving headteachers more disciplinary powers, ministers hope to expand the youth service and competitive sport in schools.A Home Office spokeswoman said last night: "If, following the publication of the action plan, it emerges that legislation is necessary, we will seek the appropriate vehicles to take this forward."The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, added: "The prime minister's flagship bill appears to have been scuppered. If it means fewer gimmicks and more policies that actually work, that is a good thing."The fragmented nature of the government's cross-government drive against antisocial behaviour comes amid speculation that Hazel Blears, the Home Office minister who has done much to put the issue on the agenda, is to be given a seat in the Cabinet when Mr Blair completes the reshuffle triggered by David Blunkett's departure five weeks ago.One option is that the Home Office antisocial behaviour unit, headed by the colourful "yob tsar" Louise Casey, could move with Ms Blears, so that she could co-ordinate the campaign across government.Mr Blair yesterday announced a proposal targeted at small-scale drug dealers to lower from £5,000 to £1,000 the threshold at which criminal assets can be seized. He also said new Home Office research demonstrated that government action was having a positive impact on antisocial behaviour in targeted areas.In the 60 areas where antisocial behaviour orders, housing injunctions, and parenting orders have been piloted the proportion of people who say levels of antisocial behaviour are high has fallen from 25% to 19% over the past two years. Recorded incidents of criminal damage also fell by 4% in the past 12 months.But Richard Garside, of the Crime and Society thinktank, said the falls in perceived antisocial behaviour were unlikely to be due to the trailblazer areas as they were only set up last year.
