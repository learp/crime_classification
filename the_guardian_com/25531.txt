From the outside, Carole Waugh had an enviable life. Living in a luxury £650,000 flat in central London, the 49-year-old was fond of her Cartier jewellery and liked to tell people about her close links to the Gaddafi family, whom she claimed to have met while working as an accounts clerk in Libya.But her wealth made her a target for the "dirty rotten scoundrel" Rakesh Bhayani, the 41-year-old conman who was found guilty on Wednesday at the Old Bailey of her murder, after killing her in her central London flat with a single stab to the neck.Bhayani's sidekick, Nicholas Kutner was found not guilty of Waugh's murder but guilty of perverting the course of justice by helping to cover up the killing. Bhayani and Kutner had both admitted conspiracy to defraud.Waugh's body was found in August last year zipped up in a holdall in the boot of a car in New Malden, south London, four months after she first disappeared. Police investigating her death discovered a life she kept secret: single and somewhat lonely, she had worked as a part-time escort, calling herself PoshTottyFun.It was this that put her in the path of the "practised and extremely competent liar" who stabbed her and hid her body before systematically emptying her bank accounts."Carole Waugh's murder was the senseless killing of a woman who put her trust in people she thought were her friends," said Detective Chief Inspector Justin Davies of the homicide and major crime command."Bhayani is a confidence trickster who murdered her with the sole intention of stripping her assets and the belongings she had worked hard for."Waugh, it appeared, had started to become difficult, demanding that Bhayani returned more than £40,000 he owed her. On the night of the 16-17 April 2012, he killed her in her Marylebone flat, later recruiting a homeless man to buy "the biggest holdall you can find" in order to hide her lifeless body.Plans to burn Waugh's body in the Cotswolds were abandoned, and it was found in a lock-up garage in New Maldon on 2 August last year.After her death, Bhayani and Kutner had wasted no time "spending her money, using it to buy gold, use prostitutes and live a champagne lifestyle", said Davies, adding: "I hope today's conviction and subsequent jail sentence brings some solace to Carole's family."Waugh's family described her as loving, proud and fun-loving. Partial to luxury goods, somewhat preoccupied with money, she was single and independent, and had lived on her own since moving from her home village in County Durham in her early 20s.On AdultWork.com she described herself as "not a professional but an enthusiastic amateur" who could give "the genuine girlfriend experience" and was interested in "good clean adult fun".It was through one such site that she met Bhayani, a married father of two with a dangerously out-of-control gambling addiction. She lent him £40,000 in February 2011 and paid him £12,000 to receive treatment for his gambling.When he was arrested for fraud, she wrote in a reference that he was "one of the good guys", and visited him in prison. Clearly, she had thought they were friends. But, said Gibbs: "Mr Bhayani doesn't really do friends."Bhayani insisted they were indeed friends, but he was exposed as a consummate conman and fantasist who had illegally remortgaged his brother's and parents' house and recruited a series of lookalike women to pose as Waugh after her death, sending one to buy Chanel on the victim's Barclaycard.In the days and weeks after Waugh's murder, Bhayani and Kutner sold her furniture and jewellery, emptied the savings fund she had opened for her niece and secured a £200,000 bridging loan on her Marylebone flat.The money disappeared in a blaze of excess. Bhayani booked himself into the high-end No 5 Cavendish Square in the west end, losing thousands on roulette tables. Kutner, meanwhile, took a university student who needed help with her fees for a night out that ended at the luxurious Sanderson hotel, the next day losing hard at another casino.Later, he posed as Carole's brother, Chris, in an attempt to sell her flat.The pair were caught after trying to rent out her flat to two different tenants. Afterturning up at the property at the same time, the would-be tenants alerted police."They were exactly like the two conmen in the Steve Martin film Dirty Rotten Scoundrels – but one was a killer, too," said a detective who worked on the case.Bhayani was arrested coming home from a holiday in Mallorca with his ex-wife and daughter, but it was not until 2 August that Waugh's body was found at the garage, where Bhayani had left it on 21 May.Elie Khoury, 40, said to have helped to recruit the women to impersonate Waugh, was cleared of conspiracy to defraud.Previously, Julie Witham, 47, admitted to impersonating Waugh, and was sentenced to 140 hours' unpaid work. Three other alleged impersonators await trial.
