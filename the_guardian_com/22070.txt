The government's crackdown on antisocial behaviour reached a new watershed today with the establishment of the country's 100th special response magistrates court.Hastings magistrates court in East Sussex will be equipped to fasttrack antisocial behaviour cases, including graffiti, littering and "thuggery", the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) announced.The number of special response courts has soared since last October when there were just 41 in England and Wales. The courts are set up in areas where unruly behaviour is a serious problem. The court in Hastings will also run specialist antisocial behaviour sessions and work closely with the police, other agencies and the community to target local hotspots.The constitutional affairs secretary, Lord Falconer, said: "Yobbish behaviour in a community can and does deny people the chance to enjoy their every day lives. Nightmare neighbours, crack houses, graffiti and intimidation all bring misery to our streets."Antisocial behaviour is a real problem if it happens to you. The response courts and their ability to serve antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos) and other penalties were established to help tackle the problem head-on."I have made it clear that ASB [antisocial behaviour] response courts should be in areas that most need them. This wide reach will help send a message to yobs, 'We are in your neighbourhood; behave or the law will get you'."According to the DCA, local communities will benefit from the special courts as magistrates are "fully aware of what matters to the local community".Ken Bodfish, the leader of Brighton and Hove city council, said more special response courts were welcome. He said: "The speed with which magistrates and district judges deal with cases involving misery crime is sending a clear message that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated and that every breach will be treated with the seriousness it deserves."Particular target groups have seen how the orders and their enforcement can, for the first time, have a substantial impact on them and this has seen a falling off of certain types of behaviour."Mike Goodwin, spokesman on antisocial behaviour issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said the pressure on offenders had to be kept up.Mr Goodwin, the assistant chief constable of Leicestershire constabulary, said: "Police, courts, the crown prosecution service and other criminal justice agencies need to constantly demonstrate to the public their collective ability to deal effectively with public priorities and local concerns."Antisocial behaviour response courts ensure that the public's ASB priorities are taken seriously at court and that offenders are dealt with in the most effective way." This year, special measures to protect vulnerable witnesses from fear and intimidation in ASB civil cases will be introduced. They will include screening witnesses from the defendants, giving evidence through video link or in private, and the use of video recorded evidence.Lord Falconer said: "Supporting victims and witnesses is vital. We need to understand the impact of the crime on victims and witnesses and the need to offer them full support throughout the court process by treating victims and witnesses with the dignity and respect they deserve."The government is not prepared to see people intimidated determined that the law-abiding majority feels the criminal justice system supports them in dealing with the yobbish minority."The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "The government are being extraordinarily complacent about the problem of antisocial behaviour."They promised to issue 5,000 Asbos each year and we have ended up with less than half that number. The fact that a third of these are being breached shows the failure of using Asbos alone to tackle yobbish behaviour."
