Police urged the public to help them trace two paedophiles today. Jason Waller, 33, from Plymouth, and Dean Barnes, 48, from Merseyside, have failed to notify police of their movements and have eluded investigators for many months.The missing pair, who are unconnected, were added to a national "most wanted" list.Barnes has been missing since October last year and was last seen in Bury, Lancashire. He is wanted for breaching his licence conditions. He has connections in Merseyside and London.Waller has been missing since March this year and is known to live a nomadic lifestyle across Britain from Cornwall to Basingstoke, Kent and London.Detective Superintendent John Clements, of Devon and Cornwall police, said Waller was a danger to children.He said: "So far, we have done our level best to find him through conventional police means and we now want to extend our hunt for him and are using the power of the internet to do just that."Public support has proven to be invaluable in the past and with the additional eyes and ears on the most-wanted site we are confident that we will find him soon."Superintendent Mike Cloherty, of Merseyside police, said it was "vital" police trace Barnes as soon as possible: "By failing to sign on to the sex offenders register, Barnes has committed further offences and it is vital that we trace him as he poses a significant risk to children."Cloherty added that by putting him on the most-wanted list, police were "confident that someone will recognise him and tell us where they have seen him. He was last seen in Bury, Lancashire, in October 2008 but does have links to Merseyside, particularly Wirral, so I would appeal for anyone who knows where he is to contact us immediately."Waller is described as white, 1.75 metres (5ft 8in) in height, overweight, with light-brown short receding hair. He speaks with a West Country accent. He has also been linked to Devon, Cardiff, Brighton, Bangor, Guildford and Cheltenham.Barnes is described as white, 1.78 metres (5ft 10in) tall, heavyset with light-brown short, receding hair.The most-wanted website is operated by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) with the charity Crimestoppers. Jim Gamble, who heads Ceop, said 14 of the 17 offenders posted on the site had been caught.He said: "I am sure that it is only a matter of time before a member of the public logs on, looks at these men and comes forward with information that could lead to their arrest."
