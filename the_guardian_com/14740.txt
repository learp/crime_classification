Sun journalist Nick Parker was found guilty of handling an MP’s stolen mobile phone. That’s not a trivial offence, but it was not - in the circumstances - the main event.What we need to note is that Parker was cleared of the main charge against him, which was aiding and abetting a police officer to commit misconduct in a public office.That suggests, just as it did in the acquittal of Clodagh Hartley, that juries are not always convinced by prosecution arguments that leaks of information to reporters are illegal. Nor did they appear to be overly worried that newspapers had paid for such information.Parker’s defence counsel, Trevor Burke QC, argued that the paying of public officials for leaks is “horribly complicated” and a “very grey area”.Journalists on popular papers, where payments have long been common, would surely agree. Even though there is no public interest defence in statute for the offence of committing misconduct in a public office, the jury’s verdicts in favour of Hartley and Parker suggest the public may well think there should be.Indeed, it may be argued that the only genuine justification for both payment and publication is the public interest. And as every editor, lawyer and politician knows, defining “the public interest” can be difficult. The Crown Prosecution Service must now be wondering whether it was wise to bring these charges against these journalists, especially against the on-the-ground reporters who carried out their work at the behest of superiors who had sanctioned their story-getting activities.Both Parker and Hartley argued, quite rightly, that they employed methods that were custom and practice across the national newspaper sector. They did what reporters had done before and what their superiors knew they were doing.I understand, of course, that such an argument does not excuse illegality. Ignorance of the law is not a defence. And, similarly, it’s not ethical or legal to respond that you were merely carrying out orders - the so-called Nuremberg defence.The juries may also have taken account of journalists working within a long-standing Fleet Street culture and, to return to Burke’s point, the whole business of paying public officials is a grey area.Taken together, I think it unsurprising that juries have sided in these two cases with the reporters.
