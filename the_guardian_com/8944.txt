The rape of a 13-year-old girl on Friday could be the latest in a series of attacks by a sex offender who is believed to have struck at least four times in the South East during the past six weeks, police said yesterday.Surrey and Kent Police have launched a joint hunt for the rapist, whom they say is extremely dangerous. Officers are linking last week's rape in Surrey with attacks in Woking, Epsom and Redhill this summer, as well as the rape of a 10-year-old in Ashford, Kent, last November. The latest attack came as the teenager cycled through the Pyrford Common area. She was grabbed and pulled into nearby woodland, where she was then raped. Surrey Police said it was too early to say if the attack was definitely linked, but officers were not ruling out any possibilities. Detective Chief Inspector Bob Crampton, who is leading the investigation, said: 'All lines of inquiry are currently being followed. The investigation is in its early stages and we are keeping an open mind.'
