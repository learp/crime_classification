David Lammy is right to focus attention on the growing alienation of young people and the need for concerted action across ethnic lines (Why are young British men drawn to radicalisation?, 25 May). In recent evidence to the education select committee, Michael Gove disavowed the need for the country to have a youth policy. It does need one – and one which does not simply respond belatedly to shocking events but comprehensively helps young people towards acquiring the skills, values and experiences for leading better lives.Tom WylieFormer CEO, National Youth Agency• David Lammy dismisses "the suggestion" the Woolwich terrorist attack "was a direct consequence of British foreign policy" as "superficially compelling". What, then, to make of the 2010 testimony from the head of MI5 between 2002 and 2007, who said "our involvement in Iraq, for want of a better word, radicalised a whole generation of young people" and "substantially" raised the terror threat to the UK?Ian SinclairLondon• "… not the time … to debate foreign policy" (Comment, 25 May). As one of the thousands who marched in London to protest against Blair's war in Iraq, and were totally ignored, I now wonder if we should all have brandished meat-cleavers to gain the government's attention. And thanks, Martin Rowson, for that wonderful cartoon on "You're going to lose".Rev John MillerEdinburgh• Among Theresa May's proposals to counter Islamist extremism (Report, 27 May), a broadcasting ban, like the one imposed on Sinn Féin in 1988, merits consideration. That measure consigned the party to total obscurity. Who now remembers the names of Jimmy Adams or Martin O'Guinness? Without the ban, Sinn Féin could well have become a significant player in Northern Irish politics.
