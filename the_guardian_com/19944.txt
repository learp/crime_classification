Eight West Midlands police officers and one member of police staff will face misconduct proceedings after the alleged assault and racial abuse of a former roadie for the band The Clash.Donville Lorenzo was arrested at his Edgbaston flat over an assault allegation and detained at Bournville police station in Birmingham in November 2007. Lorenzo claimed he was held in a police cell for more than 23 hours, during which time he was punched, kicked, dragged down five flights of stairs and racially abused by officers. The assault allegation was later withdrawn and a conviction for assaulting an officer in custody was quashed on appeal.Police satisfied with stop and search reform despite racial inequality In 2008 West Midlands police’s professional standards department found its officers had no case to answer following accusations of misconduct, but Lorenzo was awarded £17,000 in damages after a civil trial in October 2011.In June 2013, the Independent Police Complaints Commission announced it would investigate Lorenzo’s treatment and, on Monday evening, the IPCC commissioner for the West Midlands, Derrick Campbell, announced its decision. “This was a complicated case given the length of time since the original incident, the legal background to it and the nature of the allegations,” he said.“We have conducted a very thorough investigation and having discussed our report with the force it was agreed that a total of nine officers and staff should face misconduct proceedings, and that will take place in due course.”Another two former officers were found to have cases to answer for misconduct and gross misconduct, but no action can be taken against them because they have retired.

The actions of a further eight police officers were investigated and they were found to have no case to answer. Of those who will face procedures, four constables and an inspector will face combined gross misconduct hearings, and one constable will face a separate gross misconduct hearing.A sergeant and a constable will face misconduct hearings and a member of staff has been referred to the police staff disciplinary procedure. Lorenzo, 62, was a roadie with the band The Clash before having a career as an African drummer, which he claims was cut short because of wrist injuries sustained when he was assaulted by police.Lorenzo told the BBC: “The force have tried to defend what was indefensible but I am no longer surprised, as this denial has always been part of their philosophy; ‘never admit anything’, just use a defence to discredit.“Unfortunately the force are still in denial that racism in their ranks is still prevalent so they will use the resources they have to defend that stance and hope that complaints such as mine will just go away.”A West Midlands police spokesperson said: “We are aware of the findings from the Independent Police Complaints Commission’s investigation and will work alongside the IPCC while misconduct proceedings are ongoing.”
