If even the lowest estimate of 236 murders is correct, Harold Shipman would become one of the worst serial killers of all time.In the past 100 years, only the murderous exploits of the Colombian serial killer Pedro Lopez come close to matching Shipman's toll. Lopez, branded "the monster of the Andes", raped and killed 300 young girls through Colombia, Ecuador and Peru during the 1970s. In 1999 Luis Alfredo Gavarito, also a Colombian, confessed to the rape, torture and murder of 140 children. Until Shipman the most prolific British serial killer since 1900 was Dennis Nilsen, who confessed to murdering up to 16 young men, and was convicted for the murder of six. The Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, murdered 13 women, beginning in October 1975. Fred West is thought to have killed 12 people at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. The most prolific of British murderers, until Shipman, was Mary Ann Cotton, who was hanged in Durham prison in 1873. She married three times and over 20 years used arsenic to poison as many as 21 people.
