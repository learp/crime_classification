Unlike in the case of James Bulger's killers in 1993, the trial judge in the Edlington torture case has made it very clear that he does not believe any public good will be served by naming the two young brothers involved.Under section 39 of the Childrens and Young Persons Act courts can direct the media not to report any details that could identify child offenders. Such orders can be reversed in certain exceptional cases. Most notably this was done when Bulger's killers, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, were named after their conviction. They had to be given new identities, at considerable public expense, on their release on 2001 to avoid revenge attacks.Mr Justice Keith told Sheffield crown court that he would not allow naming of the Edlington pair, who were 10 and 11 when they carried out the attacks. "It is questionable whether their identities really are a matter of public interest," he said.A local newspaper in Sheffield and the families of the two victims asked for the boys to be named, arguing it would be a deterrent to future young offenders if they knew their names could be revealed.The judge said that while the public had a "legitimate interest" in knowing the full details of court cases, naming the boys would add nothing to understanding of the crime or the wider issues it raised. Against this were three "compelling" arguments in keeping the boys' anonymity.Firstly, he said, the boys could be "ostracised or harassed" in their secure children's homes if other residents knew what they had done. Secondly, their family – who have already fled Doncaster after threats – would have to be moved at public expense.Thirdly, he said, the brothers would, like the Bulger killers, have to be given new identities on their release, which would in effect negate the reasoning behind naming them.
