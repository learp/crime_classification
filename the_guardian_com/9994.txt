Max Hastings' concern is that the media's "remorseless and speculative coverage" of the McCann case will "irreparably damage the reputation of the family" (Comment, September 10). While media reporting has a part to play, the reputation of Kate and Gerry McCann continues to hinge on the outcome of the Portuguese police investigation. The crucial questions to ask at this stage relate to the broader implications of an intensified media spotlight on issues of crime and justice. Our research indicates that the rules of reporting crime have changed. Today, it is a fully interactive, "red-button" process - as starkly illustrated in the Madeleine McCann case.With the advent of a 24/7 news culture, it has become a requirement for victim's families to engage with the media to seek justice for their loved ones. This requirement is bolstered at every stage - from information-gathering, through police investigation, to ongoing media campaigns to keep certain victims in the public eye and, ultimately, the arrest, prosecution and sentencing of an offender. For victims' families, this is a high-risk, but increasingly unavoidable strategy. No matter how media-savvy those in the spotlight may appear, there is no way of controlling the twists and turns of an investigation, and no way of determining how the media will choose to report crime cases.Formal criminal justice is constrained by due process. During "trial by media", due process - and the attendant legal requirement to provide evidence of guilt - gives way to moral speculation about the actions and motives of key protagonists. This is creating a volatile climate in which sections of the media take the lead in defining who is guilty and who is innocent in the court of public opinion. What is at stake is more than the reputation of one family. Obsessive media reporting is reshaping how we think about crime and justice.
