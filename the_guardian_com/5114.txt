Singer Amy Winehouse's husband was yesterday jailed for a "vicious" attack on a former pub landlord and a £200,000 bribe attempt to escape justice. Blake Fielder-Civil was sentenced to 27 months at Snaresbrook crown court. His wife was absent from the packed public gallery. After the hearing his lawyer, Kate Anderson, said: "In the light of the extreme efforts Mr Fielder-Civil has made since being in custody ... we are disappointed with the length of the sentence and we are giving serious consideration to appealing." Winehouse had said she was yesterday expecting to be reunited with her husband as he had already spent nine months in custody. Fielder-Civil, of Camden, north London, admitted causing grievous bodily harm to James King, 36, at Macbeths pub in Hoxton, east London, in June 2006. He also admitted attempting to make King withdraw his complaint with a £200,000 bribe. Three other men admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice.The court was told how Fielder-Civil and friend Michael Brown beat King so badly that he needed plates fitted into his face for a broken cheekbone. Judge David Radford told Fielder-Civil he had behaved in a "gratuitous, cowardly and disgraceful" way. The judge said Fielder-Civil was high on alcohol and cocaine when he and Brown attacked King and the attack was "vicious and one-sided". Brown, 40, of Carshalton, south London, was jailed for 33 months. Anthony Kelly, 25, of Chalk Farm, north London, was jailed for 20 months. James Kennedy, 20, of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, was given a 40-week sentence at a young offenders institution, suspended for 12 months.
