Police have made an arrest after using a stinger device – a bed of nails that can be placed across a road – to halt a stolen milk van that was being driven the wrong way along a dual carriageway.West Midlands police detained a 28-year-old man on suspicion of theft after the open-sided delivery van left a trail of milk bottles and bread along a major route in Small Heath, Birmingham.Officers were alerted at 3.35am on Monday after the vehicle was taken from near Birmingham New Street station.Patrol cars then spotted the cart at Camp Hill Circus, where it failed to stop for officers before heading the wrong way along the nearby A45. Its wheels were eventually punctured about three miles away, where a man was arrested.Ch Insp Simon Pemberton of West Midlands police said: “It’s not often our officers are called to pursue a milk van. The suspect left a trail of breakfast destruction in his wake, with bottles of milk and loaves of bread strewn along Small Heath Highway.“The van was being driven very erratically and dangerously, at times on the wrong side of major A-roads, so a decision was taken to deflate its tyres with a stinger. Even when the milk van was boxed in down a cul-de-sac, the driver was revving his engine aggressively and shunted into one of the police cars.“Our officers managed to bring the pursuit to a successful conclusion. No other vehicles were damaged and no other members of the public were hurt.”A police spokesman said the man remained in custody on suspicion of theft, dangerous driving, refusing to give a breath sample, driving while disqualified, and failing to stop for officers.
