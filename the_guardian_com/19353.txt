Parish and town councils will be given new powers to deal with antisocial behaviour, the prime minister, Tony Blair, announced this afternoon.He promised that the law would be changed as soon as possible so that smaller authorities will have similar enforcement powers to those which local councils, housing associations and the police already have.Mr Blair said in future he wanted the lowest level of local government, in both rural and urban areas, to have the power to tackle antisocial behaviour and to be able to levy fixed penalty notices for litter dropping, noise nuisance and graffiti.Extending antisocial behaviour powers was one of the three key priorities of the government's continued blitz against antisocial behaviour, the prime minister said.Other priorities were to extend the protection of vulnerable witnesses giving evidence in civil proceedings involving antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos), and the establishment of 13 more specialist courts to fast track the Asbo system, he revealed. Speaking at a London conference to the mark the first anniversary of the antisocial behaviour action plan, Mr Blair said the government was also committed to "bringing back community policing".He said the government had changed the law and introduced systems over the last year to tackle antisocial behaviour, but added that this was only half the story.Mr Blair said: "The thing which has been most inspiring overall is the way that once these powers were there, the police the local authorities and local communities did get together and decide how to use them. But we have got to do that right across the system." The prime minister said the drive to beat antisocial behaviour was dependent on a continuing dialogue betweeen "people and ourselves".
