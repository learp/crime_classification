A bankrupt businessman who allegedly beat his wealthy girlfriend to death in a luxury Paris hotel is to be extradited to France to face murder charges.Ian Griffin, 41, will be extradited over the murder of Kinga Legg, a judge ruled at City of Westminster magistrates court. He allegedly beat the 36-year-old to death in a suite at the Hotel Bristol, Paris, before placing a do not disturb sign on the door and fleeing in his Porsche.Griffin did not appear at his extradition hearing because he was being treated for kidney problems at St George's hospital in Tooting, south London. His re-admission to hospital came two weeks after he took an overdose in an apparent attempt to kill himself. His lawyer, Matthew Butt, asked for the case to be adjourned but the district judge Daphne Wickham dismissed the appeal.In her judgment, Wickham said: "It is my conclusion that, on all the evidence before me, I cannot accept that there is a certainty of suicide." She said it would not be oppressive to extradite.Following the murder in May 2009, Griffin was on the run for almost a week before Cheshire police found him sleeping rough in woodland in Chelford. His Porsche 911 had been abandoned close to his parents' home in Warrington.Legg was a twice-married mother of one who came to the UK from Poland as a student and developed her families' tomato exporting business with great success, selling to supermarkets and fast-food restaurants.A chambermaid at the hotel found her body in the bath of room 503, "battered and bruised".
