The Premier League footballer Titus Bramble has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and possession of a class A drug, police have said.The Sunderland defender was being held for questioning by Cleveland police following an incident in the early hours.A force spokeswoman said: "A 30-year-old man from Wynyard has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and possession of a class A drug."He is currently being questioned by police and inquiries are ongoing."Last year Bramble, who played in his team's 2-1 defeat at Norwich on Monday, was arrested by Northumbria police over an alleged rape in a Newcastle hotel but he was later released without charge.His brother Tesfaye was jailed for four and a half years last month after he was convicted of raping a 19-year-old a year ago.The football club said it was making inquiries but did not want to say anything more at this time.A Sunderland spokesman said: "The club is looking into this matter but due to ongoing police investigations is unable to comment further at this stage."Bramble's career started at his home town club, Ipswich, before he moved to Newcastle United under Sir Bobby Robson for Â£6m.He joined Wigan Athletic and then moved back to the north-east with Sunderland last year.The powerful but sometimes error-prone centre back was picked 10 times for England's under-21s.
