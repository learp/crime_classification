A property developer who spiked a woman's red wine with a powerful sedative in an attempt to have sex with her was jailed for two years yesterday, despite the judge saying he did not pose a great risk to women.The jury at Inner London crown court heard that Rohail Spall, a father of four, slipped the drug into the woman's glass when she went to the toilet during a date at a restaurant in London.But Kevin Murphy, a waiter Spall had earlier ordered to keep the woman's glass topped up, saw what had happened and warned the woman, a 28-year-old banker, as she returned to the table.She said after the hearing that she feared she would have been raped if she had not been warned about her spiked drink.She was said to be upset with how Judge Colin Smith had conducted the case ,and also distressed that Spall, who police fear may be a serial sexual predator, would be out of jail in three months because of time already spent in custody.Spall, 39, of Ilford, Essex, was found guilty of administering a substance in order to engage in sexual activity. He had claimed that the pills he used were to combat chronic anxiety, and that, during the dinner on June 13 last year, he had mixed up the wine glasses by mistake.As the woman watched from the public gallery, the judge told Spall that, although he regarded him as unscrupulous and underhand, he was not convinced he posed "any significant risk to young women of serious harm".The court heard the woman had met Spall in a bar at Canary Wharf, swapped phone numbers and agreed to meet him for a meal. Once in the back of his chauffeur-driven Mercedes she had to fend off Spall's repeated attempts to kiss her.At Fish!, a restaurant in Borough Market, south-east London, Spall told the head waiter to keep the wine flowing as he "wanted to have sex" with his "girlfriend". Later, he whispered Mr Murphy should keep bringing drinks, "even if she didn't want them". He added that he wanted "something strong, something special" to "knock her out".After Mr Murphy told her what he had seen, the woman called the police and officers found a pack of Xanax - similar to the so-called date-rape drug Rohypnol - in his pocket. Only one tablet was left. When they examined the boot of the Mercedes they found hundreds more.The judge said the spiked drink had been a "deliberate attempt to weaken [the woman's] capacity to resist any sexual activity you might make towards her."I have to regard your behaviour as a determined effort to get your way to some kind of sexual overture to the complainant by underhand means, irrespective of her wishes. I am quite satisfied here, despite this behaviour on this evening, you did not pose any significant risk to any young woman of serious harm."Nevertheless, the courts must protect women ... against the dangers of this sort of unscrupulous conduct."He added that, once out of jail, Spall would be subject to a sexual offences prevention order banning him from having any prescribed or over-the-counter medication "with sedative qualities" in a public place.The case officer, Detective Constable Arran Barnes, said: "The fear is there are other women he may have targeted in this way in the past. If this is the case, we would appeal to those women to contact their local police station. He added that he was "rather surprised" by the sentence.A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman said last night that the case could be referred to the attorney general's office as "an unduly lenient sentence".
