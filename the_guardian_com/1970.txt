Tony King, the Briton held in Spain for the murders of two teenage girls, reportedly owned up to three more rapes yesterday as police in both countries began tracking an alleged trail of sexual violence over nearly two decades.Spanish newspapers quoted police sources as saying that Mr King had confessed to the two murders and raping three other women on the Costa del Sol, where he has lived for six years. The reports said he led police to the scenes of some attacks. A convoy of armed police accompanied him. Spanish police are investigating whether or not his real name is Tony Bromwich, an ex-convict with a record of sexual violence. Bromwich was jailed in 1986 for choking with electric flex and then molesting a teenage girl and four other women in north London. A Scotland Yard spokesman said Cmdr Andy Beckett, head of the murder squad, would liaise with Spanish officers about sex crimes in the UK. Some Spanish newspapers said Mr King was jailed in Britain for trying to murder a man who had attacked a woman he knew in the UK. He was remanded in custody. A second Briton, suspected of providing an alibi, is also being held. Robert Graham, 39, a timeshare salesman from Greater Manchester, reportedly served time with Mr King in a British jail.
