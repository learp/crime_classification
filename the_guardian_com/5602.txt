Chaos erupted across prisons in England and Wales today after prison officers went on strike, with one inmate found dead and others taking to the roof of a jail.Police and fire crews were called to Liverpool jail after several prisoners climbed on to the roof in the wake of the prison officers' walkout.The former chief inspector of prisons, Lord Ramsbotham, warned earlier today that the situation in prisons across England and Wales was "potentially explosive" because record numbers of prisoners were being supervised by a handful of governors.One of the wings at Britain's largest prison, Winson Green in Birmingham, was evacuated after an incident as cold lunches were being handed out, the BBC reported. The fire service was in attendance.The prison governor at Liverpool jail appealed for striking officers to help to contain the situation on the roof in H wing, warning that police would have to go in.There are just eight governors looking after 1,300 inmates at the prison, according to BBC News 24.Prison officers on the picket line are angry that prisoners have been let out of their cells during their absence.But a majority of the prison staff voted to send in colleagues with specialist "tornado" training in containing incidents.However, the officers are expected to return to the picket line once the situation is resolved.Police have surrounded the perimeter of the prison and a police helicopter has been circling overhead.Earlier today a 39-year-old prisoner was found dead at Acklington prison in Northumberland, although staff said they did not think the incident was linked to the prison officers' strike.A prison service spokesman said: "HMP Acklington prisoner William Stuart Laidlaw was found hanging from a ligature in his cell this morning at 9.30am. A doctor attended but Mr Laidlaw was pronounced dead at 9.50am."Every death in custody is a tragedy and our sympathies are with the family of Mr Laidlaw at this time. As with all deaths in custody, the prisons and probation ombudsman will conduct an investigation."Laidlaw was convicted of aggravated burglary and sentenced to four-and-a-half years. He had previously been released on licence but was returned to prison for breach of licence conditions on July 7. He was due for release on March 26, 2009.
