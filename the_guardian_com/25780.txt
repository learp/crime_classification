Senior police officers today criticised a drama-documentary about the murder of Stephen Lawrence because one of its executive producers was the wife of barrister Michael Mansfield QC, who represented the Lawrence family at the inquiry.Chief Superintendent Des Parkinson, national secretary of the Police Superintendents Association of England and Wales, said he was concerned that last night's ITV film, The Murder of Stephen Lawrence, did not make clear Yvette Vanson's link to the case, and suggested it could constitute "part of a campaign by some people". "There is always a danger in this case that people won't know fact from fiction, particularly when it is produced by someone with close links to the case," he said. "There is a real danger in that and perhaps part of a campaign by some people. You would think from some statements that police were involved in the murder."  The parents of Stephen Lawrence both backed the "factual dramatisation" about the racist murder of their son in Eltham in 1993.
