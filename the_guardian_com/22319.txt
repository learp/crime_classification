Ian Huntley, the man accused of murdering schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, has returned to prison following hospital treatment for a drug overdose.The 29-year-old left Milton Keynes general hospital in Buckinghamshire, under heavy police guard.He was wheeled out of a rear entrance in a red wheelchair before being driven away in a prison van and returned to nearby Woodhill prison, where he is being held on remand pending trial. It is understood that he will continue treatment on the prison's hospital wing.More than 20 police officers surrounded the rear of the hospital as part of an elaborate security operation. Mr Huntley was surrounded by police as he was wheeled to the waiting van by medical staff.Waiting photographers had little more than a glimpse because Mr Huntley was covered in what appeared to be a white blanket. Earlier, the parents of Holly and Jessica said they were "reassured" that Ian Huntley was still expected to go on trial for their murders.In a statement issued through police, they said: "We have been kept updated in relation to Ian Huntley's condition. We are now reassured to hear that he is still expected to stand trial."Mr Huntley took an overdose yesterday inside the special "close supervision unit" of Woodhill prison, described as Britain's Alcatraz.Prison sources said he had taken about 30 anti-depressant pills that he had hoarded in teabags. The prison service has ordered an investigation into the incident and ministers are being kept informed.He is understood to have been in a coma when he arrived at the hospital in the early hours, but by today his condition was said to be "comfortable".Mr Huntley is due to stand trial for the murders of Holly and Jessica, both 10, at the Old Bailey in October. Mr Huntley, 29, a former caretaker at Soham village college, has denied murdering the two girls in August 2002. In April he admitted to charges of conspiring to pervert the course of justice.His former girlfriend, Maxine Carr, denies two charges of assisting an offender and one charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Ms Carr, 26, was formerly a teaching assistant in Holly and Jessica's class at St Andrew's primary school in Soham.
