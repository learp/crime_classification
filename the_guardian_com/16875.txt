One of Britain’s most notorious drugs barons, who smuggled cocaine worth £5m in consignments of watermelons and pomegranates, has been jailed for more than 17 years.Kevin Hanley, 52, who was considered the “top, top man” in the drug world, was also the brains behind plots to deal kilos of cannabis and amphetamines and launder millions of pounds in cash, a court heard.After his safehouse in Chelsea was raided by police, Hanley and his girlfriend Chrysi Minadaki, a Greek TV station owner and presenter, went on the run for eight months.Hanley was finally caught when he was lured to an Irish pub in Athens to watch the British and Irish Lions play Australia on TV.Following his extradition back to Britain, Hanley was sentenced at the Old Bailey to 17 years and four months after pleading guilty at a hearing that can now be reported.Minadaki, who had enjoyed a “high-flying lifestyle”, was also jailed for 17 years while Hanley’s righthand man, John Fowler, received 16 years. All three were convicted of plotting to supply heroin, amphetamines and cannabis as well as money laundering.The court heard that Hanley had been the key lieutenant of Brian Brendan Wright – known as the Milkman because he always delivered – who is serving a 30-year jail sentence.Hanley was jailed for 15 years alongside his mentor in 2001. But within months of his release licence expiring in 2010, he went back to his criminal ways, the court heard.He found a source of cocaine in Venezuela and used Fowler’s fruit and vegetable business as a front to bring the drugs into Britain via Greece. Minadaki provided the lorries and the fruit as cover for the drug smuggling, the court heard.There were plans to use strawberries, cauliflower and broccoli when the police foiled the gang’s plot.When officers raided Fowler’s flat in Chelsea in November 2012 they found £2.5m of cocaine, £200,000 of amphetamines, £61,000 of skunk cannabis, more than £2m in cash and two cash-counting machines.Officers from the National Crime Agency had been tipped off after a separate £8m heroin-smuggling operation in Scotland was smashed.Sentencing Hanley this week, the judge Wendy Joseph QC said: “To spell out the harrowing misery [of drug dealing], it’s not just the lives of the users, but the misery caused to the families of the users and the victims of the crimes committed in order that drugs can be purchased.”She told Minadaki, 45, and Fowler, 58, that they had lied repeatedly in an attempt to heap all the blame on Hanley.The judge told Minadaki that she had enjoyed “a glittering career in the Greek media but by mid-2011 things were going less well, but you are an experienced and capable businesswoman”.She went on: “You found Hanley attractive, as did he you, and you used every end you could to support his scheme to import cocaine. You created an aura of respectability to allow his schemes to flourish. Hanley could not have done what he did on the scale that he did without your help.“You lied from the beginning, claiming to have been a vulnerable victim of grooming by Hanley, but that can’t be the case – you are no naive girl but a hard-headed businesswoman who did nothing you did not willingly choose to do.”Matthew Edward, 49, and Richard Harrison, 58, were sentenced to six years 10 months, and five years six months respectively for the cocaine plot. They are already serving jail terms for supplying £8m of heroin in Scotland.Darren Barker, 49, received a sentence of three years and nine months for the amphetamine plot and Ian Doherty, 47, who was found with £160,000 cash in a holdall, was sentenced to six months for money laundering.
