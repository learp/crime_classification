Police investigating the shooting yesterday of two officers involved in a murder hunt have arrested a badly-injured man.The 23-year-old man was found with serious injuries in Halifax, West Yorkshire, a few hours after going on the run from a country pub where he was being questioned by four detectives. He was interviewed earlier in the day in connection with the murder of Zubair Munir, 20, whose body was found on moorland near Ripponden on Sunday afternoon. Mr Munir, known also as Bear, Treasure and Ninja, had been shot once in the head. He had gone missing from his home in the Thornton Lodge area of Huddersfield a week ago. Police had gone to question the man, who has not been named, at the Fleece Inn in Ripponden when he opened fire on them shortly after 4pm yesterday afternoon. A 44-year-old female detective constable was shot in the thigh and her colleague, a 39-year-old male detective constable, was shot in the stomach. Neither was seriously injured and both were released from Calderdale Royal Infirmary last night. Peter Strong, the managing director of the Chameleon Pub Company which owns the Fleece, said last night: "We had someone staying at the pub, and from what I gather, the police wanted to question the guy and then an incident took place and he got away ... It's quite incredible, it makes you wonder what is going on in society." He said: "It's a very upsetting incident, everybody is very shocked. This is a beautiful spot and it is totally out of character." Mr Strong, who has run the family pub for four years, said there had been no problems in that time. Beryl Browes, a parish councillor, said: "Ripponden is a pretty little Pennine village that's very quiet. "It's a country village where everyone gets on together and we are not used to this sort of thing."
