The father of an exceptionally gifted teenage chess player who fell to her death from a hotel window in July has been cleared of five counts of raping her.The jury at Guilford crown court, which began its deliberations on Tuesday afternoon, also found 49-year-old Ian Gilbert not guilty of two other charges of rape and four charges of indecent assault against other victims.The Royal Bank of Scotland director was accused of raping his late daughter, Jessica, at the family home in Woldingham, Surrey.The 19-year-old died in July when she fell from an eighth floor hotel room in the town of Pardubice, near Prague, where she had been taking part in an international chess tournament.She regularly represented England at international chess events, and the English Chess Federation described her as one of the country's leading women players.The jury in the month-long trial saw videotapes of a police interview with Miss Gilbert, recorded in July 2004, when she was 17.In it, she claimed her father started getting "too touchy" when she was about eight, and then later raped her, doing so around nine times over a period of five years.Mr Gilbert denied all the charges said he had no idea why his daughter would hate him enough to make false rape allegations.He said she was exceptionally intelligent and could have made up the claims in a bid for revenge, after the pair fell out during a period when he divorced her mother and left the family home.The court had heard that on New Year's Eve 2003, a drunk Miss Gilbert threatened to jump from a clock tower, telling friends she wanted to die because her father had raped her.The following year she got very drunk and again told friends that she had been raped. This time her friends told Miss Gilbert's mother what they had heard.She fell to her death shortly before her father's trial was originally due to start. It was postponed again to allow the family to grieve.
