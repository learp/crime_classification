The number of racist attacks on people from ethnic minorities fell during the war on Iraq, the home secretary, David Blunkett, revealed yesterday.The police and the Home Office made elaborate preparations before the war to keep a daily record of attacks on Muslims, mosques and Muslim centres. "It was the dog that did not bark," said one cabinet minister. Mr Blunkett revealed that he had spoken to Muslim groups immediately after the Commons voted to sanction war, but said he could not have predicted the domestic response to the war. One cabinet minister admitted the government had been deeply worried by the threat of a breakdown in race relations. In the event, Mr Blunkett said, the main violence came from anti-war groups, including what he described as armed anarchists who converged on RAF Fairford. Mr Blunkett also revealed that some of the individuals who posed the most potent terrorist threats in Britain had left the country during the war. However, his analysis came as a Jewish group said the number of anti-semitic incidents reported in Britain had increased markedly during the war. In the first quarter of 2003, 89 malicious acts aimed at the Jewish community or Jewish individuals were recorded, a 75% increase on the previous year. The figures, compiled by the Community Security Trust, record 43 incidents in March alone - the highest total for that month in 11 years. Mike Whine, the group's director of communications, said: "The increase in anti-semitic incidents is a cause for concern. The Iraq war fed anti-semitism because groups from across the political and social spectrum alleged that the war was fought for 'Zionist' interests."
