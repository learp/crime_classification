A 23-year-old Wolverhampton man was arrested today on suspicion of encouraging an act of terrorism in connection with a website listing MPs who voted for the Iraq war and calling on Muslims "to raise the knife of jihad" against them.The militant Islamist website, run from the US, is alleged to have inspired the London student Roshonara Choudhry to attack the London MP Stephen Timms.Choudhry, 21, was jailed for life last week after stabbing the East Ham MP twice in the stomach at his surgery.The man was arrested at 9.30am, West Midlands police said. A search of his home has been conducted, and computer and electronic equipment seized for examination.Detective chief inspector John Denley said: "We are treating the contents and implications of this blog very seriously, and have taken action this morning to progress our investigation."The website was forced to remove the page listing the 395 MPs who voted for the Iraq war after the Home Office urged US authorities to intervene. The site described Choudhry as a "heroine" and encouraged others to follow her example."We ask Allah for her action to inspire Muslims to raise the knife of jihad against those who voted for the countless rapes, murders, pillages and torture of Muslim civilians as a direct consequence of their vote," a posting on the site said before it was taken down.Choudhry told police she had visited the website, which gave instructions on how to "track an MP" and advice on how to attend an MP's surgery "where you can encounter them in person".It also listed the times and addresses of Timms's constituency surgeries and a telephone number to book an appointment.
