More than 800 police officers across England and Wales have been arrested in the past two years for a range of offences, including assault, drink-driving, rape, paedophilia, fraud, drugs charges and child cruelty. The number represents a tiny percentage of serving officers, but the range of offences will surprise many. Documents obtained from 29 of the 43 forces in England and Wales under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that, between April 2006 and August 2008, 812 officers were arrested. Sir Ian Blair, combating allegations of racism at London's Metropolitan Police, faces further scrutiny after it emerged that more than 300 Met officers were arrested in the period, including 123 for violence against the person and 17 for sexual offences.A spokeswoman for the Association of Chief Police Officers said new misconduct regulations coming into force from 1 December are expected to improve the disciplinary system. David Lindley, deputy chief constable of Leicestershire and Acpo spokesman on performance and conduct regulations, said: 'The police service expects good conduct and probity from its officers and staff at all times, and when we fall below that high standard we will investigate. The figures should be seen in the context of the overall number - just over 140,000 - of police officers, the overwhelming majority of whom serve the public with dedication. They also demonstrate that police officers are treated no differently to other people when wrongdoing is alleged.'
