He only spoke to confirm his name, age and address before being remanded into custody.MacMuiris's family said they had been devastated by the mother-of-three's death.It is believed her body was discovered at O'Sullivan's address by relatives who had gone to collect her for Christmas dinner.A family statement issued via Dyfed Powys police said: "We are heartbroken and devastated by the loss of our beautiful daughter. Our lives will never, ever be the same again."Charmaine was taken from her children, grandchild and all her family in the most cruel of ways on Christmas Day.
