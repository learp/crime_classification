One of the men who murdered the soldier Lee Rigby has been given permission to appeal against his sentence.Michael Adebowale was convicted of murdering the young soldier in broad daylight in an attack staged with Michael Adebolajo on 22 May last year.A spokesman for the judiciary confirmed on Tuesday that a high court judge had given Adebowale permission to appeal against his sentence on Monday.A full appeal hearing in front of three judges will take place at a later date.Adebowale, 23, was given a life sentence with a minimum of 45 years for his role in the killing at the Old Bailey in February.Unlike Adebolajo, 29, he was spared a whole life term because of his age and lesser role in the attack. Adebolajo launched an appeal against his term in April.The pair showed no remorse for their actions throughout their Old Bailey trial, and erupted with rage during their sentencing hearing, causing security guards to bundle them down to the cells as Rigby's relatives looked on.The two men ran Rigby down in a car before hacking him to death in the street near Woolwich Barracks in south-east London.They both claimed that they were "soldiers of Allah" and were motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing.
