An 18-year-old was arrested with her partner in Plymouth on Saturday night after offering to sell her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter.Plain clothes officers from Devon and Cornwall constabulary held the couple at the Copthorne Hotel after the woman and the 21-year-old man had touted the toddler for Â£15,000. The couple were taken into Charles Cross police station in the city and were last night being interviewed there by detectives. The child, who has not been named by police, has been taken into the care of social services at an undisclosed location. The arrests followed an undercover operation by the News of the World newspaper. The tabloid contacted the couple after a tipoff from a computer expert whom the couple had approached for information about how to sell their child on the internet. After a series of meetings, the newspaper claimed, the mother signed a contract with a News of the World journalist, promising never to see the child again and handing over legal rights. A police spokesman said charges could range from obtaining money by deception, if the couple were not planning to hand over the child, to any crime which the purchasers might have carried out against the child. The woman told the newspaper: "I don't want her. I've never bothered with her really. I won't miss her. I haven't got time for her, really. She needs a lot of attention 24-7." Her partner claimed that the small girl would "forget everything when she's with new people". He added: "It's when they're four or five that they start remembering." A police spokesman said that it was the first time the Devon and Cornwall force had come across such a proposed transaction.
