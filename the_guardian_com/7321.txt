Judges are to be told to make clearer to the public the minimum and maximum jail terms that dangerous offenders should serve, as part of a sentencing shakeup proposed by the home secretary, John Reid, yesterday.They will have to use US courtroom-style language such as "five to 10 years" to make clear that an offender may be released after five, but could be returned to jail if he or she breaches the terms of release. But the sentencing package, which is to form the centrepiece of next week's Queen's speech law and order bills, will also tell the courts to exercise "self-restraint" and stop jailing thousands of less serious non-violent offenders, in an attempt to curb the runaway rise in the prison population.Judges are also to be banned from imposing community penalties for 3,000 minor offenders a year who should be fined in an effort to reverse the tide of "sentence inflation" that has doubled incarceration rates in the past 10 years.This "tough and tender" reform of the sentencing rules follows a series of high profile cases, including the controversial sentencing of a paedophile, Craig Sweeney, at Cardiff crown court which mistakenly left the impression he could be released after only five years despite being given a life sentence. Mr Reid's decision to overhaul the sentencing of dangerous offenders comes 17 months after the 2003 Criminal Justice Act put in place the biggest shake-up in sentencing for a decade.It also coincides with figures showing that the latest official reoffending rate has remained at 57.6% - the same level as in 2000 despite Labour pumping hundreds of millions of new money into the prison and probation services. The Home Office figures show that prison still does not work for the majority of inmates, with 66% of men reoffending within two years of their release compared with 54% for those on community punishments.Ministers also acknowledged yesterday that they want to stabilise the soaring prison population, which now exceeds 79,000, while protecting the public from the most dangerous offenders.The Home Office consultation paper, Making Sentencing Clearer, admits that the courts have not been using the community orders in the 2003 Criminal Justice Act as fully as they might. "The anticipated switch to these new community sentences from short terms of imprisonment that was envisaged has not happened but is a crucial part of the package of sentencing reforms we want to achieve," says the document, adding that the shorter sentences which were anticipated for non-dangerous offenders have not materialised.In fact, the courts have enthusiastically embraced the "tough parts" of the 2003 Criminal Justice Act with more than 1,600 offenders - three times as many as anticipated - given new "indeterminate" sentences with no fixed release date, while ministers have shelved the custody-plus sentence which would have taken many less serious short term prisoners out of jail.Ministers say that fines are now much better enforced and the courts should use them instead of community penalties for low-level offenders. Community penalties, which can include curfews and drug rehab, should be used instead of short prison sentences for non-violent prisoners. The consultation paper anticipates that as a result of the changes between 2,800 and 3,400 fewer low-level offenders will be given a community penalty, but will be fined instead.The Home Office estimates that the changes to the sentencing of the more dangerous offenders proposed yesterday will add about 110 to the daily prison population because they will only affect a few offenders.The consultation paper published yesterday sets out five options for reforming the way the new indeterminate life sentence, as handed down in the Craig Sweeney case, will operate.The options are:· Make the headline sentence clearer by using US phraseology of "six years to life" to indicate what the minimum and maximum term of the sentence may be;· Judge to recommend to parole board a minimum term to be served for punishment plus a minimum term for public protection;· Trial judge passes life sentence then adjourns while risk assessment is carried out before recommendation of time to be served for public protection;· Judge imposes "top up" added years in cases to "reflect public confidence issues where an offender is dangerous" - judges are currently banned from doing this;· Ban the automatic "halving" of the prison term when calculating the sentence in cases of "exceptional high seriousness".It is thought ministers are most likely to adopt only the first option, rejecting the more radical fourth option.Mr Reid said the proposals were designed to strengthen judges' hands so they have greater discretion to impose even tougher sentences on offenders they believe pose a very serious risk.But Harry Fletcher of Napo, the probation union, said it seemed extraordinary that the government was changing sentencing practice again when it was last fundamentally revised in 2003. "This is a reaction to the Sweeney case where the judge followed existing guidelines. Introducing discretion into decisions on release of longer-term prisoners will increase the prison population significantly at a time when the system cannot cope."
