Armed men freed a suspected violent criminal today after holding up a prison van with a shotgun.Wayne Joseph Connor, 20, was freed at 7.30am by two men wearing balaclavas who forced the van to pull over, smashed the driver's window, threatened him, and demanded Connor's release. Connor got into the men's dark blue car and the three drove off.The van driver was treated for cuts and bruises from the window being smashed. Neither the driver nor the van's guard were assaulted. No shots were fired.Police warned the public not to approach the men and to call 999 immediately if they were spotted. A search was under way involving a police helicopter, specialist search teams and dog handlers.The prisoner was being transported from Feltham remand centre in west London to court for trial on charges of aggravated burglary and grievous bodily harm when the two men forced the van to pull over at a roundabout near Bedfont Lake in Feltham.Connor had been due to stand trial today alongside two other men at Woolwich crown court, including Jason McInerney, 21, who escaped from custody last March during a court appearance. He was recaptured several days later.Today, Connor, McInerney and the third man were due in court to stand trial for racially aggravated assault during a burglary in West Drayton on 4 August last year.It is understood that McInerney was not in the prison van with Connor and was being held at a prison elsewhere. Two prisoners who were in the van with Connor were detained at the scene.Serco, the company that runs court escort services for the Ministry of Justice, takes up to 20 van loads of prisoners a day from Feltham to courts, prisons and police stations around south-east England. It is not clear how Connor's accomplices knew where to find him, although there was some speculation that Connor may have managed to get hold of a mobile phone.Speaking at the scene, Detective Inspector Alan Holford suggested the men might use false names and asked hotels to be vigilant. "It is not just about finding Mr Connor, but also about finding the men who brandished a firearm on the streets of Feltham this morning," he said.A Metropolitan police spokeswoman said: "If you know where Wayne Connor is, do not approach him â€“ ring police immediately."
