The mother of murdered schoolboy Jimmy Mizen vowed she would not let bitterness destroy her family at a memorial service for her son yesterday.Margaret Mizen, 55, said the family of the suspect in Jimmy's killing should not be blamed: 'Anger breeds anger, and bitterness will destroy my family if I'm not careful - and I won't allow that.'Jimmy, who turned 16 a day before his death, suffered a fatal neck injury from a shard of glass at the Three Cooks bakery in Lee, south-east London, on 10 May.More than 500 people filled the Our Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic church in Lee, while hundreds more stood outside under umbrellas in the rain as the service was relayed through loudspeakers. Fighting back tears, Mrs Mizen, who said that her faith was helping her cope with the ordeal, told the congregation: 'If you see someone today, give them a hug. There is not enough hugs and love around. That is what is missing.'Her husband Barry, 56, made a passionate appeal: 'It does not have to be like this. Perhaps we all need to look to ourselves and look to the values we would like and our responses to situations in our life.'
