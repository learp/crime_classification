A woman who attempted to kill her husband by putting antifreeze in his curry was today jailed for 30 years.Kate Knight's husband, Lee, fell into a coma for 16 weeks and was left blind and deaf after she poisoned his food and wine on their seventh wedding anniversary, in April 2005. He also suffered brain and liver damage. The judge, Simon Tonking, said Knight had carried out "premeditated planning of a most callous kind". He told her she would serve at least 15 years in prison before she would be eligible for parole."The devastation you have brought to his life is apparent to everyone who saw him giving evidence in this case," said Tonking. "But while he did so there was little or any sign of remorse on your part."There were cheers and applause from the public gallery as the judge read out his sentence at Stafford crown court. Knight, 28, stood to receive Â£250,000 upon her husband's death and was hoping to clear mounting debts. Lee Knight told the court he knew nothing of the loans taken out by his wife in 2003 and 2004 that motivated her to kill him and claim a windfall from his employer. She had confided in her neighbour, Sarah Johnson, who initially dismissed her talk as attention-seeking. But when Johnson found out Lee Knight had been in intensive care for three weeks she went to the police. Knight denied murder. She claimed her marriage was an unhappy and violent one. The court heard she had hoped her husband's death would be blamed on his heavy drinking.She used the internet to find a method of killing, settling on antifreeze after considering using the drug ecstasy or iron tablets. After a jury found his wife guilty last month, Lee Knight said in a statement he had "hardly any independence" and had lost "everything I worked for".He expressed concern about the impact on their son, saying: "Kate has ruined my life and what she has done will have a big effect on [our son's] future."
