A predatory paedophile, whose rape victim has never been identified, was yesterday jailed for an indefinite term.David Ernest Bye, 43, pleaded guilty to the rape and sexual assault of a girl under 13, and possessing more than 17,000 indecent images of children, at an earlier hearing at Merthyr crown court.Dyfed-Powys police believe Bye could be the first person to be convicted of rape of a child who has never been identified. He must serve a minimum of five years in jail before he is considered for release.The crimes were revealed when Bye, who lived in mid Wales but worked as an accountant in Reading, had to call in IT support for a problem with his laptop.More than 17,000 indecent images of children were found on the laptop, of which he had taken 202 of 10 different children himself. Some showed Bye raping and sexually assaulting a young girl.Ieuan Morris, prosecuting, said: "The defendant is a predatory paedophile and sexual pervert who secretly engaged in two known acts of sexual penetration with a prepubescent girl who was either asleep or for some reason not conscious, at night, in the isolation of his static caravan in mid-Wales."Sentencing, the judge, Eleri Rees, told Bye: "Over a period of 12 years you developed an obsession with viewing images of prepubescent girls. That behaviour escalated to taking photographs yourself... then graduated to touching the children and actual rape and penetration."The judge added that despite his admissions to police and pleas of guilt, he had not assisted officers in identifying the children involved so they could receive help.
