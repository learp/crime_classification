The commissioner of the Metropolitan police is asking the independent police watchdog to review its inquiry into the case of a serial rapist, to ensure it is fully satisfied with the conclusions.Sir Paul Stephenson is disturbed by apparently fresh allegations from one of the victims of the rapist John Worboys that Met officers laughed at her when she reported a suspected sex attack by the cabbie.Stephenson said: "Irrespective of the circumstances of this case I would take the dimmest view of any officer who laughed at a victim at any stage of any investigation."I have seen the reports from this victim and I've asked my officers to contact the Independent Police Complaints Commission to make sure they are fully satisfied that their inquiries fully balanced these issues."The commissioner said that he was doing so in the context of the IPCC's decision to stop short of recommending that any of the officers involved face the most extreme sanction â€“ a disciplinary hearing that could result in sacking or demotion.Instead, the IPCC said of the five officers who had complaints upheld against them, two should receive written warnings and three should receive words of advice.Stephenson said: "That is why I have acted to make sure they have fully investigated this and that they are satisfied that the comments [by the victim] have been fully reflected in their judgments and conclusions."The move comes as one of the victims and her lawyers have criticised the sanctions recommended by the IPCC. The victim herself has called for the officers to be dismissed.The young woman, who was 19 at the time she was drugged and sexually assaulted by Worboys, has said she is disappointed that none of the officers have been dismissed from the force.Her allegation of sexual assault by the cabbie was investigated in July 2007 but the case was closed when officers chose to believe Worboys, not the victim. Six months later, Worboys was arrested again and last year he was jailed for a string of rapes and sexual attacks on women. Police believe he is one of the country's most prolific serial sex attackers.The request for the IPCC to look again at its findings in the light of the victim's allegations could open the way for one constable to be reinvestigated over the claims. In its report published today, the IPCC did not uphold complaints against the constable at the centre of the laughter allegations. The other constable involved has since retired and was therefore not investigated by the IPCC.Stephenson said unlike other institutions, mistakes made by the police can have the "most dramatic and terrible consequences" that can scar victims for the rest of their lives.He said: "There were mistakes made by officers in the Met and those mistakes had profound consequences. Those were that we ended up with victims of the most heinous crimes that should not have been victims. I am profoundly sorry."It would appear the allegation that officers laughed at the woman is new and was not contained in her original complaint, made last summer. IPCC investigator John Cummins, who led the report, said he was first made aware of the laughter claim on Monday evening.Worboys, 52, of Rotherhithe, south-east London, was jailed indefinitely last April for drugging and sexually assaulting female passengers. He preyed on 12 women using champagne and other alcoholic drinks spiked with over-the-counter drugs to sedate them before molesting them in his cab.Detectives have since linked more than 100 crimes to Worboys.
