Prison officers in jails in England and Wales are to carry special "safety" knives in an attempt to increase the chances of prisoners surviving suicide attempts.The decision to issue knives to nearly every prison officer comes after such a move was recommended 17 times by Stephen Shaw, the prisons and probation ombudsman, during his first 18 months investigating deaths in custody.Prison service managers acknowledge there is a danger that the knives, to be known as "cut-down tools", could be used as weapons against officers but say that such a risk is outweighed by the fact that potential suicides have a much higher chance of surviving if they are cut down as swiftly as possible.The decision to issue the knives is part of an effort to reduce deaths in custody that has seen the number of prisoners killing themselves falling from a peak of 95 in 2002 to 78 in 2005. This trend looks set to continue in 2006 with 67 prisoners taking their own lives so far this year.Mr Shaw said it had been regarded as "best practice" for the last four years for prison officers to carry a knife, particularly if they were on night patrol alone on a landing, but in some cases they were kept in wing offices: "It is of critical importance to make sure that frontline staff carry a 'fish knife'. A matter of seconds can make a difference when somebody loses consciousness in terms of how much long-term brain damage is suffered."Some do store them in offices. Our view is that in all but the open prisons this should be a standard piece of equipment." Mr Shaw said the carrying of the "cut-down tools" was not like carrying a Stanley knife but he acknowledged that there was a risk that if the officer were held hostage the blade could be used against him. The blade of the safety knives is enclosed in a protective guard so it is almost impossible to stab or slash somebody or be cut accidentally. The prison service instructions that have gone out to governors in England and Wales specify strict security procedures to account for missing knives and to reduce their risk to others.A prison service spokeswoman said that about 90% of prisoner self-inflicted deaths involved hanging with a ligature: "Removing the ligature from a prisoner as swiftly as possible is crucial to ensuring the best possible chance of surviving and avoiding long-term or permanent brain damage." In jails where the knives have been issued staff say their confidence has increased as they feel better equipped to meet distressing incidents of hanging.The prisons ombudsman has warned that his investigations into deaths in custody have raised concerns about the much higher suicide rates in prison segregation units. He has also warned that while deaths in prison and police custody attract the greatest public attention they are matched by the number of deaths in secure mental health establishments.
