A shortage of courtrooms mean victims and witnesses face long delays in criminal trials, the government's spending watchdog has warned.In a report on the administration of the crown courts in England and Wales, the National Audit Office (NAO) said the worst-affected facilities were in London and south-east England. It found that about half of all cases committed for trial in Surrey, Sussex, London and the Thames Valley took more than four months to start."At these locations capacity constraints can contribute to long waiting times to commence cases, which adversely affect victims and other parties in a court case," the NAO said.By contrast, about 90% of cases in north and south-east Wales, and Humber and South Yorkshire, started within four months.The courts service was suffering from high levels of staff sickness and an outdated computer system that posed a "significant risk" to its operation, the report said.A total of 30 new courtrooms are being created in England and Wales over the next three years, at a cost of around £120 million, to help alleviate the delays. Sixteen of these are being added in London and the south-east.During 2007, the crown courts service dealt with 136,000 cases, up about 5% on 2005. The cost of administering the service last year was £382m.The NAO said the service's computer system for case management, called Crest, was "long overdue for upgrade or replacement". The system, introduced 20 years ago, runs on "ageing computers" using an operating system no longer supported by the manufacturer, the report said.On average, court workers took 11.2 days of sick leave – 1.7 days more than the civil service average and 3.7 days more than the court service's target.The NAO said: "Weaknesses in learning and development programmes increases the risk that individual crown court locations do not have appropriate levels of well-trained staff."Edward Leigh MP, chairman of the public accounts committee, which works closely with the NAO, told the BBC that some courthouses were at "breaking point".He said: "Long delays in starting trials do not serve the cause of criminal justice. I'm encouraged by the creative approach the court service takes to anticipate these problems, such as converting magistrates' court rooms. But, by preparing itself before the problems take root, it could tackle long delays and save time, money and worry."
