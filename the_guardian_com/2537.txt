A hysterical David Blunkett told the prison service to call in the army and "machine gun" inmates in order to regain control of a riot-torn prison, the former director general of the prison service, Martin Narey, claims today.In a response to the former home secretary's memoirs, The Blunkett Tapes, Mr Narey said that Mr Blunkett "shrieked" down the phone to him that he did not care about the possible loss of life among staff or prisoners during efforts to retake Lincoln jail, which had been taken over by rioting inmates in October 2002.Mr Narey told the Times that the way Mr Blunkett behaved during the riot convinced him that he was not up to job of being home secretary. Mr Blunkett's recollection in his diaries, published today, is very different. Faced with a riot at Lincoln which he feared might replicate the humiliation of Margaret Thatcher's last home secretary, David Waddington, when Strangeways prison in Manchester was seized by inmates, Mr Blunkett said there must be "no dithering"."If I have to ring [the then defence secretary] Geoff Hoon and bring in the army, so be it, but by dawn I want the prison retaken and I want order restored," he said after being told that prison officers had withdrawn.Last night Mr Blunkett categorically denied Mr Narey's claims and said that his diaries were an accurate account of events at the time. But Mr Narey's recollection of events makes it clear that the incident still rankles - even though Mr Narey was later promoted, becoming a second permanent secretary while Mr Blunkett was still home secretary.Mr Narey said he called the home secretary on the evening of the riot. Mr Blunkett was furious after the 25 staff on duty at Lincoln were forced to leave the wings to secure the prison perimeter. He became "hysterical" during the conversation and directed Mr Narey to order the staff back into the jail without delay.Mr Narey said that he told Mr Blunkett that he would take the prison back as quickly as possible, but would not risk staff or prisoners' lives. "He shrieked at me that he didn't care about lives, told me to call in the army and 'machine gun' prisoners and, still shrieking, again ordered me to take the prison back immediately. I refused. David hung up."Mr Blunkett has won few friends in government for the tone and timing of the diaries - motivated, it is said, by a need to replenish the funds he created for his three adult children.
