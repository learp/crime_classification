The Prison Officers Association represents prison officer grades and nursing staff in secure hospitals and has been warning politicians that they are playing Russian roulette with the criminal justice system (Threat to community sentencing, 8 March). The wisdom of professional prison officer grades is unfortunately not always listened to by politicians who tend to use the prison service as a political football, and my members are left to pick up the pieces from ill-thought-out policies that are normally underfunded and quick to create a headline. The so-called rehabilitation revolution is a smoke-screen for cuts and will not reduce reoffending.When you look closely, the major detail is missing. Nobody believes payment by results will work and few understand it. Nothing has been tested yet Ken Clarke is bouncing ahead, not listening to the concerns of unions or the general public. Front-loaded budget cuts are imminent, not just in the Ministry of Justice but in health, education, welfare, policing and every other aspect of life, and they will have a detrimental impact. Lessons of the past will be forgotten, such as the disastrous care in the community programme where there was no investment in community places when mental hospitals were closed. The justice minister in recent interviews talks about 20 years ago. These cuts are happening now, and are dangerous; too much and too quick. I am glad he has copied what the POA has being stating for some time â€“ that until you solve drug abuse, alcohol abuse, mental health issues, education and social exclusion, you will never address the root causes of crime, and our prisons will remain at capacity because reoffending will not have been addressed. Investment in these key areas will pay dividends in the long run. Cuts, not rehabilitation, is the real agenda, and getting something on the cheap.Steve GillanGeneral secretary, Prison Officers Association
