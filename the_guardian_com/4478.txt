A 24-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a series of sexual assaults on female students from Loughborough University.The man, who lives locally but is not a student, has been questioned by detectives about an attempted rape and four sexual assaults. He has been remanded on police bail to a date in May.All the incidents are alleged to have taken place either in Loughborough town or on the edge of the university campus between Sunday October 15 last year and Saturday February 3 2007.A spokeswoman for Loughborough today reiterated the university's nighttime safety advice to students and staff, which was compiled in conjunction with the police and the university's student union.Students are being reminded not to walk off campus on their own and to avoid unlit or quiet areas of the campus if alone.They are also advised to "drink in moderation" and if they do get drunk to keep their wits about them.Students, particularly women, are told never to travel back to the campus or home alone and never to take shortcuts through dark alleys, parks or wasteland.Travelling as part of a group or taking a taxi or night bus was the safest option when off campus, according to the advice.Any students or staff who think they are being followed should first cross the road and then head towards a busy area and ask for help, the safety guidance recommended.Students and staff are also encouraged to report to police any incidents of assault, or anything they see which they think is suspicious.Leicestershire police can be contacted on 0116 222 2222.
