A Liverpool garage owner with ties to the criminal underworld was jailed for a minimum of 25 years yesterday for the murder of his ex-girlfriend.Liverpool crown court heard that Anthony Clarke, 27, kidnapped Monika Szmecht, originally from Poland, before he stabbed her and set her on fire.Clarke, a former soldier, became jealous after the couple's year-long relationship ended and forbade Szmecht, 21, from seeing other men. On several occasions Clarke beat her and she eventually went to the police. When she demanded Clarke hand over £1,000 in exchange for dropping the complaint, he murdered her.Szmecht's ordeal began when Clarke told her he would pay the sum. On June 11 last year, the couple met in a car park in Croxteth. Clarke forced his ex-girlfriend into his van and locked her in a cage at the back. He later drove to a layby near Rainford, St Helens, and stabbed Szmecht six times before setting her alight.Sentencing Clarke, Mr Justice Teare said: "Despite her extreme suffering she somehow walked to a nearby house where she collapsed, naked and smouldering. And she identified you as her attacker ... It is difficult to imagine the enormity of the ... suffering you inflicted on Monika." Clarke's uncle, David Clarke, 46, of Walton Village, was jailed for two years for assisting an offender. He helped to dispose of evidence and obstructed the police inquiry. Clarke's best friend, Philip Savin, 29, of Bootle, was jailed for 4½ years for assisting the kidnapping and attempting to destroy evidence.
