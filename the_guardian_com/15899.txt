Detectives were searching today for a missing man they want to question in connection with the murder of a mother and her 18-month-old daughter.The bodies of the pair, named locally as Claire Ford, 19, and baby Charlotte, were discovered yesterday by police in a house near Wadebridge in Cornwall. Police said they wanted to talk to local man Christopher Robert Adams, 26, who is understood to be related to one of the victims. Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Boulting, who is leading the inquiry, said Mr Adams should not be approached. He is described as slim, clean shaven and with dark, short, brown hair, and may be driving a silver Peugeot 306, registration W737 LCB. Det Ch Insp Boulting said Devon and Cornwall Police were "very concerned for his welfare", and appealed to him to contact them. Police were called to the house around lunchtime yesterday following a call from a member of the public who was concerned for the welfare of the occupants, and they found both bodies inside. Det Ch Insp Boulting said the discovery of the bodies was "very distressing" for the officers who found them. He will meet other members of the investigation team this morning to discuss calls received from members of the public overnight. The house and lane leading to it have been cordoned off and police forensic officers are examining the scene.
