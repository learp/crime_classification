A nurse who murdered her elderly parents by stabbing them and battering them with an ornamental flat iron has been jailed for life.Susan Toop, who used "extreme violence" to murder her father, Arthur Toop, 82, and mother, Joan, 74, will serve at least 18 years.Toop, 54, killed her parents at the bungalow she shared with them in Bournemouth, Dorset, in November 2008.She told police she had killed the couple to put them out of their misery but the prosecution said they had a good standard of life and the attack came after her relationship with her "domineering" mother deteriorated.Toop had pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but was found guilty of murder by a jury at Winchester crown court in July.She was sentenced at the royal courts of justice in London by Mr Justice David Clarke, who imposed two life terms. The judge told Toop she had done a terrible thing, killing her parents with extreme violence.He said such a crime would normally attract a minimum sentence of 30 years but he took into account her history of mental illness, her previous good character and the many years of service she gave at the Royal Bournemouth hospital.During her trial the jury heard that Toop told police she wanted to put her parents "out of their misery".But Timothy Mousley QC, prosecuting, argued the parents had a good quality of life and were not miserable.He said the relationship between Toop and her "domineering" mother deteriorated in the weeks before the murders.Postmortems on the couple revealed that Joan Toop had suffered defensive wounds, suggesting she had fought back. She had 28 knife wounds.Arthur Toop died without defending himself and may have been taken by surprise. After he was dead his daughter continued to stab him, possibly because his heart pacemaker seemed to indicate he was still alive. After the attack Toop made an apparent attempt to kill herself.Christopher Donellan QC, defending, said Toop remained convinced her parents wanted to die.The judge said there was no objective evidence this was correct. Jean Toop enjoyed line dancing and worked as a cleaner while Arthur Toop was devoted to his daughter.The judge told Toop that although there was "clear evidence of abnormality of mind" the jury clearly thought it did not "significantly or substantially reduce your responsibility for the terrible thing you did in killing your parents that night".
