The government has rejected raising the age of criminal responsibility after the children's commissioner for England argued that the killers of James Bulger were too young to have faced trial.Maggie Atkinson, who was appointed as the commissioner last autumn, said Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, who were 10 when they killed the toddler, should not have been tried for murder because they were too young to understand the full consequences of their actions.Calling for the age of criminal responsibility to be raised from 10 to 12, Atkinson told the Times that a civilised society should recognise that children who commit offences should be treated differently from adult criminals.But a Ministry of Justice spokesman today ruled out a change in the law. He said: "We are committed to tackling crime, and in particular intervening early with young people to prevent crime and antisocial behaviour."We believe that children aged 10 and over can differentiate between bad behaviour and serious wrongdoing. We do not intend to raise the age of criminal responsibility. It is not in the interests of justice, of victims, or the young people themselves, to prevent serious offending being challenged."Custody for under-18s is always a last resort and is only used for the most serious, persistent and violent offenders."Only 3% of young offenders who admit or are convicted of an offence receive a custodial sentence and the government has expanded the range and intensity of community sentences available for young people, as an alternative to detention."Atkinson's comments come after James Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, met the justice secretary, Jack Straw, this week to discuss the return to prison of one of her son's killers, Jon Venables.Earlier this month it emerged that Venables – who was given a new identity and released on licence in 2001 – had been recalled to prison following "extremely serious allegations".Media reports have suggested that Venables, now 27, had his probation revoked over child pornography allegations, but Straw refused to confirm the details of why he was returned to prison.Atkinson said politicians should put the needs of children first and not allow themselves to be so influenced by the views of victims' relatives."The 'we are too worried about the parents' issue is something that runs like a thread through a number of cases. My constant song is 'listen to the children and young people'," she said.Calling for the age of criminal responsibility to be increased, the commissioner said even the most "hardened" of children who had committed serious crimes were "not beyond being frightened"."The age of criminal responsibility in this country is 10 – that's too low. It should certainly be moved up to 12; in some European countries it is 14," she said."In terms of knowing what the full consequences of your actions are, you are into older childhood or adolescence.""In most western European nations they have a completely different way of intervening with youngsters who have committed crime. Most of their approaches are much more therapeutic, much more family and community based, much more about reparation than simply locking somebody up."Atkinson said the James Bulger killing was a "dreadful thing" and Venables and Robert Thompson, who were 10 in 1993 when they were charged with the two-year-old's murder, needed to be in a contained environment like a youth justice facility and given programmes to help them turn their lives around.Venables's breach of the "life licence" under which he was released should help to force a debate on the effectiveness of the current system, she told the Times."Youngsters are usually tried in a youth court, [Thompson and Venables] were tried in an adult court. What they did was exceptionally unpleasant and the fact that a little boy ended up dead is not something the nation can easily forget. But they shouldn't have been tried in an adult court because they were still children."In a statement issued today, Atkinson said she regarded crimes such as the killing of James Bulger and the recent case where two brothers in Edlington tortured two other young boys as "terrible atrocities"."I empathise with the pain and anguish felt by all the families of the victims involved," she said.But she added that many other children and young people were being locked up for committing far less serious crimes.Criminal barrister Felicity Gerry, a specialist in prosecuting and defending child offenders, said she saw no need to raise the age of criminal responsibility.But she added the burden was on the prosecutor to decide not just whether there was sufficient evidence for prosecution, but also to ask whether the child was fit to be tried, whether they understood what they did was wrong, and to look at the nature of the offence.The Conservatives shadow justice secretary, Dominic Grieve, said: "Changing the age of criminal responsibility is not the answer. We need fundamental reform to address the causes of offending by children, including family breakdown, poverty, gang culture and school discipline."
