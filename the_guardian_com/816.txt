Police today named the man shot dead in his car in Sheffield on Friday night as Safrajur Rahman Jahingir.South Yorkshire police said Jahingir was shot twice as he sat behind the wheel of his silver Vauxhall Corsa in the Parson Cross area of the city.Three men are being questioned in connection with the murder of the 23-year-old.Police said the three men, aged 28, 33 and 36, were arrested in raids at different locations across Sheffield yesterday.After the shooting, which happened on Scraithwood Road at about 10.45pm, Jahingir lost control of the car and swerved across the street, narrowly missing a bus, before crashing into bushes.The bus driver rushed to help, and was joined by a paramedic, but Jahingir was pronounced dead.Yesterday, detectives appealed for information about sightings of a red Seat Leon hatchback car seen being driven away from the scene seconds after the shooting.Jahingir, from the Darnall area of Sheffield, died from two gunshot wounds to the body, a postmortem examination showed.Detective Superintendent Peter McGuinness, leading the murder hunt, said members of the public had no reason to fear for their safety."We believe this was a targeted attack and not gang-related," he said. "At this stage, we are keeping an open mind about the motive."Officers are conducting house-to-house inquiries and examining CCTV footage ... we already have some good lines of inquiry we are following up."The shooting came two months after James Kamara, 22, was shot dead in the Broomhall area of the city.
