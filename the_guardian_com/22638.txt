A 44-year-old man will today appear before magistrates charged with the murders of two soldiers in Northern Ireland earlier this year.The man, from the mid-Ulster area, will also face firearms charges when he appears at Ballymena magistrates court.Sappers Mark Quinsey, 23, from Birmingham, and 21-year-old Patrick Azimkar, from London, were shot dead at the Massereene army base, in Antrim, in March.The man, who was arrested in mid-Ulster on Tuesday evening, has been taken to the serious crimes suite at Antrim police station.The Real IRA claimed responsibility for the double murder, which marked an upsurge in dissident republican terror.Forty-eight hours after the double murder, Constable Stephen Carroll, of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, was shot dead by a sniper as he answered a call in Craigavon.The Continuity IRA admitted it was responsible for Carroll's murder.The two soldiers, who had been set for a tour of duty in Afghanistan, were killed outside the barracks as they collected pizzas they had ordered.They had already changed into desert army fatigues and were due to fly out of Northern Ireland the next morning.Two gunmen in a car parked near the base opened fire with semi-automatic rifles.As the soldiers lay on the ground, one of the armed men sprayed their bodies with further automatic gunfire.Four other people, including two pizza delivery men, were seriously injured.Both attacks provoked demonstrations across Northern Ireland, and the unionist first minister, Peter Robinson, and the republican deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, formed a united front against the killers.McGuinness, a former leading figure in the Provisional IRA, denounced both the Continuity and Real IRA as "traitors" to the people of Ireland.Colin Duffy, a prominent republican from Lurgan, Co Armagh, has already been charged with the murders.
