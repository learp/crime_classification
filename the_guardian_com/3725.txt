Six men were convicted today of smuggling 12.5 tonnes of cannabis resin worth Â£36m into Britain in a rusty tugboat. Investigators tracked the boat from Morocco to Southampton. Four other gang members, including three who were due to receive and distribute the drugs, pleaded guilty at earlier hearings. Winchester crown court heard that an Israeli crime gang used an eastern European crew to transport the drugs. Investigators who boarded the Abbira on the river Itchen took five days to recover 419 bales of the drug, which were later incinerated. The men will be sentenced tomorrow.
