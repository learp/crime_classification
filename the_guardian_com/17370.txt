A 19-year-old man at the centre of a sex abuse inquiry has admitted attacks on eight girls as young as 13 but more than 40 possible victims have been interviewed and police said more arrests were expected.Jake Ormerod, of Torquay, Devon, was arrested by police investigating a suspected paedophile ring at a seaside resort of Torbay which officers believed was grooming and abusing vulnerable girls who had been plied with drink and drugs.Ormerod admitted 13 charges of sexual activity with a child, eight when he was under 18 and five when he was 18, during the hearing at Exeter crown court. The charges covered a period of three years.He was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing on 1 July and was told by Judge Philip Wassall he faced a lengthy jail term.Police believe Ormerod was part of the gang that targeted homeless children and picked up pupils outside their schools, sometimes using social network sites to make contact.Thousands of parents were sent letters earlier this year informing them that the operation, codenamed Mansfield, was taking place.Following the hearing , Detective Inspector Simon Snell, who is leading the operation, said Devon and Cornwall police expected to make more arrests. He said: "We have probably only touched the surface of it. They have been hanging around schools and they have been preying on young, vulnerable missing children."We have interviewed more than 40 children and I do not think we have finished yet. There may be more arrests."Facebook is one of the features, Ormerod had an account and we are investigating the links that site provides us."It might be that people are not coming forward because they might be intimidated by these offenders. We will deal with them in confidence."
