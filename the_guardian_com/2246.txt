Detectives appealed for help yesterday in finding a distraught mother who snatched her two young children from foster carers at knifepoint and drove off with two men.The daylight abduction in a street in Middlesbrough was apparently carefully planned, but the officers said Shanaz Hafeez, 29, was in "a distressed state", raising fear for the children's safety. A national alert was put out for a red Ford Escort, registration number M679 NPY, which sped off with Mrs Hafeez and her daughters Salina, five and Sarah, three. The children's carers and other witnesses said the mother had flashed a knife before grabbing one of the girls;the other was bundled into the car by one of the two men. "We especially want help from the Asian community, Detective Superintendent Tony Hutchinson of Cleveland police, who is leading the inquiry, said. "We want to hear from anyone who may know where these children are. We want to know any sightings of this car." Mrs Hafeez has long black hair and at the time of the abduction was wearing a blue knee-length cardigan.
