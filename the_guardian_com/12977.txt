Police investigating the murder of a heavily pregnant teenager found dead after a flat fire said today she had been stabbed.Gwent police said a post-mortem examination on 19-year-old Nikitta Grender, who was eight months pregnant with a girl, revealed she had been stabbed to death.Local officers and South Wales fire service were called to reports of a blaze in a flat in Broadmead Park in Liswerry, Newport, yesterday.Firefighters entered the smoke-filled property and found Grender's body inside the bedroom of the first-floor flat. Her dog, a pug cross, also died in the blaze.Officers said the weapon, believed to be a knife, had not been found. The crime scene is cordoned off and is being examined by forensic teams.Detective Superintendent Geoff Ronayne of Gwent police said: "This is a horrific crime where two innocent lives have been lost. Nikitta was two weeks away from giving birth to a baby girl. This is particularly callous and something we very rarely see. When Nikitta's family should have been looking forward to the birth of her baby they are now absolutely grief stricken."We know Nikitta was out with friends Friday evening and visited McDonald's in the Spytty area during the evening, and we are establishing the exact time she was dropped back to her address, but we would urge anyone who was in the vicinity of Broadmead Park, was with her or who saw her at any stage from 7pm on Friday 4 February onwards, to get in touch."Someone must know who did this and we are urging members of the community to come forward and help us with this inquiry."A spokesman said specially trained officers were supporting Grender's family.Anyone with information should get in touch with police on 01443 865562 or 01633 838111, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
