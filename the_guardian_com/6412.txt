An unemployed lorry driver who offered the Ritz hotel in London at a discount price to property developers was jailed for five years today.Anthony Lee, 49, from Goole, in east Yorkshire, devised an "elaborate and outrageous scam" that extracted £1m from his victims, Judge Stephen Robbins told Southwark crown court.Targeting businessmen who were obsessed with prestigious trophy properties, Lee claimed to be acting on behalf of the reclusive, billionaire Barclay brothers who own the landmark hotel and casino in Piccadilly. He suggested that the brothers wished to sell it secretly for the bargain price of £250m.But Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay were completely unaware Lee was claiming to be able to sell the building, which is estimated to be worth £600m.Developer Terence Collins sought the support of Dutch businessman Marcel Boekhoorn to finance the £1m down payment in December 2006, telling him the Barclays had "secretive reasons" for selling the Ritz through a third party.Once the money was handed over the sale never went through, promised paperwork never materialised and the money was never returned, the jury heard.Lee claimed in court that the £1m related to a separate property deal he had with Collins. Boekhoorn, whose money it was, had never having heard anything about this.During the four-week trial, Lee, an undischarged bankrupt who had a police caution for theft, insisted he was just a "straight-talking Yorkshireman".The judge told him: "This con or scam or sting, whatever term is used, was probably motivated by your mistaken belief that Terry Collins had deprived you of another potentially lucrative property deal and it may be that this offence was done out of revenge."The judge sentenced Lee to five years, less the 25 days he has already served in custody.Detective Sergeant Garry Ridler, who led the two-year investigation for North Yorkshire police and received a judicial commendation from Robbins, said Lee's actions had not been "victimless"."It was well-planned, it was well thought out and there were victims," Ridler said. "Reputations were ruined."Earlier, Nicholas Johnson, representing Lee, told the court that his client was diabetic, suffered from kidney disease and had been the main carer for his partner until his conviction."The custodial setting has hit him hard. He is very different in his aspect," said Johnson.During the trial, the court heard that almost the first thing Lee did on receiving the money in his account was to transfer £435,000 to his friend Patrick Dolan, 68. Dolan, of Tottenham, north London, said he spent all the money on having a good time. The jury acquitted him of taking part in the scam.Lee was convicted of obtaining the £1m payment by deception. He was cleared of conspiracy to defraud between 1 January 2006 and 30 March 2007.Dolan was also cleared of the conspiracy charge.The pair's solicitor, Conn Farrell, 57, of Aldershot, Hampshire, was cleared of the conspiracy charge after he told the jury he was simply acting on his clients' instructions. He had been accused of lending a "veneer of legitimacy" to the scam.
