A robbery has allegedly been thwarted by firearms officers, the Flying Squad – and a quick-thinking 66-year-old woman who was on her way to a golf lesson.The strange events began on Monday morning, when armed police swooped on Perivale Park golf club in west London, in what Scotland Yard has termed "a pro-active operation".It is said that just before 9.30am two men with covered faces were seen running into the back of the clubhouse, where a security guard was collecting cash. After threatening the guard with a knife, the men made off with a cash box containing about £3,500.Although the pair were intercepted by officers from C019 – the Metropolitan police's firearms unit – one of the men allegedly battered an armed officer with the box, knocking him unconscious, before being detained.The second man was initially grabbed by the woman, who had arrived in the club's car park for a golf lesson. A third man was arrested nearby by other firearms officers.The injured CO19 officer sustained a concussion, two broken fingers, a broken bone in his hand and had to have 19 stitches in his face, but has now been released from hospital.Detective Inspector Neil Williams, from the Flying Squad, which is based at Tower Bridge, said: "This was a very violent robbery where a significant amount of money was stolen. Due to the swift actions of Flying Squad and firearms officers, these people were arrested and the cash recovered."Acting Detective Chief Superintendent Brian Dillon said: "Every day, CO19 officers are deployed in dangerous circumstances to protect the public and unarmed colleagues. I pay tribute to the professionalism of all the officers involved and to the member of the public who had the courage to assist police."Three men have appeared at Tower Bridge magistrates court charged in connection with the incident. They have been remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey in January.
