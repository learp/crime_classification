The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, yesterday backed a call by the attorney general for the removal of the ban on using phone-tap evidence in court.The DPP said: "It's very, very important we do everything we can to achieve this because we've got a big prize in prospect if we manage this. The big prize is public safety - convicting dangerous criminals."Lord Goldsmith urged an end to the ban for the first time in an interview in yesterday's Guardian. Although the move is not yet government policy, he was "personally convinced" after talks with prosecutors in the US that a way had to be found to make intercept evidence admissible in court.Opposition comes from the security services and GCHQ, who fear exposure of their covert techniques and a strain on their resources from fishing expeditions by defence lawyers seeking reams of phone call transcripts.Downing Street played down any suggestion that the change might be coming soon. Tony Blair's official spokesman said that while the issue was the subject of "ongoing active work" in Whitehall, it could not put at risk the security services' sources or personnel. "What we can't do is jeopardise the work of our security services through a sensible desire to use intercept evidence," the spokesman said.But those supporting the move yesterday included the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair; the chairman of the bar, Stephen Hockman QC; and Shami Chakrabarti, director of the civil rights organisation Liberty.Mr Macdonald said: "I acknowledge there are issues to be addressed and there are very real concerns, but we feel very strongly that we have to find a way through this."He said he had had extensive discussions with senior prosecution figures in the US and Australia, "and the one message you get is we could not operate in serious crime and in terrorism without this". It was "the last piece of the jigsaw" following new US-style powers for prosecutors in England and Wales to strike deals with suspects in return for their help in ensnaring the ringleaders. "The DEA [US Drug Enforcement Agency] told me they never prosecuted a major drug case without intercept," he added.He recognised that there were difficulties to be resolved. "There is a risk because of the way our disclosure rules work that the agencies involved in surveillance will be absolutely swamped with demands for disclosure by the defence."We have to find a way of doing this without placing intolerable burdens on the agencies. The way to do that is to allow access only to material that is genuinely relevant to the issues in the case."Counterterrorist officials say MI5, the domestic security service, is not in principle against using phone-tap evidence in court. But MI5, the foreign intelligence service, MI6, and the government's electronic eavesdropping centre, GCHQ, argue that conversations picked up by hidden bugs, which are admissible as evidence in court, are clearer because targets are less guarded than they would be on the phone.The scope for arguments between defence and prosecution lawyers about the meaning of words used in telephone conversations, or nuances used, are enormous, the argument continues.They say transcribing tapes would consume an enormous amount of resources because defence lawyers would demand a full transcript of a conversation, not just those extracts considered by the prosecution to be relevant.
