Police in the Western Isles have launched their first murder inquiry in more than 40 years after a missing teenager was found dead in a derelict house.Northern constabulary said they were treating the death of Liam Aitchison, 16, as murder after a postmortem examination.His body was recovered from an empty RAF building in Steinish, close to Stornoway, airport last week.Aitchison, who was originally from South Uist, one of the most southerly of the Western Isles, had been reported missing a week earlier, on 23 November, after being last seen with a group of people in Stornoway the previous evening.His family was called in to formally identify the body on Friday. They urged witnesses to come forward with information."We beg you: if you have any information and have not brought it forward as yet, we urge you, please go to the police. Without this help, we can't get peace," they said.Aitchison had a troubled past and a history of minor offences. He had been due to appear in court for sentencing on the day he disappeared for allegedly assaulting an ambulance driver, yet the disclosure that police now believe the teenager was murdered will shock islanders.The Western Isles enjoys one of the lowest crime rates in the UK; this murder inquiry is the force's first there since the death of Mary Mackenzie, an 80-year-old crofter, in 1968.Mackenzie was found battered to death beside her bed at her croft at Brue, a township on the west side of Lewis, in November 1968. A sum of money was missing and a neighbour, George Macleod, then 21, was charged and prosecuted for her murder.Macleod, who has since died, was released when a jury found the charges not proven, a verdict short of not guilty, after serious problems emerged about the police's handling of crucial evidence, including the stolen money and his blood-stained clothing.Detectives have been drafted in from the mainland to help investigate Aitchison's murder.Detective Chief Inspector Kenny Anderson said the force had set up a major inquiry team.He said there had already been a "very positive" response from locals in Stornoway, but appealed for help in finding three other men seen in the area where Aitchison's body was found."In particular, we wish to trace witnesses who may have seen three people wearing hooded-type tops, who were seen walking in the Steinish village area shortly after midnight on Tuesday 22 November into the early hours of Wednesday 23 November," he said.A Stornoway taxi driver said he had already contacted the inquiry team to disclose that he had been hired by Aitchison after 10pm, the last confirmed time he was seen alive.The driver, who asked not to be named, said: "I took him to an address outside Stornoway late that night."Northern constabulary, which polices the largest land mass of any force in the UK, last year had an 86% clear-up rate in the Western Isles, which has a population of 26,500 but large numbers of holidaymakers and temporary workers.The force recorded more than 2,100 crimes and minor offences in the area over the period.
