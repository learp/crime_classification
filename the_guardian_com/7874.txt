The government antisocial behaviour adviser who came under fire after giving a raucous after-dinner speech is to keep her job, it was announced yesterday.A Home Office spokesman said in a statement: "The Home Office has investigated the remarks made by Louise Casey on July 7."Louise has acknowledged that some of these remarks were ill-judged and inappropriate. She apologised immediately and has been warned about her future conduct."Ms Casey, the head of the antisocial behaviour unit and a former homelessness campaigner, sparked consternation in Whitehall earlier this month when she used the speech at a conference organised by the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers to praise binge drinking, threatened to "deck" Downing Street officials and boasted how she liked to get "hammered".After the speech was secretly recorded and reported in the Daily Mail, Downing Street said the prime minister stood by the "yob tsar".But Ms Casey's comments, although intended to be light-hearted, apparently upset some in the Home Office.At the time Jonathan Baume, of the First Division Association, the senior civil servants' union, said he hoped the Home Office took "a robust approach".Last night the FDA declined to comment on the fact that Ms Casey would be keeping her job.In her speech, Ms Casey suggested that ministers might perform better if they "turn up in the morning pissed"."Doing things sober is no way to get things done," she said.
