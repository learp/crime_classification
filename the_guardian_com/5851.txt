Number: TT6221 Name: Wright Wing: H213 Dear DadThis is a reply to your letter you are right you have never seen me angry before because I am a quite and placid person whenever I get upset I tend to bury it deep inside which I suppose is not a healthy thing to do because the more I do that the more withdrawn I become because I have seen to much anger and violence in my childhood to last anyone a lifetime.But what really makes me sad is the fact that I thought all the family fueds were behind me now I really thought we had made a step forward I just wish everyone would get along and work towards a family unit because all the bickering and point scoring against each other is really getting me down it seems you are pulling me one way and pam is pulling me the other and in the end something will give and it just seems to me that person will be me and that is the last thing that I want at the moment has I am sure you do as well because if I start to fall apart at the seams I don't think I could cope in here I need to be strong to cope with this nightmare like that but you said in the paper that when you looked in my eyes you would know whether I was guilty or not that really hurt me it was like a knife in the heart for you to even contemplate that I could even be capable of such a terrible crime.You say you want to help me the only way that will happen is if you make the effort to work together because all this he said she said you must understand is not doing my frame of mind any good I just want it to stop I do love you dad but you must understand pam is my life now and I will always stick by her like she has by me she is having a rough time of it at the moment she has lost loads of wieght and is on all sorts of tablets when I saw her on tuesday I was shocked her face looked so withdrawn she looked really ill so she is my main concern at the moment she has made me the happyest I have been all my life she has pulled me out of myself it seems her only aim in life is to make me happy and vise versa so I will not tolerate anything bad said against her.I would like to see you but I need to be sure that you are behind me 100% and that there are no hidden agenda's Pam is makeing no money from the press so where you got that from I don't know for one thing she is not allowed to talk to the press because she is a potential prosecution witness not that I am worried about that at all because everyone that knows me is a potential prosecution witness even you!My head seems to be all over the place at the moment so please try and sort this out I know you are a proud man and don't like backing down but you are the only one that can sort this out you say you want to help so please do that one thing for meLove Steve
