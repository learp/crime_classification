All those who work in policing will be surprised that you can publish an article about the way the police handle reports of crime (Police tell victims to solve crimes themselves, 4 September) without mentioning the biggest issue in policing: the ongoing reductions in funding.The police service has already been reduced by over 30,000 staff and, as the home secretary made clear last week, these cuts will continue into the future. Faced with this, police forces have to constantly review every part of their operation to see where efficiencies can be gained, but this inevitably involves hard decisions on dealing with more reports over the telephone and trying to get more public involvement in reducing crime and disorder through the use of volunteers.The principles of UK policing as laid down by its founder, Sir Robert Peel, has always been this concept of cooperation between police and public, and history and experience show it produces far better outcomes.There is another issue here, however: recent reports on child sexual exploitation and domestic violence have shown that the police need to give far greater priority and effort to protecting vulnerable people. Given declining budgets, this will have to involve a shift from the priority given to some aspects of property crime, often the legacy of previous performance target regimes now thankfully abandoned by the home secretary and most police and crime commissioners.

Now suddenly it’s what we’re supposed to do. The problem is, as it ever has been, that self-help investigation leads by a short route to self-help punishment, invariably violent. So the police get involved again. Not very clever. A government that reduces police funding so far below safe levels does not deserve the title.Colin YarnleySouthwell, Nottinghamshire
