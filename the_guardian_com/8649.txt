It was her worst nightmare come true. One second, Sharon Waugh was on the phone, confiding in a friend about her stalker ex-husband. The next he was in the hallway beside her, pulling out the phone before he beat and raped her."He'd crashed through the front door, where he'd been listening through the letterbox," she explained. "The next day, when I was out, he broke in and hid in the wardrobe. When I came home he jumped out and stabbed me. I had to have micro-surgery for severed nerves in my hand. "Luckily, my friend had come back to the house with me. If I'd been alone, he would have killed me. She dialled 999 but when the police came they didn't arrest him, simply escorted him back to his lodgings while I was taken to hospital. "The next day he turned up at the hospital, threatening to wreck the place if he didn't get to see me. It was only then he was arrested. He got 6 years in jail, though he only served 2. "If he hadn't been jailed, he never would have left me alone. After we split up, he followed me every time I left the house. He phoned all the time, sometimes just hanging up, sometimes shouting, and he'd ring my mother, telling her he had just seen our daughter." Her story is typical of stalking victims, many of whom are targeted by estranged partners. A Women's Aid survey of 200 survivors of domestic abuse found more than 150 were attacked after they had left their partners. Although she suffered extreme physical and sexual violence during her five-year marriage, much of which took place in front of her toddler daughter, Ms Waugh, 38, from Surrey, said being stalked left worse mental scars. "I had a nervous breakdown, and my daughter, who's 18 now, won't go out in our local town for fear she'll meet him. She's still wary of all men. "Black eyes heal, but you never get over the emotional stuff. Even now, with my new husband in a new house, I still catch myself worrying he's waiting to pounce."
