A man has been convicted of Britain's first "web rage" attack after an online exchange of insults led to him track down and beat another man. The Old Bailey heard how Paul Gibbons, 47, went to the home of John Jones, 43, after a row on an internet chatroom, and inflicted wounds including a cut to the throat.Gibbons traced Mr Jones to Clacton, Essex, arriving at his door with a pickaxe handle and accompanied by a man carrying a machete. Gibbons pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding and was remanded in custody for sentencing next month.Ibitayo Adebayo, prosecuting, told the court the two men met while using a Yahoo chatroom dedicated to Islam. After communicating without problems for a period, Gibbons then accused Mr Jones of spreading rumours about him. He claimed in particular that Mr Jones had accused him of "interfering with children"."There was an exchange of views between the victim and the defendant which were threatening on both sides," Mr Adebayo said. "Certainly there was some hostility between the two."Police warned internet users to guard their identity, adding that Gibbons was able to trace Mr Jones because he put personal details about himself online.
