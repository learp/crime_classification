He was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital where he sadly died."Detective Superintendent Neil Esseen, who is leading the investigation, said it was an "incredibly tragic" case."It is being treated as a murder inquiry, although we are not looking for anybody else in connection with this incident, he said. "We are still in the very early stages of this investigation, but we are conducting a number of inquiries in order to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the deaths."A neighbour said: "It's shocking, a terrible thing. I knew Paul. He was a happy, jolly type. He was always jokey and loved football."He had moved away, so we didn't see much of him any more. His mother is on holiday so I don't even know why he was at the house."
