A woman whose body was found in a river alongside that of her partner has been named by Norfolk police.Annette Creegan, 49, of Mitcham, Surrey, was formally identified by officers on Tuesday after her body was found in the river Bure on the Norfolk Broads on Sunday.Detectives believe she was dead before entering the water, probably as the result of strangulation.Her partner, named locally as John Didier, died as the result of drowning. His death is not thought to be suspicious.Police launched a search for the bodies after finding a 13-year-old girl alone on a boat after a hire company alerted police that the vessel had not been returned on time.Earlier, Detective Superintendent Jes Fry, the head of the Norfolk and Suffolk major investigations team, had said inquiries were ongoing into how long the couple had been dead before they were pulled from the Bure on Sunday.He refused to comment on reports that the woman now named as Creegan had been dead for several days."All circumstances point towards this being a domestic incident and we will continue to investigate in order to put a full set of evidence before the coroner," said Fry.The man is not a UK national, meaning it could take days to obtain dental records and other forms of identification from his home country, believed to be the US.He was found dead near Creegan's body by divers, brought in by police, searching the river on Sunday.â€¢ This article was amended on 5 September 2012 to clarify that divers who searched the river were not police divers.
