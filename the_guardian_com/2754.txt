An extra £100m is to be spent accelerating the recruitment of police community support officers to get their numbers up to 16,000 by next April in England and Wales. The chancellor said the measure would mean Labour's general election pledge that every area would benefit from neighbourhood policing would be met 12 months early, although the spending is being brought forward from that planned for 2007/08.The Home Office has said it still needs to recruit 24,000 police community support officers to provide full-strength dedicated patrol teams in every neighbourhood. The chancellor's pledge to fund 16,000 officers by April 2007 meant that every neighbourhood would have a dedicated policing presence 12 months early but the patrols would not be up to full strength until 2008 - the original target date.The extra cash would also fund the development of a new service publishing local crime and police performance data. This would provide an interactive website with local crime figures in addition to the local policing summaries to be sent out to every household from next month.The chancellor also announced that the expected savings from the programme of police force mergers and other efficiency gains would be kept by the Home Office to be invested in frontline policing. The budget allocated a further £42.5m to "help fund emerging counter-terrorism priorities" over the next two years.The more rapid acceleration of the neighbourhood policing teams comes at a time when the government is facing criticism over its plan for police force mergers that could cut the number of forces from 43 in England and Wales to about 24. Labour's manifesto promised to increase civilian patrol officers to 24,000 by 2008. This is in addition to the record 141,000 fully qualified police officers.
