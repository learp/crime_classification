The local authority criticised over the Edlington torture incident could face government intervention after inspectors launched an investigation into persistent management failures.The Audit Commission is to conduct a special review of leadership and decision-making at Doncaster council and report to ministers later this year.The investigation, called a corporate governance inspection, is carried out only when a council's performance has been so persistently poor that public confidence or safety is deemed to be at risk.Last week two brothers from Doncaster, aged 11 and 12, who were in the care of the authority, were jailed indefinitely at Sheffield crown court after they inflicted a horrific 90-minute torture ordeal on two young boys in Edlington, near Doncaster. A serious case review into the brothers' handling by a range of agencies concluded the incident was preventable.Although the inspection was triggered by public outrage, the council's performance has been scrutinised for some time. A year ago, ministers sent in a new management team to overhaul its children's services department after a series of deaths involving children known to the authority. In December it scored just one out of four in annual council performance ratings. In a statement the commission said: "This decision has been taken in the light of serious concerns about the council's performance in the last two years and the threat to public confidence caused by recent events. The inspection will take place as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made."The communities secretary, John Denham, who welcomed the decision, said: "I promise the people of Doncaster we are prepared to use the powers we have to tackle any issues identified by the Audit Commission which require government action."The council said the inspection would help the authority identify "entrenched" problems. Tim Leader, its acting chief executive, said: "The announcement of this inspection reflects the fact that some important services are not improving quickly enough and that strong and effective leadership is required to drive better performance. We have clear plans to tackle these weaknesses and the inspection will help us identify and root out some entrenched problems and give extra impetus to transforming our business."Obviously, we would rather not be in this position: the fact is we are and are determined to show we can improve services for local people quickly."The court heard last week that the young victims, then aged nine and 10, were strangled, hit with bricks, made to eat nettles, stripped and forced to sexually abuse each other. It emerged during the hearing that the elder attacker watched ultra-violent movies as part of a home life of "routine aggression, violence and chaos".
