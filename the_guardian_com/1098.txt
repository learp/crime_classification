He denies a second murder, that of Betty Yates, 77, who was found dead at her cottage in Bewdley, Worcestershire.Farrow admits carrying out a burglary at a cottage in Thornbury after which a note was found threatening to kill "Christian scum".The jury heard that the word "Help" was written with a finger in blue ink on the wall in the lounge of the vicarage.
