Relatives of a father and daughter who died when a former police inspector crashed his car after an alcohol-fuelled evening abroad hit out last night at the French justice system which allowed him to walk free from court.Keith Bridges came off the road yards from his home in the village of Berbiguieres, in the Dordogne region, in June 2006, killing his wife Julie, 42, and stepdaughter Bethany Lowe, 10.Family friends Andrew Dyer, 41, and his 10-year-old daughter Gabriella also died.Bridges was handed a two-year suspended sentence yesterday for "homicide involontaire" - a charge akin to manslaughter - while drink-driving.The 52-year-old showed no emotion as the sentence was handed down, but Dyer's family were overcome with emotion following what they termed a miscarriage of justice.Speaking from his home in Bridgwater, Somerset, father Noel Dyer, 67, said he and his wife were "very upset" by the court's "lenient" approach."I wanted justice but this is not justice. I thought the British justice system was bad enough but by Christ, this is 10 times worse."I don't know what the French court was thinking - it's beyond comprehension."He added that he and his wife Mary, 65, would never get over the tragic events of an evening in which they lost both their son and their granddaughter.And he said Bridges, who survived with a broken leg, should never have taken to the road."If you're not in control of your car, it is a lethal weapon," he said.Mary Dyer added: "I think it is disgusting. We both thought he deserved a lot more than that."Four lives were lost for no reason. He shouldn't have driven that car and as a police officer, he should have been more responsible - I can't get over that."During a short trial last month, the court heard Bridges got behind the wheel of his overloaded Jeep at around 11pm, following an evening with family friends, the Fullers.The group had drunk around four bottles of wine, 22 small bottles of beer and at least a bottle of spirits in a cocktail mix before leaving the Fullers' home.An inquest in October heard Bethany and Gabriella begged the adults not to drive the mile or so back - even suggesting they could drive themselves.But Bridges ignored their pleas and on a wooded lane, less than 150 yards from his farmhouse, lost control of the car.Giving evidence in the small courtroom, about 30 miles from the scene of the crash, Bridges conceded in "hindsight" there "may have been something" he could have done to avoid the collision.Police estimated he was driving at around 101kmh (62mph) at the time - well over the advisable limit of 70kmh, or 43mph.Bridges, an officer with 30 years' experience, was given a blood alcohol test a few hours later which revealed he was three times the French drink-drive limit and almost twice the UK limit."Behind the image of foie gras and good wine, we are having to judge dramatic facts," Jean-Luc Gadaud, prosecuting, said."This was the act of a man who shouldn't have done what he did."Bridges, a "talented driver" who was part of a special police unit which transported VIPs, could not explain why there were eight people in the car.Presiding judge Daniele Garcia-Puydebat said he had been "spotted by police" and chosen to drive "members of the royal family, foreign dignitaries, politicians and high-security prisoners".The prosecution called for a four-year suspended sentence last month and asked for Bridges to be stripped of his driving licence for seven years.Edouard Knoll, the lawyer representing Gary Lowe, Bethany's father, in the civil part of the case, expressed surprise at the sentence handed down, terming his actions on the evening of June 7 "abhorrent".But he said the result was not unusual for the French system, which traditionally imposes more lenient sentences than those meted out by British courts for deaths on the road.During the brief hearing at the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Bergerac, Bridges was ordered to pay a fine of €200 (£180) for driving offences and was banned from the road for a two-year period.His long-standing friend Tracey Dyer, 41, one of the three surviving passengers in the car, said he would live with what happened "for the rest of his life".Though her husband was killed in the collision, she has supported the retired police inspector throughout his trial."He gets up every morning and relives that evening and will always live with (the question of) 'what if I hadn't done that?'."He will live with this for the rest of his life. No prison sentence would have made any difference," she said.Tracey Dyer suffered multiple fractures and severe head injuries in the crash and remained in intensive care for weeks.Her son Kieron, then four, and daughter Charlotte, then seven, were both injured but also survived.The civil case, which has yet to be resolved, is expected to be re-examined at the same court on April 12.
