A Scotland Yard worker has been sacked for abusing a new corporate credit card introduced to stamp out fraud.Two police officers are under investigation for suspected misuse of the overhauled expenses system.Senior officers scrapped the use of American Express cards after an inquiry uncovered fraud and found that many officers broke internal rules.New Barclaycards with lower spending limits, tighter rules and shorter repayment intervals were given to a smaller number of officers and staff.Scotland Yard admitted that an unnamed civilian employee was forced to resign and cautioned for theft after buying personal goods through the new system.Officers are investigating two further cases of suspected misuse and a third case may have been dropped after the employee left the force.Caroline Pidgeon, a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority, said she was shocked by the disclosure."After all the publicity about Amex, we have got three people already under review with the new card. I find it staggering, quite honestly."Anne McMeel, Metropolitan police director of resources, said the inquiries showed that the new system was picking up potential problems."We are looking at this and they are being picked up," she said. "If people are misusing them we are picking it up and getting on it."No system is absolutely perfect but we are very conscious of the need to make sure this is properly controlled within the organisation."Documents passed to the Metropolitan Police Authority showed that 133 cardholders were already overdue in reconciling a total of £84,199 spent on the cards.Officials said less money was being spent on the new system because fewer officers held cards and staff had been told to use other methods to buy equipment.The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, ordered a review of spending on American Express cards when colleagues uncovered evidence of fraud in September 2007.A total of 3,533 officers and staff were issued with the cards and at one point £3.7m of public money was unaccounted for.Most of this money has been paid back, but legal action is expected against two former officers who owe £82,000 and £1,100.Hundreds of officers in the force's specialist crime and counter-terrorism wings were stripped of their cards in the crackdown. Internal investigators discovered so many employees broke in-house rules that they agreed a secret amnesty and did not punish them.More than 300 people were referred to anti-corruption detectives and 50 cases passed to independent investigators. Three officers have been convicted of criminal offences and prosecutors are considering 12 more cases.More than 20 officers have been handed punishments including written warnings, formal reprimands and docked pay.Inquiries are expected to continue until next March.A Metropolitan police spokesman said the new system was introduced in June last year with "robust processes" to make sure staff used resources appropriately."Among various benefits this has enabled managers and finance units to have greater oversight of expenditure."
