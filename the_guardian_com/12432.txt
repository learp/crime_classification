Vincent Tabak refused to comment when detectives asked if he had made sexual advances towards his neighbour Joanna Yeates, her murder trial heard .Tabak also declined to answer as police inquired whether he had been in the 25-year-old's bedroom or if she had "led him on", Bristol crown court was told.He replied "no comment" when police asked where he attacked the landscape architect and declined to say if he had tried to revive her.The jury was told that Tabak made prepared statements when he was interviewed over three days after his arrest. But to most questions he simply replied: "No comment."The Dutch engineer, 33, has admitted the manslaughter of Yeates but denies her murder.The jury also heard from a prison chaplain about the moment when Tabak admitted to him that he had killed his neighbour. The jury was told Tabak had said he was sorry for what he had done and that it would be "very difficult" for him to tell his girlfriend.For the first time, the court heard that Tabak may have put Yeates's body into his cycle bag to move it from Clifton, Bristol, to the roadside verge three miles away where it was found.Tabak was arrested on 20 January, more than a month after Yeates vanished.When he was told that DNA evidence linked him to Yeates, Tabak claimed in a prepared statement that the laboratory may have been insecure and suggested DNA samples might have been deliberately contaminated for financial gain.But as detectives asked him for details about how he may have killed Yeates and his relationship with her he repeatedly replied: "No comment."Tabak was on remand at Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire, where he was held in the health unit because of concerns that he could commit suicide, the jury heard.On 8 February he told a chaplain, Peter Brotherton: "I've got something to tell you that's going to shock you."Brotherton said the prisoner told him: "I'm going to change my plea to guilty." Brotherton asked him if it was "concerning the young lady from Bristol". Tabak replied that it was.The Salvation Army chaplain asked him if he was sorry for what he had done. Tabak replied that he was, adding he would find it "very difficult" to tell his girlfriend.Brotherton offered to say a prayer with him but Tabak declined. The chaplain said he told his superior what Tabak had said and it was reported to a security officer. Later when they met again Tabak "appeared angry" at Brotherton and told him he would not tell him anything else.Cross-examining Brotherton, William Clegg QC, for Tabak, suggested the chaplain was wrong to claim the accused had said he was going to "change his plea".Clegg suggested his client had simply said: "I'm going to plead guilty." He had already told his lawyers that he had killed Yeates, Clegg said, adding that Tabak was "a depressed and distressed man unburdening himself".The jury was given more details about the scientific evidence said to link Tabak to the victim.Traces of DNA that matched Tabak's profile were found on Yeates's chest, it was claimed, and her blood discovered in the boot of Tabak's car.Cross-examining Lindsay Lennen, a forensic scientist, Clegg raised the possibility that Yeates's body could have been transported in Tabak's cycle bag from Clifton to the verge where it was found.Earlier, Yeates's mother Teresa wept as a photograph of her daughter's body was shown to the jury.She looked away and was comforted by her husband David when the mortuary picture of her daughter lying fully clothed in the foetal position with her pink top pushed up, exposing her bra, appeared on a screen in court.As Mr Yeates supported his wife, he looked over his shoulder from the public gallery towards Tabak in the dock.The trial continues.
