A car thief was jailed for 12 years yesterday for killing a farmer whose Land Rover he was trying to steal.After sentencing, relatives of the victim, Michael Boffey, 61, said they were furious that Ashley Squires had been out on licence when he ran him down. Had Squires served his full sentence, he would not have been at liberty to kill Mr Boffey.Squires, 22, admitted manslaughter. His brother, Frederick, 24, was jailed for 5Â½ years after admitting assisting an offender and conspiracy to steal vehicles.Birmingham crown court heard Mr Boffey and a colleague, Christine Russell, were in the office of his farm in Withybrook, near Rugby, when they heard the engine of the Land Rover starting. They ran out and stood in the path of the car. The farmer was knocked over and suffered fatal head injuries.Stephen Linehan QC, prosecuting, said the brothers had targeted at least seven other farms before and after the killing.Sentencing the pair, who lived together in Leicester, the recorder of Birmingham, Judge John Saunders QC, said the 12-year sentence reflected the outrage felt by people in the Midlands. "The public justifiably expect that when a criminal kills an innocent person in the course of carrying out a criminal enterprise, that long sentences must follow."The court had been told that Squires had been sentenced to 42 months for burglary. He had stolen a van on a farm in 2003 and driven it at the owner. Had he served the full sentence he would have been in prison until September last year, the month after Mr Boffey was killed.Outside court, the farmer's widow, Bernice, said she would have liked to have seen Squires jailed for life. Mr Boffey's son, William, said the family could not believe Squires was let out early. He called on the government to review its policy. "It was a travesty that he was not tried for murder and found guilty. We feel that the legal system has failed us."
