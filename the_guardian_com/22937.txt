A farm labourer held 40 years ago under mental health law after the shotgun killing of two women out picking blackberries was finally charged with their murder yesterday.Victor Wilson, who was 20 when the women were killed near the ruined Yorkshire abbey of Meaux in 1963, appeared at Hull crown court after his case was reviewed by a mental health tribunal. Now 61, he was not asked to enter a plea to the charges of murdering the newly married pottery worker Joan Botterill and Gladys Tate, 53, the wife of another east Yorkshire farm labourer. Mr Wilson was declared unfit to stand trial under the Lunacy Act shortly after the killing. The women, whose husbands were baling straw in nearby fields, had gone blackberrying with Mrs Tate's dog, which was also shot dead. Mr Wilson, who lived near the 12th-century abbey at the time, has spent the past 40 years in mental hospitals, but the case was never closed by the police. Humberside police officers were in court yesterday, along with Mrs Botterill's sister when the proceedings were adjourned for three months by Judge Michael Mettyear at the request of the defence barrister Stephen Knapp, who gave legal background which cannot be reported at this stage. The prosecution raised no objection and a further review will be held at Hull in September. Martin Wainwright
