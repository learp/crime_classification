A 27-year-old man has been found guilty of seven "strangulation" robberies in London but cleared of attacking the fashion designer Nicole Farhi on her doorstep.Matthew Mykoo, of Brent, north-west London, was convicted at Wood Green crown court of the attacks on lone women committed between March and June last year.He was found not guilty of robbing Farhi, 62, a crime to which his brother had confessed. Farhi was set upon and choked until unconscious outside her home in north London in April 2008.Farhi told the court that when she came round her assailants were stealing a diamond ring from her finger and a Rolex watch that had belonged to her father. Daniel Mykoo, 28, choked Farhi using an arm around her throat. He admitted 19 attacks including Farhi's robbery and two car offences.Matthew Mykoo was unanimously convicted of seven robberies but cleared of eight attacks including the one on Farhi.The brothers are originally from the French Caribbean. The attacks targeted lone women and one 60-year-old man. Daniel grabbed victims in a choke-hold from behind and Matthew snatched their valuables.There were attacks in areas including Hampstead, St John's Wood, Ladbroke Grove and Chelsea. The victims included a domestic violence counsellor, who was robbed in March last year of jewellery and money as she emerged from a domestic violence workshop in Fulham.The judge, Nicholas Browne, told the pair they faced life sentences. "I warn you in very clear terms that an indeterminate sentence for public protection is virtually inevitable bearing in mind the number of victims and the fact that these robberies were of the most serious type I have ever encountered."The sentence which I impose on you will be measured in many years â€“ I don't rule out a life sentence."He adjourned sentencing until 23 July for pre-sentence reports.
