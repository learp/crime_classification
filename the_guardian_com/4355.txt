A man who punched the Manchester United football manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the groin and then chanted "Fergie, shut your mouth," was jailed for 15 months today.Kevin Reynolds, 44, who was described in Southwark crown court as a "fighting drunk", pleaded guilty to the assault last month.Reynolds, branded by the judge as a "significant risk to the public", spotted Sir Alex outside Euston train station, London, staggered towards him and delivered a single punch.His "stunned" victim promptly doubled up in agony and, as he fought for breath, managed to gasp, "What the hell are you doing?"Reynolds, whose criminal record lists 146 convictions, including many for violence, promptly insisted: "I'm sorry Fergie, I didn't realise it was you."But almost immediately he held out his arms and started shouting: "Fergie, Fergie shut your mouth."Peter Zinner, prosecuting, told the court: "Your honour may know it is a chant that is used by football supporters in Scotland, or is something heard at matches involving Manchester United when Sir Alex gets excited."The barrister said the club manager was left standing there in both considerable pain and "somewhat bemused amazement".Sir Alex told police in a statement: "He really gave me a whack. At the time my natural instinct was to react and defend myself. However, I decided against it as I did not know if he was carrying any weapon and might come at me again."He said that fortunately he suffered only "bruising and soreness" and there had been no "lasting effects"."This is not something I expect to happen to me when I am going about my daily business and it completely stunned me," he said.
