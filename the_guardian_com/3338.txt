The search for one of the most notorious and damaging hoaxers in criminal history, the unknown teaser who derailed the Yorkshire Ripper inquiry, has been dropped.Scientific tests have concluded that no more information can be gleaned from letters and a tape sent by the man who repeatedly claimed "I'm Jack" in taunts that came to obsess the head of the hunt, Asstistant Chief Constable George Oldfield. The last three women victims of the real murderer, the Bradford lorry driver Peter Sutcliffe, were killed as Oldfield's detectives searched for the spurious suspect in north-east England. More than Â£1m was spent on publicity and inquiries in Wearside after the voice on the tape was linked to the area by speech analysts. The hoaxer operated only briefly between 1978 and 1979 and has left no trace since. West Yorkshire police said that in most cases the offence of wasting police time would not lead to prosecution after a 25-year lapse, but the damage caused by the "false Jack" was so devastating he would be unlikely to enjoy an amnesty. A spokesman said: "We still have the original files. They were subjected to rigorous forensic examination - it's now apparent that the chemicals used mean they cannot be subjected to more modern techniques. Great efforts were made to trace the person but without firm evidence we could take no further action. We are not now actively investigating." Sutcliffe was jailed in May 1981 for the murders of 13 women in Bradford, Leeds and Manchester, after he was caught by chance prowling for another victim in Sheffield. He was sentenced to a minimum of 30 years' jail but is not expected to be released in 2011 from secure psychiatric care where he is likely to remain for the rest of his life.
