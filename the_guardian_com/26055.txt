A mother who starved her seven-year-old daughter to death was cleared of murder today after a court accepted her plea of manslaughter.Jurors were directed to clear Angela Gordon, 35, of murdering Khyra Ishaq on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The court heard Gordon had been suffering from severe depression when she deliberately starved her daughter, whose body mass index was so low it was off the scale of medical charts.Birmingham city council will now face questions over childcare procedures, after it emerged staff at Khyra's school had been so concerned about her welfare that in one 24-hour period the deputy headteacher made three phone calls to social services to express anxiety about her welfare.Khyra's stepfather, 31-year-old Junaid Abuhamza, and Gordon both admitted manslaughter two weeks ago. A charge of murder against Abuhamza was dropped this month after the court heard evidence about his mental health.The acceptance of Gordon's not guilty plea to the murder charge came in the sixth week of a retrial, after days of psychiatric assessment and legal argument.Explaining the decision, Timothy Raggatt QC, for the prosecution, said three psychiatrists had agreed she was suffering from severe depression in the month before Khyra died at her home in Handsworth, Birmingham."For that reason we cannot resist the defence of diminished responsibility, now raised for the first time. It is extraordinary that it emerges so late [in the trial] but the sole reason for that is the denial ... that Angela Gordon has put up around herself for all these months."At the opening of the retrial in January, which followed an aborted trial last summer, Raggatt said: "The infection that brought about Khyra's death was one that was caused, and wholly caused, as a result of one thing: for months – quite literally, months – she had been starved, and starved quite deliberately."Khyra was so emaciated at the time of death, her condition was outside the experience of medical professionals, he told the jury.Gordon and Abuhamza have already admitted five counts of cruelty to other children, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Those children, who were also in the defendants' care, were "similarly starved" and assaulted, the court heard, with two of them found to be in a state of acute, severe and dangerous malnutrition.The defendants will be sentenced on 5 March.
