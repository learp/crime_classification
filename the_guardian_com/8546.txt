Teenagers who have a family member in prison are often abandoned by the system and left to cope alone with feelings of anxiety, loss and isolation, a new study has revealed.The study, by the Scottish forum on prisons and families (SFPF), is the first of its kind to focus on teenagers affected by the imprisonment of a parent, sibling or other relative - a previously hard to reach and invisible group.Next month a study by the Federation of Prisoners' Families Support Groups in England and Wales, which has also been funded by The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, is likely to show similar findings with teenagers feeling traumatised, isolated and lacking in support.The Scottish study, which estimates some 11,000 children are affected, found that for many young people losing a relative through prison created multiple problems. Many had increased responsibilities within the family and were anxious not to burden the remaining parent with their own worries, leaving them isolated to cope with their own complex feelings.Young people were particularly aware of the stigma associated with having a relative in prison, were often anxious to keep it secret, and lived in fear of the consequences of people finding out. These only served to cut them off further from much-needed support."The trauma of arrest, trial and subsequent imprisonment and loss of their relative leaves a distressing legacy," says the report."One of the most striking and alarming findings is the high number of young people who find themselves in circumstances which isolate them from service provision and from their peers and community. For them, the term social exclusion is a daily and potentially long-term experience."The report calls for more awareness among professional agencies, as well as the public, about the experiences and needs of young people. "Statutory and voluntary sector agencies must act together to bring about an effective mobilisation of energy and resources which will ensure that young people do not find themselves punished, penalised or in any other way discriminated against because of their circumstances."The report makes a host of recommendations to improve the situation. The Scottish prison service should make visits more child-friendly, arrange extra visits for young people and make access easier through cheaper telephone calls or by introducing email links.Police should ensure that an officer is responsible for looking after children and young people at the time of arrest, ensure they are accompanied, and have all the information they need to help them understand what is happening.Meanwhile, the SFPF itself should develop a schools information and training programme to raise awareness of the effects of the imprisonment of a relative on young people and their need for special support.Kate Philbrick, vice-convenor of the SFPF, said: "We need to get social work, education and criminal justice agencies to look at their processes and the lack of support for teenagers in this vulnerable position. The early experiences, such as arrest and trial, can be as crucial as the imprisonment itself, and can have a life-changing effect."Stewart Asquith, professor of social policy at Glasgow University, said there was a danger that teenagers might feel that they themselves were being punished in some way for the behaviour of their imprisoned parent or relative."Unless the needs of these young people are addressed ... they will continue to feel that they are being punished and they will carry with them a legacy into adulthood which puts them at further risk," he said."Help with coping with the effects of imprisonment of a parent or other key figure, and ensuring that they maintain contact with them when they are in prison, has to be provided to teenagers as of right, not as some form of charity."Bernadette Monaghan, senior manager of criminal justice charity Safeguarding Communities and Reducing Offending (Sacro) in Scotland, said that people who were able to maintain relationships with their family while in prison were much less likely to reoffend."A lot of work has been done to improve visiting facilities, particularly in relation to young children, but up until now nothing has been done for teenagers. Maybe it is easier to look at young children and their needs. When it comes to teenagers there doesn't seem to be the support they can tap into," she said.The Scottish prison service said it placed great importance on maintaining family links. "These are a key element in the rehabilitation process and the prison service has provided a number of initiatives, both itself and with external agencies, to foster greater links," said a spokeswoman.
