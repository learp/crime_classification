A growing number of individuals are boycotting the internal police investigation into the undercover infiltration of political groups.This presents a problem for Scotland Yard as it appears to diminish the credibility of their investigation and increases pressure for an independent, public inquiry.Operation Herne is the code-name for the internal investigation that has been set up by Scotland Yard to investigate the many allegations surrounding the Special Demonstration Squad, the covert unit that spied on political campaigners for 40 years.Soon after the allegations surrounding the undercover infiltration of the Stephen Lawrence campaign were made in June, the murdered teenager's father, Neville, called for an independent inquiry. He said that an internal police inquiry was "unsatisfactory" as he had "no confidence" that it would get to the truth of the matter. "I am convinced that nothing short of a judge-led public inquiry will suffice", he added.He has been joined by his former wife, Doreen Lawrence. She told MPs in July that she has "no confidence" in the ability of police to investigate the claims.She said it was not right for "police officers to investigate each other", adding: "You can't have police officers investigating each other. It's proven that's not the right way to do things."She too has called for a public inquiry, saying : "We want an inquiry that is open, not behind closed doors, so we can hear exactly what was going on after Stephen was murdered."Police chiefs including Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police commissioner, have called on Peter Francis, the fomer SDS officer who has revealed a lot about the inner workings of the Special Demonstration Squad, to speak to the internal inquiry. So far he has been reluctant to do this, as he has doubts that the internal inquiry is sufficiently independent to investigate the matter.He has been backed by Doreen Lawrence, whose lawyer, Imran Khan, said Francis "should be giving evidence to a public inquiry, not staying behind closed doors and speaking to police officers. That's the whole point of calling for an inquiry".For some time, Francis has himself favoured a public inquiry into the SDS where he could testify under oath. It is a call he made as far back as October 2011 (when he spoke under his pseudonym of Pete Black). You can find that call here.In the latest development, the group of eight women who are suing Scotland Yard have announced that they are not going to co-operate with the internal police inquiry either. An article on their announcement last week can be seen here.The eight women have objected to the police stance of neither confirming nor denying whether the men they had long-term relationships were undercover officers, while at the same time asking the women to provide detailed statements about those relationships.The police stance means, they say, that they would never know the outcome of any investigation into the men.They too have called for an independent or public inquiry.It is worth reading the full exchange of correspondence between the police and Harriet Wistrich, the lawyer for the eight women (here)
