The prime suspect in the murder of Rory Blackhall turned up at hospital in an agitated state the day after the boy's body was found, it emerged yesterday.It was not until four days later, when police issued a description of a man they wanted to question, that staff at St John's hospital, Livingston, realised it matched the man they had treated and alerted officers.Lothian and Borders Police are refusing to confirm whether they believe that Simon Harris, 37, - a loner on bail awaiting trial on sex-abuse charges who was found hanged on Sunday at his Livingston home - was responsible for 11-year-old Rory's murder. They will present information to the procurator fiscal, who will decide if the case can be closed.It took police a further two days to visit Harris's home where they found him hanged. Officers had received calls from the public when they released the description of a man they were looking for. A police spokesman said yesterday that it was inappropriate to comment while inquiries continued.
