More than 100 Romanians fleeing racist attacks in Belfast have been moved to a council-run leisure centre after taking refuge overnight in a church.The 115 Romanians were transferred to the O-Zone complex this morning.The sports centre in the city's Ormeau Park has become a temporary home for the Romanians, many of whom have said they want to leave Northern Ireland.Belfast's lord mayor, Naomi Long, said the repeated attacks on the Roma families close to the university district had brought shame on the city.A group of youths are suspected of being behind the intimidation of the Romanian families. On Monday night a number of young men from the Village area of Belfast threw bottles and stones at an anti-racist protest on the Lisburn Road called to show solidarity with the Romanians.Although the mob chanted Combat 18 slogans, security sources in Northern Ireland said there was no evidence that the neo-Nazi terror group had organised cells in the Greater Belfast area.Both main loyalist paramilitary groups, the UVF and UDA, have condemned the racist attacks and said none of their members were involved.The only politician from the Chinese community elected to any parliament in the UK said many of the Romanians would prefer to go back than remain in Belfast.Anna Lo, an assembly member for the Alliance Party in south Belfast, said the families were "very frightened".Lo said attacks on Romanian homes – which included bricks being thrown through windows – had been increasing in frequency in recent months."They are really very frightened," she said. "The women, when they were talking to me yesterday, they were really upset, tears in their eyes and said, 'You know we love it here, we'd like to live here, but we're too scared.'"One of the women who took shelter in the church, and who did not want to be named, said she had feared the attackers had come to kill her and her family, and she now wanted to go back to Romania.However, the help given by the church had shown a positive side to the people of Belfast, she said.Malcolm Morgan, pastor at the City Church, said he was happy to help."It's a sad indictment of our society, but hopefully we can show them a different side to Northern Ireland and a caring side of Northern Ireland," he said.Jolena Flett, racial harassment adviser for the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities, said the Romanians had been threatened verbally and then three properties were attacked on the same day."There has been an issue about the families feeling unsafe in the properties they were attacked in. What we are trying to do is provide them with alternative accommodation," she said.
