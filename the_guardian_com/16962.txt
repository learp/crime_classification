Your article (Harass a hoodie: how Essex police take surveillance to the streets, May 30) highlights the flawed logic of New Labour's approach to crime prevention. Jacqui Smith applauded the intrusive surveillance methods of Operation Leopard, citing the reduction in crime rates as a demonstration of the policy's legitimacy. The home secretary seemed pleased to announce that "those who harass our communities are themselves harried and harassed". This eye-for-an-eye approach is hypocritical and unhelpful in the long term. It undermines the moral authority of the police and further alienates those individuals who are already on the far edges of society.James ThompsonSouthampton With the media still smouldering with reports on the way white working-class discontent has boosted the BNP, Home Office support for the Essex police initiative to "harass a hoodie" is incendiary. Would the police in Bradford or Brixton be carrying out this type of operation? If the Home Office think probably not, they should stop the police from taking liberties with groups that lack political clout. This type of filming captures the innocent and stokes up discontent - there is too much to lose to go in pursuit of these short-term gains.Dr Andrew WilsonSenior lecturer in criminology, Nottingham Trent University
