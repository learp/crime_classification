The Director of Public Prosecutions has spoken about plans to clamp down on criminals hiding their assets abroad. Alison Saunders said it is hoped that £10 million in assets is initially recovered from convicted tax evaders, drug barons and corrupt businessmen in Spain and the United Arab Emirates. She said criminal asset recovery would be a priority for the Crown Prosecution Service.“People have been convicted of crimes. They might be tax evaders, they might be drug offenders,” she told the BBC. “But what is really important is that we get the money back so that we can either give it back to victims - so we compensate victims for the crimes against them - or if there are no victims, that we deprive criminals of effectively what is their life blood, which is money. “And it means they can’t go on and put that money back into more crime.” She said 12 priority cases have been identified. Ms Saunders said there were “a number of other countries” also being considered.
