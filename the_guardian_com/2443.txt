A man and a woman have been charged with conspiracy to supply drugs to the singer Amy Winehouse.John Blagrove, 34, and Cara Burton, 22, both of Queensbridge Road, Hackney, east London, have been charged with two counts of conspiracy to supply cocaine and MDMA, Scotland Yard said. The charges follow a video obtained by the Sun, published in January, which appears to show the singer inhaling fumes from a crack pipe. Winehouse was arrested and interviewed by police last month and later released on bail. She has not been charged. The couple have been bailed to appear at Thames magistrates' on July 1. The Grammy award winner's appearance and behaviour have sparked concerns about her wellbeing recently.The 24-year-old star, who is said to be worth Â£10m, was admitted to hospital last August after a reported overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and alcohol. Her father, Mitch Winehouse, once said he was so concerned about his daughter that he wrote a eulogy he expected to deliver at her funeral.
