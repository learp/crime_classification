A "jealous" wife who stabbed her husband's pregnant ex-lover in the stomach has been jailed for 10 years.Andrea Dean attacked Stacey Jenkins, 28, outside a primary school in Liverpool when the victim was 37 weeks pregnant, the city's crown court was told.Dean knifed Jenkins seven times with a 10cm filleting knife, striking her abdomen, leg, hand and arm.The victim and her unborn child survived and the baby girl, named Hope, was born at full term three weeks later.Dean, 40, from Liverpool, was sentenced after earlier pleading guilty to wounding with intent and attempted child destruction.Her husband, Christopher, also 40, was sentenced to 30 months after pleading guilty to assisting an offender, perverting the course of justice and aiding and abetting his wife.The court heard he had driven his wife to the confrontation, although he did not know she was armed with the knife, and afterwards hid the weapon and gave her a false alibi.Jailing the couple, Recorder Clement Goldstone QC said Dean had made no secret of her animosity towards Jenkins.He told her: "The pregnancy was a source of great annoyance and jealousy to you."Not only because the father was your husband and he had fathered another child outside your marriage, but also because you had been trying, unsuccessfully, to have another, fourth child with your husband and your annoyance may have increased even further when you learned that the child which Stacey Jenkins was carrying was in fact a girl â€“ you having three sons."Turning to her former fishmonger husband, the judge said: "You are a victim of your own weakness."You did not have the strength of character to stand up to your wife when you realised she was contemplating, if not an attack, then at least a confrontation with the woman who was heavily pregnant with your child."
