A black police officer may have been serving in Britain as early as 1910, more than half a century earlier than thought, it appears from a newly discovered photograph.The Metropolitan police service and London's Black Police Association are trying to identify a man pictured in uniform in a photograph dated September 3 1910 and taken in Chislehurst, Kent. They hope to name him in time for the association's 10th anniversary in September and Black History Month in October. "This picture provides a glimpse of our history," said Commander Steve Allen, head of the Met's diversity directorate. "We are very keen to try to identify this officer and speak to those who may have known him about his experiences in the Met. "He must have been one of the first black police officers in the Met and, with that, must have found an environment very different to that of today. He was one of the pioneers in being a black role model in the capital's criminal justice system." Keith Smith, of the Met Black Police Association, said: "This is a wonderful opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the contribution of black staff to policing over the last 100 years." Britain's first black policeman was previously thought to have been Astley Lloyd Blair, who joined the Gloucestershire force in 1964 aged 27. Mohamet Yusuf Daar, who was born in Kenya, became an officer in Coventry in 1966. But the Met's first known black officer was Norwell Roberts, who joined in 1967. He had buttons torn off his uniform by fellow officers and bananas thrown at him from patrol cars, but won commendations for his career, reaching the rank of Detective Sergeant. He received the Queens Police Medal in 1996. By one estimate, there were fewer than two dozen black officers nationwide by the mid-1970s and although a quarter of Londoners are from ethnic minorities, the proportion within the Met is still only 6.5%.
