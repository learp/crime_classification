Alan Travis’s article (Decline in heroin and crack use ‘behind fall in crime’, 23 July) announced the Home Office’s view that the main factor in falling crime rates over the last 10 years has been the reduction in the number of heroin addicts in the country. This crime reduction success has been the result of the brave policy of successive governments to invest heavily in treatment programmes for drug-addicted offenders over the last 15 years. The numbers of people treated went up fourfold around the turn of the century, and communities are now reaping the benefit from this policy. A wide range of treatment programmes have contributed to this trend – our own peer-reviewed research shows that the Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust (RAPt) prison treatment programme achieved a 20% reduction in post-release reoffending among a cohort of 352 male addicted prisoners who were prolific offenders before their imprisonment. Funding for many treatment programmes is now under threat – if they are allowed to close, the long-term costs to the taxpayer, and to communities, will be much higher than the short-term savings.Mike TraceChief executive, RAPt
