A soldier who raped three teenagers and tried to abduct two schoolgirls has been jailed indefinitely.Jonathan Haynes, 30, raped two of the teenagers after seizing them on the streets of a market town and attacked the third at a university hall of residence.Haynes, a lance corporal with the Royal Logistic Corps, tried to grab the two 14-year-old schoolgirls from a country lane.Haynes was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection and ordered to serve at least 11 years imprisonment â€“ but was warned he may never be released.As he passed sentence, Judge Neil Ford QC, the recorder of Bristol, described Haynes as a "clever and cunning predator".A jury was told that Haynes, who was based at a barracks near Chippenham in Wiltshire, meticulously planned his attacks. The first kidnap and rape happened in September 2009 in Chippenham as the 16-year-old victim made her way home from a night out.Just 13 days later he raped an 18-year-old student after forcing entry to halls of residence in Pontypridd, south Wales.The following February, he attempted to snatch the two schoolgirls late at night from a country lane near Chippenham.Weeks later Haynes kidnapped a 17-year-old girl off the streets of Chippenham and repeatedly raped her.Haynes did not realise that the hired car he was driving was fitted with a GPS tracking device. After his arrest, detectives were able to piece together his movements and establish that he had been cruising the streets of Chippenham during the early hours looking for victims, or "sharking".One of his victims had the presence of mind to pull out some of her hair during her ordeal and push it down the car seat to prove she had been there.Haynes, of Northampton, was found guilty of rape, kidnap and attempted kidnap.Speaking after the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Bob Hamlin, of Wiltshire police, said that there could be many more victims and that his team were examining other unsolved cases in the area.He said: "We are investigating more cases that are unsolved but it is hard to put a figure on just how many more offences this dangerous man could have committed."He is one of the most evil men I've dealt with in 32 years of work. The horror the victims suffered can never be forgotten."The Ministry of Defence has confirmed Haynes is no longer a serving soldier.
