An agency set up by Tony Blair to recover the ill-gotten gains of leading underworld figures is costing four times more to run that it recovers, figures will show today.The agency's annual report due out today will show that while the police seized £67m of assets accrued through crime in 2005-06, the agency recovered just £4.3m on a budget of nearly £20m.This represents just 3.4% of the proceeds of crime recovered by law enforcement agencies in the first nine months of the last financial year.The year before, the agency seized just £4.1m when it had a budget of £18m, the agency's annual report will show.The figures will be another embarrassing blow to the government over its law and order promises, fresh from the scandal of foreign prisoners released without deportation.Mr Blair established the Assets Recovery Agency with the promise that it would target hardened criminal and double the money seized by police and customs.The prime minister gave the agency a target of breaking even by 2005-06 so it could plough money back into policing and community projects.But far from boosting coffers, the agency has grown to 200 staff and is struggling to claw back money as criminals successfully hold up cases for years by claiming breaches of their human rights.The agency's annual report today will show it has been able to freeze more than £80m of assets since it was set up in 2003.But many cases are then bogged down in the courts. The agency has also faced accusations that it has shied away from big -time criminal targets, according to a report in today's Times.A Conservative MP who unearthed evidence on the agency's finances using parliamentary questions today described the agency as "toothless".Grant Shapps said the Assets Recovery Agency budget had risen last year to nearly £20m but it was not matching that with confiscated cash and property.The government had failed to give the crime-fighting organisation enough powers, and new human rights legislation had also stymied its work, he said.Mr Shapps claimed that Mr Blair had pledged the agency would collect £80m by this year, when he set it up in a "blaze of publicity" in 2003.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "This is a classic Blair idea which actually in detail doesn't work."Jane Earl, director of the Assets Recovery Agency, said Mr Shapps' figures were "not entirely" right.She accepted that it had only recovered £4m, but the £80m target had been for the assets recovery community as a whole."Mr Shapps is entirely right that we have a large amount of money under restraint, frozen, something over £100m in our lifetime," she said."That's not money that has gone away that we are not pursuing, that's all money which is being litigated through the courts as we speak."The cases that put money into the so-called tinbox last year were really the ones that came in in the very early stages of our lifetime."We think that the time taken to get a case from being referred to us from law enforcement agency to completion is longer than we expected, it's longer than we hoped for, and I have to say to you and everyone else that we're sorry that's the case."
