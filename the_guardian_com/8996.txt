The accomplice of one of Scotland's worst serial killers has finally been named by police almost three decades after his alleged involvement in the infamous World's End murders.In an official report to the procurator fiscal, police have identified two men as the prime suspects for the notorious murders of 17-year-olds Helen Scott and Christine Eadie in Edinburgh in October 1977. One, Angus Sinclair, who is currently serving life in Barlinnie prison, is also believed to be responsible for three other deaths in Glasgow the same year, making him Scotland's worst serial killer of the past 50 years. Sinclair has long been suspected of involvement in the World's End murders. Detectives have always believed he had an accomplice. However, this is the first time they have been able to identify him. Following a massive investigation involving more than 100 detectives from three Scottish forces, police have spent the past year reviewing the evidence from seven long-unsolved murders. Fresh scrutiny of forensic samples and the use of the latest techniques to extract DNA have been a vital part of the investigation. Forensic experts have revealed that advances made in the last six years have enabled scientists to produce two clear and distinct profiles, where previously only one broken and incomplete pattern had emerged. The second accomplice has also been identified as a result of these advances. He is also named in the police report.
