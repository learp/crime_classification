London is one of the world's hot-spots for pickpocketing, a new survey has revealed. The capital was rated tenth in an index of global destinations where tourists are most likely to have their possessions stolen.The findings, collated by online travel site TripAdvisor, saw Barcelona retain its position as the prime destination for prying hands, with Rome and Paris coming second and third respectively.The entire top 10 was composed of European city destinations, and Spain – a popular holiday location for British travellers – is the country where you should be most vigilant. Madrid, Tenerife, and the Costa Brava all made appearances above London.Despite the findings, TripAdvisor's Emma O'Boyle reassured UK tourists: "All these destinations offer a great experience and Brits should not be put off visiting.""This index simply reinforces that extra care should be taken, especially in the busier tourist areas. By taking some simple precautions you'll be able to enjoy a fun and hassle-free holiday wherever you go."Tips on how to avoid the attention of opportunistic thieves include keeping your valuables close to you on the front of your body, ideally in bags that sit across your chest or under your arm. Carrying large amounts of cash, your passport or plane tickets is discouraged.London, which attracts an annual 26 million visitors, is the top 10 for the first time – but is still ranked safer than Athens, Prague and Lisbon.O'Boyle says: "While the vast majority of visitors have a safe and enjoyable experience, the index shows that London must be on its guard."What is the most inventive way you've been pickpocketed on holiday and where?
