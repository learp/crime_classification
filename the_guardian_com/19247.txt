Lord Taylor of Warwick today became the first peer to be convicted in connection with the parliamentary expenses investigation, when a jury found him guilty of dishonestly claiming Â£11,277 in allowances.The 58-year-old qualified barrister was convicted by an 11-1 majority verdict after a seven-day trial at Southwark crown court. Taylor, who was ennobled by the Conservatives but resigned the whip after the allegations were made, had denied six charges of false accounting between 2006 and 2007.The judge, Mr Justice Saunders, adjourned the case for sentencing on a date to be fixed and Taylor was released on unconditional bail.Taylor claimed travel costs and overnight subsistence allowances for attending the House of Lords after registering a home in Oxford as his main address. But he did not live at the property, which was the address of his half-nephew, nor had he ever stayed at it. His only home was in Ealing, west London.He maintained it was his honest belief that it was acceptable for him to claim the allowances "in lieu of salary" and to reimburse him for costs incurred carrying out House of Lords business.He also claimed the practice was "widespread" and openly operated by others in the Lords, where at that time no checks were conducted to ensure a peer owned or even resided at their designated address.The court heard that it was a "lightly-policed scheme", open to abuse. "Lord Taylor knew that, and he used it," the jury was told. Staff processing the claims forms had no reason to believe he was lying, and they relied on peers giving them correct information.Taylor's defence counsel, Mohammed Khamisa QC, argued that the expenses system was not "black and white" but "at best, a grey one". It was "unclear, ill-defined and, most crucially, treated by many as a remuneration in lieu of salary", he said.Taylor had been advised by other lords in the upper chamber to nominate a "main residence" outside London, said Khamisa. The peer had acted in a "clumsy, illogical and stupid" way, but it was not a "deliberate attempt to lie".The jury of seven men and five women took five hours and eight minutes to reach their majority verdict, finding him guilty on all six counts.
