While the authorities and dating sites work closely together to ensure a safe environment on the internet, we encourage everyone to apply the same caution when meeting people online as they would meeting through friends or in a bar."Never give money to anyone just as you would never give money to someone you recently met in a pub or cafe. Don't share personal contact details off the site. If in doubt, use the highly visible 'report a concern' button which flags issues to our care team."
