When the Metropolitan police sent a delegation to New York city to see if there were any lessons they could learn from mayor Rudolf Giuliani's zero tolerance policy, they claimed to be unimpressed by the Americans' swamp tactics to tackle the symptoms of crime rather than its root causes. What they did admire, however, was the way crime figures in New York are broken down to precinct level, allowing police in a given neighbourhood to be made directly accountable. Precinct captains responsible for sending out beat patrols can see what impact they have on crime figures. And, perhaps more importantly, so can local residents.British criminologists, especially those in the Home Office research, development and statistics directorate, were also impressed. This was one of the reasons ministers published a paper this week urging an overhaul of the way crime figures are collected and presented. Another reason is illustrated by the chart. The proportion of reported incidents that the system recognises as crime varies between different kinds of offence and overall is only about three quarters. The police - systems of reporting differ - apply their own tests to the public's allegations that something untoward has happened. The key is local data. In the US, standard American crime figures are available county by county. In Philadelphia it is even possible for residents to find out what incidents have happened in selected crime categories on their block. Although some audit commission publications and websites, such as Upmystreet.com, imply that similar figures are available for each local authority or even postcode in England and Wales, that is still some years off. The form in which statistics recording crime are published would be recognisable to a 19th-century civil servant. Traditionally, statistics have been broken down for each of the 43 police forces so that an incumbent home secretary has a good idea about what sort of job each chief constable is doing. But increasingly ministers see value in making much more local information available - both in terms of combating crime and reducing fear of crime. For the first time, in January this year, annual crime figures were broken down to the level of the hundred or so "crime and disorder partnerships", which mostly follow local authority boundaries. Figures were even available for the more numerous basic command units - essentially each of the 300-odd police divisions in England and Wales. This, however, is still a long way from the postcode definition of neighbourhood that accords with many people's idea of "the area in which I live". Only about 17 forces have logged crime data for their areas that are detailed enough to give a breakdown for postcodes. Such postcoded crime data usually only cover about 60% of addresses in any one patch. Some forces have started to collect crime data based on where specific offences were committed - the Home Office thinks it is still some years before this becomes common practice. However, it now seems that there is the political will in Whitehall to give the whole process a push. It is not just crime figures that ministers are interested in making available at this very local level. The social exclusion unit in the Cabinet Office wants to see the office for national statistics taking on the task of making neighbourhood data available for a number of key social indicators. The idea is that local data would help explain crime patterns. Car crime might be correlated with such indicators as car ownership; burglary rates with types of residential property as well as unemployment and social deprivation. "It is only with this level of detail that a local police force would be able to carry out a proper hot-spot analysis and identify trends and patterns that otherwise would be reliant on the instincts of long-serving officers, who with the best will in the world cannot absorb all of the information about crimes in their locality," says the paper on modernising crime statistics. It is to be hoped that such computer-generated data would be in addition to, and not a replacement for, the judgment of the long-serving neighbourhood officer. But a serious effort is now being made by the government, Home Office and police to invest in the necessary computer software to take up the techniques that some American cities have for many years regarded as an important part of the fight against crime. Perhaps this more numbers-based approach to tackling crime has something to do with the number of statisticians now to be found running the Home Office. The police minister, Charles Clarke, has a Cambridge degree in maths and economics; the home secretary, Jack Straw, is a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society; and Paul Wiles, the new head of research, is an enthusiastic number-cruncher. Mr Clarke believes that such neighbourhood information can help reduce the fear of crime among even the most innumerate. He recently held a meeting in his Norfolk constituency called to discuss the rising crime problem. Local residents were fearful. But anxiety was assuaged when the police produced their breakdown for the patch. There had recently been only four crimes - and one of them involved the heinous offence of knocking over somebody's dustbin.
