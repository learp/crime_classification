The police watchdog has launched an investigation into the contact that officers had with hairdresser Hollie Gazzard before she was fatally stabbed.Gazzard, 20, died in an attack at the salon where she worked in Gloucester last month. A man from Cheltenham, Asher Thomas Maslin, 22, has been charged with her murder and remanded in custody.The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said Gloucestershire constabulary had referred the matter to it because the force had "previous contact with her".It said the investigation would examine contact between Gazzard and Gloucestershire police. There will also be an analysis of how similar matters have been handled by the force.IPCC associate commissioner Guido Liguori said: "This is clearly a very difficult time for Hollie's friends and family and I would like to extend my condolences to them. They will have questions about whether anything more could have been done by Gloucestershire constabulary to prevent her tragic death, and I am also aware that incidents such as this can be of concern to the wider community."Our investigation will establish what action was taken and whether it was in line with force and national guidelines. This will include looking at what intelligence was available to the force and the use of risk assessments."As a criminal investigation is under way, we must be cautious about the information we make public so as not to interfere with the ongoing criminal proceedings."
