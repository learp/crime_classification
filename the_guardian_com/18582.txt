A 32-year-old neighbour of landscape architect Joanna Yeates was charged with her murder last night, Avon and Somerset police said.Vincent Tabak, a Dutch architectural engineer who was arrested on Thursday, will appear at Bristol magistrates court tomorrow accused of killing the 25-year-old.Detective Chief Inspector Phil Jones, who led the inquiry, said last night: "I would like to pay tribute to Jo's family and Greg for their assistance and dignity in the most difficult of circumstances. Their support to us has been invaluable."Joanna's father David said earlier in the day that his daughter and her boyfriend Greg Reardon had never mentioned Tabak. "Jo and Greg didn't socialise [with him]. As far as I know, their paths never crossed," he said.Speaking from his home in Ampfield, near Romsey, Hants, Mr Yeates added: "It would be good if the person they have arrested is the right one this time, simply because then we wouldn't have to go through it all again."I have nothing personal against this man â€“ I don't know him. We are just waiting now."Tabak works in Bath for engineering company Buro Happold and moved to Bristol from Bath in 2009. Police began searching his property, which is next door to Joanna's flat in Clifton, last Thursday after setting up a tarpaulin outside it. Officers had been granted a 30-hour extension to continue questioning Tabak.Joanna's landlord, Chris Jefferies, was arrested on 30 December last year in connection with the murder but was later released on bail.Joanna was last seen alive on 17 December. She left the Ram pub near Bristol city centre, where she had been drinking with colleagues and walked home, stopping at three shops. After a search, her body was found on a rural roadside verge three miles away. A postmortem revealed that she had been strangled.
