The resettlement of offenders is poorly coordinated and fails to address social exclusion issues such as housing and addiction problems that could lead people back into crime, according to the chief inspector of prisons.The warning came as the Home Office admitted that it could not explain why there are record numbers of prisoners in England and Wales despite an apparent drop in the number of crimes.Prisons minister Beverley Hughes said prisoner numbers hit a record high of 68,127 last week despite the British crime survey for 2000 recording 12% drop in offending.In her first report, the new chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, warned that there was no national strategy on resettlement of offenders despite evidence of good practice.The report, Through the Prison Gate, jointly published with the chief inspector of probation, Professor Rod Morgan, found that short-term prisoners were particularly neglected even though they have the greatest needs.Prisoners often leave custody ill prepared to live and work in the community, and without having addressed their offending behaviour, it states."What we are presenting is a challenge that both the prison and probation services ought to meet, and we hope they will be given the support to do it," said Ms Owers. The report calls on the home office to tackle the social exclusion of ex-prisoners through educational and vocational opportunities and assistance with housing, debt and relationship difficulties.It recommends that inmates are provided with risk and need assessments, more effective drug and alcohol treatments, and the motivation to not re-offend."Unless something is done to tackle the causes of offending behaviour, and the social and economic exclusion from which it commonly springs, and to which it contributes, prisons will continue to have revolving doors and the public will not in the long term be protected," the report states.Martin Narey, director general of the prison service, said the report provided additional impetus for resettlement work being developed in prisons. "In order for resettlement schemes to flourish we first need to provide decent and secure prisons and ensure that prisoners have the basic literacy and numeracy skills required for employment," he said.The number of people in jail has risen by 2,000 since David Blunkett was appointed home secretary. The prison population stands at 68,066 today, including an all-time high of 4,036 women.Speaking at the launch of the report, Ms Hughes said: "We are seeing a fall in the incidence of crime, particularly serious crime, and I think we're right to say 'What's going on? "If crime is falling, why are we seeing a continuing rise in prison population?"The government's reform of sentencing, based on a review by former Home Office adviser John Halliday, has been delayed because of anti-terrorism legislation. Implementation of the review's recommendations is expected to lead to more community sentences rather than short-term prison sentences, particularly those of six months or less. Two-thirds of inmates are serving sentences of a year or less, and three-quarters have been sent down for less than two years. Ms Hughes insisted that the review's prediction that up to 9,500 extra prison places might need to be built would not need revising.
