"Any movement yet guv?" I was standing in the open doorway of the wing office. Mr Turnlock, our brusque and efficient landing officer was on the phone. Twenty minutes earlier there had been a "general alarm". I thought I knew the reason why. The orderly who delivers the newspapers from the library had told me. Mr Turnlock finished talking and replaced the handset. "What is it?" he said. "Er, any movement yet?" I repeated, "the stabbing . . ." "What stabbing?" he said. "The paper orderly said there had been a stabbing on one of the wings and that was why movement had been stopped." "Rubbish," said Mr Turnlock. "You see how rumours erupt in these places? Movement was stopped because an old chap collapsed outside the chapel. It started back up again 10 minutes ago." "Oh," I said, "right." Feeling foolish, I left the wing and made my way towards the exercise yard. Mr Turnlock was right. After all these years I should have known better than to believe the worst without question. But tensions had been running a little high in the jail. A week earlier a man had been attacked by another wielding a lino cutting blade fixed into a piece of dowling. The home-made weapon had been thrust into the victim's face with such force that the steel edge had ploughed a deep furrow across the bones of his cheek and jaw. The resulting 40 stitches made it look as if he had been flung face first through a car window screen. I spoke to him briefly in the healthcare centre a few days later when I was up making an appointment to see the dentist. It was the worst chibbing I had ever seen. I didn't know the scarred man, but coincidentally I had spoken to him once before. It was a couple of days after his arrival last September and we were browsing the same bookshelf in the library. He asked me what the prison was like. "Relatively quiet," I told him. Unimpressed, he began dropping names of reputed tough-guy prisoners he had allegedly already done time with - "faces" in the system. The conversation was beginning to bore me until I heard him mention the name "Braggs." "Who?" I said, startled, "Donny Braggs?" "No," he said, "his son, Joe. Donny Braggs is dead." "You're kidding," I said. I pressed him for details. It was important to be sure we were talking about the same man. Satisfied we were, I asked him what had happened. "He was stabbed in the leg in a nightclub," he said. "Gangrene set in and it killed him." "Christ," I said, and sighed a deep sigh. Thirteen years had passed but I had never forgotten my run-in with Donny Braggs. We were on the same wing at the time. Donny was "on the book" (Category A prisoner) and was known for his short temper. One sleepy-eyed Monday morning I bumped into him outside my cell door with my breakfast tray. Immediately he began ranting and hurling abuse. His racket was drawing dozens of pairs of eyes in our direction so I implored him to come into my cell. "The screws will be on us in a minute." I said, "Come on, I'll make us a cup of tea." He followed me in, but straight away recommenced his tirade. He was becoming hysterical. Realising I had made a mistake I grabbed the front of his shirt, intending to shove him back outside. Instead Donny wrong footed me and swung me around full circle. He reached up behind his head with his right hand and suddenly I felt a stabbing blow in the corner of my left eye. He must have seen my cutlery in a cup on the shelf which was behind me before pulling me around. Luckily the knife he grabbed was only made of plastic. Other stinging blows to my scalp and face followed before instinct caused me to drop my head and unwittingly crash it against the bridge of his nose. Donny fled, bleeding, from the cell. We never resolved that conflict. He was shipped out a couple of days later for threatening a prison officer - I explained my swollen eye and the weals on my face by fibbing that I had "collided with someone while jogging". Over the years I often thought about Donny. The prison system is a small world and I couldn't help wondering if and when there would be another confrontation. God knows if he ever thought about me. Although I'm ashamed to admit it, I felt relieved when I learned of his demise. On reflection, perhaps it was not so foolish after all to have believed the worst from the library orderly. One thing I'm sure of though - for a long time to come, whenever the young man with the scars hears that "movement has been stopped" he'll be minded to believe the worst without question. And it will be the most natural thing in the world. Â• Erwin James is serving a life sentence. He will not be paid for this article.
