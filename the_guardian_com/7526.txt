An Italian terrorism expert who met the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko on the day he was allegedly poisoned has also tested positive for the radioactive isotope polonium 210, it emerged today.Mario Scaramella, who has been in hiding since Mr Litvinenko died, met the former spy in a London sushi restaurant just hours before he fell ill.Experts believe the fact that the academic, a contact of Mr Litvinenko, has also tested positive for polonium 210 indicates that the poison was delivered at the restaurant.Mr Scaramella has since been taken to hospital for further tests. Italian doctors said he had tested positive for a "significant" amount of the poison.It also emerged tonight that an adult member of Mr Litvinenko's family, who was in close contact with him during his illness, has been exposed to polonium 210.The person, who has not been identified, tested positive for the radioactive substance after providing a urine sample. The Health Protection Agency said the levels are not significant enough to result in any illness in the short term.Meanwhile, doctors wearing specialist protective clothing have started the post mortem examination of Mr Litvinenko at a hospital in east London.Detectives investigating the death of the 43-year-old, who died last Thursday, are investigating letters smuggled out of Russia. The letters purportedly show the existence of a secret squad set up to target him and others, it was claimed today.Scotland Yard has been passed copies of two letters apparently written in jail by the former Russian intelligence officer Mikhail Trepashkin. In one, Mr Litvinenko is warned that he and his family are at risk.Mr Litvinenko's London friend Alex Goldfarb said scans of the letters came into his possession yesterday, and he passed them to Scotland Yard.Mr Trepashkin - who worked for the KGB's successor, the FSB, until 1997 - was tried in 2004 on accusations of being a British spy and passing secret information to Mr Litvinenko and his close friend Boris Berezovsky, the tycoon in exile in the capital.Mr Litvinenko believed he was being targeted for criticising the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.However, British intelligence sources increasingly suspect that the former spy, killed by polonium 210, was the victim of a plot involving "rogue elements" within the Russian state, it was reported today.While ruling out any official involvement by Vladimir Putin's government, investigators believe only those with access to state nuclear laboratories could have mounted such a sophisticated plot.Three pathologists are carrying out his post-mortem examination at the Royal London hospital. One is representing the government and one Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina, while an independent pathologist is gathering evidence for any criminal investigation.Also today, the foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, met her Russian counterpart and received renewed assurances that Moscow would cooperate fully with the investigation into Mr Litvinenko's death."When the questions are formulated and sent through the existing channels, we will consider them thoroughly," the Russian ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Sergei Lavrov as saying. "Now the ball is on the English side, and everything depends on the British investigators."Mrs Beckett's conversation with Mr Lavrov, which followed an earlier phone call between the two, did not mean Russia was being obstructive, the prime minister's spokesman said.The investigation into possible rogue Russian agents centres on a group of men who entered the UK among a large crowd of Muscovite football fans.The group of five or more, who arrived shortly before Mr Litvinenko fell ill, attended CSKA Moscow's match against Arsenal at the Emirates stadium on November 1 and flew back shortly afterwards.While describing them only as witnesses, police believe their presence could hold the key to the former spy's death.Yesterday, the Irish government said it was launching a separate investigation focusing on the former Russian prime minister Yegor Gaidar, who fell ill during a visit to Ireland a week ago.At first, Mr Gaidar's entourage thought he was suffering from something he had eaten, but one of his aides yesterday said doctors suspected he had been poisoned.The Garda√≠ said it would question everyone Mr Gaidar had been in contact with, but there was no immediate link to the Litvinenko case.In London, the number of locations searched by police for traces of radioactive material rose to 24 yesterday, with polonium 210 found at 12 of those.The home secretary, John Reid, told the Commons there was a "high level" of contamination at some of the locations, but said the risk to the public was low.It was reported that the levels of radiation were highest in the toilets of the Millennium hotel in London, where Mr Litvinenko had a meeting shortly before falling ill.These levels were above the safe public dose limit, Channel 4 News reported. There were also traces at the Itsu sushi bar, where he went later, but they were far lower.Explaining the increasing belief that Mr Litvinenko's death involved Russian state elements, one official said yesterday: "Only the state would have access to that material."Officials have now gone so far as to say that the involvement of individuals within the FSB in the affair is "probable". However, they insist it is far from definite, and the evidence is still circumstantial.Intelligence sources do not rule out the possibility that the perpetrators were "rogue elements" either still in the FSB or former members of it.Three British Airways aircraft have been taken out of service in connection with the investigation, with traces of polonium 210 found on two of them. One has now been cleared to return to service, the airline said today.The culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, and Lord Coe, who flew to Barcelona, are among those known to have travelled on one of the contaminated planes."I'm feeling absolutely tiptop," Ms Jowell said today. "This was a scare that never was."
