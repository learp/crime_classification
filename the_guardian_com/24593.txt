The number of prison suicides fell by a fifth last year, but the figure is still too high, a prison reform group warned today.Official figures, released on New Year's Day, showed there were 78 self-inflicted deaths in English and Welsh prisons in 2005 compared with 95 in 2004.Frances Crook, the director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, warned the Home Office not to treat the reduction as a success."Whilst this long-overdue fall in the number of prison suicides is welcome, it should not obscure the fact that 78 men, women and children still died during the course of the year," she said."What the figures really show is how low things had sunk in recent years for the authorities to be hailing the fact that 'only' 78 people took their own lives during 2005."The Home Office should not lull itself into a false sense of security by believing that they have cracked the problem of suicide in prison."The Howard League pointed out that 16 of those who took their own lives were aged under 21, including two aged 16 and 17.The proportion of suicides by ethnic minority inmates rose from one in 10 of all prison suicides in the past five years to more than one in five during 2005, it added.Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: "The government takes the issue of suicide in prisons very seriously and, in the face of population pressures, suicide prevention efforts have continued with unprecedented energy and commitment."A new care-planning system is being rolled out across the estate to ensure that there is a flexible, holistic approach to address the needs and care of these highly vulnerable people."We will continue to learn from our experience and will continue to work with a wide range of stakeholders to improve our practices and procedures."
