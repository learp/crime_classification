Tony Blair yesterday made his most scathing attack yet on the criminal justice system to justify the major extension of summary powers for the police to rein in yobbishness and antisocial behaviour.The prime minister claimed in his Downing Street speech that the traditional court processes loved by the "political and legal establishment" did too much to protect the rights of the accused while proving "utterly useless" in protecting the ordinary citizen on the street.Mr Blair, for whom the drive against antisocial behaviour is a key plank of his final term in office, said traditional thinking had to be overthrown not only in the way the police and courts dealt with low-level crime but also in how to tackle the few "problem families" who were responsible for much of the disorder.Quoting the 17th-century political thinker Thomas Hobbes and 20th-century social critic RH Tawney, the prime minister hoped the Respect action plan launched yesterday would not be judged on whether or not it was "tough" or populist but as opening a "genuine intellectual debate about the nature of liberty in a modern developed society".While human rights groups sharply criticised him for "introducing a mutant strain of criminal law" that could sweep up the innocent with the guilty, child welfare groups claimed the action plan was a "sheep in wolf's clothing" with the punitive rhetoric masking a massive expansion in preventative parenting programmes.Mr Blair claimed that under the criminal justice system, in theory, the police charged the accused, the prosecutor prosecuted and the court decided the outcome, but that was not what happened in reality. "In practice, the person who spits at an old lady on her way to the shops is not prosecuted because to do so takes many police hours, much resource and if all that is overcome, the outcome is a fine. The result is the police do not think it is worth it; and so it doesn't happen."It was necessary to reverse the burden of proof in such cases because the system was treating Britain as if the country were still in the 19th or early 20th centuries while the scale and nature of modern crime made the traditional processes simply too cumbersome and too remote from reality to be effective."The real choice, the choice on the street, is not between a criminal law process that protects the accused and one that doesn't; it is between a criminal law process that puts protection of the accused in all circumstances above and before that of protecting the public."He said it had to be accepted that the extension of summary powers with the right of appeal worked in practice: "Anything else is the theory, loved by much of the political and legal establishment but utterly useless to the ordinary citizen."Although he said that his father, who grew up in the back streets of 1930s Glasgow, would deplore the lack of respect in 21st-century Britain, Mr Blair insisted he was not trying to take the country back to some golden age: "We are not looking to go back to anything. We have left behind an era in which we refused to respect people because of who they were. The only reason to withhold respect is because of what people do."He acknowledged that 1950s Britain was not a place where ethnic minorities, gay men or lesbians were respected and women were expected to stay at home rather than pursue a career. "But it is sometimes said that, as we get more prosperous and as deference declines, respect for authority is bound to fall away."But his intellectual justification was dismissed by the Tory leader, David Cameron, as failing to tackle the long-term causes in the decline of respect, and by the human rights group Liberty as regarding the presumption of innocence in British law as "too cumbersome".Main proposals The respect agendaEnforcement and community justice· Extend powers to shut "crack houses" to any residential or licensed premises which are the scene of significant, persistent and serious nuisance· Increase fixed penalty notice fine for serious offences to £100· Extend "conditional cautions" so offender has to undertake unpaid work to make good damage to community· Lower threshold for seizure of proceeds of crime from £5,000 to £1,000· New offence of obstructing ambulance workersDealing with problem families· Fifty "sinbin" schemes to tackle families who are out of control.
