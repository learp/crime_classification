Edinburgh detectives have stepped up their appeals for help identify a murdered woman with very distinctive jewellery and ornamental dental work, whose dismembered remains were found in a shallow grave at a well-known beauty spot.The woman's body was found on Thursday evening on Costorphine Hill, a popular nature reserve and woodland park area near Edinburgh zoo, but her identity and the cause of her murder remain a mystery.In the first detailed description of the remains since their discovery, detectives with Police Scotland, the new national Scottish force, said they believed the victim had been murdered and dismembered at a different site, and urged the public to report any unusual sightings in the woods.Detectives have already firmly ruled out any link with the murder of Suzanne Pilley, a bookkeeper from Edinburgh who disappeared in May 2010. Her ex-boyfriend, David Gilroy, was convicted of killing her but her body has never been recovered.Detective Chief Inspector Keith Hardie, of the new force's specialist crime division's major investigation team, said a postmortem has established the victim was middle-aged, white, of medium build and was short."She has had significant cosmetic work on her teeth. We have also recovered a number of rings and two of these are distinctive, both are gold in appearance, with one in the design of a daisy and the other is heart shaped," he said."I feel confident that someone will recognise the description of the lady's teeth and the rings, together with the general description of a slim, middle-aged lady who has disappeared."Hardie said they were releasing a fuller description of the victim's appearance in an effort to expand their investigation and jog people's memories. She may have been buried at any time in the past six months, he said, and urged people to remember seeing people in the area with particularly large backpacks or tools."This is someone's daughter, it may be someone's mother and I am appealing today to the public to consider if there is a mother, a daughter or a friend you have not seen or heard from for the past few weeks or months, and the person fits the following description, I would urge you to contact us now," he added.
