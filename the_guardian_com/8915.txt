A policeman who preyed on vulnerable women he met while on duty was today convicted of two charges of rape and three of indecent assault.PC Stephen Mitchell, of Northumbria police, had denied all the charges against him. He claimed the 16 women who had made complaints about his behaviour were liars.On Friday, the 42-year-old was cleared of three counts of rape, two indecent assaults and two counts of misconduct in a public office.But the jury at Newcastle crown court convicted him of five other sex offences on its fifth day of deliberations today.Yesterday, he was found guilty of six counts of misconduct in a public office but cleared of six other counts of misconduct and one of assault.During a five-week trial, the prosecution said Mitchell preyed on heroin addicts, shoplifters and a disabled teenager by offering them help while they were in custody at Pilgrim Street police station, in central Newcastle, and then demanding sexual favours afterwards.He had a hold over one woman for three and a half years – even trying to keep her on heroin after she had quit – which only ended when she went into hiding after he raped her in handcuffs at her home, it was alleged.Other women were flattered then propositioned while still in custody with a view to beginning sexual relations later, the jury was told.Mitchell claimed the women colluded against him after a rumour that he said had been made up by one claimant was picked up by others in a close-knit criminal fraternity.The officer, from Glasgow, claimed: "These people will grab any opportunity they can."
