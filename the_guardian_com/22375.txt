A postman faces jail for hoarding more than 10,000 pieces of mail in his house and garden in Plymouth, Devon, and burning hundreds of letters and parcels. Neil Roberts, 40, opened some of the personal mail and burned some of the items in a dustbin.Magistrates were told yesterday that Roberts had worked at a sorting office for two years when his employers received anonymous information that he was storing mail.Investigators visited him and saw piles of mail in the garden and more in his house. John Major, prosecuting, said that of the 10,000 pieces discovered about a third was personal mail. Of these, 33 items were opened, and Roberts admitted burning 400 pieces.After his arrest Roberts told police: "I'm so sorry. I hate myself for it. I wish I could turn the clocks back."Kenneth Papenfus, defending, said: "This isn't a story of vice or malice or any sort of deliberate act. This is part of a long history of depression. The fact he was hoarding all these items is clearly an indication he could not discharge his responsibility."Roberts pleaded guilty to delaying the delivery of 10,860 postal packages between July 2006 and September last year. He will be sentenced next month.
