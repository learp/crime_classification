An axe-wielding attacker hacked a man to death in front of horrified residents of a smart north London street yesterday before calmly surrendering to police.Passers-by and workmen tried to intervene but could not halt the sustained attack, which happened in Belsize Park, an area popular with celebrities and wealthy business people.Some witnesses said they heard the attacker shouting at the victim, identified as a local 61-year-old married man with children, that he had "had it coming to him for 20 years". One man said when police arrived the attacker, thought to be from the Camden area, told them it was a "private" matter.The attack happened at around 9.40am in Eton Avenue. Student Nick Blackford, 20, described how he was woken by screams. He looked out of the window of his third floor flat and saw the smartly dressed attacker, later said by police to be 37, yelling at the victim. He said: "He was shouting something like: 'You've had this coming to you for 20 years'."Workmen had tried to stop the attack by charging at the man with scaffolding poles but had to retreat. A woman driver tried to reason with the attacker but was ignored.Avelina Rodrigues, 48, who was cleaning a house nearby, said: "The man was raining down blows on the victim. I shouted at him to stop but he was just hitting the man's head. The man [the attacker] looked at me. He looked normal. There was no anger in his eyes. He just wanted to destroy that man."Ms Rodrigues said that when police arrived a few minutes later, the man stopped his attack: "He knelt down, put his axe down and calmly surrendered."A man was being questioned by police at Holborn police station in central London.
