A terminally-ill woman, aged 72, was taken to jail shouting: "I'm innocent" yesterday, after a jury convicted her of breaking a neighbour's arm with a spade.Retired civil servant June Iddon interrupted the judge and complained that she could not hear, as a court was given details of her increasingly vicious row with a neighbour.She was convicted of assault by a jury at Preston crown court which heard that she had brought the spade down "like an axe" on 62-year-old Jeffrey Grundy.Jailing her for 24 weeks, recorder Lesley Anderson QC said: "Even today you have demonstrated no real appreciation of how serious the injury could have been, and you have shown a complete lack of any remorse. Sending a woman like you to prison is a significant waste of public resources. But in my judgment, and notwithstanding your age and physical frailty, you need a sustained period in which to reflect on your behaviour."Iddon, who is single and has lived all her life in the same house in Tarleton, Lancashire, lost a series of previous cases about a narrow strip of land between her garden and Grundy's. She was jailed for 28 days last year after defying a civil injunction against trespassing.In mitigation, her counsel Louise Whaites said that Iddon led a sad, isolated existence and had been treated for cancer since 2003, when she was given a life expectancy of up to 10 years. She said: "It is extremely sad when a lady of this age, who has worked all her adult life and put a great deal into her community when she was younger, finds herself in this position."Grundy said after the hearing that Iddon was an "actress with a dual personality" who could have paralysed him and put him in a wheelchair if his arm had not deflected the spade. He said: "She's worse than the neighbour from hell. I'd move if I could but if you've got someone like that next door you can't sell your house. At least I will have a pleasant Christmas without her."
