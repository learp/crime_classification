Police in Northern Ireland have been urged to finally catch the killers of a German student who was raped and murdered in north Antrim nearly a quarter of a century ago.No one has ever been charged with killing Inga Maria Hauser, a backpacker whose body was found in a forest outside the seaside resort of Ballycastle on 20 April 1988.Detectives said this time last year they were closing the net on a number of people they believed knew the killer of the young German, one of the highest profile non-political crimes in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.Ahead of the 24th anniversary of the 18-year-old's murder, SDLP assembly member John Dallat expressed his hope that 2012 will be the year when the perpetrators are finally brought to justice. Dallat has been in regular contact with the police over the unsolved murder investigation.Dallat said: "Every year thousands of young people from Ireland travel to different parts of the world and their parents entrust the people of other nations to look after them, protect them and allow them to return safely. That is what the parents of Inga Maria did and they were badly let down by one or more individuals who shamefully murdered their daughter and buried her in a shallow grave in a lonely wood."I am grateful to the police for keeping this case open and I welcome developments in DNA but I am concerned that nature will eventually take its course and those involved will go to their graves without having to answer for the crime they committed."As we approach the anniversary of Inga Maria Hauser's murder I know it is the wish of many people and particularly the parents of young people who travel abroad to bring to justice the individual or individuals who let the nation down by what they did to the Hauser family and their daughter."It is understood the police believe at least two people were involved in the teenager's murder. Hauser, who was from Munich, travelled to Larne in Northern Ireland on the ferry from Scotland on 6 April 1988. Fourteen days later the missing student's body was found in Ballypatrick Forest park.
