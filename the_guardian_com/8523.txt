Plans by Theresa May to reform controversial police "stop and search" powers are being held up by wrangling between the Home Office and Downing Street, government sources have confirmed.A Whitehall "write round", in which every department is invited to give its thoughts on a proposal, is understood to have been delayed by No 10.The home secretary, who has been reaching out to the Conservative right recently after her office leaked a proposal to impose a 75,000 cap on EU migration, is adopting a more liberal stance on the reform of police stop-and-search powers.In a speech to the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales conference last September, May said that stop and search has the potential to cause "immense resentment".The home secretary, whose differences with No 10 are reported in the Times on Wednesday, has warned of the "waste of time" involved in the 1.2m police searches in the street every year. She has warned that the arrest rate from stop and search, as low as 3% in some areas, is "far too low for comfort".In her speech in September, May said that stop and search can be effective in reducing knife crime if it is used properly. But she added: "The caveat is vital: it works if it is used properly and fairly. Stop and search has the potential to cause immense resentment and honesty to the police, with all the implications that has for generating distrust and ending co-operation from the public, if it is not used fairly."The home office confirmed after the recent finding by an inquest jury that Mark Duggan had been killed lawfully by police that it was considering reforms to stop-and-search powers. May is understood to be examining whether to limit, though not ban, the use of section 60 which allows a police officer to stop an individual even if they lack reasonable suspicion of involvement in a crime.Ministers insisted that the verdict on the shooting of Duggan was reached by an inquest jury whose members heard three months of evidence. The jury found that Duggan had been killed lawfully by a police marksman, even though it accepted he was unarmed at the time.But ministers and the Met commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, are keen to show they understand the need to reform stop-and-search powers. Hogan-Howe said: "We do have a particular concern about our relationship with younger members of the black community. That's why since I became commissioner I have significantly reduced the use of stop and search. We rarely use the powers [section 60] we have to do blanket searches across an area, and concentrate on searching where we have intelligence to suggest we should."
