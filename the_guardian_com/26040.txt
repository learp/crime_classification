Tony Blair today called on Britain's black communities to speak out against gang culture, as he promised further new laws against knife and gun crime.Following the violent deaths of seven black teenagers in London over the past three months, the prime minister said the killings were the "latest manifestations of severe disorder".But he stressed: "We won't stop this by pretending it isn't young black kids doing it."He hinted that tough new anti-gun and knife laws were on the way in the wake of the killings.Mr Blair made his comments in a speech in Cardiff as he hit the campaign trail in Wales ahead of next month's assembly elections.The PM also emphasised that the victims of the attacks were also "innocent young black kids".His speech came on the day that a second teenager was in court charged with the murder of 14-year-old Paul Erhahon in east London over the Easter weekend. A third boy, aged 15, was also today arrested in connection with the case.The two charged boys, who cannot be named, are 14 and 13 years old.Giving the Jim Callaghan memorial lecture, the PM said: "In respect of knife and gun gangs, the laws need to be significantly toughened."There needs to be an intensive police focus on these groups. The ringleaders need to be identified and taken out of circulation; if very young, as some are, put in secure accommodation.He went on: "The black community - the vast majority of whom in these communities are decent, law-abiding people horrified at what is happening - need to be mobilised in denunciation of this gang culture that is killing innocent young black kids."But we won't stop this by pretending it isn't young black kids doing it."Paul Erhahon was the seventh Londoner under 16 to be murdered since the end of January. His 15-year-old friend, who was also stabbed, remains in hospital.Mr Blair said tackling violence was the "missing dimension" to an otherwise successful regeneration of Britain's cities.Saying there should be "less Jenkins, more Callaghan", he compared the liberalism of the 60s Labour home secretary Roy Jenkins with the more socially conservative Labour leader Jim Callaghan.He warned that the country was "in danger of completely misunderstanding" the nature of the problem as a social malaise."More and more I think this is not just wrong but misleading; I mean literally misleading us in the wrong direction."Mr Blair recast prime minister Callaghan in a New Labour light, saying the late PM would have agreed with the "Respect" agenda and himself always espoused the code of the Boy Scouts in public life.Pointing to the violence in Manchester ahead of last night's Champions League tie at Old Trafford, he said similar errors were made in the past over football hooliganism."In truth, most young people are perfectly decent and law-abiding, more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime. Most families are not dysfunctional."Most people, even in the hardest communities, are content to play fairly and by the rules. Most young black boys are not involved in knife and gun gangs.Referring to recent unrest at football matches, he said: "On the whole, even at the height of football 'hooliganism' most football fans were proper fans, not hooligans."What we are dealing with is not a general social disorder; but specific groups or people who for one reason or another, are deciding not to abide by the same code of conduct as the rest of us."In the end, football hooliganism was dealt with by a combination of tougher laws, intensive police work, and reducing the possibilities of organised violence."It worked. But it only worked when people stopped pretending it was a problem of football fans."David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said: "We welcome the prime minister's sentiment that gang leaders need to be targeted but after 10 years in power and just weeks before Tony Blair steps down, the public will wonder why it has taken so long for him to speak up."But the speech attracted a daming response from the Liberal Democrats.Simon Hughes, the party's chair and a London MP, said: "The prime minister is just plain wrong and over simplistic about gun and knife crime."Some of us live in the sorts of places where these attacks and tragedies happen and we know that the picture is much more complicated."Of course, only a minority of young people ever use a gun or a knife, but it is absolutely not limited to black youngsters. "Many young people now getting caught up in gangs and violence on our streets are white, mixed race and Asian as well. "The common factor is that they either think weapons are cool or they're frightened and think it's necessary to defend themselves. All the evidence shows that young people are the most frequent victims as well as perpetrators of these horrendous crimes. "The solutions are complex, but personal and family responsibility, appropriate education and training, lots of constructive activity and a major increase in qualified youth workers would make a massive difference."
