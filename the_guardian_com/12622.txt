A major revolt in the probation service has been averted by a little-noted but gracious announcement by Martin Narey, chief executive of the new National Offender Management Service (Noms).After spending 10 weeks explaining his proposed structure to more than 3,000 staff across the country, Narey has announced a reprieve for the existing 42 local area probation boards earmarked for the axe."I have decided that the option of moving immediately to create new regional boards is unlikely to deliver better management of offenders and better services - my two main objectives," he says.Narey is going to press ahead with the plan for new regional offender managers, who will have direct responsibility for budget allocations, but the local boards will continue to control their own areas. In truth, the underlying philosophy of Noms - the idea that there should be "end to end" management of offenders across the prison and probation services - received widespread support. But it appears to have been a classic case of highlighting all the difficulties of putting an excellent policy idea into practice.The proposal to axe local probation boards and replace them with a regional structure had the probation service on the brink of revolt. Narey has admitted he received more than 400 written responses to the idea, and more than 240 MPs were against the idea.John Raine, chair of the Probation Boards' Association, is delighted with Narey's decision, saying that the earlier proposal to split the probation service within the new structure of Noms would have caused unnecessary disruption and undermined the essential role of probation in the new organisation.Judy McKnight, general secretary of Napo, the probation union, says that the reprieve shows the government had noted the near unanimous opposition to the original plan. When he made the announcement, Narey acknowledged that his original plan had caused anxiety but warned that everybody should realise that some probation areas were a lot better than others.
