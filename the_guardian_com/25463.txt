 Noisy neighbours and other anti-social tenants could have housing benefit withdrawn under plans revealed by the home secretary David Blunkett today. A white paper on anti-social behaviour proposed that persistent bad behaviour could be an "automatic trigger" to stop benefits. Private landlords who fail to take action against problem tenants will also lose housing benefit payments which currently go direct into their bank accounts. In a wide-ranging paper, Mr Blunkett said tearaways as young as 16 would face fines of up to Â£80 if they cause a nuisance in local communities. Powers to hand out fixed penalty fines will also be extended beyond police and council officials. Organisations accredited by a chief constable - which are thought to include private security guards - will be able to issue fines for offences such as fly-posting and graffiti. The paper said begging should lead to a criminal record for the first time while allowing police to take finger prints from offenders. It also hinted at possible new powers to issue fines to parents of unruly children under the age of 16 - although it did not mention applying the new powers to children as young as 10, as disclosed in a leaked document last week. Mr Blunkett said: "It's time to stop thinking of anti-social behaviour as something that we can just ignore. Anti-social behaviour blights people's lives, destroys families and ruins communities. "It is not about waving a magic wand - it is about giving people the tools they need to claim back their communities for the decent law-abiding majority."
