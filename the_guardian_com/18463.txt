Suzanne Blamires, Shelley Armitage and Susan Rushworth: all are missing and it is feared they have all been killed, perhaps by the same person. But not to worry, women of Yorkshire, or women of Britain generally. These people, the headlines make clear, have not been killed because they are women. They have been killed because they are prostitutes. Or could it simply be that violent misogynists find women in this line of work much easier prey? And could it be that violent misogynists are encouraged in their terrible hatred by a wider culture that emphasises at every opportunity that a prostitute's murder is not quite as awful and incomprehensible as a woman's murder?
