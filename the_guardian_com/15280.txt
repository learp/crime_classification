Four men from a hostel for former offenders were arrested yesterday on suspicion of the murder of a 77-year-old woman who was found battered to death at her cottage.Police said the men were arrested at Elderfield House, near Winchester, a hostel which attracted controversy when a serial sex attacker who was living there, Anthony Rice, killed a woman he had met in a pub.Forensic science experts yesterday searched the hostel following the arrest of the men, aged 21, 28, 36 and 37.Detective Chief Inspector Paul Barton, of Hampshire police, confirmed the men were from the hostel, where former prisoners are housed and supervised.Barton said that officers were still keeping an open mind in the investigation and said the arrests were "one line of inquiry" based on "only one of our hypotheses".Barton would not comment on whether a murder weapon had been found and he appealed for joggers, ramblers or anyone who might have seen anything suspicious to come forward. He said that 120 officers were involved in the investigation.Georgina Edmonds was found dead on Friday afternoon by her son, Harry, and a family friend when he returned home from work. She lived in a house called Fig Tree Cottage in the grounds of her son's home in the village of Brambridge.A postmortem examination found she died from head injuries.About 15 people live at Elderfield House, which is run by a Christian charity, the Langley House Trust.In August 2005, sex attacker Anthony Rice lived there for nine months on his release from prison. He met a woman called Naomi Bryant in a pub and days later stabbed and strangled her at her home in Winchester. Rice was jailed for a minimum of 25 years for her murder in October 2005.The Liberal Democrat MP for Winchester, Mark Oaten, said: "If these arrests were to lead to charges against individuals at Elderfield then with regret I think I would find it hard to continue to support the hostel remaining in my constituency."I don't wish to make a kneejerk reaction but as the local representative for the community I have to put safety first."There were no signs of forced entry at Mrs Edmonds's cottage but police said it was normal for the pensioner, the widow of a businessman who founded a coffee company, to leave her house unlocked.In a statement, her son said: "We are grateful for the level of media interest in this case and hope that helps to progress the police investigation."Yesterday Mark Greenshield, who runs the White Horse pub in Otterbourne just yards from the hostel, said: "The place is a holiday camp and I say pull it down. Feelings are strong in the village, especially after the Anthony Rice case, when lots of people went to a meeting in the village hall."They [the ex-offenders] are not tagged or anything and they are supposed to be in by 11.30pm but I have seen them jumping out of the windows at 2 o'clock in the morning and I've even been over there and told the staff."There are some old guys who have lived there for years and everyone knows them in the village and they are OK."However, another resident who lived close to Elderfield House said that in the 20 years he had lived nearby there had only been a few problems.The man, who did not want to be named, said: "It's done a lot of good work."Otterbourne parish councillor Roger Zebedee said: "The majority of people are pretty supportive of the place. The probation and agencies have given various assurances to the residents of Otterbourne."
