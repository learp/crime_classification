The number of prisoners serving life sentences to have been freed on parole has almost halved in England and Wales, a report published today revealed.The report showed the parole board had sanctioned the release of lifers in around one in nine (11.8%) cases, almost half the 21.3% rate of the previous year, since April.The board said it had taken a more cautions approach to parole following two high-profile cases in which freed offenders committed violent crimes including murder.In the six months from April to September, 901 lifers requested to be released after serving their minimum sentence. The parole board granted 106 of these requests.Figures also showed that the proportion of parole requests granted for prisoners serving more than four years and less than a life sentence had dropped from nearly half (49%) last year to just over one-third (35.7%) for the six months from April."It's clear that there is a more cautious approach in the wake of one or two high-profile cases where someone who has been released has gone on to commit a serious offence," Tim Morris, of the parole board, said.He said the board's members had taken a "much more stringent approach to the information before them"."Where previously they may have gone ahead and made a decision based on information that wasn't complete, they are being much more rigorous that the information is complete and will defer the matter until they have all the information," he added.Parole, which allows a prisoner to be freed before they have served their full sentence, is granted on the basis of reports by prison and probation staff."The key message for us to put over is that the most important consideration that we have in our work is the safety of the public and reducing the risk to that safety," the parole board chief executive, Christine Glenn, said."In this, we can never stand still. We have to look constantly for ways in which we can learn from our mistakes, improve our procedures and reduce the risk to the public."Her comments followed a report by the chief inspectors of probation, the police and prisons, which warned that warned nearly four out of 10 serious sexual and violent offenders released from prison on licence were being freed without being screened for their risk to the public.The document, published in September, found there was a "very patchy picture" in the way the criminal justice system managed high-risk offenders after their release.Recent cases to have caused public and political concern include the release of Anthony Rice, a sex offender who strangled and stabbed Naomi Bryant at her home in Winchester last year.Rice killed Ms Bryant nine months after being freed by the parole board, which had deemed him to be a minimal risk to the public.In November 2004, financier John Monckton was murdered by Damien Hanson and his accomplice, Elliott White - who were both on probation - during a robbery at his Chelsea home.Hanson had been released on parole three months earlier after serving 12 years for attempted murder.The parole board's annual report for 2005-06, published today, showed that 87 prisoners on a life licence were recalled following allegations of further offences. This amounted to 5.8% of the 1,495 life sentence prisoners under active supervision in the community.There were 7,528 parole applications received during the year, up 3.2% on the previous year.
