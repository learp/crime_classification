A teenage girl who used a mobile phone to film a man killed in a "happy-slapping" attack was today jailed in what is thought to be an unprecedented ruling.The 15-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, sobbed as she was sentenced to two years' detention and put on a training order by Leeds crown court for her part in the death of Gavin Waterhouse last September.The judge, James Stewart QC, said the courts had to make an example of such youths.At a hearing last month, the girl pleaded guilty to manslaughter after admitting to aiding the killing by filming two other teenagers kicking and punching Waterhouse, 29, in an unprovoked attack behind Morrisons supermarket in Keighley, West Yorkshire. The three had all been drinking.After her guilty plea, a Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) spokeswoman said: "As far as I am aware this is the first time a suspect in England and Wales has been successfully prosecuted for aiding and abetting murder or manslaughter, for the filming of an inaptly called happy-slapping incident."Sentencing the girl today, Stewart said: "I've received a most moving letter from your mother about the way you were brought up and the shortcomings of modern society."But it is only by making an example of youths like you that the court can do its best to try and change things."Waterhouse's killers – Mark Masters, 19, of Parkwood Rise, Keighley, and Sean Thompson, 17, of Parkside Terrace, Cullingworth, Bradford – both pleaded guilty to manslaughter at previous hearings and were sentenced at Leeds crown court last week.Masters was sentenced to seven years in a young offenders' institution, and Thompson was sentenced to six years' detention. Sentencing them, Stewart said they typified "the young, drunken, violent yob who hunt in packs and of whom the public are sick and tired". Masters had given the teenage girl his mobile phone and said "Video this", the court heard.The girl approached Waterhouse for 40 pence and when he refused she filmed for about 15 seconds as Masters repeatedly punched Waterhouse in the face. Thompson then pulled Waterhouse to the ground where he was kicked.The girl's barrister, Abbas Lakha QC, said she had had "no idea" of the violence that was going to take place and thought she was being asked to film Waterhouse drunk.Sentencing her, the judge said: "Your part in this cruel and revolting venture was to ask the no doubt terrified Gavin Waterhouse for 40 pence. When he refused, the others attacked him and you filmed the incident on Masters' mobile phone."The victim was left lying on the ground as the teenagers ran off laughing, the court heard. Waterhouse made his way home to his bedsit in North Street, Keighley, where he died from a ruptured spleen."He died, no doubt, in excruciating pain," Stewart said.Immediately after the attack, the 15-year-old told one witness she had filmed the attack but could not get the camera right. The witness described her as "a bit hyper" and dancing to some music.The video was shown to others and sent to mobile phones.Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Superintendent Paul Kennedy said this was "new territory" for the police and the CPS."I think there's something different about this case, the real overriding feature of it throughout the investigation was just the unprovoked, brutal nature of it."The further different aspect to it was the filming, the encouragement by the 15-year-old."You can't help but feel sick to death of the mindless violence that people seem to think they are free to use, and what the court has done today is to send a message to other young people that you can't get yourself involved in violence because you will be punished by the court."
