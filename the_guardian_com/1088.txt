A paranoid schizophrenic graduate who abandoned his medication was committed to Rampton secure hospital yesterday as an inquiry into why he stabbed to death a randomly chosen woman and her unborn twins began.A judge told Benjamin Holiday, 25, there were indications in medical reports that his "very disturbed and dangerous" condition might be linked to his use of ecstasy as a student, when a string of severe delusions became entrenched in his mind.Hull crown court heard that Holiday crept up behind Tina Stevenson, a 31-year-old woman he had never met before, as she walked home after a successful check-up on her double pregnancy at Hull Royal Infirmary.She cried out: "Oh my babies" after a single fatal wound from a 25cm (10in) kitchen knife which Holiday had recently stolen from a local department store.Convicting Holiday of manslaughter, Mr Justice Simon ordered him to be detained under the Mental Health Act at Rampton with his future release conditional on a full assessment by the home secretary and mental health authorities.The judge said: "There is still no clear answer as to how a young woman expecting twins could be stabbed to death in this city's streets by a stranger. This was not of a rational nature."Relatives of Ms Stevenson shouted "Rampton's too good for you" as Holiday was led from the dock by five escorts. He showed no sign of emotion. The court heard that he still suffered from paranoid schizophrenia with complex delusional beliefs and had showed no memory or acknowledgment of the tragedy in January last year.After the hearing, Douglas Gee, the medical director of Humber Mental Health Teaching NHS trust, said Holiday had not shown any earlier indications of extreme violence and was previously of good character.He had spent a fortnight in a secure psychiatric unit in Hull in 2004 but was discharged with a prescription for regular medication and had not appeared to be a threat to anyone. The court heard that Holiday had missed his medication the day before the killing."In the run up to this incident, we were in regular contact with him and there was no indication that he could pose a serious risk," said Dr Gee."He was being seen by us as an outpatient and did not meet national criteria in the Mental Health Act for detaining a patient. Events such as these are shocking but thankfully very rare. Most people with mental health problems pose no threat to others."An internal inquiry concluded earlier this had found that there was no evidence that the tragedy could have been foreseen.Dr Gee added: "Now that the case is over, an independent external inquiry will be held and we will support it in any way we can."The head of the Humberside police inquiry, Detective Superintendent Ray Higgins, said: "Holiday's involvement in this incident is a tragedy for both him and his family, who have tried so hard to help and support him through his illness."The father of the twins, Iraqi refugee Hehdi Rahman Saleh, described Ms Stevenson as "a lovely girl" who had filled their two-year partnership with laughter.
