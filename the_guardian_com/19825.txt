Labour will today launch a new "zero tolerance" criminal justice drive, including an urgent review of the law of self-defence to ensure it backs "have-a-go heroes".The moves by Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, and Jack Straw, the justice secretary, are designed to outflank the Tories' renewed push on law and order based on David Cameron's claim that British society is "broken".Amid concerns from some Labour strategists that the party has ceded too much ground on crime, the home secretary will also announce a new fund worth tens of millions of pounds to support neighbourhood patrol teams, including the issuing of mobile fingerprint machines to officers who will target low-level crime in every community.Ms Smith's first speech as home secretary will mark a return to the language of zero tolerance that has not featured strongly in ministers' speeches since Mr Straw's period as home secretary in Labour's first term.Measures that Ms Smith will announce today are:· Publication of local crime figures to back up the introduction of local beat patrols in every neighbourhood from next April.· Shared local community safety budgets between police, local authorities and other agencies to help tackle crime and antisocial behaviour.· Renewed attempts to secure cross-party consensus on counter-terror legislation.· A new package of measures to tackle gun and gang culture, including providing "exit strategies" for gang members.· The network of specialist help centres for rape victims across the country is to double from 18 to 36.Her speech will be designed to set out Ms Smith's "safety and security" agenda and focus on the tools that are needed to implement Labour's promise to provide a visible policing patrol presence in every neighbourhood. The extra ring-fenced fund for the next generation of police technology is designed to be used for equipment that gets officers out of the police station and on to the beat, including the 10,000 hand-held computers and mobile weapon detectors promised by Gordon Brown on Monday.The introduction of local crime data is designed to address the fact that, despite a 35% fall in the national crime figures since Labour came to power, most people believe that crime has gone up. Ministers hope the provision of local crime data will make clear the real situation and reduce fear of crime.The decision to double the number of sexual assault referral centres, based in healthcare centres and not police stations, is designed to encourage victims to report rapes.As well as medical help and counselling, specialist staff will offer victims the opportunity to deep-freeze samples so they can be used as evidence should they wish to press charges at a later date. Forensic evidence will only be passed to the police if the victim agrees.The increase will mean that there will be a referral centre in nearly every police force area across England and Wales.In his speech, Mr Straw will say: "Enforcing the law, securing justice, is not just a matter for 'them' - the courts, the prisons, the probation service, the police - but for all of us."The justice system must not only work on the side of the people who do the right thing as good citizens, but also be seen to work on their side."The review, he will say, is aimed at ensuring that those who seek to protect themselves, their loved ones and their homes as well as other citizens have confidence that law is on their side.His aides stressed that Mr Straw was not going to go as far as to defend the actions of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer who was jailed for life after he shot in the back a burglar in his home in 1999.
