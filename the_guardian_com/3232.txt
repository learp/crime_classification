The first barrister to be paid more than £1m in one year from legal aid was named yesterday in a government report which showed that the top 12 lawyers in the field earn more than £600,000 from taxpayers.Top of the list was James Sturman QC, who acted for Jose Mourinho in the Ashley Cole "tapping up" case. Mr Sturman, who was paid £1.18m - almost twice what he got the year before - does not have the background often associated with the bar. A non-Oxbridge graduate, he read law at Reading University.Mr Sturman said yesterday that most of his income had come from cases which should not have been pursued, and blamed the prosecuting authorities for wasting taxpayers' money.Details of his earnings appear in lists of the 10 barristers who earned the most from criminal legal aid over the past three years, released by the Department for Constitutional Affairs. A separate list outlines the top 10 earners from civil legal aid for the same period.Many of the top legal aid earners also have other income from private clients. Mr Sturman, for example, represents footballers involved in disciplinary cases.The report shows that Ken Macdonald, the director of public prosecutions, received £597,000 for defending criminal cases in 2003-04 - the year he crossed to the other side for a £165,000 salary.Andrew Dismore, the Labour MP whose parliamentary question elicited the information, said: "They're just astronomical figures. Nobody is worth that sort of money from public funds. What it shows is how the legal aid system has become absolutely skewed towards a few fat cats, whereas those who are doing the donkey work in the magistrates courts and in the crown court are feeling the pinch."The disclosure coincides with a battle between the criminal bar and the lord chancellor over pay rates for run-of-the-mill cases, which have been frozen since 1997. Juniors say they can be paid less than £50 a day, and criminal barristers are threatening to boycott some work for which rates are to be cut. Faced with a £130m overspend on legal aid, Lord Falconer, the lord chancellor, has told the top earners their fees will have to be trimmed."I recognise that there are problems in relation to the way that criminal legal aid pays too much on the big cases and too little on some of the other cases and we need a redistribution," he told the Guardian. "There is plainly a raft of cases where the payments have been much too high."Mr Sturman, 47, who became a QC only three years ago, said most of his £1.8m had come from a two-year international software piracy case which should never have been prosecuted. It was the biggest legal aid case until the Jubilee line corruption trial, which collapsed this year wasting £60m. The piracy case was so expensive because the defence had to read 2.9m pages of prosecution documents, he said."We were arguing, 'why on earth are you prosecuting these people, why don't you take them to the civil courts, get an injunction with a power of arrest, and we'll all save millions and millions of pounds?' But the hi-tech crime unit brought the prosecution and once they served the papers we had to read them."Lord Falconer said the government recognised the need for reform, but was awaiting recommendations due next January from Lord Carter of Coles's review.Highest paid barristers, criminal defence service, 2004-051 James Sturman QC  £1,180,0002 Simon Bourne-Arton QC £902,0003 Kalyani Kaul £766,0004 Gilbert Gray QC £755,0005 Balbir Singh  £750,0006 Peter Griffiths QC  £690,0007 Trevor Burke QC  £683,0008 Thomas Derbyshire £668,0009 George Carter-Stephenson £653,00010 David Spens QC  £639,000
