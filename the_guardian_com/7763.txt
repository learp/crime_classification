Dartmoor prison is now a safer and less oppressive jail than it was two years ago but still has some way to go, according a report published yesterday by the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers.Dartmoor's segregation unit, with its "cages" and "pens", which was the focus of criticism in Ms Owers' last report, has been transformed into a bright, carpeted resettlement unit, she said. But she said while the unit was providing excellent facilities for 45 prisoners, it is used for only 7% of the prison population and more than half of the inmates leave the Devon prison with no fixed address to go to. "Dartmoor 2003 was a visibly different prison from Dartmoor 2001. It was lighter and less oppressive than before, both in its physical appearance and in its less over-controlled atmosphere," Ms Owers said. "We concluded that there has been some welcome and positive changes, but there was still some way to go." In particular the report showed that allegations of racist behaviour by the staff had almost doubled since 2001. Yesterday's report said up to half of the inmates did not work, and education classes, although of a good quality, were only attended by one-third of prisoners.
