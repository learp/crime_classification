Detectives were yesterday given extra time to question Adrian Blair and David Mason, both 19, over the murder of the skydiver Stephen Hilder.Mr Blair and Mr Mason, who were close friends of Hilder, and accompanied him on his ill-fated jump, were arrested on suspicion of murder on Wednesday lunchtime and taken to separate police stations. Mr Hilder, a 20-year-old army officer cadet based at the Royal Military College of Science, near Swindon, Wiltshire, took part in the national championships of the British Collegiate Parachute Association in July. It was at the event that he fell 13,000ft to his death, landing on a field near Hibaldstow airfield, north Lincolnshire, after his parachutes failed. At first it was assumed it was an accident but police then concluded that both his parachutes had been sabotaged. The cord on his main parachute and the strapping on his reserve had been severed. Hilder, a veteran of more than 200 jumps, Mr Blair, from Cornwall, and Mr Mason, from Cambridgeshire, met at the military college and formed a skydiving team. Video footage of the last jump in which the three men are seen performing manoeuvres has been shown on television in an appeal for information about the death. Mr Blair and Mr Mason helped carry Hilder's coffin at his funeral at St Mary's church, Burghill, near his hometown of Hereford.
