A 34-year-old man will appear in court today accused of the murders of two people, one a policeman, 11 years ago.Gary Nelson was charged yesterday with killing a community constable, Patrick Dunne, and William Danso, who were both shot in Clapham, south London, on October 20 1993. PC Dunne, 44, was dealing with an unrelated domestic incident when he stumbled across the gang which had just killed Danso, a 31-year-old bouncer and security guard. Danso was watching television in his terraced house in Cato Road when three men, armed with baseball bats and two handguns, burst in and confronted him in the hallway. They fired a total of 12 shots, six of which hit him. He managed to dial 999 but died of his injuries. Mrs Danso was pregnant with the couple's sixth child when her husband was killed. PC Dunne, who was in the house opposite, came outside to investigate the noise, and one of the men opened fire. He died of a single bullet wound to the chest. The gang drove off in waiting cars. The murder of the community policeman, a former maths teacher who swapped the classroom for a police beat, shocked the nation. Diana, Princess of Wales, sent flowers to his mother, Betty, and Tony Blair, then shadow home secretary, was among hundreds of mourners at his funeral. A few months later three men were charged with the murders. The following year the charges were dropped when the crown prosecution service advised there was insufficient evidence. In October 2001 the Metropolitan police said they were "actively reinvestigating" the case, and a Â£100,000 reward was offered for information leading to a conviction. The policeman's brother, Ivan Dunne, 51, an electrician from Carshalton in Surrey, said yesterday: "We are absolutely ecstatic about this. It will be 11 years to the day on Wednesday when Pat was murdered. "The police have kept us informed and said they would never give up. To get it to court is an incredibly big step. To get justice done would be fantastic."
