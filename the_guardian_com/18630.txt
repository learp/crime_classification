Police have made 97 arrests as part of a clampdown on potential troublemakers ahead of the Notting Hill carnival, Scotland Yard said on Monday.Most of the people were detained on suspicion of possession of drugs in a series of "pre-emptive" arrests ahead of the event later this month.Operation Razorback aims to stop individuals and gangs who are suspected of planning criminal activity at the August Bank Holiday weekend event.They include a 24-year-old woman who was arrested on Monday in Brent, north-west London, for possession of class A and B drugs with intent to supply.Already over the past few days Metropolitan police officers have arrested 88 people on suspicion of possessing class B drugs, who were all given warnings and had the substances confiscated. Three people were detained for possessing class A drugs and released on police bail.A 15-year-old boy was charged with possessing a class B drug and will appear at West London magistrates court on Tuesday, while a 16-year-old boy was arrested for breaching bail conditions.A 19-year-old woman was cautioned for possessing class B drugs.Of the two remaining people, one was arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods and possessing drugs, while the other was already wanted on a warrant.Those arrested were told not to attend the carnival. The crackdown will continue for the next four weeks.Chief Inspector Chris Allmey, from the Met's territorial support group, said: "Operation Razorback is a highly sophisticated and detailed operation aimed at ensuring those who set out with the sole intention of causing trouble at carnival will not succeed."Four weeks of intense activity targeted at preventing troublemakers from getting anywhere near carnival has been planned and we're committed to making Notting Hill carnival as safe as it can be, ensuring that the thousands of people who go along to carnival each year can enjoy this unique and vibrant event."We're asking anyone who may know someone intending to cause trouble to get in touch."
