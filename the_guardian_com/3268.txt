The man on trial for the murder of a reclusive 84-year-old writer was among the leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in China that resulted in the Tiananmen Square massacre, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.Wang Yam, 46, is accused of bludgeoning Allan Chappelow with a blunt instrument at his north London home in May 2006, stealing his identity and defrauding his bank accounts.George Robertson QC, for the defence, said Yam came to Britain, via Hong Kong, after he was forced to flee China in the wake of the massacre in 1989 in which 2,000 students were killed.His grandfather had been one of Mao's "closest comrades" on the Long March and his father was an officer in the Chinese army, Robertson said."He studied physics at university successfully because by the age of 27 he had a position teaching at Beijing university and had a masters degree in electrical engineering. He became vice-president of the student body in 1989 ... He became an organiser of the movement for democracy.""Afterwards there was a witch-hunt. A year or so later ... it was indicated he would have to go to a re-education camp, a coal mine ... He decided to flee as a refugee to Hong Kong. He was accepted in 1992 as an asylum seeker and was naturalised as a British citizen in 1998." For two hours yesterday, the trial was held in private. The judge gave no explanation.Yam denies murder, breaking into the writer's home, stealing four blank cheques and £20, and the handling of the stolen cheques, a mobile phone and a quantity of mail. He also denies obtaining £20,000 by deception. The trial continues.
