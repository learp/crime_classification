A policeman has been re-arrested on suspicion of rape after the discovery of new evidence, it emerged yesterday.The 25-year-old Greater Manchester police officer was first arrested and bailed in March this year after a woman claimed he had raped her three times in 2004. The constable, who had been working in Bury before the allegations were made, was not due to answer bail until August but he was re-arrested yesterday after fresh evidence was uncovered. He was questioned about the evidence yesterday and released on bail again, said a spokeswoman for the Independent Police Complaints Commission. "An advice file will now be prepared for submission to the Crown Prosecution Service for its consideration," she said. "The Independent Police Complaints Commission is managing the investigation into the rape allegation." The CPS will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to charge the policeman, who has not been named. If it decides not to pursue the case, the officer could still face disciplinary action from an internal investigation. A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester police said the investigation was being dealt with by the IPCC and they could not comment on the matter.
