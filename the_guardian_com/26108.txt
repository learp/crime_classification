Please RT: bit.ly/puLBAM #bristol".On Tuesday all four party leaders on Bristol city council, the Liberal Democrat council leader Barbara Janke, Labour leader Peter Hammon, Tory leader Peter Abraham and Green party leader Tess Green, issued a statement condemning the violence, which has so far led to 24 arrests.It said Monday night's disturbances were "shocking, yet relatively isolated" compared with the violence in other cities. They blamed it on "a small minority of opportunist anarchists seeking to capitalise on unrelated circumstances elsewhere". But they added: "We face a challenge as a city but also as individuals, and we all have to rise to this challenge. We need to clean up and reopen for business."
