The Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday condemned Britain's 24-hour drinking culture, saying it was the "tip of the iceberg" of alcohol abuse.Rowan Williams expressed his concern that a review, ordered by the prime minister, Gordon Brown, would conclude that the legislation permitting pubs and clubs to serve alcohol around the clock had been a success."I would be interested to see why anyone should think of it as a success," he said. "I think it has had an effect of making less safe and less civil our public space in many contexts, including Canterbury."There is a whole culture of alcohol abuse which this country has failed to tackle and the 24-hour thing is just the tip of the iceberg. It is not that I am singling it out as the worst bit of the field, it is just that it is one of the more obviously presenting factors."He made the remarks on the fifth anniversary of his enthronement as Archbishop of Canterbury. Since becoming the most senior cleric in the Church of England and head of the world's 77 million-strong Anglican communion, his leadership has come under fire from theologically conservative primates and their more liberal counterparts. Both have attacked him for his reluctance to take sides in the saga over the ordination of gay bishops.Williams also cautiously welcomed the words of the Bishop of Rochester who this month claimed that parts of Britain had become "no-go" areas for non-Muslims. He said: "A lot of Muslims will say, well there are 'no-go' areas for us in British society, in some ways, so if the question is about how do we overcome that mutual isolation, that is a very good question ... I want to say Bishop Nazir-Ali has quite a record in Christian-Muslim dialogue and ought not to be heard as saying something simply negative."
