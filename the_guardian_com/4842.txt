The family of a woman believed to have been murdered by her mentally ill husband who then killed himself said today the couple had been "let down by the system".Sue Goswell's body was found on Sunday at the family bungalow after her 66-year-old husband, Roger, crashed his car into a tree near West Chittingdon. He died later at Worthing hospital.When police went to the bungalow they found a note, believed to have been written by Mr Goswell, which read: "Police entry only."A postmortem examination showed his 63-year-old wife, a retired hairdresser, had suffered multiple stab wounds and blunt trauma to the head. The injuries were inflicted by a kitchen knife and mallet.Detective Chief Inspector Adam Hibbert, of Sussex police's major crime branch, said today that Goswell had received treatment in the past for mental health problems.He said a "number of questions" had been raised about how various agencies had responded to concerns in the weeks before the tragedy.In a statement, the dead couple's children, Sarah, Joseph, Rebecca and son-in-law Alex, said Mrs Goswell had been "a wonderful parent, wife and friend to many".They said: "Our father Roger Goswell was a tortured soul and unfortunately in the end we feel that they were both let down by the system."Hibbert declined to be drawn on the exact treatment Mr Goswell had received for his mental health problems, saying it would be inappropriate while inquiries continued."I believe that we are dealing with a murder and a suicide," he said. "At this stage, we are not seeking anyone else in connection with these deaths."Hibbert said detectives were keeping an open mind about the motive for the deaths. No suicide note had been found but examinations were continuing on the car and at the house.
