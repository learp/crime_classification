Charles Clarke, the former home secretary, has launched another stinging attack on his successor, John Reid, saying any decision to halt the police mergers scheme would be "weak and damaging".After overnight reports that the entire mergers scheme would be cancelled in the wake of yesterday's collapse of the deal to merge Cumbria and Lancashire's forces, Downing Street was today forced to insist that "consultations" over the plans were still ongoing.But yesterday the Cumbrian force pulled out of a voluntary merger with Lancashire constabulary - the only two forces which agreed to merge - saying no money was on offer from the government to finance the plan.Mr Clarke introduced the scheme to consolidate England and Wales's current 43 forces into around 24 larger forces, saying it would better fight terrorism and organised crime.Today - in a follow up to the explosive Newsnight interview he gave criticising Mr Reid's description of the Home Office as "not fit for purpose" and defending his role in the foreign prisoners affair - Mr Clarke said axing the Cumbrian merger would "hamper" counter-terrorism.This morning, Downing Street would only say that Mr Reid would address the issue of mergers in a speech tomorrow - adding that the consultation process would continue.Following yesterday's Cumbrian decision, Mr Clarke issued a statement to the Press Association.It said: "The government's decision to halt the voluntary merger between the Lancashire and Cumbria police is weak and damaging."It is likely to jeopardise the whole police reform programme and so will delay the introduction of neighbourhood policing throughout the country, to which we committed in our 2005 manifesto."Moreover it will seriously hamper the ability of the police to contest terrorism and serious and organised crimes like trafficking in drugs and people, as the 2005 Report of Her Majesty's Inspectorate made clear."Michael Baxter, chief constable of Cumbria Constabulary, said that the government would be unable to continue with its plan to slash the number of police forces from 43 to 24 by 2008.Mr Baxter said that he was unable to see how the forces' restructuring plan would be able to work if a deal could not be brokered between Lancashire and Cumbria. He said: "If it can't work between Cumbria and Lancashire, it can't work anywhere."The proposed merger of the two forces was the only one to receive the full backing of the police authorities involved. A Home Office spokesman said: "John Reid said in June that he wanted to consult with the police on this matter, and those involved, and my view is that the consultation process will continue and that that's what John Reid will talk about tomorrow."Both forces issued a joint statement yesterday expressing their "intense disappointment" at the government for failing to resolve the "deal-breaker" issue of council tax harmonisation.The statement said that, following a meeting with Tony McNulty, the policing minister, yesterday morning, the government had not offered any solutions to the funding problem.The statement read: "Both authorities had previously insisted that the merger would only proceed if the government was able to provide a solution to the 'deal-breaker' issue of council tax harmonisation."At the meeting, the minister admitted that he had been unable to provide any solutions. "The government refused proposals by the two forces to standardise increases in council tax police precepts.Cleveland police authority rejected Mr Clarke's suggestion that its force should combine with Durham and Northumbria, both of which were in favour of the move.Cheshire voted against merging with Merseyside, and West Mercia opposed joining up with Staffordshire, Warwickshire and the West Midlands.Only Lancashire and Cumbria agreed to cooperate with Mr Clarke's blueprint.The Police Superintendents' Association, which backed the moves and advocates a national police force, said it was "the biggest wasted opportunity for policing of a generation".Rick Naylor, the president of the association, said: "Communities do not deserve the current situation of postcode policing."This government promised us reformed and modern public services."They have failed the police, whose structure will remain rooted in the 1970s when there were no mobile phones, no internet, no cybercrime, we only had three television channels and the M25 had not been built. The world has changed and so must policing."Mr Clarke was the architect of plans to slash the number of forces in England and Wales from 43 to as few as 17 by 2008. The exact final number of forces has fluctuated.The Conservatives welcomed the news. The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said the government had "woken up to its own folly".He said: "The government's approach of putting it back to consultation can only have one sensible outcome, namely that we junk the 'one size fits all' approach to our police forces and pursue an intelligent, co-operative, resource-sharing approach to mending the gaps in protective services."
