Labour MPs could block a British version of "Megan's law", which would allow the public access to a register of known paedophiles.The former Home Office minister Angela Eagle said yesterday that the government could face "difficulty" if it tried to introduce the US-type law."Child abuse is an appalling cycle of violence. It needs to be stopped," she said on the BBC's Sunday AM programme."Above all, we need to protect children. I am not convinced Megan's law does it."Instead, more should be done to treat offenders, she said, and insisted that any plans to follow the US example "in this very difficult area" should be evidence-based."I think there will be difficulty in the parliamentary Labour party if attempts were made to introduce laws - like the education reform - which are based on assertion, not evidence."Last week the home secretary, John Reid, said he was considering importing a version of the law and would be sending his junior minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, to investigate how it has worked in the US since implementation in 1997. But yesterday Hazel Blears, the Labour party chairwoman, said: "We are trying to find out how these laws work and look coolly and dispassionately at them. I don't think we should be driven by hysteria on this."She spoke as news emerged that the antidepressant drug Prozac could be given to sex offenders as part of a treatment programme.Responding to Sunday newspaper reports, the Prison Service and the Home Office said the treatment programme for sex offenders was based on cognitive therapies, but they kept "an open mind" on whether drugs such as Prozac could be used in individual cases.Phil Wheatley, director general of the Prison Service, said: "The sex offender treatment programme is based on cognitive- behavioural principles rather than drugs and has been shown to be the most effective method of reducing reoffending. Medical treatment of an individual sex offender would be decided on the basis of an individual's clinical needs by a clinician. We keep an open mind and continue to liaise with Department of Health colleagues as to whether drugs may complement existing treatment programmes."Reports that chemical castration was being considered for sex offenders by the Home Office were denied.
