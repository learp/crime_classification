A Slovakian man was today jailed for a minimum of 25 years for the "barbaric" rape and murder of a businesswoman in a Glasgow park.Marek Harcar forced 40-year-old Moira Jones into Queen's Park in the city on 28 May last year as she returned home from a night out.Passers-by heard screams coming from the park. A park ranger found Jones's badly beaten body the following morning.After a 20-day trial at the high court in Glasgow, Harcar was found guilty of killing Jones.It took the jury just over an hour to convict the 33-year-old of robbing, raping and murdering the Britvic executive and trying to defeat justice by fleeing the country days after the crime.The judge, Lord Bracadale, ordered that Harcar must serve at least 25 years before he could apply for parole, telling him his crime had shocked the nation."Your conduct that night reflects a level of wickedness very rarely encountered," he said.Members of the Jones family were in court as the jury returned its verdict.Speaking outside afterwards, her mother, Bea Jones, paid tribute to her daughter."Moira, darling, darling Moira. We were so proud of you, we will always be so proud of you and we will do the best we can with our lives to make them worthy of you," she said."You will live with us forever."Harcar – who had moved to Glasgow from Liverpool 10 days before the murder – had blamed three other men for the crime.The court was told, however, that it was a "billion to one" that DNA found on the victim's clothes and body could be from someone other than him.The trial had heard that Harcar abducted Jones as she arrived outside her flat in Queen's Drive at around 11pm after visiting her boyfriend.Harcar had been drinking heavily and had been heard saying that he was going out to look for a woman.Scotland's lord advocate, Elish Angiolini QC, prosecuting, told the court Harcar pounced on Jones and forced her in to the park before subjecting her to a savage assault.Various witnesses told of hearing screams coming from the bushes.Frederick Graham, a taxi driver, told his partner: "If there has been a murder, then we have just heard it."Jones's body was found behind a privet hedge.She had suffered at least 65 separate injuries as a result of "severe and sustained blunt force trauma", the court heard.Her clothes were torn and her personal belongings were scattered around her.Harcar first came to the attention of police when they spoke to residents in the Queen's Drive area as part of their inquiries.One, Lucie Pechtlova, told them he had recently moved from Liverpool and had been staying in her flat.She said he had left the flat on the night of 28 May in a drunken state, saying he was going out to find "whores". DNA from the flat linked him to the crime.Harcar fled to the Czech Republic, and then to Slovakia, after the murder. A European arrest warrant was granted, and he was extradited back to the UK.The court was told he had 13 previous convictions, four of which involved violence.Harcar was also placed on the sex offenders register and will be deported when he is freed.
