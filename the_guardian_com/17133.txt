Britain's first community justice judge, who will preside over the country's first US-style "one-stop crime-busting centre", was named yesterday as David Fletcher, a district judge in Sheffield.Mr Fletcher, 47, a former solicitor, came top of 17 candidates who responded to a newspaper advertisement for the £113,121 job. He will move to Liverpool to head the £3m Community Justice Centre, based on a scheme in Red Hook, New York, which is credited with cleaning up a crime-ridden area. The centre, in a former school in Vauxhall, north Liverpool, will deal with cases of anti-social behaviour and low-level crime. It will also offer drug treatment as well as debt counselling and will break new ground by having the judge supervise treatment programmes and monitor offenders' progress. Mr Fletcher said he believed the new system could cut the time it took for offenders to be dealt with by the courts. "In the event of someone entering a guilty plea, we could get them in the court, access the help they need and impose the sentence on the same day, instead of the process taking weeks."
