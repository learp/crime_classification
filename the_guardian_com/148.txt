Two men have appeared in court to admit their involvement in a million-pound armed raid at Selfridges.Sam Curtin and Connor Groake admitted conspiracy to rob and aggravated vehicle taking at the department store in Oxford Street, London, on 6 June.Curtin, 24, appeared at Kingston crown court on crutches on Monday, having broken his leg in a crash on one of the getaway vehicles, a Vespa moped. His co-accused, Groake, 19, was driving the moped, the court heard.The men, from Islington, will return to court next Monday to be sentenced for their part in the smash-and-grab attack, in which a six-strong gang dressed in burqas made off with Â£1m-worth of luxury watches.Scotland Yard said the raiders used the garments to disguise themselves and the tools they were carrying during the raid.They said members of the group used an axe and a sledgehammer to smash glass cabinets , then filled holdalls with the watches.Oxford Street shoppers looked on as the gang met accomplices outside with getaway vehicles.Curtin and Groake are the only people charged in connection with the incident so far.The court also heard how Curtin, who winced in pain as he made his way into court, was in need of urgent medical care following an operation on his shattered leg.Judge Nicholas Price said he was "astonished" to hear the prison doctor was not involved in Curtin's treatment, particularly after defence counsel Gordon Johnston said the wound had started to smell.Both defendants were remanded in custody.
