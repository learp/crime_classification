In response to the justice secretary's intention to get tough (Report, 10 October), as the newly formed Independent Probation Alliance we challenge the assumption that this will reduce crime. It is telling that Chris Grayling's party conference speech did not once mention the probation service, which is responsible for supervising and managing offenders in the community. Still more disturbing is the removal of probation from the minister's title so that now he is responsible for prisons and rehabilitation – signalling the demise of a key national service?Grayling correctly listed the factors contributing to offending behaviour. An over-focus on punishment, however, creates an unintended consequence – people tend to continue offending. Real results are obtained from rehabilitation and reintegration. In contrast, a disproportionate emphasis on custodial sentences is both expensive and ineffective, with political rhetoric along such lines doing little to protect the public, while alienating further those in most need of better integration into society, and making the rehabilitation of offenders more difficult.Although unmentioned in Grayling's speech, the probation service faces radical changes that will see key functions privatised and payment by results introduced. These untested departures will effectively remove probation from the public sector, calling into question who has overall accountability for offenders in the community. Given the implications for public safety, we urge the justice secretary to look at the evidence of what works before reaching for doctrinaire solutions.Diana Fulbrook Chair, Safeguarding Children Board, Loraine Gelsthorpe President, British Society of Criminology, Lord Ramsbotham Former chief inspector of prisons, Jane Allen Director of Harthill Consulting, Rob Canton Professor in Community and Criminal Justice, De Montfort University, Steve Collett Former CEO, Cheshire Probation, Honorary fellow Liverpool University, Honorary reader, Manchester University, Ian Glennie Justice communications consultant, Carol Hedderman Professor of criminology, University of Leicester, Fergus McNeill Professor of Criminology and social work, University of Glasgow, Karen Page Criminal justice consultant, David Scott Visiting senior research fellow, University of Portsmouth, Anne Worrall Professor of criminology, Keele University
