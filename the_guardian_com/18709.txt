John and Anne Darwin, the couple at the centre of the back-from-the-dead canoeist case, spent last night in separate cells in the north-east as police prepared to question her on suspicion of fraud and put him before the courts.Mr Darwin, 57, will appear before magistrates in Hartlepool today charged with making an untrue statement to procure a passport and obtaining a money transfer by deception.Mrs Darwin arrived back in Britain yesterday morning and was arrested by armed police when her plane touched down at Manchester airport. The 55-year-old was driven to the north-east where detectives will begin questioning her today.The latest developments come nine days after her husband walked into a central London police station saying he believed he was a missing person.Mr Darwin, who was thought to have died in a canoeing accident in 2002, told officers he could not remember anything about the last five years. After police established who he was, he was reunited with his sons, Mark and Anthony.Shortly afterwards it emerged that his wife had sold the family's two houses and moved to Panama six weeks earlier to start a new life.Detectives began to have doubts about Mr Darwin's story and when a picture emerged of the couple posing in an apartment in Panama City in 2006 - four years after he was supposed to have died - he was arrested at Anthony's home on suspicion of fraud.Since then Mrs Darwin has given several interviews in which she admitted she had know her husband was alive for the past four years.She told reporters Darwin had been living in the family house in Seaton Carew for much of the time and yesterday it emerged that there was a secret passage connecting the two houses owned by the couple, allowing him to slip away when friends or family visited.According to his wife, the former prison officer would regularly walk along the beach near their home. He even showed prospective buyers round the house when it was being sold.The former doctor's receptionist said her husband had made the decision to fake his own death after his bedsit business got into financial trouble, leaving him tens of thousands of pounds in debt.She has repeatedly insisted she believed he was dead when he disappeared and his canoe was washed up near their home.She says it was not until almost a year later that Darwin turned up on her doorstep looking tired and dishevelled."When I asked where he had been he said it didn't matter. He was home now. He said he'd done it basically so that we didn't lose everything, which is rather ironic now," she said.Mrs Darwin told reporters that she had wanted to admit everything when Darwin first reappeared, but said her husband had persuaded her not to come clean.After days of arguments and discussions, she says she agreed to keep quiet. She also promised that she would not tell the couple's sons that their father was alive. This week, as the couple's story began to unravel, their sons issued a joint statement disowning their parents.They asked: "How could our mam continue to let us believe our dad had died when he was very much alive?"The Darwins face lengthy prison sentences if they are convicted. Before she touched down, Mrs Darwin said: "I am aware that could happen and I am absolutely terrified at the prospect. I feel I have been living a kind of prison sentence for the past five years, but that's been my own private sentence and the public one will now follow."Yesterday Detective Sergeant Iain Henderson, of Cleveland police, said an application would be made at Hartlepool magistrates court this morning to remand Mr Darwin in custody.He said Darwin appeared "fit and well", adding that he could not say whether he would face more charges.Last night Darwin's aunt, 80-year-old Margaret Burns, said: "It's beyond satire. You couldn't make it up."
