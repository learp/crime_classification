A man who stabbed to death a 17-year-old student at a New Year's Eve party in east London last year has been jailed for life.Nigerian-born Chester Dauda, 21, stabbed Stephen Boachie in the heart outside a pub in Barking in the early hours of January 1 2007, after a scuffle with the victim. Boachie was the first of 27 London teenagers to be murdered in 2007.Sentencing Dauda at the Old Bailey yesterday, Judge Martin Stephens QC said he must serve at least 14 years and recommended his deportation at the end of the jail term.The victim's father, Kwasi Boachie, said he had hoped his son, who was an A-level student, would have a better life in Britain than their native Ghana. In an impact statement to the court, Boachie, 51, added: "But all that has been dashed by the act of a murderer in this craze of knife-carrying gangs."How many more lives will have to be sacrificed before people realise that killings never solve any human-related problems?"The court was told that Dauda and Boachie had a fight outside at the Thatched House pub moments before the murder.Dauda, who moved to Britain in 2004, was pulled off by friends but later fetched a knife from a car. On his return he pushed the teenager on to a car bonnet and stabbed him twice, in the stomach and chest. Initially Dauda told police he had been at Barking mosque and a friend's house on the night of the murder.Judge Stephens added: "This was a deliberate act of outrageous violence committed on the victim aged but 17. Whatever he may have said or done to you earlier, there can't be the slightest excuse for what you did."
