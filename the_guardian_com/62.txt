A convicted sex offender has been jailed for a minimum of 32 years for the rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl and the murder of her mother.  Thomas Smith was placed on the sex offenders register in 2006 for his attack on another 10-year-old girl. Photograph: Strathclyde police/PAFormer soldier Thomas Smith, 26, choked Diane Fallon and her daughter Holly at his home in Ayrshire last year with a PlayStation cable using a technique he perfected in the army.The high court in Glasgow heard that Smith had dumped his victims' bodies before later claiming to police he had accidentally killed the mother and daughter, who were his next-door neighbours in the village of Cronberry, near Cumnock.But in court yesterday he admitted the rape and double murder. He was sentenced to life in prison for both of the murders and told he must serve 32 years before being considered for parole.Judge Lord Turnbull told him: "You have set a benchmark of depravity below which it is difficult to imagine any other human being sinking."After the ruling, he was branded "evil personified" by the family of his victims.Strathclyde police are reviewing how Smith was able to offend again after being placed on the sex offenders' register in 2006 for indecently assaulting another 10-year-old girl in Teesside.Diane and Holly Fallon were missing for 11 days before police found their bodies after a major search operation.Speaking outside court after the sentencing, Diane Fallon's sister, Deborah Weir, said: "There are no words in the human vocabulary which can describe the evil that stood in the dock today. He is evil personified."He has taken the lives of two innocent people in a most brutal and horrific manner. Diane, a loving mother, daughter, sister and aunt, and Holly, a beautiful sister, granddaughter, niece and cousin."Their loss has had a huge impact on us as a family. Our lives will never be the same again, there will always be something missing."Detective Chief Superintendent John Mitchell, of Strathclyde police, said: "This was a despicable crime that has devastated a family and shocked the community of Cronberry as well as the rest of the country."The severity of these crimes was clear when the sentence of 32 years minimum was handed down."
