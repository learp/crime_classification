A babysitter was jailed for 16 years on Tuesday for giving a three-year-old boy to a known paedophile who drugged and raped him as he slept.Aaron Hughes, who was jailed for life for the sex attacks on the sedated toddler, filmed the rapes on his mobile phone and was caught when police did a routine check on his computer because they believed he had breached a court order by downloading child pornography.The child was provided to him at the home of Claire Semmens, from Roath, Cardiff, who was regularly looking after boys aged between three and six.Cardiff crown court heard that Semmens was sexually attracted to Hughes's lover, Hamish Morgan, and that the three had become close friends. She was jailed for 16 years, barred from working with children again, and must sign on the sex offenders register for life after admitting two charges of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and possessing indecent images.Hughes, also of Roath, admitted two charges of rape, possessing indecent images, and breaching the terms of his sexual offences prevention order.The court heard that both attacks were on the same three-year-old, but while Hughes claimed they happened on the same night, police checked the videos and spotted the little boy was wearing different pyjamas and that Hughes had a different ring on his finger. Investigators also found computer images of two other boys babysat by Semmens.The prosecutor, Laurence Jones, said: "The rapes were carried out at separate times â€“ but both were on the same boy and they happened in Semmens' bedroom. Semmens not only supplied the boy but provided a room which enabled Hughes to commit the act and film it in a relatively safe haven."By her own admission Semmens knew Hughes was a child sex offender who was banned from having any contact with children. But she was trying to satisfy Hughes's perversions for young male children."Hughes and Semmens disappeared when they realised the images found on their computers would send them to jail, pawning their jewellery and taking a train to Gatwick airport.Sentencing them, Judge Phillip Richards said: "It almost defies belief that any human being would do such a thing to such an innocent young child. Each of you are going to spend a long time in prison before you see the light of day."
