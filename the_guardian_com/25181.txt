Almost one in 10 disabled people in the UK have been the victim of a hate crime, according to a leading disability charity.For the first time, the 2009 version of an annual survey carried out by Leonard Cheshire Disability asked respondents whether they had faced a crime which they felt was motivated by their disability, with 9% saying they had."Even without a comparison for previous years, this is a shocking figure," said Eleanor Gore, from Leonard Cheshire, who compiled the review. "It's often hard to know how big a problem disability hate crime is as it tends to be very under-reported, and sometimes police and councils don't recognise it properly."The charity said it had included the question after high-profile incidents in which disabled people had been targeted, notably the case of Fiona Pilkington and her 18-year-old daughter, Francecca. In September, an inquest jury criticised police and a council in Leicestershire for failing to help Pilkington after her family suffered years of abuse from gangs of youths. Pilkington killed herself and Francecca by setting the family car alight in a layby near their home.The inquest heard that police and council antisocial behaviour officers failed to recognise the family's torment as a potential hate crime, and did not know that Pilkington was caring for a severely disabled daughter and a son with more moderate learning difficulties, even though Pilkington rang police more than 30 times over the course of a decade.The Disability Review, based on responses from 1,253 people, found 12% of disabled people had been the victims of a crime, although not necessarily a hate-motivated offence, over the last year.It recorded evidence of increased financial hardship and discrimination faced by disabled people â€“ 42% said they were finding it hard to live on their income. A similar percentage believed they had been turned down for a job because of their disability, a rise of seven percentage points from 2008, while more than half felt they had been discriminated against in a place of work.
