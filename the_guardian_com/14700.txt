Detectives have named a man they are looking for in connection with a burglary gang who savagely beat an academic.There are fears that Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, could attempt to flee the UK as officers from Scotland Yard try to track him down in the wake of the violent raid in Wimbledon, south-west London, last week.Lecturer Paul Kohler was left with "life-changing injuries" after four balaclava-clad men burst into his home at around 10pm on 11 August and beat him, demanding money.His wife was also threatened by two of the intruders, who tried to tape her to a chair during the raid.On Monday police named Pawlowichz, who is 6ft, stocky, bow-legged and walks with a limp, as a suspect in the attack.DI Dan O'Sullivan said: "We are calling for members of the public, in particular the Polish community, to assist us in tracing Pawlowichz's whereabouts."We believe that he may make an attempt to flee from the UK to Poland, and at present we are in direct liaison with the Polish authorities, UK Border Agency and Interpol and a coordinated effort to detain Pawlowichz is under way."Two men have already been arrested and charged in relation to the burglary, and on Monday a third man was held in Garratt Lane in Wandsworth, south London, on suspicion of aggravated burglary.Kohler has undergone surgery for a fractured eye socket and suffered multiple facial injuries and extensive bruising to his body and limbs.He told the Evening Standard that a police officer saved him from having a wooden cabinet smashed on his head as he lay in a pool of his own blood in his dining room.The law lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies said: "He didn't think about himself, he just grabbed him and took him out. It was really brave."I was quite bad, lying in a pool of my own blood at this point and I'm sure had that happened, the fractured skull they thought I had would have happened."Anyone with information can call police on 020 8649 3159 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
