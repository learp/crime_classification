A man who held a "petrified" shop assistant at gunpoint during Britain's biggest jewellery robbery last summer was today convicted for his part in the £40m raid.Aman Kassaye, 25, of no fixed address, was found guilty at Woolwich crown court, London, of kidnap, conspiracy to rob and possessing a firearm. He was acquitted of another gun possession charge.The jury is still considering verdicts on six other people who deny charges relating to the robbery. The gems stolen from Graff Diamonds in Mayfair, London, have never been recovered.The court heard that Kassaye had used a professional makeup artist to disguise his appearance and a succession of getaway cars to make his escape across the capital.The raiders had shot anyone who got in their way. The jury saw footage of Kassaye firing in the street outside the store, sending passersby running for cover.He claimed the raid was carried out by someone "remarkably like him" but he was identified by a shop assistant, Petra Ehnar.Philip Bennetts, for the prosecution, told jurors that after what happened Kassaye's "facial features would be etched in her mind forever".Ehnar, who was forced to empty a display cabinet with a gun at her back, told police: "This was the first time I have ever been subjected to an armed robbery and I was petrified. I was thinking, 'I am going to be shot, killed.' I had no idea."It is the most terrifying experience a person can be put through as you have no control over the situation that you find yourself in."She filled a bag with 43 pieces of jewellery including earrings, necklaces and watches. They were worth £40m. One diamond necklace alone was valued at £3.5m.The court heard that Ehnar's manager, Martin Leggatt, was forced to lie spread-eagled on the floor with a gun pointed at his head.Kassaye was found guilty on the ninth day of the jury's deliberations.Craig Calderwood, 27, of no fixed address; Solomun Beyene, 25, of Lilestone Street, Marylebone, north-west London; Clinton Mogg, 43, of Westby Road, Bournemouth, Dorset; Courtney Lawrence, 31, of Ladbroke Grove, west London; David Joseph, 23, of Flaxman Road, Loughborough Junction, south-east London; and Thomas Thomas, 45, of Penrhyn Road, Kingston upon Thames, are all accused of conspiracy to rob.Calderwood is also charged with two counts of possessing a firearm.
