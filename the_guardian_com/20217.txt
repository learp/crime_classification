A man with learning difficulties has been jailed for six years for killing his baby daughter by shaking or banging her head, causing some of the most severe injuries eye specialists have ever come across.William Stephens, 25, was convicted of the manslaughter of 16-week-old Paris Vince-Stephens, who died after suffering catastrophic head injuries.The baby's 19-year-old mother, Danah Vince, was cleared by a jury of causing or allowing her child's death.A serious case review has been launched to look at the numerous contacts social workers and health professionals had with the pair, who had a tempestuous and sometimes violent relationship.Stephens, who is said to have attacked Vince with a dog chain while she was pregnant, had been issued with a restraining order to keep away from her but is believed to have been staying at her flat in Bristol at the time of the offence in January.In sentencing him, Mr Justice Teare said Stephens lost his temper or control but accepted that he had serious learning difficulties that may have inhibited his understanding of what he was doing. "You will have to live with the fact that you killed your daughter," the judge said.During the trial the jury heard that Paris was admitted to hospital with injuries that the prosecution claimed were either caused by shaking, banging her head against a soft surface or a combination of the two.The court was told that experts at Bristol Eye hospital were shocked by the extent of bleeding to both her retinas. Ophthalmologist Mohammad Afshor said in a statement: "It was so severe that it was hard to see where the haemorrhaging originated. I had never seen anything like it before."In the year before Paris was killed, there were 13 meetings between Vince and social workers – the last just two days before her daughter died – and five with a health visitor. The serious case review is expected to be published by the Bristol Safeguarding Children Board in the new year.
