Among those arrested are: Kieren Fallon  The outstanding rider of his generation, 39-year-old Fallon has been Flat racing's champion jockey in six of the past seven seasons, missing out only in 2000 when a serious shoulder injury sustained at Royal Ascot forced him to spend six months on the sidelines. Has passed 200 winners in a season four times, and won the Derby three times. Stable jockey to Sir Michael Stoute, the most powerful yard on the British turf.  Karl Burke  Former professional jockey who saddled his 52nd winner of the season just four days ago, a personal best.

Formerly based in Newmarket, he now trains 55 horses at Middleham, north Yorkshire.  Darren Williams  Joined Karl Burke's yard as an apprentice six years ago, and has been the trainer's principal jockey since becoming a full professional in early 2003.

Fergal Lynch  A 26-year-old freelance jockey based in north Yorkshire, the highlight of Lynch's career to date came when he won Europe's most valuable handicap, the Ebor at York, on Sir Michael Stoute's Clerkenwell in 1996. Has ridden 44 winners so far this season, with victories including Monsieur Bond in the prestigious Duke of York Stakes in May.
