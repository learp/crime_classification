Five law lords unanimously endorsed the lifting of a high court injunction yesterday which would have banned the media from naming a woman accused of murdering her child when her trial begins next month.The family division of the high court granted the injunction to protect the woman's surviving child, and that part remains in force, preventing the media identifying him or his mother in reporting yesterday's ruling. But the original injunction granted by Mr Justice Hedley also prevented the woman being named during her trial on a charge of murdering her nine-year-old son with a salt overdose. He lifted that part, after an application by an Essex newspaper, the Romford Recorder. The child's guardian, represented by Cherie Booth QC, took the case to the court of appeal, which rejected the appeal by a two-to-one majority, and then to the House of Lords. Yesterday Lords Bingham, Nicholls, Steyn, Hoffmann and Carswell unanimously rejected the appeal. They ruled that the courts had no power to create new exceptions to the general prin ciple of open justice except in the most compelling circumstances. Lord Steyn said that an injunction to protect someone not involved in the case was "a step too far" which, if permitted, "would seriously impoverish public discussion of criminal justice". The injunction protecting the surviving child remains in place, but there is now no bar on naming the woman and the son she is charged with murdering, or using their photographs, during her trial. Lord Steyn said the child would not be directly involved in the trial: he was not a witness, and there would be no need to refer to him.
