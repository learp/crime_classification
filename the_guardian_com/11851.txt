A British woman who married a Sicilian mobster and was arrested for helping to run his mafia empire is on her way back to Britain after Sicilian prosecutors handed her a two-year suspended sentence in return for a plea bargain.Ann Hathaway, 44, from Rochdale, attacked the "inhumane" conditions of the Sicilian prison in which she had been held and said she had no regrets about marrying Antonio Rinzivillo, the head of a feared Sicilian clan, and serving a 30-year sentence for murder."Of course I would do it again," said Ms Hathaway. "I adore my husband. He is the father of my daughters."Ms Hathaway met and married Rinzivillo in Italy and raised their two daughters there after her husband was jailed. Prosecutors put out an arrest warrant for her as part of a swoop on 88 members of the Rinzivillo clan, alleging she had helped collect earnings and laundered cash on behalf of the gang, which is accused of drug dealing, extortion and arms trafficking.Ms Hathaway was arrested in Britain in January and extradited to Sicily, where she accepted the suspended sentence, which prosecutors consider an admission of responsibility.
