Primary school children as young as 10 could take part in anti-gun crime workshops, under plans being developed by Operation Trident, the Metropolitan police unit dealing with violent crime in London's black communities.The plans follow concerns from teachers that current programmes to target children in secondary school come too late to prevent them getting involved in gangs, drug dealing and violence in some areas of the capital.Children aged 10 and 11 will be lectured against gun and knife crime under the programme, which has been in development for five months. One session in a London primary school has already taken place. That is now being evaluated to consider an expansion to other schools across the capital.Trident already runs workshops in secondary schools where 13- and 14-year-olds are shown graphic accounts of gunshot injuries and crime scenes to help them understand the consequences of gang violence.Detective Inspector Kieran Power, head of Trident's community engagement team, insisted that the classes being developed for primary schools would be appropriate for the children's age and would not include similar material.But the news will raise concerns about the exposure of very young children to violent crime in the capital.The initial workshop was used to gauge the 10- and 11-year-olds' understanding of criminality and violence to help develop the programme of school visits, which has not yet received official approval. Power said the reaction of the children to questions on gangs was mixed, with some demonstrating in depth understanding of the way gangs work, while others had no experience at all.That session is being analysed to assess what material should be targeted at 10- and 11-year-olds. If the scheme gets approval from senior officers at Scotland Yard, a pilot will take place across the capital. Trident is currently run in Southwark, Lambeth, Brent, Hackney, Haringey, Lewisham and Croydon.Power said: "We were going into secondary schools and the feedback from teachers and parents was that they loved the presentation but thought we should go to younger children."There is no evidence that primary aged children are involved in gun crime but the suggestion was that we could do better preventative work earlier. It's very early days and we still have far to go before this is rolled out."He said they could decide to target groups of children teachers identified as at risk instead of taking whole classes, which would inevitably include children to whom the idea of gang violence was irrelevant."When you are dealing with primary school children there is a sensitivity of getting the message right," Power said. "There is a feeling we have to get this absolutely right the first time because you can't risk getting it wrong with any children."This is part of our preventative strategy and that is absolutely vital to start reducing the number of victims of gun crime."The secondary school programme, Decisions and Consequences, explains the work of Trident and the impact of serious weapons. Power insisted the move into primary schools was not intended to frighten children but to help them make decisions in a positive way."We tell them how innocent young people can inadvertently become involved in bad situations. How without knowing it they can get caught up in a stabbing or a shooting," he said.Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: "We know that parts of the capital have a serious problem with gun crime and we know that can affect children."As long as it is done appropriately and in proper consultation with the schools there is nothing inherently wrong with this."
