Plans to introduce antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos) in Northern Ireland to combat low level crime and disorder were unveiled by the government today.Under the draft proposals, launched by the province's criminal justice minister, John Spellar, police, district councils or the Northern Ireland Housing Executive would be able to apply to a magistrate for an Asbo against anyone destroying property or harassing their neighbours.Mr Spellar said he was confident that the measures would go a long way in removing the blight of antisocial behaviour from local communities.A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Office added that Asbos would not be used to tackle sectarian violence.As elsewhere in the UK, each Asbo would be tailor made to stop an individual's antisocial behaviour or prohibit them from entering a specified area, he said. Although they are civil orders rather than criminal penalties, breaching them is a criminal offence. The draft antisocial behaviour (Northern Ireland) order 2004 also proposes introducing acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs), written agreements between unruly neighbours and the police and other public agencies banning antisocial behaviour. The contracts would not legally binding but if breached could lead to tougher sanctions, including Asbos. Asbos were introduced in England and Wales in 1999, but the government had delayed introducing them in Northern Ireland because the province has no direct equivalent to the local authorities elsewhere in the UK, which hold responsibility for education, housing and social services. Mr Spellar said he was "committed to bringing forward the necessary legislation as soon as possible to protect both individuals and the community". The measures go out for public consultation over the next four weeks.The proposals come in response to the community safety strategy for Northern Ireland launched last year, which suggested the use of Asbos to tackle street violence, low level neighbourhood disorder and fear of crime in the province.
