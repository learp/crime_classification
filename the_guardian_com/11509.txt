A Labour peer and former MSP was jailed for 16 months today for deliberately starting a fire in a hotel room.Mike Watson early this month pleaded guilty to a charge of wilful fire-raising at the Prestonfield House Hotel in Edinburgh in November last year. He was accused of setting fire to a curtain in his hotel room in the small hours of the morning after a political awards dinner.Watson had initially denied he was responsible, despite CCTV footage apparently showing him crouching down at the base of a curtain just minutes before it was engulfed in flames.The blaze, which caused Â£4,500 worth of damage, was said by one expert at an earlier court hearing to have put people in "a potentially dangerous situation".The court heard that Watson was well under the influence of alcohol that night.Before handing down her sentence, Sheriff Mackie told Watson: "Fire raising is a most serious crime."By pleading guilty to the charge you have acknowledged that you intended to set on fire property at Prestonfield House Hotel, whereby property was damaged and lives were endangered."The potential for serious injury to guests and staff within the hotel and for very significant damage to the property was considerable."The sheriff said the fact that nobody was injured was due to the prompt actions of staff and the high quality of the hotel's safety equipment.She continued: "No explanation has been offered for your actions."A large amount of alcohol appears to have been consumed but that neither excuses nor fully explains your behaviour."This is not an offence which was committed recklessly."She said that having regard to the "deliberate and dangerous nature" of his conduct and the fact that, according to a social inquiry report, he presented a "significant risk of re-offending", a custodial sentence was the only appropriate outcome in the case.The sheriff also had to consider public safety in this instance, she said.Watson would have been sentenced to 20 months but this was reduced to 16 months in light of his guilty plea.The Scottish Conservative home affairs spokeswoman and deputy leader, Annabel Goldie, said: "The sentence actually served will not be 16 months."Thanks to Labour and Lib Dem insistence of preserving automatic early release, Lord Watson will be out of jail after serving only half his sentence, eight months."Mike Watson was first elected MP for Glasgow Central in a byelection in 1989. He opposed the first Gulf war in 1991 and the Maastricht treaty in 1993.In 1992 he joined George Galloway and other leftwing pro-devolution MPs who blocked the removal of the Commons mace in protest against the proposed privatisation of the water industry. The protest was designed to stop the Commons rising for the summer recess, signified by the mace being put away.A backbencher throughout his time in the Commons, his seat was axed under boundary changes just before Labour's landslide victory in 1997. He was then ennobled and in 1999 elected as MSP for Glasgow Cathcart. He served as Scotland's tourism, culture and sport minister from 2001 to 2003.Lord Watson has resigned as an MSP since pleading guilty to the fire-raising charge.
