A millionaire businesswoman was jailed for eight years today for trying to arrange the contract killings of her former lover and his new wife.Carol Ann Hunter was told by the judge she was callous and manipulative and had used her besotted lover to achieve her aims.Her lover, Anton Lee, was jailed for four years for soliciting murder.Hunter, 50, of Chiswick, west London, was found guilty at the Old Bailey in December of inciting financial adviser, Lee, to hire a hitman to kill Colin and Judith Love.Hunter had denied the charge but pleaded guilty to soliciting grievous bodily harm with intent against Mrs Love.Lee, 54, of Stanmore, north-west London, had pleaded guilty to soliciting murder and gave evidence against Hunter. The court was told Hunter could not accept that Colin Love, 59, her partner of 22 years and the father of her two children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had fallen in love with someone else.The court heard that Mr Love married his old flame, Judith, 51, after contacting her on Friends Reunited, and moved her into Hunter's country retreat, she was filled with uncontrollable hatred.The final straw came when business executive Mr Love, who earned less than Hunter, wanted a share of the £600,000 property, Lionsfield House, Bedfordshire, the court was told.Divorced Lee asked a friend if he knew a contract killer. The man contacted Surrey Police, who arranged a meeting with an undercover policeman calling himself Darren.Hunter was said to have changed her mind after meeting Darren, and handed over £5,000, with £5,000 to follow, and said she only needed Mrs Love maimed - for her to be blinded or put in a wheelchair.Using the name Ann Hunter-Love, before her arrest Hunter was an executive with major companies including Unilever, before leaving to become managing director of a company making Tommee Tippee baby products in Northumberland.Hunter sent a series of emails to Mr Love in which she referred to Mrs Love as the OBW (old bitch whore) and developed an uncontrollable hatred of her.Hunter and Lee were arrested in October 2005 and have been held in custody since.Hunter appeared in court today in a brown suit and clutching a file of papers.She was separated from Lee in the dock by a female prison officer.Judge Brian Barker, the common serjeant of London, also gave Hunter a concurrent five-year sentence for plotting to maim Mrs Love.He told the pair: "It is a tragedy to see two people of ability, achievement and admiration in this court. You brought disgrace upon yourselves and pain and anguish to those who love you."He told Hunter: "You did not accept the obvious. You used your besotted lover to achieve your aims."Her switch to wanting Mrs Love maimed was as bad as it could get. "It had every chance of being carried out with horrific consequences for Mrs Love for the rest of her life," said Judge Barker."You have the ability to control and get everything you want. You are a woman who can present two entirely different faces. You are capable of manipulation and callousness of the highest order."The judge said to Lee: "You had taken leave of your senses. The context of your crime is breathtaking in its audacity and coldness. You were deeply infatuated. I am satisfied you had a very early change of heart."Mr Love, who used to run an internet company and who lectures at universities, said: "In October 2005 my wife Judy and I were shocked and appalled to learn that my ex-partner had, together with her boyfriend, been arrested for incitement to murder and maim."He said: "I still find it almost impossible to believe that an intelligent and gifted woman would contemplate such a plan without fully realising the downside of exposure and failure."In my opinion, she has wrecked her life as a caring mother, career icon and female role model."
