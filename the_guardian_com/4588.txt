A far-reaching package of legal reforms to increase rape convictions and prevent men 'getting away with it' has been finalised by the government.With fewer than 6 per cent of allegations now ending in a court conviction, the Solicitor General, Mike O'Brien, said he hoped that the government's new proposals would halt the trend of proportionately fewer men being found guilty in rape trials.However, ministers have ruled out lowering the burden of proof for convictions, opting instead to introduce a range of measures designed to assemble the strongest possible case for prosecutors.A new statutory definition of capacity to consent to sexual intercourse will mean that, if a woman is so drunk she is incapable of consent, a man who sleeps with her may be charged with rape.The controversial move is strongly opposed by judges, who believe it should be left to a jury to decide whether an alleged victim was in a fit state to agree to intercourse.However, O'Brien has rejected the resistance by the Council of Circuit Judges, which represents the 637 circuit judges who would have to enforce the law, by claiming that men who take advantage of drunken women should face the consequences.'There is no doubt men are still getting away with it, with repeat offenders a particular problem,' said O'Brien, who has spearheaded the proposed overhaul of rape legislation.The conviction rate in rape cases has fallen from a third of cases in 1977 to just 5.2 per cent in 2004. Among other changes to be unveiled this month is the use of video screens in court showing the first interview of a rape victim with the police. In addition, victims will be advised by 'independent sexual violence advocates' before a trial to make sure that the complainants are comfortable with appearing in court. More specialist rape prosecutors and the use of expert witnesses to help dispel 'rape myths' and advise a jury how a rape victim might be expected to behave are among other proposals.'We need to ensure there are specialist skills available for dealing with rape victims, who may often feel violated and traumatised,' O'Brien told The Observer. 'Victims ought to be able to choose whether to give evidence-in-chief through video. Some judges take the view that victims are better off giving live evidence, but some victims don't want to relive the experience. They feel that they have done it once, in the police station where it was videoed. There is an issue of what is best evidence, but in some cases the video might work best.'Further steps, including an alleged attacker's previous sexual convictions being discussed before the jury, and hearsay evidence in which the victim told family or friends about an attack - but not police - could also be permitted. Doubling the number of sexual assault referral centres from 15 to 30 by 2008 is another of O'Brien's proposals.The government also believes it is necessary to develop measures for dealing with rape victims with mental-health problems, as well as fresh methods of rehabilitating convicted sex offenders to stop them reoffending.Ministers are also currently examining whether to grant judges the power to remove the right to anonymity of women who make false rape claims. Courts may be able to lift anonymity if there is concern that the woman will fake another assault.Last month Maria Marchese, 45, was jailed for nine years after bombarding a doctor and his fiancee with hundreds of anonymous death threats, text messages and silent calls. But the Crown Prosecution Service failed to prosecute her, leaving her free to falsely accuse Dr Jan Falkowski, who was then suspended from his job and left by his fiancee.
