The parents of missing four-year-old Madeleine McCann are expected to travel to the Vatican later this week for a meeting with the Pope as they started a campaign to spread the hunt for their daughter around Europe.Arrangements were being made for a meeting on Wednesday after indications from the Vatican that Pope Benedict XVI was keen to meet the couple, who have drawn strength from their Roman Catholic faith since her disappearance on May 3."We are currently exploring the possibility of a visit by Gerry and Kate McCann to meet the Pope in Rome in the near future," family spokesman Clarence Mitchell confirmed yesterday.A meeting with the Pope would be "profoundly important" to the couple and would help strengthen the faith to which they have publicly turned in recent weeks, sources close to the family said.The visit was a further sign of the increasing reach of the Madeleine case, which has already seen telephone conversations between Gordon Brown and the parents as they remain at the Praia da Luz resort in Portugal where Madeleine vanished.Grassroot Roman Catholic groups have already involved themselves in spreading the Madeleine campaign around Europe and the couple made a high profile visit to Portugal's holiest shrine, at Fatima, last week.Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Westminster, has been instrumental in organising the visit.The couple plan to travel to Spain, Germany and Holland after their Vatican visit. They have been offered the use of a private jet by a British entrepreneur and have raised a fighting fund of more than Â£320,000 as they drop their professional commitments as doctors to concentrate on the campaign.They are keen to avoid being turned into celebrities, despite offers reportedly arriving from prominent television chat shows in the US.The family's first campaign victory, apart from keeping Madeleine's name and picture in the news, was to force Portuguese police to finally release a description of a man believed to have carried a child away from the apartments where Madeleine vanished.That description, issued late on Friday, has already generated more than 100 reported sightings of the 35-40-year-old Caucasian man of medium height with shortish hair that is long on the collar, police sources told Portugal's Lusa news agency.The woman who saw the man is a friend of the McCann family and dined with them that night.She was reported yesterday to be wracked with guilt that she did nothing to stop the man.Although Portuguese police officially said the suspect was "possibly carrying a child, or an object that could have been taken as a child" other police sources claimed yesterday that he had been carrying a small blonde girl wearing "distinguishable" pyjamas and wrapped in a blanket."She thought it was odd, but thought it was the man's own child," a police source told the Press Association. "He was walking urgently, neither running or walking."The witness joined the McCanns at a tapas bar a few dozen yards from their holiday apartment at about 9.30pm on May 3.When Mrs McCann went back into the apartment half an hour later to check on the children, Madeleine had vanished.The friend "instantly" realised what she had seen and gave a statement and description to Portuguese police.Despite concerns that they had just "filed away" the descriptions, local people in Praia da Luz said police were asking them about someone fitting that description within a couple of days of the disappearance."The view of the family is that this was Madeleine being taken," the source said.
