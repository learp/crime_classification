Criminal gangs have begun using GPS "jammers" imported from China to help them steal expensive cars and lorries carrying valuable loads – and there are fears that terrorists could use more powerful versions to disrupt air traffic, a conference in London will hear on Tuesday.The "jammers" put out radio signals at the same frequency at the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, overwhelming the timing signal that in-car devices use to plot their position. That means a tracker device built into a lorry with a valuable load, or a car with an anti-theft GPS device which should report its position if stolen, cannot distinguish the correct GPS signal."It disappears from the radar," said Professor David Last, of the University of Wales at Bangor, who has been a police expert witness in a number of cases over the past 18 months in which GPS jammers have been seized.Some German drivers are also believed to use such jammers to try to evade GPS-based road charging, which was introduced for trucks in 2005. There have also been robberies in Russia where such jammers have been used against both GPS systems and mobile phones on lorries to prevent the driver from contacting the authorities.In Germany, as in the UK, it is illegal to sell or use such jammers – although it appears to be legal to import or own them.Satnav devices rely on being able to "see" at least four of the 30 satellites orbiting about 20,200km (12,550 miles) above the earth: by correlating the very precise timing and identification signals they transmit, a ground-based device can calculate its own location to within about 1 metre. However, the jamming devices do not have to put out a strong signal to disrupt GPS reception."The problem is that the signal from the satellites is extremely weak – it's the equivalent of picking up the light output of a 25-watt bulb on the satellite," said Bob Cockshott, another conference speaker who heads the location and timing program for the Technology Strategy Board, funded by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills."That means you only need a jammer with an output of about 2 watts to swamp any signal from the GPS satellites over an area of a few metres." Such a device would be billions of times more powerful than the GPS signal at ground level.Cockshott says that such more powerful jammers could have multiple uses for criminal gangs. "They would work over tens of kilometres, so drugs gangs might use them to disrupt navigation in the Thames estuary if they were taking a delivery and didn't want rivals to be able to trace them."Such systems have been found in the hands of criminals arrested by police over the past 18 months, said Cockshott. The jammers could be built by a competent electronics expert, though the gangs appear to prefer to import them from Chinese makers in Shenzhen."We need to make users of GPS aware of the threat," said Cockshott. "They need to use a complementary technology so that their systems work without GPS." Systems that triangulate on mobile phone masts, and another which uses a ground-based network, called eLoran, can operate even when GPS signals fail, he said.Professor Last said that the use of these systems by criminals and terrorists had been anticipated since 2002, when the US government produced a report pointing out that disruption to GPS could cause "severe safety and economic damage to the US".Charles Curry, the managing director of Chronos Technology, who also heads a consortium which is building a GPS-jamming detection system with a £2.2m UK government grant, said that the biggest fear was that a powerful GPS jammer with an output of 20W or more might be used by terrorists near an airport."If you lost GPS capability on planes or other things that rely on accurate timing, such as the emergency networks or power stations, then if they don't build in the ability to mitigate against such attacks there could be very serious consequences." The detection system is now in its prototype stages and would be used at airports, harbours and other locations which rely on the nanosecond accuracy of GPS outputs.
