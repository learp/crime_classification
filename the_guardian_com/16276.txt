An inquest jury has taken only 90 minutes to return verdicts of 12 unlawful killings and one suicide over the murderous rampage of Derrick Bird, drawing a legal line under the tragedy of the Cumbrian shootings last June.The six women and five men were praised by the coroner at Workington, close to the scene of the taxi driver's first shootings in Whitehaven, for dealing efficiently and carefully with four weeks of often harrowing evidence.They added no riders to the verdict about 52-year-old Bird's state of mind, which was described by medical experts at the hearing as "delusional and paranoid".They also made no comment on the response of the emergency services or gun-licencing policy in Cumbria, both of which have been largely endorsed by independent inquiries.But West Cumbria coroner David Roberts is writing to the home secretary, Theresa May, and the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, about liaison problems between police and emergency ambulance teams.He singled out the near failure of radio systems, muddled links between the force and ambulance chiefs and instructions given to paramedics to wait for police to declare the scene safe before they were allowed to help victims.The coroner made a point of praising witnesses of the tragedy who gave evidence, especially relatives and friends of the victims. Concluding the inquest, he said: "I would like to express my appreciation to the families for the quiet dignity they have showed and the moving tributes to their loved ones who were snatched from them that sunny summer's morning."Their loss is beyond comprehension. I hope that in some small way this inquest, in examining the facts, can present some form of closure."Recalling that Bird's first victim had been his own brother, whom he wrongly believed to be trying to get him jailed over a tax bill, he said: "We should also not forget the children of Derrick Bird who were caught up in his actions."The inquest heard details for the first time of the gunman's random killings, whose victims included a mother devoted to caring for her disabled daughter, a pensioner returning from inspecting his mole traps and a businessman out for a lunchtime bike ride.Evidence was also given about those who escaped, including schoolgirl Ashleigh Glaister, 14, who ducked just before Bird fired from his taxi's smashed window, and young mother Zoe Turner, who was out walking with her two young sons in woodland at Doctor's Bridge, Boot, where Bird shot himself in the head.She told the silent hearing how the gunman had just muttered "you're all right", as he walked past them and into the trees.Bird's first victims were his twin brother, David, the family's solicitor, Kevin Commons, 60, and a fellow taxi-driver, Darren Rewcastle, 43, who was one of a group of colleagues at the rank in Whitehaven whose joshing unwittingly added to the killer's paranoia.The inquest heard from a psychologist, Dr Adrian West, that "bitterness, resentment and depression" led Bird to "enact vengeful, retaliatory fantasies, believing that people would never forget him and that, as he was heard to say, 'Whitehaven will be as famous as Dunblane'".Bird's randomly chosen victims were mother-of-two Susan Hughes, 57; retired security worker Kenneth Fishburn, 71; retired Sellafield worker and part-time mole-catcher Isaac Dixon, 65; retired couple James and Jennifer Jackson, aged 67 and 68; farmer and rugby league player Garry Purdham, 31; estate agent Jamie Clark, 23; retired Sellafield employee Michael Pike, 64; and pensioner Jane Robinson, 66. Eleven others were injured.
