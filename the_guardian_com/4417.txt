There are more than 8,000 female prostitutes working in brothels in London, a new report revealed today.Women are also working in saunas and massage parlours, with 75% coming from foreign countries. Many are smuggled into the country from eastern Europe and Asia as sex slaves by organised crime gangs. The report, Sex In The City, by the Poppy Project charity, is the result of a six-month investigation, and focused particularly on "off street" prostitution. Information was gathered about saunas, massage parlours and other businesses which had advertised personal services in local papers and had been recommended on websites and internet guides to buying sex.The report found 730 brothels operating in the capital and 66 supposedly legitimate lap-dancing clubs where dancers were offering sex to clients. The sex industry in Britain is fuelled by gangmasters who bring girls in to the country to face forced prostitution. The largest numbers of prostitutes came from Thailand, Russia, Brazil and Kosovo, the report found.Operators can make huge fortunes with a large brothel turning over up to £1m a month. Women smuggled into the country are often raped before being set to work, and have their passports and travel documents taken away so they cannot flee. They are often forced to live in terrible conditions sleeping on floors, and are then farmed out and moved around sauna-style establishments and flats around the capital. Girls can be sold between brothels for up to £10,000 and may be sold on four or five times. Some are even advertised on the internet, which police believe is fuelling demand for the trafficking of vice girls. Last year, the Metropolitan police's clubs and vice unit took 300 girls out of brothels, 10 of whom were children. Superintendent Chris Bradford said: "It's like a slave market."
