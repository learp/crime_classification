Shannon Matthews is not expected to return home for several days, following her discovery in a relative's flat, while police try to find out what lay behind her 24-day disappearance.Detectives have told the nine-year-old's mother and stepfather that gentle questioning of the child is being undertaken slowly by trained officers under an emergency protection order.Magistrates have also given West Yorkshire police extra time to hold 39-year-old Michael Donovan, also known as Paul Drake, the uncle of Shannon's stepfather, who was arrested on Friday when officers broke into his flat just over a mile from Shannon's home in Dewsbury Moor. He and the girl were found in hiding in separate storage drawers under two divan beds in the top floor flat.The police inquiry team, whose search operation was the force's biggest since the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper, rejected criticism that they should have searched Donovan's home earlier. Chief Supt Barry South held a private meeting with local people at a church in Dewsbury last night to clarify Shannon's arrangements and tackle rumours of delay over tip-offs about Donovan. He said afterwards: "Let me put on notice the fact that had we known at any time the whereabouts of Shannon we would have been there in seconds."Senior officers are expected to give more detailed answers to claims of delayed response to at least one tip-off about Donovan when questioning of Donovan and Shannon is complete. The force also described as "totally inaccurate" a claim by Yorkshire Conservative MEP Edward Macmillan-Scott that immediate use of an "amber alert" to publicise Shannon's disappearance could have solved the case within hours. A police spokesman said that such alerts applied to child abductions where vehicle details were known or partly known, which was not the case with Shannon. The child's mother Karen Matthews, 32, appealed for privacy yesterday, after asking police to issue a statement on her behalf, in which she said: "I fully understand that the police need to keep speaking to Shannon to establish exactly what has happened during the time that she has been missing."
