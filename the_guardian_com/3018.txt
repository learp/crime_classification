Photographer: Matt Cardy/Getty ImagesAt the height of the so-called "garotting panic" in London in the winter of 1862 - following the mugging of Hugh Pilkington MP as he walked to his club - the satirical magazine Punch ran a series of spoof advertisements suggesting that Londoners might like to purchase articles from their new design of clothes so as to prevent themselves falling victim to the garotters as Pilkington had done.Among these "unique articles of dress" - advertised under the heading "Do you wish to avoid being strangled?" - was the "patent anti-garotte collar," which, according to Punch, "enables gentlemen to walk the streets of London in perfect safety at all hours of the day or night".The "garotting panic" was in reality a response to a new phenomenon that Londoners had to come to terms with: the return of released prisoners into the community, which until the 1860s had not been something that was often experienced, given that most offenders had in the past been transported to Australia. And, of course, if you were transported to the other side of the world in the 1840s, 50s and 60s there was little chance that you would actually return to your native city, and so offenders were out of sight and out of mind.The end of transportation therefore pushed prisons and released prisoners into the public eye, and crime committed by released prisoners - called "ticket of leave men" - were a staple of the Victorian media.So far, so what?Have you heard about BladeRunner? This, according to its website, is a new company "with experience in producing a special range of clothing for the security community," and their "advanced technology" has allowed everyday clothes to become transformed so as to be able to withstand attack. Their Defender Hoodie, for example, is stab- and bullet-proof, and the "hoodie is rugged and tough just like a normal hoodie, but this one has a removable Inner Shell that gives you Ballistic Security at level NIJ STD 0101.04."I'm not certain that I actually know what "Ballistic Security at level NIJ STD 0101.04" actually means, but it is clear enough that this range of clothes, which were initially designed for police officers, have now emerged from the police precinct and entered the high street. BladeRunner products are now becoming much more widely available both online and in the shops, and such has been the demand that there are also moves to now turn these products into school jumpers.BladeRunner says that it supports the No to Knives campaign and provides details about the website www.ntk.org.uk, and immediately below this address suggests that there are "investment opportunities" in their company.I have no doubt they will be inundated with potential investors - such are our own current concerns about knife-carrying among young people, and I imagine that even one or two people reading this article are already on BladeRunner's site looking for hoodies or jumpers for their kids.Even so, might I suggest that the solutions to knife-carrying have little to do with clothes, metal detectors at school gates, knife amnesties, tougher penalties for knife carrying and the like and much more to do with the fact that children are increasingly carrying knives because they are scared and have been the victim of an attack. Their fears are not irrational but accurately reflect how difficult it is to grow up in the space that we call "childhood" when the adult world no longer takes the concerns of young people seriously and is far more prepared to demonise them as yobs, chavs, and of course "hoodies".So, rather than develop new types of hoodies that might offer stab- and bullet-proof protection - and you can already see how this might actually encourage a greater willingness to engage in violence - what we should be doing is taking the fears of young people seriously and doing something positive to eradicate those fears. Now that's the investment opportunity that I would like to buy into.
