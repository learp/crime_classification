Across an 80-mile swath of the home counties, from Ashford in Kent to Bracknell in Berkshire, parents, teachers and schoolgirls have been warned that a serial rapist who strikes near wooded areas is on the prowl.In what has become one of the biggest manhunts in years, Hertfordshire police joined Operation Orb at the weekend after a 14-year-old girl was attacked in Stevenage on her way home on Friday afternoon. If DNA tests match the sample police already have, the "Trophy Rapist" - so-called because he takes clothing or property from his victims - will have struck 10 times since last November. Three of his known victims have been girls aged between 10 and 13. In the latest attack, the 14-year-old was grabbed from behind, dragged into nearby woods, and raped, as she had walked along a footpath next to Collenswood school in Stevenage. She had heard the sound of someone running behind her and stopped to let the person pass. Police are appealing for witnesses, particularly a moped driver who rode past the assault as it happened at around 5.30pm, and an elderly woman who was walking a white dog on the footpath shortly before the offence took place. A Hertfordshire police spokeswoman said yesterday: "At this stage we are not ruling out the possibility of this rape being linked to the other offences. However, until detectives have the results of the forensic examinations, which are expected on Tuesday, it is not possible to give a definitive answer and officers are keeping an open mind." Chief Inspector Mark Busley, who was in touch with local schools at the weekend, said: "It is important to stress offences like this are extremely rare. However, we are asking parents and guardians to remind children of the importance of taking common sense measures to safeguard their personal safety and to try and remain in the company of others."
