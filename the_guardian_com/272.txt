The report gives the first account of the two firearms officers who shot dead Jean Charles de Menezes, disclosing that they refused to answer questions from investigators and saying there is "significant doubt" over part of their account.The Independent Police Complaints Commissioninterviewed the pair under criminal caution; they exercised their right to silence and relied on written statements prepared 36 hours after the incident. The IPCC criticised the police practice of officers compiling statements together, after taking legal advice.Codenamed Charlie 2 and Charlie 12, the pair told how they left their base in east London armed with Glock 9mm handguns loaded with hollow tip bullets. At 7.45am they were told they might have to "do something they had not done before". At a second briefing they were given details of two men they might have to stop, and were warned bombs could be hidden on the body and "triggered easily".As Mr de Menezes travelled towards Stockwell station, Charlie 2 says he heard over the radio a surveillance officer saying "this was definitely our man" and that the suspect was "nervous, acting strangely". He then heard the command: "Stop him getting on the tube; he must not get on the tube." Charlie 2 believed this had come from a designated senior officer, who would issue the shoot to kill command. As they entered the train they saw an "Asian man", in fact Mr de Menezes. Both officers said they shouted "armed police", and the man advanced on them, before they fired repeatedly into his head.The report says "it may be of significance" none of the 17 passengers heard any police warning, adding: "There is significant doubt as to whether they shouted this in the carriage." All eight police in the carriage claimed the warning was given.In their statements on July 23, they wrongly said the man they shot was wearing a bulky jacket.
