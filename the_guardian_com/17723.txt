The gun allegedly used to kill the schoolboy Rhys Jones replicated the distinctive wounds inflicted in his shooting when fired in tests, a court heard today.The 11-year-old Liverpool schoolboy was gunned down in a pub car park in Croxteth Park on his way home from football practice in August last year.It is claimed he was hit by a stray bullet fired at members of the north Liverpool gang Nogga Dogs by Sean Mercer, 18, a member of the rival gang Crocky Crew. According to Neil Flewitt QC, prosecuting, the bullet - which entered Rhys's back slightly above his left shoulder blade and exited through the front right side of his neck - produced a noticeable "keyhole effect" on Rhys's body instead of a neat entry wound.Quoting the scientist who conducted the tests, Flewitt said the resulting wound was consistent with the bullet hitting the 11-year-old "partially or fully sideways-on" instead of nose-first. Neil Flewitt QC said a similar wound was created in tests on the .455 Smith and Wesson believed to have been involved in the shooting, using three of the .45 Colt cartridges recovered with the weapon."His tests revealed that the bullets produced the same distinctive 'keyhole' effect that he [the scientist] had identified on Rhys Jones's football shirt," Flewitt said.He said the unusual wound was the result of the bullet "tumbling nose-over-base" in flight rather than flying nose first in a stabilised manner.A bullet tumbling in this way is usually due to an undersized bullet or one discharged from a gun with a smooth-bore barrel or from a barrel with worn rifling. It could also be caused by deflection if the bullet passed through an intermediary target.According to the scientist, the tumbling bullet that killed Rhys was undersized by 0.08mm and the rifling of the revolver was worn.
