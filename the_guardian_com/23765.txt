Police investigating a shooting at a funeral that left one man dead have ordered extra patrols on the streets of south London to thwart reprisal attacks.The shooting is thought to have possible links to tensions between rival gangs in south London. It happened on Thursday afternoon as a 17-year-old youth who died in a car crash was buried.Multiple shots were fired as mourners left the funeral of Joel "Jozey" Morgan, 17, at Camberwell Old Cemetery.The man who died was named by police on Friday as Azezur Khan, 21, whose family said he preferred to be known as Ronnie.A 17-year-old youth was shot in the ankle, and in the area other bullet holes could still be seen.Metropolitan police commander David Zinzan, who is responsible for policing in south-east London, said: "Our priority is to bring to justice those responsible for this horrific shooting and to prevent any further incidents from occurring over the coming days."A significant number of witnesses have come forward and detectives from Operation Trident have been working around the clock to gather evidence and piece together exactly what occurred and identify those responsible for this outrageous act."Four people arrested after the shooting, two men aged 20 and two 17-year-old girls, have been released on bail.Police said gunfire broke out as mourners left the funeral.Detective Superintendent Gordon Allison, of Scotland Yard's Trident unit, said: "As people were coming away from that cemetery two men were seen coming out of the cemetery and one of them was believed to be armed with a firearm. As a result of that shots were fired."He said Morgan, whose funeral it was, had "contact with gang members" but added that detectives were keeping an open mind about the motive for the shooting.Allison said: "Police intelligence would lead us to believe that, yes, he may have had some contact with gang members." But, he added, it "doesn't make it acceptable" for two people to be shot after a funeral.He also said "contingencies" had been made in case of trouble at the service."From our point of view we were obviously aware that the funeral was taking place and contingencies were in place to manage anything that might have come out of that," he said.An estate agent's near the scene had a bullet hole in its front window.
