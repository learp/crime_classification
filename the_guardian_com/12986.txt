A nationwide police campaign against sex trafficking was launched today after a four-month operation last year led to more than 200 arrests.All 55 police forces in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will take part in the project, named Pentameter 2 after the campaign last year.It is aimed at tracking down the criminal gangs who force women and children into the sex trade. This year's campaign will focus on helping the victims of trafficking.The government estimates that up to 4,000 women and girls are forced into prostitution after being trafficked from abroad.Last year Pentameter rescued 88 women and girls, including some as young as 14, who had been forced into the sex industry.Around half were from eastern Europe, and the rest from the Far East, Africa and South America. A permanent unit, the UK Human Trafficking Centre, was set up after the first Pentameter operation, bringing together police, prosecutors and officers from the Serious Organised Crime Agency.Speaking on BBC radio's Today programme, Tim Brain, the chief constable of Gloucestershire, said: "The problem is large. It is growing because there are huge profits to be made in the exploitation of young women and young men for sexual purposes."It is a form of 21st century slavery."Trafficked women can be forced to have sex with up to 40 strangers a day after being brought to the country under the false impression that they would be working in legitimate jobs, police said.The Crown Prosecution Service revealed last summer that "slave auctions" of women for prostitution are taking place on the concourses of British airports.Brothel keepers bid for women as soon as they arrive on UK soil.Police believe the average prices for trafficked women are falling, with "innocent and virginal" females fetching the highest price up to Â£8,000.Beth Herzfeld, of Anti-Slavery International, welcomed today's initiative but called for more resources to help those who had been trafficked for prostitution and forced labour."This is an important step forward but we can't underestimate the scale of the problem and therefore the resources that need to go into tackling it and supporting the victims of trafficking."It's critical that all those trafficked people are provided with the support that they so desperately need and deserve."She said the number arrested in last year's operation represented the "tip of the iceberg" of those involved in the illegal trade.Ms Herzfeld also said there was only one dedicated project to house and support the victims of human trafficking, which had space for 35 people.
