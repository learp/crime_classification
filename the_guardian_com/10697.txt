The home secretary, David Blunkett, today squared up for a fight with the Police Federation over the government's plans to reform officers' working practices, calling on officers to "police streets, not demonstrate on them."His call came after the head of the Metropolitan Police Federation - a quasi trade union that represents rank and file officers in London - Glen Smyth warned that the police would stage demonstrations around the country to protests against cuts in sick pay and overtime allowances.The Police Federation was meeting in London today to discuss tactics for opposing the bill, which was part of David Blunkett's plan to eradicate so-called "Spanish practices" from the police in England and Wales.But today in the Commons, Mr Blunkett fired a shot across the bows of any police disruption, saying police officers should police the streets, not demonstrate on them.He told MPs: "I think this message needs to go out to Glen Smyth and others from the Metropolitan Police Federation that we deeply care about what the police are doing. "We want more of them in the community on the beat, we want police on our streets, policing and securing our streets not police on our streets demonstrating on those streets." The police are barred by statute from striking, but leaders of 126,000 rank and file officers are thought to be planning a mass rally at Wembley Arena against changes to their pay and conditions.The Police Federation had warned that there was "widespread discontent" about many of the proposals in the police reform white paper and that officers were unhappy about the prospect of working longer hours for less money. Speaking on behalf of the Police Federation, Mr Smyth said earlier today that there was "absolutely massive anger" among rank and file police officers about the home secretary's proposals. Under the proposals, overtime pay would be cut and paid only after an officer had worked 42 hours, rather than at the current 40 hours. However, Mr Blunkett promised higher starting salaries for experienced candidates and extra pay for people in special priority posts. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of his plans is to give community support officers (CSOs) police-style powers to use "reasonable force" to detain suspects.
