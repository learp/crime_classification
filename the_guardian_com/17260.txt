Eight out of 10 families sent to antisocial behaviour "sinbins" are headed by single mothers, according to an official study of the schemes published today.The report, which also found a high rate of mental health problems and family violence within the households, suggests that support rather than punishment is the key to tackling nuisance neighbours.The study is an interim assessment for the government of six projects across the north of England offering intensive help to disruptive families who sign up to strict behaviour codes. The schemes, labelled 'sinbins' by some, are based on the successful Dundee Families project.The prime minister, Tony Blair, wants to see a network of such schemes across the country, as part of his Respect action plan published last week.The study, by Sheffield Hallam university, looked at 99 families being helped by such schemes.It found:路 80% of the families were headed by single mothers; 路 a quarter of the families included at least one child with special education needs; 路 39% had a least one family member with mental health problems, and 路 28% of the households reported a history of family violence.Judy Nixon, senior lecturer at Sheffield Hallam's centre for social inclusion and the leader of the study, said the early indications showed that such schemes were helping to change disruptive behaviour.A full assessment of the schemes, five of which are run by the children's charity NCH, will be published later this year.Last week, welfare charities, including NCH, criticised the hardline tone of Mr Blair's Respect agenda. NCH urged the government not to judge the success of its campaign on the number of antisocial behaviour orders issued. Other charities were concerned about punitive measures, such as docking benefits for antisocial families and sealing and shutting homes that were the focus of neighbour nuisance.Ms Nixon said her report suggested that helping families was better than punishment."The more supportive environments provide very positive outcomes in terms of stopping offending behaviour."The findings suggests that the causes of problem behaviour need to be tackled before you can find sustainable long-term solutions. Many causes are associated with poverty and low incomes and a range of support needs. Many of these families are slipping through the net of welfare provision."Ms Nixon said the term "sinbins" was an inaccurate description. "It implies a focus on punishment, whereas in fact these projects provide intensive support."An NCH spokeswoman said: "The report shows the strong link between intensive rehabilitation projects and improving antisocial behaviour."
