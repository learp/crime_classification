A murder hunt was launched last night after a woman was found stabbed 16 times and left burning in a seafront shelter.Her body was found by council workers in the Holywell area of Eastbourne, East Sussex, early on Saturday after council workers on the promenade spotted flames in a thatched shelter set into the clifftop. She had been subjected to what Sussex police described as "a frenzied attack". A badly burnt child's double buggy was found next to the woman, believed to be in her 30s, but a police spokesman ruled out the possibility that children were attacked in the incident. Officers said the buggy was probably used by the victim, who may have been homeless, to transport possessions. The woman was white, 4ft 10in to 5ft tall (147-152cm) and may have had shoulder-length brown hair. She was found with an elephant charm bracelet on her left wrist and may have been wearing a pink padded jacket and a heavy black woollen coat, according to police. Detective Chief Inspector Tony O'Donnell, leading the investigation, said: "This was a horrific attack on the victim. We urgently need the help of the public in identifying the woman. I would ask anybody with information to contact us as soon as possible."
