The dead man has not been named by police.Dinesh Tailor, 49, the owner of a nearby pharmacy, was one of the first to rush to help. "He was lying on the pavement face down and there was blood pooling from his chest and abdomen area," he said. "He had lost consciousness. He didn't reply when we asked if he could hear us."The victim received help from paramedics at the scene, but was pronounced dead on arrival at the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel.
