Detectives hunting the killer who bludgeoned 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell with a hammer said yesterday that a potentially crucial witness had come forward.The murder in Hampton, south-west London, has been linked to two other incidents in recent weeks. The new witness described seeing the first victim, a 17-year-old girl who was attacked on January 8, lying on the ground as a man stood over her. An e-fit of the suspect is to be published later today. Ms McDonnell was attacked on February 4, less than 91 metres from her home. Police believe the same killer may have struck for a third time, on February 25. An 18-year-old student escaped with minor injuries when a man who had been crouching behind a wall leapt out and tried to hit him with a heavy tool. Forensic tests could show whether the killer left fibres or DNA on Ms McDonnell. Detectives are also scrutinising 60 people whom they regard as being "of interest", and a dozen whose backgrounds make them credible suspects. Police are still looking for two potential witnesses who were seen leaving a bus near a cemetery on the night Ms McDonnell was attacked. One was a woman in her 20s with blonde hair, the other a man aged about 30, wearing a green wax-type jacket, who was last seen walking towards the road where Ms McDonnell, a gap-year student, was killed. Criminal profilers have told the murder squad that the suspect probably lives in the area and may have some kind of sexual motive, though none of the victims was sexually assaulted. A 21-year-old man was arrested in connection with the inquiry. He was later charged for unrelated robbery and firearms offences and remanded in custody.
