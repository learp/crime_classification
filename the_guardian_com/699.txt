The ringleader of a gang of Algerians who ran a £1.5m fraud racket across Britain was jailed for five years yesterday.The Old Bailey heard that Ali Khelifi, 34, was the "chief executive" of the gang, which netted at least £800,000 from the highly organised scam, by using 342 bank accounts over a two-year period. The gang set up bogus accounts or took over dormant ones, obtained cheque books to buy consumer goods from chain stores, then returned the goods for cash before the cheques bounced. Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad led the inquiry, which also involved the National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit, based within Special Branch. The 10 men did not appear to have profited personally from their crimes, and police discovered that at least £800,000 had left the UK. But then the trail went cold and detectives failed to establish links to any terrorist group. The London-based gang carried out seemingly random and minor acts of fraud in cities and towns hundreds of miles apart, which made it difficult for police forces to spot connections. But a shop assistant at Laura Ashley in Stratford-upon-Avon became suspicious of a customer trying to get a refund on an £80 floral dress he had bought in Dundee. She raised the alarm, and police found £3,500 of clothes and electrical goods, with receipts, in the boot of the suspect's car. Detectives launched a surveillance operation which led to the discovery of £1.5m worth of clothes and electrical goods in a lock-up. Seven other men have been jailed and one deported for the frauds.
