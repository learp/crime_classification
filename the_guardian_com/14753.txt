A Labour MP has hit out at the News of the World for being involved in a "despicable and evil act" and called on the prime minister to act over the hacking of the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler following her disappearance in March 2002.Tom Watson informed MPs of the revelation, published on the Guardian website on Monday afternoon, which he said would not only shock parents "to the very core", but also "strongly suggests" that parliament was misled.Later Watson said: "Surely now we should hear from David Cameron and Ed Miliband. It's utterly disgraceful that they've let this scandal run on for as long as it has. No more cowardice - we want action."Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott said on Twitter that he will write to culture secretary Jeremy Hunt demanding that he block News Corp's bid to take full control of pay-TV company BSkyB following the revelations about Dowler.He tweeted: "The hacking of Milly Dowler's phone by Murdoch's News of the World proves once and for all he is not a fit and proper person to own BSkyB."Detectives from Scotland Yard's new inquiry into phone hacking by newspapers, Operation Weeting, are believed to have found evidence of the targeting of the Dowlers in a collection of 11,000 pages of notes kept by Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator jailed for phone hacking on behalf of the News of the World.In a point of order, Watson referred to an inquiry into press standards conducted by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee last year and asked the Speaker, John Bercow, how the Commons could address the matter.Watson, a former minister, said: "In the last few minutes, it has just been revealed by the Guardian newspaper that Milly Dowler's phone was hacked by private investigators working for News of the World."The company [the News of the World] subsequently revealed the information to the Surrey police who were investigating the matter. As well as being a despicable and evil act that will shock parents up and down the land to the very core, it also strongly suggests that parliament was misled in the press standards inquiry held by the select committee in 2010."The Speaker said he had only learned of the revelation from Watson himself five minutes before and suggested that the MP should "take it up" with the DCMS committee if he believed MPs were either misled or misinformed.He went on: "In view of the gravity of the issue he has raised – with the details of which I was not previously familiar – I can say only it will have been heard by ministers on the Treasury [government] bench and if they judge in the circumstances that some sort of public response is desirable, as they might, I hope that response will be made on the floor of the House of Commons before it is made anywhere else."Milly Dowler, then aged 13, disappeared on her way home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey on 21 March 2002. Last month, Levi Bellfield was jailed for life for her murder.Her family's lawyer issued a statement on Monday afternoon in which he described the News of the World's activities as "heinous" and "despicable".
