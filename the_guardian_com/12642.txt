Street crime in the London borough of Lambeth, where people caught in possession of cannabis are not arrested or charged, has fallen dramatically, according to new figures.The number of robberies in Lambeth has fallen by almost 50% in the six months up to and including April, Scotland Yard said.Detective superintendent Jim Webster, crime manager for Lambeth police, said: "There are some 450 less people per month becoming victims of street robbery now as compared to six months ago. "There is a massive saving of resources achieved by this reduction in crime. We can now use this "peace dividend" to focus on longer-term approaches to bringing down crime.Lambeth's suspended police chief, Commander Brian Paddick, pioneered the police's experimental "softly, softly" approach to cannabis possession in July 2001.Cmdr Paddick championed the controversial policy because he said it freed officers to tackle the trade in hard drugs such as crack, cocaine and heroin.But he was taken off operational duties in Lambeth in March after an inquiry was launched into allegations that he smoked cannabis and allowed his gay lover to use the drug in their flat.During last month there were 468 reported robberies in Lambeth, compared to last October when the number of incidents peaked at an all time high of 916.So far this year robbery is down by 18% compared to figures for 2001 - the highest street crime reduction in London.The fall in the crime figures is due to a range of initiatives under Operation Safer Streets, involving Lambeth police, the local authority and community, a Scotland Yard spokesman said.Police said successful projects included the use of robbery response cars operating six days per week.Officers, working with Lambeth housing department, have also been targeting convicted youngsters and teenagers suspected of involvement in crime. Their parents are being visited and in some cases they have been warned that their children's behaviour could lead to their eviction.Police have also concentrated on a number of tube stations to carry out crime prevention and have installed surveillance cameras at key crime hotspots.
