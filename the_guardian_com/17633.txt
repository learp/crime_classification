The England star Steven Gerrard today denied being involved in a nightclub brawl last year, as he formally pleaded not guilty to affray at Liverpool crown court.The Liverpool captain, aged 28, was accused of being part of a group that injured businessman Marcus McGee, 34, at the Lounge Inn, Southport, in the early hours of December 29 last year.Gerrard's appearance came on the day he signed a two-year contract extension that will keep him at Anfield until 2013.Asked how he pleaded, the father of two, dressed in a single-breasted dark blue suit, said in a loud voice: "Not guilty."He appeared alongside six other men who also denied affray, which stemmed from a melee after Gerrard celebrated Liverpool's 5-1 away win against Newcastle United. Today, the Recorder of Liverpool, Henry Globe QC adjourned the trial to July 20.Because of Gerrard's standing as Liverpool captain, there had been discussion in legal circles about whether the trial would be moved to another city. However, Judge Globe said careful consideration would be given to jury members' interests, and kept the case in Liverpool.The seven defendants were given bail with conditions not to contact witnesses nor to enter visit the Lounge Inn, unless with a legal representative.Gerrard, who grew up on Huyton's Bluebell estate, has been capped 70 times for England and has captained his country four times. He has an honorary fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University.As Gerrard was in court today, his manager Rafael Benitez announced the player had agreed a two-year contract extension to 2013. He told the club's website: "This is fantastic news for the club. Steven has once again shown his commitment and it was an easy deal to agree. As soon as we offered him the option, he said yes. There were no problems at all. He wants to stay for life."."
