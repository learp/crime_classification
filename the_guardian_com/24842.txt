A former British National Party candidate who amassed a stash of explosive chemicals in anticipation of a future civil war was jailed today for two and a half years.Robert Cottage, 49, was cleared after two trials of conspiracy to cause explosions. He earlier pleaded guilty to possessing the chemicals.Police discovered a large stockpile of chemicals and food at his home in Colne, Lancashire, last September.Officers mounted the operation after Cottage's wife told a social worker she was concerned about the substances, and about her husband's belief that immigrants were swamping Britain, which he feared was on the brink of civil war.Cottage appeared at Manchester's crown square court to be sentenced in relation to the charge of possession.Cottage's barrister, Alistair Webster QC, said his client admitted having bought the potassium nitrate and sulphur and planning to manufacture gunpowder but said he would have used the chemicals only to create "thunder flash"-style bangers to scare off intruders.The judge, Mrs Justice Swift, labelled Cottage's actions "criminal and potentially dangerous".She noted that the pre-sentence report said Cottage held "overvalued ideas" but said the risk of his committing further offences was low."It is important to understand that Cottage's intention was that if he ever had to use the thunder flashes, it was only for the purpose of deterrence," she said."The pre-sentence report says Cottage continues to hold views that veer towards the apocalyptic. The risk of further offending of the same type is low but it cannot be ruled out."A second man, David Jackson, a 62-year-old dentist, was also charged with conspiracy to cause explosions but was cleared after the jury twice failed to reach verdicts.Mrs Justice Swift said there was no evidence the chemicals' packaging had been opened or that Cottage had attempted to make gunpowder.Cottage, of Talbot Street, has already served 10 and a half months in jail and is likely to be freed within six months.
