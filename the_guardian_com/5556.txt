Police are recording less than half of all crimes of domestic violence reported to them, and only 11% of these lead to a conviction, according to a report out today.A joint study by police and Crown Prosecution Service inspectors found that despite a big leap forward in police attitudes and much work by the CPS to raise awareness of domestic abuse, this had not filtered down to the grass roots. "Often policies were not matched on the ground by effective responses and solid investigative practice. Priority given to domestic violence locally was variable and depended heavily upon local initiatives and commitments." The solicitor general, Harriet Harman, who commissioned the report, said: "The police and CPS now have the right policies, but not everyone is putting them into practice. The government will back up the police and prosecutors in stepping up their efforts to tackle domestic violence." The report found that frontline officers and lawyers who dealt with domestic violence were often highly dedicated. But more in-depth training was required, as well as systems to examine why arrests were not made in some cases. Police in England and Wales receive a domestic violence call every minute, thousands of children witness incidents every day, and two women are killed by a partner or former partner every week. Yet the inspectors discovered that of 463 incidents to which police were called there should have been 260 crime reports, but there were only 118. Only 21% of these resulted in charges, and there was a conviction in just 11%. In 44% of cases received by the CPS, the victim wanted to withdraw the complaint, often for fear of reprisals or a reluctance to "break up" a family. The inspectors found little guidance to prosecutors about when witnesses could be compelled to testify.
