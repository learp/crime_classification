Jack Straw said this week that victims of crime or their relatives would be able to lay complaints under the new Human Rights Act if there was evidence police had failed to carry out a proper investigation of a crime. He said of the act, due to come into force on October 2: "It is about the rights of victims and the wider community".But the home secretary is also considering giving victims a greater role in the judicial process. He has suggested that the court could be provided with a "victim personal statement". He is rightly sympathetic to the feelings of those who feel ignored in a process which directly affects them, but careful distinctions must be drawn. Helping victims by way of counselling or compensation is vital and doubtless much could be done to improve the support they receive; but the prosecution of the perpetrators of crime is another matter.Protestors in Portsmouth who believe their children to be the target of child abusers have every right to air their views publicly but they have no role in the court's function of deciding guilt, innocence or punishment. Centuries have gone by since catching criminals was left largely to victims and their families. Punishment was seen as making reparation to the victim. In modern society, while reparation may still have its place, maintaining the rule of law has become the responsibility of the state. The whole process has become professionalised. Jack Straw is certainly entitled to consider whether the pendulum has swung too far. Occasionally, reminders of the medieval rights of the victims have surfaced. In 1817, Abraham Thornton was tried by judge and jury for the rape and murder of Mary Ashford. They had been to a dance in the rural neigbourhood of Erdington, now a suburb of Birmingham, and they walked home together. Next morning Mary's violated body was found drowned in a pond. There were signs of a bloody struggle nearby. Abraham was the obvious suspect. He claimed they had intercourse by agreement and then parted peacefully. He denied any involvement in her death. In the days before fingerprints, blood tests or DNA, the means of proof were lacking. The judge pointed out that there was no evidence to link the accused directly with the crime. The jury acquitted. In their grief, Mary's family tried to use an archaic legal procedure, "appeal of felony", to have Thornton re-arrested and brought before the Court of Queen's Bench. Thornton's lawyer arrived at court with a large pair of gloves which he handed to his client. Those who have seen the recent production of Richard II would recognise what happened next. Thornton threw down his gauntlet in front of Mary's brother, William Ashford. Thornton claimed that the medieval law entitled him to trial by battle - the primitive idea was that winning a physical fight would prove who was right. Ashford refused the challenge - Thornton was younger and fitter. Ashford's lawyers argued that he should have a second jury trial but the judges said he had to fight or abandon his claim. Prudently he did so. The judges had rather effectively consigned the appeal of felony to the dustbin of history; it has never been attempted again. The victim's family has no longer the right to challenge an acquittal. And why should the accused, who has stood trial and been acquitted, have to face another trial merely because the victim is unhappy at the outcome? Where a suspect has not been tried and acquitted and the the Crown Prosecution Service declines to prosecute, there remains the possibility of a private prosecution, but, as the family of Stephen Lawrence discovered, it has pitfalls. The high standard of proof of guilt of crime must be achieved, yet the state's investigative resources are not available to the private person. As the Lawrences discovered to their dismay, an acquittal rules out a future public prosecution (though this could be changed following the recommendations of the Lawrence inquiry). The Human Rights Act is opening up promising opportunities for victims of crime to put greater pressure on the police and prosecuting auhorities to take action. The right to a fair hearing enshrined in the European Human Rights Convention has already been held by the Court of Human Rights to entitle the victim of crime to demand a thorough investigation and hold the police accountable if it is not carried out. From next month the English courts will have to enforce this requirement; the Scottish courts already have to do so. It is also important to remember that the victim has the right to take civil proceedings for compensation but this has little value where the criminal has no means or they are effectively concealed. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board may provide more certain recompense but there are features of that system which may themselves fall foul of the Human Rights Act. Jack Straw is right to try to improve remedies for victims but, other than as a witness of fact, the victim has no proper voice at the trial of the alleged perpetrator. To give the victim a role in deciding innocence or guilt would flout our notion of impartial and independent justice. It would violate the right of the accused to a fair trial. To give the victim any right to influence the sentence would raise the same fair trial issue.Within the criminal process itself the victim or the family may be able to contribute something to the sentencing process by providing information which will assist the judge. To this extent a "victim personal statement" may be of value. Beyond that, sympathy for the victim cannot in modern days detract from the state's responsibility to ensure the independence and impartiality of the justice system.
