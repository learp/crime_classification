Detectives have urged members of the travelling community to help them track down two men named yesterday as key suspects in the killing of a 10-year-old boy in a hit and run incident.Lothian and Borders police will make a national appeal on the BBC programme Crimewatch tonight for information on the whereabouts of Patrick Nolan, 19, and Isaac Purcell, 25, after releasing their names and photographs yesterday. They are suspected of riding in the green Peugeot saloon that hit Jack Anderson at high speed as he crossed a junction in Edinburgh on his way home from primary school on October 5. The car was being chased by police investigating hoax calls and had raced down the wrong side of the road. It was later found near Saughton prison in west Edinburgh.The appeal is being broadcast on Crimewatch because detectives believe Mr Nolan and Mr Purcell have fled Scotland and may be being harboured in the Gypsy Traveller community in England, Wales or Ireland.Mr Purcell's younger brother Mark, 19, is in custody charged with culpable homicide and five other charges over Jack's death after he was arrested in October. Attempts to trace the two suspects have stalled, leading detectives to get permission from Scottish prosecutors to identify the suspects on television - an unusual step in Scotland.
