A council said today it has withdrawn an Asbo against a teenager who suffers from Tourette syndrome, despite insisting that his bad behaviour was not linked to his medical condition.Manchester city council withdrew the antisocial behaviour order against the youngster, whose condition causes involuntary swearing and insults, vocal grunts, hyperactivity, grimacing and muscular tics.The council was successful in winning an interim order against the youngster, who cannot be named for legal reasons, in January this year.Local residents had complained that the boy repeatedly kicked a football against their properties, threw stones and spat at houses, kicked street lamps and threw rubbish down the street.He also used homophobic abuse repeatedly against a resident, and was part of a group that used abusive and insulting language to elderly residents when challenged about their behaviour.The interim order banned him from using bad language, vandalism, graffiti, playing football in the street and being in a group bigger than three.An interim order is imposed before a final court hearing can be arranged where a full Asbo can be imposed. After that, breaking the Asbo can lead to immediate arrest and prosecution.The teenager's bad behaviour had stopped in August 2004, after the council began compiling evidence. The council claimed they were only withdrawing from pursuing a full Asbo because of the success of the interim order.But his family's solicitors sent a letter to the council saying he suffered from Tourette syndrome.A council spokesman said today: "Solicitors acting on behalf of the boy submitted a doctor's letter saying he suffered from Tourette's. However, no medical evidence was ever produced linking the syndrome with the antisocial behaviour." Manchester city council has been one of the most active local authorities in the UK in its use of Asbos.Councillor Eddy Newman, executive member for housing on the council, said: "By applying for an interim order, this boy's antisocial behaviour has been stopped in its tracks and there is now no need to proceed to a full order against him."Like the majority of our law-abiding residents, we only ever required that the behaviour should stop. It has, so the order has worked."
