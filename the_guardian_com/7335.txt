A pioneering high-security hospital unit designed for some of the most dangerous prisoners has been closed to admissions following a series of disturbances including hostage-taking and assaults on staff.The Peaks unit at Rampton hospital, Nottinghamshire, is undergoing fundamental changes as a result of the breakdown in its operation. An inquiry has blamed the Prison Service for sending unsuitable patients to the unit simply because they were nearing the end of jail terms and the Home Office did not want them released into the community.The development is a major blow to the government's expensive policy of special treatment for men deemed to have "dangerous and severe personality disorder", or DSPD, which was drawn up after the conviction of Michael Stone for the killing of Lin Russell and her daughter, Megan, in 1996. Like others diagnosed with personality disorder, formerly described as psychopaths, Stone was said to have been regarded by some psychiatrists as untreatable.The Peaks is one of a new generation of units, eventually to total 300 beds, designed to accommodate DSPD patients and work intensively on their conditions and behaviour. Treatment at The Peaks costs Â£180,000 a year for each patient.Claims about the kind of disturbances at the unit were described in a letter from Scott Maloney, a patient in The Peaks for the past 15 months. Writing on March 23 this year, Mr Maloney said that over the previous four weeks: a patient had punched a doctor in an unprovoked attack; one patient had taken another hostage; four patients had seriously assaulted a member of staff; and one patient had stabbed another in the eye with a pen.The letter was written to Bob Johnson, an independent psychiatrist who had been head of therapy at Ashworth high-security hospital, Merseyside.Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS trust, which runs Rampton, acknowledged that the Peaks was closed to admissions "to allow the unit an opportunity to reassess and refine its arrangements".
