A restaurant worker who lived on the run from immigration authorities was jailed for life today for the murder of a young Chinese couple who let slip details of their secret and highly lucrative betting scam.Cao Guang Hui, 31, was convicted of strangling, battering and stabbing to death the pair in their flat in Newcastle upon Tyne, almost certainly in a failed attempt to get a share of nearly £250,000.He was ordered to serve a minimum of 33 years by Mr Justice Wilkie, who described the deaths of Xhi Zhou and Zhen Xing Yang, both 25, as a crime of "exceptionally high seriousness which would have involved horrifying and barely imaginable suffering".The judge echoed police fears that others in the Chinese underworld were involved by suggesting the victims had "in some way crossed those involved in organising their criminal activities".He told the court that the brutality of the murders was a punishment, an example and a clear message sent out to all who become involved in this scam not to cross the organisers.Cao was overpowered by seven prison officers after he screamed at the jury: "You are killing me! You are the murderers!"The seven women and five men had rejected his defence that he was a pawn of a criminal gang who had carried out the killings last August after using him to gain access to the flat in inner-city Fenham. Although the jury rejected Cao's claim that he was blackmailed into taking part, detectives have not ruled out the possible involvement of others.Sentencing was adjourned for an hour after Cao collapsed in the dock where he had sat throughout the three-week trial beside security officers and a translator.The court heard that the victims were two popular young graduates of Newcastle University who preferred to use their Anglicised names of Cici and Kevin. Their bodies were found bound with tape and covered in blood at the flat where their cat had also been drowned.Detectives believe both may have been tortured in a bid to reach a stash of money they had made through rigging bets and issuing false academic qualifications.The trial heard Cici and Kevin had a declared income of only £17,000 a year, mostly earned by Cici's waitressing, but more than £233,000 had passed through their bank account.Yang was involved in sending information from live UK football matches to gamblers in China who benefited from a TV time delay of several seconds, allowing them to bet on events already knowing the outcome.Hints of the scam and the couple's prosperity leaked out into Newcastle's large Chinese community, and the court heard that Cao went to considerable lengths to pose as a prospective tenant for a spare room which Cici and Kevin had to let.The jury of seven women and five men heard that major financial transactions were going on at the time of the killings, including a transfer of £45,000 to Yang's parents in Dalian, China, only a few weeks earlier.The theft of a laptop and the couple's mobile phones from the flat was rapidly dismissed as a reason for the murders by police. Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, described the ferocity of the killings as "not even remotely necessary" for such a minor haul.The phones proved crucial, however, in leading detectives to Cao, after they were found in a field by two boys. When the phones were handed in, after a national appeal on Crimewatch, fingerprints and DNA matched those of the 30-year-old, who was picked up after dodging immigration checks for five years.A search of Cao's home in Morpeth, Northumberland, found trousers stained with Yang's blood and a watch and spectacles taken from the victims. Cao admitted he had been in the flat at the time of the killings, but had been tied up himself by others, who had blackmailed him into applying for the tenancy and making a rendezvous with Cici and Kevin.The court heard that negotiations over rent were all carried out on a website popular with the city's Chinese community, where Cici used the online name Godlike and Cao, who gave the couple a false surname borrowed from that of a friend's, called himself Tanktank.Cao's money affairs were secretive, but police checks showed him earning only just over £3,500 in 2006-2007, falling to £1,842 the following year, when his last details were recorded four months before the murders. He sat throughout the trial wearing a white shirt and spectacles, and remained expressionless most of the time, including the moment when the jury foreman read out the guilty verdict. He collapsed when the prosecution said that they would ask for life sentences.The victims were buried together in China where their relatives watched the trial with an interpreter via a videolink. Cici's father, Sanbao Zhou, said after the verdict: "There is an ancient Chinese saying: 'The most suffering one can go through in one's life consists of losing one's mother when one is still young, losing one's wife in the prime of one's life and losing one's children in one's old age.' This is especially true when one's child has been murdered."Kevin's mother, Shu Zhen Qu, who came to Newcastle for the trial, said: "This person did not just kill two people, he has killed two families. We have now been sentenced to go to hell. Our family will never be able to have any future generations."Det Supt Steve Wade, head of the inquiry, said more than 6,000 mobile phone checks and hundreds of internet usage inquiries had been made during the "large and complex investigation". He said that reassuring Chinese opinion had been an extra dimension to the inquiry – with an estimated half a billion people watching a TV briefing in London for the Chinese media."The victim's parents had some natural scepticism about how police in the UK operate – it was completely outside the realm of their previous experience or knowledge and all communication has been through an interpreter," Wade said."We did everything possible to meet these challenges, keeping them updated about the investigation, taking them through the prosecution process, helping them watch the court proceedings and explaining where necessary."I've been impressed by their patience, courage and dignity under extremely traumatic circumstances. And I know that they, in turn, have been overwhelmed by the scale, skill, diligence and professionalism of the investigation which has brought about this conviction."
