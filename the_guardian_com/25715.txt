A Premier League footballer has been stabbed in both legs and is described in a "serious" condition after an attack on him and his mother at their home.The West Ham central defender Calum Davenport required emergency surgery today on his injuries after the knife attack in the home in Bedford. Doctors described the Bedford-born player's injuries as severe, but it is too early to speculate whether they have curtailed or could damage the 26-year-old's career. His mother was also described by police as being in a serious condition.Two men have been taken in to custody in connection with the incident. A 25-year-old man was arrested in Derby on suspicion of attempted murder, while a 19-year-old man arrested earlier remains in custody, said Bedfordshire police. Detectives from Scotland Yard have also been notified of the incident. In addition, West Ham's medical team are liaising with hospital staff over the extent of the wounds.A statement by West Ham read: "The club's thoughts are with Calum Davenport and his family. His mum is recovering while Calum underwent surgery this morning and his injuries were described as serious by doctors."The thoughts of everyone at West Ham are with Calum and his family and, due to the ongoing police investigation, no further information will be released at this time."Davenport is a former England Under-21 international, who cost the Hammers £3m when he joined them from Tottenham during the summer of 2007. However, he did not figure in West Ham's first game of the season at Wolves last week and recent transfer speculation has linked the defender with a £1.5m move to Nottingham Forest.Davenport spent a spell on loan at Premier League rivals Sunderland last season and has also been loaned out to Watford. The centre-back started his career at Coventry and has also played on loan at Southampton and Norwich. Gianfranco Zola's side are due to play Tottenham tomorrow.
