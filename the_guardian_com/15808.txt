A top policeman today called on the government to free up police from "mundane work" by hiring civilians to do certain clerical and administrative jobs.Rick Naylor, the president of the Police Superintendents Association of England and Wales, said it was wasteful to have officers "filling in forms"."Police officers frequently do administrative and clerical jobs and they are not using their police powers - this is a waste of resources," he said. Mr Naylor made the plea at the association's annual conference in Chester, which was attended by the Home Secretary, John Reid.The Crime Fighting Fund is an extra pool of money that services can use to hire more police officers. In 2005-06, some Â£277 million was earmarked for forces in the fund.Mr Naylor said that, while a "relaxation of the fund" to hire civilians would lead to a reduction in sworn officers and be "risky" for the government in terms of popular opinion, "the gains could be service-changing."He also spoke about high levels of anxiety and depression among superintendents and chief superintendents. Health surveys conducted among its 1,600 representatives every three years since 2000 had found increasingly high levels of stress which were well above the national average.He cited the example of a superintendent working on the London July 7 bombings who did not go home for three weeks.Mr Naylor said long hours and the pressure to achieve targets were having a negative effect on the police service. "I believe chief officers are under so much pressure to achieve targets that it is affecting their relations with superintendents as they transfer that pressure to us. This is my theory why some of my colleagues are being treated so badly and leave bitter and twisted."
