The number of stun weapons seized at UK borders has soared by more than 70% in four years, official figures show.Stun guns deliver powerful electric shocks that can be deadly and are illegal in the UK.Border officials confiscated 729 of the weapons in the financial year of 2015/16 – up from 604 the year before and 633 in in 2013/14, according to Home Office figures. And the number of seized stun guns has increased by 71% from 2012/13, when 425 of the weapons were found.The numbers were released by the Home Office in answer to a parliamentary question from Kerry McCarthy, the Labour MP for Bristol.Stun guns are increasingly the weapon of choice for criminals and gangs who find it hard to get real guns in the UK.Nathan Matthews took a kidnap kit, which included stun guns disguised as torches, when he went to the home of his teenage stepsister Becky Watts and murdered her last year.The 16-year-old suffered 40 injuries as she tried to fight off Matthews and his girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, during the attack. The pair, who are both serving lengthy jail terms, then dismembered her body, wrapped the parts in cling film and stashed them in a garden shed.McCarthy told the Press Association: “The use of disguised stun guns seems to be a growing problem in this country, including among organised crime gangs. I was deeply troubled by their connection to the tragic murder of Becky Watts, which was how I was first made aware of the issue.“I hope that border staff are taking this problem seriously in order to prevent these weapons from getting into the hands of criminals in this country.”Stun guns have been used in armed robberies, aggravated burglaries and in rows between drug dealers, and those in possession of them face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.But while some people are purposely buying the weapons, there are concerns Britons are unwittingly purchasing stun guns disguised as torches or mobile phones abroad and accidentally bringing them into the UK.In January last year the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) warned that some Britons buying “silly novelty” souvenirs could face jail.Baljit Ubhey, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said: “This is an issue that holidaymakers must be aware of and they need to make sure they know what they are bringing back in their suitcases.”He added: “What can seem like a silly novelty object can result in a criminal conviction and even imprisonment and I would urge all holidaymakers to make sure they know what they are buying when shopping for souvenirs abroad.”
