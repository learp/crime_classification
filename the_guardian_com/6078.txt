Detectives investigating the murder of two women whose body parts were found in bin bags last night arrested a 51-year-old man being sought in connection with the killings, Scotland Yard confirmed.Anthony James Hardy was picked up near Great Ormond Street Hospital for children after a tip-off by a member of the public. He was taken to a north London police station.Hardy was identified as a suspect on Wednesday after detectives found the body parts of two women at his flat in Royal College Street, Camden, London, and in bin liners dumped on the street and at the back of a pub nearby.The arrest, which was carried out by members of the territorial support group, came just hours after police launched an appeal for a missing 24-year-old Scottish woman who was last seen on Boxing Day with Mr Hardy.Scotland Yard also revealed last night that there had since been two reported sightings of Kelly Anne Nicol, from Falkirk, Scotland, which were being followed up."We still urge anyone who has seen her to contact police so that we can be satisfied that she is safe and well," the spokeswoman added.Detectives revealed yesterday that Mr Hardy had been at the casualty department of University College hospital in Camden for four hours on New Year's Day seeking drugs to help him with a long-standing illness related to diabetes.But nurses believed he had been drinking and when they asked him for his home address, he allegedly became agitated and aggressive and left, according to Detective Chief Inspector Ken Bell.Police had talked to doctors at the hospital about Mr Hardy earlier that day, but not to staff in the casualty department, so nurses there were unaware that he was wanted for questioning.Though he had not given a false name to hospital staff, a still photograph from a CCTV camera in the building confirmed witness accounts that he had shaved off his beard in the last few days.It was feared that Mr Hardy might be in desperate need of medication for a condition called peripheral neuropathy, which can make him depressed.At a press confer ence yesterday, Commander Andy Baker, who is in overall charge of murders investigated by Scotland Yard, made a direct appeal to Mr Hardy: "Come and speak to us."He added: "There are a number of issues that need to be put to him, and Mr Bell will be ready to receive him. He has been to a hospital, so we have to be concerned about his health; he is diabetic and we can make sure he gets the right medication."The two women whose limbs were discovered earlier this week have yet to be identified and forensic tests on items in Mr Hardy's flat - including a hacksaw - are still at an early stage.Further details emerged yesterday of Mr Hardy's past.A year ago police searched his ground floor council flat - its walls painted with crude Celtic-type crosses - and found the body of a homeless prostitute and crack cocaine addict in a locked room.The police had been called to the block after a complaint of criminal damage had been made against Mr Hardy by a neighbour. He was arrested for that offence but a postmortem examination concluded that the woman, Sally White, 38, had died from a heart attack. Mr Hardy, a father of four who used to live in Australia, was released without charge.At her inquest in April the coroner, Dr Stephen Chan, recorded a verdict of death by natural causes. He said: "There is no foul play or third party involved in the death."Pathologist Dr Freddy Patel said death was due to coronary heart disease adding: "There were no marks of violence and there were traces of cocaine in the blood and urine but not enough to be fatal."Detective Sergeant Alan Bostick, the investigating officer into White's death, said: "There was no evidence he [Mr Hardy] was responsible for the death."
