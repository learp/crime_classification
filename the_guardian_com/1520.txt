A police officer who discovered a loophole in Tesco's Clubcard scheme, which enabled him to accrue 75,000 points in just two months and convert them to air miles, became so obsessed with collecting points that he would arrive at his local store "morning, noon and night". Shaun Pennicott, a 42-year-old married father of two, was convicted of the fraud and may lose his job with Hertfordshire constabulary.Pennicott, who regularly frequented his local Tesco in Watford town centre, discovered that coupons for loyalty points could be used repeatedly because there was no barcode reader in the slot for the coupons on the self-service check-out machines.Between December 2005 and January of last year he made 154 transactions, each time using the 150 bonus points voucher to repeatedly swipe bonus points that could be converted into BA air miles. He collected enough points to pay for six return flights between London and New York by the time the store's computer flagged up the need for a security check.Pennicott was last week convicted at Luton crown court of "going equipped to cheat" and given a community service order. He was fined £800 and ordered to pay prosecution costs of £2,500.Tesco yesterday admitted the loophole existed, but said it was not economically viable to make the changes to stop it.Samantha Leigh, prosecuting, told the court Pennicott would sometimes use his coupon three or four times when shopping. Each bonus point is worth a penny and every £2.50 can be converted to 600 air miles. During one promotion for Birds Eye meals, Pennicott bought 759 of the cheapest ones and got almost 38,000 bonus points converted to air miles.Pennicott said he had been amazed by what he had discovered and claimed he had planned to highlight the loophole to Tesco and the transactions were to be examples to show them.Judge Michael Kay described his defence as "preposterous.""This became an obsession in my judgment," he said. "You were so greedy you would do virtually anything to obtain Clubcard points and turn them into air miles. You regularly travelled abroad and that is what attracted you."
