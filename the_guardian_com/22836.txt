The pilot of a plane that crashed and injured the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, during an election day stunt has been convicted of making threats to kill.Justin Adams, 46, of Faringdon, Oxfordshire, was found guilty by a jury at Oxford crown court of five counts of making threats to kill relating to Farage and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) crash investigator Martin James.The crash on 6 May 2010, in which the light aircraft nosedived to the ground while towing a campaign banner, left both Adams and Farage in hospital.Adams, who was dressed in a navy blue suit and striped tie, stood in the dock staring straight ahead as the guilty verdicts were delivered.The Honourable Mr Justice Saunders adjourned sentencing until the week commencing 9 May, pending a pre-sentence report.Remanding Adams in custody, he said he was "clearly extremely disturbed" at the time the offences happened.He added: "He is a man who does need help. If I can find a way of giving him help, I will."During the trial, the prosecutor Alan Blake argued that the threats were intended to make those receiving them fear they would be carried out.The jury was played a recording of an exchange between a man calling himself Justin Adams and Sharon Bailey, a police inquiry centre officer at Thames Valley police.He said: "I'm going to kill somebody or two," the court heard.During the conversation on the evening of 28 November last year, Adams was heard to say: "I know where they live. They destroyed my life."He later added: "I now have a 9mm pistol. I've got the means. I will take them out and then myself."Adams told the operator that he had lost his livelihood, house, wife and child in the wake of the CAA investigation.He said: "You need to understand all charges were dropped against me after six or seven months of investigations. In the intervening period everything else fell apart."He added: "He's taken my life. I'll take his."Referring to Farage during the conversation, he said the politician had promised to issue a joint media statement following the conclusion of the investigation into the crash, which had cleared him.He added that he had met him for lunch to discuss it and "upped the pressure".He said: "Never use your last bullet, always keep a spare. I've got eight and need four to use. Three active and one spare."During the call, Adams stated he had not worked since May and received £30 a week, in place of his previous £50,000-a-year earnings.The court heard that Adams was later arrested and taken into custody.Giving evidence in his defence, Adams told the jury that, after the crash, his mental health had been "rapidly spiralling downhill" as his business and personal relationship deteriorated.He said he felt he was not receiving the help he needed and made the threats "in the belief and hope I would get put inside".He said: "I could see no other way. I made a decision to make these threats purely to get assistance."Adams said he had received media approaches to talk about the crash, but that Farage had initially suggested to him that there would be an opportunity to speak after the investigation ended in his favour.He claimed that friends later informed him that Farage was "generating PR as a result of the crash".
