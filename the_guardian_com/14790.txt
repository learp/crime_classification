A 22-year-old man will appear in court today charged with the murder of Egeli Rasta, who disappeared almost two weeks ago after setting out for a run near her home in south London.Ms Rasta, 27, has not been seen since leaving her flat in Mitcham on July 4, the day after she had finished a temporary job as a sales assistant in Harrods. She was reported missing four days later after failing to keep appointments with her recruitment agency and a friend.Police investigating her disappearance found a female body on Mitcham common, where the young Estonian regularly jogged, on Sunday evening. A post-mortem examination had yet to be carried out last night, and police said identification could take some time as the remains were badly decomposed. Detective Chief Inspector David Garwood, who is leading the inquiry, said the body had been discovered in an area covered in head-high scrub and trees after a tip-off. Ms Rasta's family have been notified but it is unclear whether they will come to Britain.Garath Davies, of Mitcham, is to appear at Wimbledon magistrates court today charged with murder and perverting the course of justice.
