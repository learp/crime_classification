Another member of the network which shielded gunman Raoul Moat during his week on the run in Northumberland faces jail for disrupting the police search.Scott Raisbeck, 30, admitted hiding a Ford Transit van used by the killer after he left jail and targeted his former partner's new boyfriend under the mistaken impression he was a police officer.Raisbeck also pleaded guilty at Newcastle crown court to disposing of the keys of the van, which had been stolen from Hartlepool borough council, and a number of other items which would have been useful evidence for the manhunt.Moat threatened to target police officers after murdering 29-year-old Christopher Brown, wounding his former partner Samantha Stobbart and randomly shooting and blinding traffic officer, PC David Rathband, 43. He killed himself after police cornered him in the quiet town of Rothbury where he had hidden in lairs known to him from holidays in the area when he was a boy.Two close associates of Moat were jailed for life in March for the murder of Brown, a karate instructor, conspiracy to murder and attempted murder. Karl Ness, 26, was ordered to serve a minimum 40-year term and Qhuram Awan, 23, 20 years.Raisbeck, of Blyth in Northumberland, was convicted of perverting the course of justice and handling stolen goods. He was given bail during the preparation of pre-sentence reports but Mr Justice Coulson told him: "I hope you understand that I will impose a prison sentence upon you for this offence. The pre-sentence report is likely to be of assistance to me in helping me decide how long a prison sentence I should impose on you."
