A 15-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the rape of an 11-year-old girl at a supermarket in Leamington Spa earlier this month, police said today.The youth was detained last night at an address in Leamington Spa and is in police custody awaiting questioning, Warwickshire police said.The mother of the victim has said the incident will scar her daughter for life and described the attacker as "sick in the head".The girl was shopping with her mother when she was attacked in a Sainsbury's store on March 2. She had left her mother to go to the toilet when she was pushed back into a cubicle and raped.The mother, who cannot be identified to protect her daughter's anonymity, said her child had returned "shaking and distraught" 15 minutes later, telling her: "A nasty man has done some horrible things to me in the toilet."The woman said that her daughter, a "very independent little girl", was now too scared to go to the toilet alone."She won't talk about it. She won't go to the toilet on her own. She won't go into a room on her own," the mother said."She is never going to forget it. It will scar her for life. It will be with her forever."This man ... needs to be caught ... I think he is sick in the head."
