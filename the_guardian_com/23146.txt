Senior police officers clashed with the UK's most-used social networking site today, accusing Facebook of ignoring worrying trends that it is providing a safe haven for predatory paedophiles by refusing to sign up to a "panic button" for children and young people.Jim Gamble, chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Unit (Ceop), was joined by the country's lead officer on homicide to tackle the site about its repeated refusal to sign up to a key safety practice adopted by many other similar websites.The American-owned site has 23 million active users in the UK but refuses to display an official "panic button" that links users directly to Ceop to report suspected activities by predatory paedophiles.The police officers spoke out after the conviction of Peter Chapman for the rape and murder of 17-year-old Ashleigh Hall.Chapman, a convicted double rapist, posed as a young man called Peter Cartwright on Facebook and spent time grooming Ashleigh before the pair exchanged mobile phone numbers and agreed to meet. Ashleigh was raped and suffocated by Chapman, who dumped her body in a field near Sedgefield in County Durham last October.Facebook has refused repeated requests by Ceop to include a panic button on its site. Information from the button is used to build intelligence reports on suspects which can become part of police investigations into paedophiles, rapists and violent individuals.Ceop revealed today that nearly half of the reports received about Facebook last year involved individuals who were suspected of grooming young people on the site. But because Facebook does not have the Ceop button on its site, only one or two complaints came from Facebook itself.Children use the button to make reports to Ceop's specialist police teams about suspected abuse, grooming and severe bullying. More than 500 such reports are received each month, four a day involve cases where children are in immediate danger. Although Bebo and MSN have adopted the button, Facebook has refused.Gamble said: "We have been asking social networking sites for too long to do the right thing."Since we launched the button in 2009, we have carried out careful analysis to look at varying sites who haven't adopted our service and the trends are worrying."Last year 267 reports were received about suspicious activity on Facebook. Almost half – 43% – related to cases of suspected grooming. But in 81% of cases, the individuals who felt under threat had to seek out other sites to make their reports to Ceop because Facebook has not adopted the direct link button."This is just not good enough," said Gamble. "Their argument for not putting our button into their environment, in my opinion, doesn't hold water."Last year Ceop intelligence reports led to 334 people being arrested.Jon Stoddart, the Association of Chief Police Officers's lead officer for homicide supported Gamble's call for Facebook to adopt the button. Facebook said it has yet to see any evidence that the Ceop reporting mechanism helps tackle the problem. A spokeswoman insisted the site was "one of the safest" places on the web.Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, also called on Facebook to fix the "glaring failure" to include the Ceop button.Alan Johnson, the home secretary, said the government was looking at ways to alert authorities when convicted sex offenders were online."What our people in the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (Ceop) agency do is go online themselves to try and lure in these people," he said."Whether we can get the technology to flag up when they're [sex offenders] online is something we need to look at."Merseyside police, who should have been monitoring Chapman, today referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The force acted after revelations that it waited nine months before issuing a national wanted alert for Chapman, after realising last year that he had vanished from his home.There was more controversy for Facebook today when a 27-year-old man, David Calvert, was wrongly identified as Jon Venables on Facebook, and some 2,370 people joined a group to discuss the "new identity" of one of the Bulger killers.Calvert, originally from Liverpool, was the subject of similarly false rumours five years ago and has publicly described the hatred directed towards him, and fears for his family's safety.
