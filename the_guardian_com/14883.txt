One of the killers of toddler James Bulger has had his request for parole rejected after a court hearing.The three members of the parole board – headed by a judge – had to decide whether Jon Venables still posed a risk to the public and it looked at the offence he had committed that led to his recall to prison, his offending history and his progress in jail.The decision was announced on Twitter by James's mother, Denise Fergus, who did not attend the parole hearing, but made a statement to the Parole Board in writing. Her tweet read:"good news all just heard venables is NOT getting released xxx"A number of reports from psychologists, probation officers and prison officers would have been considered along with the view of the secretary of state during the hearing at Leeds crown court.Venables, 28, was released from secure detention with a new identity in 2001, along with Thompson, after they had served eight years for murder. But he was jailed for two years last July after pleading guilty to downloading child pornography.The board also heard James's father, Ralph, describe the "daily nightmare" of life since his son's murder.Speaking outside Liverpool crown court on Friday, where Bulger had given evidence via videolink, his solicitor, Robin Makin, said: "It's a daily nightmare for all of them. It still is. Things have not really got better."He said his client had been forced to re-live the details of the murder, including the torture and sexual abuse which James suffered at the hands of his killers.A spokesman for the Parole Board said: "The Parole Board has now completed its review of the continued detention of Jon Venables in order to make recommendations to the secretary of state as to his suitability for a move to open prison conditions or direct his release."A three-member panel of the board, chaired by a judge, held an oral hearing to review the case and come to a decision."That decision has been communicated to the two parties to the proceedings – the prisoner, the secretary of state and also, via the secretary of state, to the families of the victim in this case."He went on: "It is the policy of the board not to comment on or confirm its decisions or reasons in individual cases."Such information constitutes personal data within the definition of the Data Protection Act 1998 and its disclosure to unauthorised persons would contravene one or more of the data protection principles."It is the duty of the secretary of state to notify appropriate authorities who may have a role in supervising an offender in the community of the outcome of the Parole Board hearing."Venables and Robert Thompson were 10 when they abducted James.The pair walked the toddler several miles to a railway line in Walton, Liverpool, where they tortured and killed him.They were convicted of murder and served eight years in secure accommodation before being freed and issued with secret new identities.It was also revealed that Venables had sex with a woman carer at the secure unit where he was held as a teenager after James's murder.Speaking on Monday, Robin Makin also said the authorities had shown an "inability to cope" with putting Venables back into society in an area adjacent to Merseyside.The solicitor said: "It was crass and stupid. It was never going to work. Some of these concerns were raised 10 years ago."He added: "The problem as we see it is this: the authorities, because of their liberal agenda, don't really want to see Jon Venables for the person that he actually is."He said not enough attention had been paid to the sexual element of the murder and that previous reports were "fundamentally flawed".Makin likened Venables to a half bottle of "rotten wine"."The authorities just don't want to see what is there — the sexual element, how that has undoubtedly scarred Jon Venables all his life and came to manifest itself later on."They don't want to see the rotting bit. They just look through the glass at the top and don't deal with it and that's not the way to deal with things."Fergus, who did not attend Friday's hearing, made a statement to the Parole Board in writing.
