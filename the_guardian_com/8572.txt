A man has been arrested after a 10-hour armed siege at a snooker hall in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.Armed police surrounded the Spot On snooker club in the centre of Hucknall at 2.20pm on Thursday following reports that a man inside had a gun.Specialist officers negotiated with him throughout the afternoon and evening, and at 12.40am on Friday armed officers entered the premises and made an arrest.A 20-year-old was detained on suspicion of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and was being questioned in custody, Nottinghamshire police said.Two women hiding in the building during the stand-off were guided to safety by police at about 8.40pm. They were distressed by their ordeal but uninjured.The siege began when police were called to reports that a man inside the snooker hall was acting suspiciously. As the situation developed dozens of officers, including police armed with sub-machine guns and backed by specialist dog teams, set up a cordon around the venue, in Vine Terrace just off High Street. Nearby businesses were told to lock their doors and keep people inside, and children and staff were evacuated from nearby Beardall Street primary school. As the situation developed through the afternoon paramedics wearing green body armour and helmets arrived at the scene while black-uniformed armed police watched the snooker hall. A man answering the snooker club’s telephone told the Press Association: “It don’t have nothing to do with you, does it? There’s nothing to say so you can stop ringing the phone.” After the incident Nottinghamshire police said Vine Terrace and High Street would be reopened and residents allowed to return home, while a cordon would remain at the snooker hall while officers examined the scene.
