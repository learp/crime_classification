The killer of a 15-year-old schoolgirl did a Google search for “lime pit” hours after dumping her body in a hedgerow, a court has heard.Stephen Beadman is also alleged to have accessed a betting website and watched a TV show on a computer found at his home shortly after he raped and murdered Kayleigh Haywood in November last year.A jury has heard that Beadman, a landscape gardener, told detectives he “switched” and attacked Kayleigh with a brick near Ibstock, Leicestershire, after drinking shots of vodka mixed with rum.The 29-year-old has pleaded guilty to murder and rape but denies holding Kayleigh prisoner at the home of his neighbour Luke Harlow between around 9pm on Saturday 14 November and 3am on Sunday 15 November last year.On the seventh day of a trial at Nottingham crown court, DC Andrew Spence said analysis of a computer found at Beadman’s address showed it had been used between 11.45am and 5.40pm on 15 November.Spence said Beadman was seen at around 11.05am walking back towards his home from the area where Kayleigh’s body was found.The officer told the court that at 11.45am Beadman’s computer accessed a website called Putlocker, an online video site, and a minute later was used to visit a gambling firm’s webpage.Answering questions from Crown QC Miranda Moore, Spence said it was possible that a TV show was running in the background on the computer when a Google search for the term “lime pit” was carried out at 11.54am.Further use of the computer before Beadman’s arrest in the early hours of 16 November saw it access Harlow’s Facebook profile and that of Kayleigh, the court heard.Harlow also denies the false imprisonment of Kayleigh, who was seen being pinned to the ground by Beadman on a footpath in Ibstock in the early hours of 15 November.The prosecution alleges that Kayleigh was held captive against her will inside Harlow’s house after being groomed on Facebook.The trial continues.
