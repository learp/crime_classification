A suspected burglar perched in a tree overhanging a railway line for several hours caused major disruption for morning commuters.The man climbed the tree near Charlton station in south-east London in the early hours of Wednesday and refused to come down throughout the morning rush hour. He had been chased by police after an attempted burglary at a nearby retail park shortly before 2am, in a pursuit involving a Metropolitan police helicopter.British Transport Police sent specialist officers to try to persuade him to come down, but rail operator Southeastern was forced to close the track.A BTP spokesman said: "Our officers were called to a trespass incident near Charlton station at 2am on Wednesday 13 August, after reports of a man on the tracks. Colleagues from the Metropolitan police service and London ambulance service are also in attendance. The man is currently still on the scene, and specialist officers are talking to him in order to resolve the situation."Southeastern said that the tree overhangs the London-bound track and so it was not safe to run services while the man refused to come down, although trains leaving London were able to run normally after an initial closure.London-bound services were diverted or delayed, and tickets were accepted on the tube and buses.
