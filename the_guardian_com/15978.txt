Three detectives are to face disciplinary action over their investigation into how a man died shortly after being restrained by police, the independent Police Complaints Authority said yesterday.Roger Sylvester, 30, died eight days after an incident outside his home in Tottenham, north London, in January 1999. A detective superintendent and two detective sergeants who were involved in the initial inquiry into Mr Sylvester's detention and subsequent death are now to face a total of seven disciplinary charges, the PCA said. The charges come after complaints by Mr Sylvester's family about the conduct of officers from the Metropolitan police's complaints investigation bureau. A spokesman for the authority said: "The charges relate to alleged neglect in that investigation and were recommended by Essex police who, under the supervision of the independent Police Complaints Authority, conducted an investigation into the death of Roger Sylvester. A disciplinary hearing will take place on a date to be arranged." Mr Sylvester was arrested after he was reported to be naked and causing a disturbance by banging aggressively on a door. It later emerged he was banging on his own door. Officers took him, still naked but handcuffed, to hospital but he collapsed into a coma while police were restraining him in a hospital room. An inquest into his death is due to be held in October. The authority said it would not make a decision on whether there were any disciplinary issues against eight officers who were involved in Mr Sylvester's detention until after the inquest.
