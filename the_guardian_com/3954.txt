A 15-year-old babysitter was today convicted of the murder of a toddler in an assault which left the victim with 68 injuries.Demi Leigh Mahon was beaten, bitten and had her hair sheared off by Karl McCluney. He was looking after the two-year-old for 90 minutes last July while her mother went to pick up a child benefit cheque and buy a birthday card.Manchester crown court heard that McCluney took the toddler to a park before attacking her at a flat in Eccles, Greater Manchester.He had admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but denied murder. The jury rejected his claim and convicted him of the latter.  Karl McCluney, 15. Photograph: Greater Manchester Police/PAThe attack on Demi was so ferocious, the court heard, that she was left brain-damaged after being punched repeatedly in the face.Dr Naomi Carter, a pathologist, told the court that part of the child's scalp was sheared off, most likely as a result of it coming into contact with a hard surface. Carter said it was neither "reasonable or credible" that the vast majority of the injuries were sustained accidentally.After the assault, McCluney watched television and didn't call for help as the child lay unconscious on a mattress. Her mother, Ann Marie McDonald, screamed at him on returning home and asked why he hadn't called an ambulance. He claimed: "I haven't done nothing."He then went on to attempt to cover up responsibility for the crime by telling a series of lies about the toddler's injuries, claiming she had hit her head on an ashtray, or a radiator, or fallen over in a park.The court was told that while being held in a secure residential unit after his arrest McCluney had told a member of staff: "I'm not proud of what I've done and everyone will think I'm a monster. But no one can ever punish me as much as I punish myself."McDonald said: "Demi was my only daughter and my princess and I love her more than anything in the world."I always tried my best and did everything I could for her but feel that sometimes I didn't get the help and support I needed."Following McCluney's conviction the judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, lifted the reporting restrictions on the defendant's identity.
