One of the UK's most wanted men has been arrested in Birmingham after a hijacking in which a mother was dragged from her car, which then sped off with her two young children still inside.The suspect, Cedric Brown, was apprehended after the car was stopped a mile away by West Midlands police officers responding to reports of a burglary.Brown, 44, was wanted for questioning about attempted murder and aggravated burglary at a brutal break-in in Bristol two years ago. The attack, in which a husband and wife were tied up and slashed with a knife in an attempt to force them to reveal the whereabouts of their valuables, was featured on BBC TV's Crimewatch.West Midlands police said the mother of the two children, a one-year-old boy and a two-year-old girl, was pulled from her Ford Focus after police arrived at Slade Road, Erdington, where the burglary had been reported. Sergeant Nicholas Barnes said: "Several police vehicles were in pursuit and the man abandoned the Ford Focus in South Grove where he was arrested by officers who then spotted the toddlers."Thankfully, neither of them was hurt and we quickly reunited them with their mum, who naturally was extremely relieved. Officers responded to calls of the burglary within minutes. The suspects simply didn't have enough time to get away from the location before they were swamped by police."Two other men, aged 18 and 19, from Birmingham, were arrested in an alleyway near the scene and were being questioned about the burglary. Brown, known as 'Skipper' and originally from Birmingham, is being questioned about the burglary and the Bristol attack.He is thought to have been in hiding in Birmingham since the incident at a farmhouse in Goose Green near Warmley in November 2010 when a 49-year-old man was slashed in the face, head and stomach while his wife was forced to watch. Brown was suspected of being one of two intruders who were after money but fled, eluding a search by police involving a helicopter.Det Insp Jill Kells of Avon and Somerset police said at the time: "This was a very serious assault and it's important we find the men responsible quickly. It was obviously terrifying for the victims."
