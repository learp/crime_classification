The government is considering plans to close scores of alleyways that local authorities believe have become havens for burglars and drug dealers.Fourteen councils have applied to the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for powers to shut off alleyways in a total of 74 areas identified as crime hotspots.Alun Michael, minister for rural affairs and urban quality of life, said: "Until now the inflexibility of the rights of way legislation has prevented residents from doing anything about alleyways that give criminals access to the backs of residential properties and an easy means of escape."The first batch of applications for closures included alleys in 25 areas of Manchester, 15 areas in Rotherham, 13 in Leeds and 11 in Bradford.Rights of way campaigners have warned the process could lead to the unwarranted closure of footpaths but the government said it would focus on back alleys, including those on housing estates, which have become a haven for robbers, burglars, arsonists and drug dealers. Rights of way would only be targeted where they were causing real problems, the government added, because of use by criminals and where other methods of tackling crime had failed.Many of these would be redundant alleyways created in the past to help people remove household waste before the advent of modern refuse collection, Mr Michael explained.Councils would have to invite and take into account any objections from local people before proposals to close a right of way could be implemented.Mr Michael added: "It is clear from the evidence that local authorities have included in their applications that there is widespread support from local residents and neighbourhood groups who are fed up with the repeated burglary, assault, arson, drug dealing and the general antisocial behaviour that is associated with some alleyways. "Residents complain of falling house prices and difficulty selling their homes because they are close to a problem alleyway."
