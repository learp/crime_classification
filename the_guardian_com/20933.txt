Motorists convicted of causing death by dangerous or careless driving may face tough penalties under new guidelines published today for England and Wales.Judges are being advised to impose stricter sentences of up to seven years on people who read or write text messages on a mobile phone while driving and cause deaths, according to guidance from the sentencing guidelines council (SGC).Drivers could find themselves locked up for a maximum of 14 years if they commit a serious case where drink, drugs or persistent bad driving are factors.A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: "Ensuring drivers who cause death on our roads through bad driving are suitably punished is essential if justice is to be done and people are to maintain their support for the criminal justice system."That's why the government welcomes the firm guidelines published by the independent sentencing guidelines council today."He added: "Justice ministers want to see two new offences of causing death by careless driving and causing death by driving while unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured, introduced at the earliest opportunity and will make an announcement later today."The SGC said the guidelines meant that judges and magistrates were given a "clear message" that driving offences that result in death were serious offences and should receive appropriate sentences. Cases where drivers showed "prolonged, persistent and deliberate" bad driving should receive lengthy jail terms, it said.The use of mobile phones should also be treated "robustly" the SGC said, with advice that if an offender is distracted by a handheld mobile phone when the offence is committed it should be treated as "particularly" serious.
