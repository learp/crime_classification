A fall in the underlying crime rate in London since the last mayoral election has been masked by a spike in street robberies in 2005 and the recent high-profile spate of gun and knife crime murders.The political debate over crime in London is skewed by the fact that although the drop in crime has been sustained - as it has in the rest of the country - the fear of crime, especially of violent crime, is far higher than in the rest of the country. The British Crime Survey figures show that 28% of Londoners say they are very worried about violent crime compared with a national average of 17%.At first sight the highly publicised deaths of young teenagers in recent knife and gun attacks, and a historic concern about mugging would seem the obvious explanation for this greater anxiety about violent crime.Manchester and Liverpool actually suffer a higher rate of gun and knife crime but they don't provoke such high levels of fear across the whole community.This paradox means that much political debate in London over crime is obscured in a war of competing statistics in which each party cleaves to the crime figures that best serve their case.So Ken Livingstone highlights the 6% fall in crime recorded by the police last year and the fact that is the fifth successive year in which police-recorded crime has fallen across the country.The Liberal Democrat challenger, former police officer Brian Paddick, prefers the verdict of the British Crime Survey, which is based on people's experience of crime, which shows that the capital's crime rate has remained broadly stable since 2005/06.This is normally regarded as more reliable but its value is limited in this case as a London breakdown of the BCS has only been available for the past two years. The national BCS survey has also shown a sustained fall in the longer term.The Conservatives' Boris Johnson unsurprisingly focuses on the disturbing figures about fear of violent crime and anti-social behaviour in London - it is out of control.This is a debate that can only go round and round in circles and end up fuelling that fear of crime that all the candidates want to defuse.In terms of practical solutions, Livingstone's promise of 1,000 extra officers looks distinctly old-fashioned in the wake of the Flanagan report's push for smarter use of officers rather than more of them.Paddick's promise to cut crime by a further 20% over the next four years looks unrealistic, while Boris has only so far proposed an uncontroversial package of more police on the streets, hand-held scanners, and "live" CCTV on buses that few would argue with. So far none of the candidates have addressed one of the main drivers of repeat crime in London â€“ the capital's severely overcrowded prisons, several of which would make a modern-day Charles Dickens blanch.
