Prisoners should receive more cash help on leaving jail as part of a national strategy to cut re-offending, according to the social exclusion unit (SEU).An SEU report published today recommends increasing the discharge grants paid to released prisoners and enabling more to claim housing benefit while inside jail to prevent them from becoming homeless.But it does not specify the amount of extra cash ex-prisoners should get, although earlier drafts showed that the government planned to give them £100 and pay their rent for six months.The report, Reducing Re-offending by Ex-prisoners, reveals that 58% of criminals re-offend after being convicted, committing about a million crimes every year in England and Wales with an annual cost of £1bn.Young male prisoners are the worst re-offenders with 72% committing further offences.The SEU recommends a range of rehabilitative programmes and support schemes to break the revolving door of re-offending, and identifies the root causes as homelessness, unemployment, drug abuse and mental illness.These include a "going straight" contract that sets out what is expected of prisoners inside and outside of jail. The scheme will be piloted by 18-20 year olds and will mean they have a rehabilitation package tailored to their individual needs.Payments from prison wages will go into a "reparation fund" for the victims of crime and help fund rehabilitation services for criminals.Prisoners should also get more advice on getting benefits, housing and jobs while incarcerated, the SEU recommends. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said prisoners were being presented with a contract."We offer them the support they need to get over the problems that contribute to crime. In return they have to take responsibility for their actions and work on their problems."Barbara Roche, minister for state at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, said: "This provides some incentives for people to learn a trade, get some education, take anger management classes - everything they need to go straight after prison. "If you don't do this, you can have things taken away. It's a very important carrot and stick approach." The report found rehabilitation services for prisoners were "piecemeal".Homeless ex-prisoners are six times more likely to reoffend than those with housing but the SEU found that a third of inmates lost their homes while inside prison.Only half of medium secure prisons have a drug treatment programme despite a third of crime related to theft being linked to heroin or cocaine addiction.Paul Cavadino, chief executive of the crime reduction charity Nacro, said the report was "a devastating critique of the way that failure to rehabilitate prisoners fuels high crime rates."At present, arrangements to resettle ex-prisoners are patchy, under-funded, and for many short-term prisoners non-existent. A national rehabilitation strategy is badly needed to ensure that resettlement arrangements are consistent, well planned and properly resourced."Home Office minister Lord Falconer said the department was drawing up an action plan in response to the SEU report, and would shortly publish a white paper to ensure prison both punished and rehabilitated offenders.
