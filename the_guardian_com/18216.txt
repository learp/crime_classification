A Dido and Eminen fan who made his neighbours' lives hell by playing their hit songs at top volume at all times of the day and night has been banned from owning a stereo, radio or television.An anti-social behaviour order has also been served on the 26-year-old West Lothian man who repeatedly played the Band Aid single. Both cases are in a dossier published by Asbo Concern, a new penal reform group calling for a full public review of the way such orders are used. The group, which combines the Howard League for Penal Reform, Liberty and Napo, the probation officers' union, said there had been an explosion in the use of Asbos, with 2,300 made since November 2003. Its dossier of 64 cases cites several instances where the courts issued Asbos against professional advice. One case involved a 20-year-old prolific shoplifter, who, against advice, was given a three-year order banning entry to all shops, stores and retail outlets in Devon and Cornwall. He was eventually jailed for 15 months after three breaches. Napo's Harry Fletcher said: "There is great concern people are being jailed following the breach of an Asbo where the original offence is non-imprisonable, and that Asbos are being used where people have mental health problems." He said some local authorities were using the orders to clear sink estates of problem families and individuals, instead of dealing with the wider environmental problems. The Tory leader, Michael Howard, this week pledged measures such as cuts in housing benefit, confiscation of driving licences, and community work as an alternative to prison for breaching Asbos. New Home Office data shows that only 7% were jailed for solely breaching an Asbo, and 93% of those under an order and then jailed were imprisoned for other offences. A Commons report on Tuesday said the government's strategy had got the balance about right between prevention and enforcement.
