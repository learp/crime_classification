The police marksman who fatally shot Mark Duggan got it wrong when he claimed the first shot struck the suspect's chest, an inquest was told.A pathologist contradicted crucial evidence from the armed police officer, known only as V53, on the order of the bullets that killed Duggan in 2011.Professor Derrick Pounder, who carried out a postmortem on Duggan, told jurors that the 29-year-old was shot first in his right bicep before a second round hit his chest – not the other way round as the police marksman had claimed.The evidence on the order of the shots is crucial to the inquest into Duggan's death, which sparked the worst riots in modern history across England following the incident in Tottenham, north east London, in August 2011.Jurors are being asked to decide whether Duggan was unlawfully killed and they may conclude that a shot to the chest, if it came after a shot to the arm, was not absolutely necessary."My conclusion is that the first shot was to the arm, the non-fatal shot, and the second was to the chest, the fatal shot," said Pounder.Explaining why he believes Duggan was shot first in the arm, Pounder said: "The shot to the arm is a shot which occurred when he was more or less upright. He may be leaning forward slightly but he wasn't. The other shot occurred when he was significantly bent forward."He later told jurors it would have been impossible for the bullet to follow a 46-degree trajectory inside Duggan's body if he had been standing "more or less upright", as V53 told the inquest last month.Asked why he believed his evidence contradicted that of the marksman, Pounder said: "I take the view he simply got it wrong."A second expert, Professor Jonathan Clasper, also had doubts over why a handgun – which police believe was being carried by Duggan – was recovered 7.3 metres away over a fence following the shooting.The military surgeon, who was commissioned by the Independent Police Complaints Watchdog to examine the incident, said it was "very unlikely" Duggan would have hurled the gun that far either voluntarily or involuntarily during or after being shot.Michael Mansfield QC, for the Duggan family, told jurors that a number of witnesses very close to the shooting had not claimed to see a gun leave the suspect's hands and fly through the air. He added: "We're dealing with someone who is in the process of stumbling forward and collapsing and he continues to do. The process is one of continuous and rapid collapse."Asked whether he believed Duggan was physically able to throw the gun after sustaining the two gunshot wounds, Pounder said it was extremely unlikely. "The weapon is sufficiently heavy that it would require considerable muscular effort to throw it any distance and imposed a great deal of pain on someone with a biceps wound," he added.The marksman, V53, told the inquest last month that he had shot Duggan a second time because the first caused the suspect to flinch, meaning the gun alleged to have been in his right hand was now pointing in his direction. Pounder said he did not believe it was likely that Duggan was able to raise his arm.Earlier the jury heard that the bullet that killed Duggan, a 9mm hollow-point round, was estimated to have travelled at 870mph before plunging 30cm down through his chest from an inch above his right nipple.The bullets had only been authorised for police use shortly before the shooting, according to Mansfield, who told jurors they are "not even in use by all army units" in the UK.The shot to the chest struck Duggan in the aorta, piercing both lungs before exiting his body through his back. Pounder, who carried out the autopsy on his body, said the impact of the shot would have caused Duggan to bend forward struggling to breathe. "Effectively they [victims] can't breathe. It is more like being suffocated than being winded. You can't get air into your lungs," he told jurors.The inquest continues next week.
