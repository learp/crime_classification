The iPod explosion could be behind a 5% increase in recorded robberies, police chiefs suggested yesterday, as the Home Office released figures showing that overall levels of crime remain stable.Ian Johnston, chief constable of the British transport police and spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said the rise was "a lot to do with the products that are available to be stolen these days. The mobile phone explosion is continuing. The iPod explosion is continuing. All of these gadgets that people carry around with them are very attractive to robbers, so that puts the opportunities up. We've obviously got to respond to that in a very positive way."Home Office figures show a 2% fall in recorded crime between April and June 2006, when compared with the same quarter last year. At the same time, the annual British crime survey - which records people's personal experience of crime - showed a 2% increase."The risk of being a victim of crime remains at its lowest for a quarter of a century," Mr Johnston said.But robbery rose by 5%, or 1,100, compared to the same three months last year, and the total of violent crime was slightly up. Recorded drug offences increased by 16%, explained by officials as the result of a crackdown on cannabis possession after police restored a more hardline approach.Tony McNulty, the Home Office minister, said the increases in robbery was "much slower than in recent quarters" - in figures to March they were up by 12%. But he recognised "that more work needs to be done to reverse this trend".Robbery figures began to rise in 2005, at the end of the prime minister's short-lived initiative to target street crime in the worst areas.The British crime survey shows 8.4m fewer crimes were being committed than in 1995.But Paul Cavadino, chief executive of Nacro, the crime reduction charity, said the figures "underline the fact that locking up record numbers of prisoners is no panacea for street robbery or other violent crimes".David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said: "These shocking statistics show the towns and communities of Britain continue to be blighted by increasing violent crime and robbery as a result of Labour's failing policies on law and order. Instead of being on the streets fighting crime, our police are stuck behind their desks under an ever-increasing burden of Labour red tape."The crime survey shows a rise in the numbers of people worried about drunkenness and rowdiness, with one in 10 people saying they had considered moving.Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said the findings raised serious doubts about Tony Blair's antisocial behaviour policy. "Surely rising public concern shows that the government's twin-track approach of demonising young people and carpeting the country with Asbos - up to 60% of which are then breached - has reached its limit."The crime survey shows a narrow majority of those interviewed, 51%, believe the police in their area did an excellent or good job, up three percentage points on the previous year.Recorded statistics for firearms offences show an 8% drop in the 12 months to June 2006, including a 20% drop in fatal injuries.
