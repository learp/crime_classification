A lawyer who repeatedly stabbed his unfaithful wife to death escaped conviction for murder yesterday but was jailed for five years for manslaughter.A jury at Manchester crown court took two hours to convict Christopher Lumsden, 52, of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Lumsden repeatedly stabbed Alison Lumsden, 53, in the back, neck and face on March 16 2005. She died on the bedroom floor of their luxury home in Bowdon, Cheshire.Pathologist Charles Wilson said Mrs Lumsden's injuries were so severe he was unable to tell how many times the 12cm kitchen knife had been plunged into her body.Lumsden admitted killing his wife, but denied murder, claiming he was suffering an "abnormality of mind" at the time of the tragedy.The court heard that five days before her death Mrs Lumsden told her husband she was having an affair with a family friend, Roger Flint, and that she wanted a divorce. Lumsden told the court he had also been devastated by his mother's death a month before the stabbing, and was struggling to come to terms with a rare and incurable form of muscular dystrophy. His illness curtailed his active lifestyle, and his reluctance to attend social and sporting events increased the rift with his wife.Lumsden will serve at least half the sentence. He has spent 11 months on remand, so is set for release in 19 months.
