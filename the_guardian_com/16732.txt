Primrose Shipman was described by Dame Janet Smith as an honest and straightforward witness.She was 17 and five months pregnant when she married Shipman on November 5 1966. She bore him four children and stayed with him despite his conviction for drug abuse. She helped out in the surgery in Market Street, Hyde, and stuck by him when the police began asking awkward questions and exhuming bodies in 1998. She left the semi she shared with Shipman in Mottram-in-Longdendale, Greater Manchester, and has now settled in a cottage in Wetherby, north Yorkshire. She visits Shipman regularly in Frankland prison, County Durham. Dame Janet said Mrs Shipman gave up documents which were relevant to the case. "They have been of great assistance to the inquiry and have helped me to reach decisions on a number of individual deaths where, without them, I would have been unable to do so." Before coming to give evidence in public, which she initially resisted, Mrs Shipman was given an undertaking by the attorney general that no statement she gave would be used in evidence against herself or her husband.
