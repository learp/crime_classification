Police have released images of a Durham woman who had a pen embedded in her arm after an attack on a coach.Cynthia Bell, 66, was helping at her husband's coach firm when a man got on one vehicle and refused to leave. The man tried to tamper with the controls around by the driver's seat and as she tried to stop him, he grabbed a pen from the dashboard and stabbed her in the arm with it before running off.The incident happened in the coach park in Seasiders Way in Blackpool at about 5pm on 24 August.DS Mark Dickinson, from Lancashire police, said: "As you can see from Mrs Bell's photograph, significant force must have been used by the offender who stabbed her. She was lucky to have escaped without serious blood loss or any nerve damage."We are pursuing a number of lines of inquiry, including CCTV and forensic opportunities."I am particularly keen to identify and speak with two young women who were with the offender and I would ask them, or anyone who recognises them from their descriptions, to contact me as soon as possible."The offender is described as a white male in his late teens or early 20s, 1.82cm (6ft) and of stocky build, with short dark hair.He was with two young white women. The first was wearing a pink top with a floral pattern, and had a pram or pushchair. She walked with a limp.The second woman had blonde hair and was wearing a cream jumper. She had a tattoo on the right side of her lower stomach on display.Anyone with information can contact either PC 6857 Danny Morris or DS 3370 Mark Dickinson on 101, quoting log number 0979 of 24 August 2014.Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or online at Crimestoppers-uk.org.
