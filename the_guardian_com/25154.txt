Lawyers in their 30s could become part-time judges and work their way up to the high court and beyond, under government plans to reform the judicial appointments system.Lord Falconer, the constitutional affairs secretary, told MPs yesterday that the judiciary of England and Wales must become much more diverse in terms of "gender, ethnic mix and experience mix". Expanding for the first time on how the proposed new judicial appointments commission might diversify the judiciary, he said it would make selection of judges more open and transparent, which should make a wide range of candidates more willing to apply. At present, the lord chancellor appoints judges after taking soundings from senior judges and leading legal figures, producing a judiciary which is overwhelmingly white, male and over 50. Lord Falconer told the Commons select committee on the Lord Chancellor's department that Britain has no woman judge in its highest court, the House of Lords - soon to become the supreme court - nor has it ever had one. "I wonder how many countries that can be said about," he added. Encouraging young part-timers could mean women lawyers working for a time in private practice, then combining working as a part-time judge with looking after a family. This opens the prospect that England and Wales could move closer to the career judiciary of continental Europe, instead of being drawn from older lawyers who have spent most of their careers in legal practice.
