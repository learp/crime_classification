New laws that could see careless drivers who kill jailed for up to five years rather than receiving a fine will come into force on Monday.Causing a death while driving using a mobile phone, applying make up or eating and drinking can be taken into account by the court during sentencing. Uninsured, disqualified or unlicensed drivers who kill on the road also face a jail term of up to two years.The offences are part of the 2006 Road Safety Act and are designed to plug gaps which allows some drivers to walk away with a maximum fine of £5,000 and penalty points on their licence regardless of whether they have killed someone.In 1996 Carol Pattinson, 32, was killed when a lorry smashed into the car she was travelling in. Her parents led a campaign warning of the danger of using mobile phones while driving. The lorry driver was fined £250 after admitting careless driving and given six penalty points.Jim Fitzpatrick, road safety minister, said: "The introduction of these new offences is the latest step to tackle bad driving. Where carelessness causes a death it is right that the driver should face tough penalties." The Ministry of Justice estimates around 155 convictions will result in a jail term under the guidelines.Cathy Keeler, the deputy chief executive for the road safety charity Brake, said: "The standards between what is deemed dangerous driving and careless aren't well defined." A spokeswoman for RoadPeace said there was no guarantee a jail term would be imposed.
