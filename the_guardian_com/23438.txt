Staff at Lothian and Borders police are to face disciplinary action for abuse of the internet.Six civilian staff and 41 officers from across the force were caught in actions ranging from forwarding smutty jokes to viewing mild pornography. One civilian is reported to have ordered fetish clothing from a transvestism website. The investigation began from the force's Fettes headquarters in Edinburgh, and has been dubbed "Fetishgate" by the Daily Record newspaper. It is understood that none of the breaches, or sites visited, can be regarded as criminal, and nobody is expected to be sacked. The officers have not been suspended, but face misconduct proceedings and possible reprimands. "We can confirm 41 officers and six support staff have been reported for misusing the computer system," a spokeswoman for Lothian and Borders said. A number of officers were to be offered counselling over the the material they had been logging onto, the spokeswoman said. "The force has a strict policy on internet use and emails. In order to maintain the integrity of the system and protect staff from offensive images, we carry out regular checks." The misuse came to light in a check last September, which led to a full IT review.
