Home Office ministers tonight defended changes to legislation to criminalise men who pay for sex with women who are forced into prostitution.Women's groups claimed that Jacqui Smith, the home Â­secretary, had "backtracked" by narrowing the wording of the new offence so it covers women "subjected to force, deception or threats" rather than anyone "controlled for gain by a third party".The women's charity, Eaves, which runs the Poppy project, which helps women trafficked into Britain for sexual exploitation, says it is disappointed by a "backward move" that would fail to protect exploited British women who are not covered by trafficking legislation.Helen Atkins, of Eaves, said the revised wording was actually narrower than that used in the international trafficking definition that required "fraud, force or coercion". She added: "The home secretary's amendment doesn't cover the exploitation of vulnerability which commonly occurs in cases of grooming of women and girls into prostitution and the psychological control that often comes with it."But the Home Office spokeswoman said it did not believe it would make the offence too narrow: "We share the aims of the Poppy project ensuring that all those involved in prostitution through exploitation are protected by this offence. Our amendments will ensure that they are and that the offence is much clearer, allowing it to operate more effectively to bring to justice those who exploit vulnerable women."Ministers said they were responding to concerns raised by Liberal Democrats and Conservatives that the term "controlled for gain" could apply in wider circumstances than the new offence was aimed to cover.Ministers want to deter sex buyers from paying for sex with those who have been trafficked or otherwise forced or coerced to provide sexual services. The new wording would make it a crime to pay for sex with someone who has been subject to "force, deception or threats of a kind likely to induce or encourage" the provision of a sexual service.
