A man whose trussed-up body was found at the foot of Beachy Head was stabbed to death elsewhere before being thrown over the cliffs, police said yesterday.Detectives said it was possible the body was in a blue plastic barrel, found nearby, when it was hurled over the 180m (600ft) high cliffs. Forensic scientists were examining the barrel, along with tyre tracks which showed that a car had driven from the beauty spot's car park to the cliff edge. The body was one of three spotted by a routine police helicopter patrol on Friday. When it was recovered on Saturday from the base of the cliffs near Eastbourne, police found the man had suffered multiple stab wounds to his head and body. His hands and feet had been bound with tape and a plastic bag had been placed on his head. Detective Chief Inspector Tony O'Donnell, who is leading the inquiry, said yesterday: "We are sure that the murder happened away from the scene." He said he believed the man had been murdered in the "latter part" of last week. There has been speculation that the man may have been tortured before he was killed. Mr O'Donnell added: "I think the fact he was bound may have been a way of transporting him rather than him being tortured. We are working on the theory he was murdered elsewhere and thrown off the cliffs, possibly in the barrel, possibly not. "We will be doing a number of things to identify him such as using DNA, looking at missing person records, tracing his clothes and using dental records. We are also examining the base of the cliffs and the top for possible evidence." The murdered man was in his early 30s, around 173cm (5ft 8in) tall and had a full "afro" hairstyle and black beard. The murder is not being linked to two other bodies found at Beachy Head as they showed different stages of decomposition.
