People accused of rape would remain anonymous until they were convicted under a new policy approved by the Liberal Democrats last night.Activists argued that the stigma attached to the crime meant that defendants as well as victims should not be named.Geoff Payne, the vice chair of the party's federal policy committee, said that even acquittal did not remove the taint of a rape charge because people often believed there was no smoke without fire."Let's not have trial by media. Let's not have trial by lynch mob - if a jury decide someone is guilty let's name them; if not, let them get on with their life," he told activists.But Ann Morrison, a magistrate and activist, warned that the measure could lower prosecution and conviction rates by stopping witnesses from coming forwards.The conference also passed measures to decrease the crime rate through public campaigns to change attitudes to rape and increase the conviction rate through the introduction of specially trained prosecutors and an increase in sexual assault referral centres.In a separate debate, the Liberal Democrat leadership last night won a rare victory in its attempts to increase the number of female and ethnic minority MPs through positive action.Activists passed a motion to prioritise campaigning in seats which have picked women or disabled, black or ethnic minority candidates.The target list has previously been based purely on how winnable the constituencies were considered.Previous attempts to introduce positive action - such as all-women shortlists in target seats, or a quota for black or minority ethnic candidates on shortlists in diverse constituencies - had been rejected.The change will be reinforced by a new fighting fund unveiled yesterday by Sir Menzies Campbell, which will finance campaigning by women and ethnic minority candidates.Party officials denied it constituted a bribe to seats to select certain candidates, describing it as an incentive."This is a message for those people who support the Liberal Democrats - and for those who don't - who think we aren't serious about getting more women and ethnic minority MPs into parliament. We are," said Sir Menzies.The Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust has provided Â£200,000 to kickstart the fund.Proposing the motion yesterday, Simon Hughes, the party president, warned: "When we choose the top target seats in future, they cannot all be seats where we have white male candidates."Real and lasting diversity does not happen by accident. We either go forward or stand still - and if we stand still we will be overtaken."Despite a marked improvement in the number of women elected at the last election, only 9 out of 63 MPs are female.The party has no black or ethnic minority MPs at all, while Labour have 11 and the Tories two.Rabi Martins, a councillor from Watford, added: "There is no equal playing field at the moment. Good intentions do not get us anywhere."But Mike Simpson, chair of the Lib Dem south east region, warned: "Members should be focusing on the very best candidates - we should not be encouraging them to divert attention in the hope of a cash injection."What I see is not a reluctance to select women and ethnic minority candidates, but a shortage of such candidates."Another activist, Dave Smithson, argued: "We need to encourage them - not give them an unfair advantage."In reality, the party has already taken positive action surreptitiously.Senior Lib Dems admit privately that they poured extra resources into target seats with women candidates at the general election because of the desperate dearth of female MPs in the last parliament.
