Your features on overcrowded prisons (August 31) point to the number of offenders imprisoned for breaching community sentences. This highlights a double standard which runs through our sentencing structure. If community sentences fail, courts abandon community sentencing and jail the offender. Yet when prison sentences fail because ex-prisoners reoffend, courts do not abandon failed custodial sentencing. It is right to enforce community sentences, but further non-custodial punishments should be used if the original offence was judged not to deserve prison.Paul Cavadino Chief executive, NacroYour article exposes the consequences of the government's mish-mash approach to sentencing. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 changed the philosophy behind the release of prisoners. Previously, prisoners were entitled to "early release" in certain situations. It kept prison numbers down. Now a prisoner serves part of the sentence in custody and the remainder on licence in the community. Although it is recognised that short sentences serve no useful purpose, presumably the recall of prisoners for breach of licence (eg missing a probation appointment) has even less value. Yet we are at risk that much of the prison population will be comprised of those who have breached their licence rather than those sentenced for their original offence. Is this what Tony Blair meant when he talked about the Criminal Justice Act 2003 "putting the sense back into sentencing?"

He did not think about them when he was stealing, did he? As retailers increase prices to cover theft, we all pay for Mr Diston's thievery. Michael Greenwood Carnforth, Lancs
