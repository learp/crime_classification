The third man charged with murder is Lloyd Moore, 26, a portfolio administrator, of Epping, Essex."We are deeply disappointed that one of our officers has been charged in connection with this investigation," said Patrick Rice, commissioner of the City force."He has been suspended from duty and justice must now take its course. "The community can rest assured that we will continue to carry out a robust and thorough inquiry to ensure those responsible for Lee Cook's death are brought to justice." Mr Lowe and Mr Moore will appear at City of London magistrates court today. Mr Maynard was remanded in custody yesterday, until November 1.
