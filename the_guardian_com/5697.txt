Dissident republicans staged a bogus burglary to lure police into a gun attack in west Belfast on Thursday afternoon.Three police officers officers were badly shaken after coming under fire with six shots directed at them in the Dunmurry area of the city around 1pm.The Police Service of Northern Ireland said on Thursday that a patrol comprising of two policemen and a female officer were responding to reports of a break in at a house in Foxes Glen.The PSNI believe the original burglary report was false, and may have been an attempt to lure officers into the area.Local Sinn FÃ©in councillor Stephen Magennis described the attack as reckless.He said: "[The shots were] fired from a valley into a built up street. There's also a car here where a bullet went right through the window and came out the seat. It's actually on the ground at the minute, the bullet.""For me, it's attempted murder on police. I'm glad no one was hurt but very easily someone in this community, whether it was children or residents, could have been injured," he added.The attack is similar to the one carried out by the Continuity IRA in March 2009. Constable Stephen Carroll was shot dead after his patrol responded to reports of an attack on a house in a private estate in Craigavon, Co Armagh.
