9.32pm GMT21:32SummaryHere’s a summary of where we stand.MPs have voted by 464 votes to 38 - a majority of 426 - in favour of government regulations allowing Britain to opt back in to some EU police and criminal justice measures. The coalition exercised its right to opt out of around 110 measures en masse, but it is opting back into 35. The vote technically only covers 11 of these - and not the European arrest warrant (EAW) - but the government said it would treat the vote as a vote on all 35.John Bercow, the Commons speaker, has strongly criticised the government for not allowing MPs to have a specific vote on the EAW. It was breaking a promise given by David Cameron, Bercow said. People were “contemptuous” of conduct like this. (See 5.08pm.)Labour has forced the Commons to curtail the debate early. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, used a rare Commons procedure to force a vote on a proposal to put off the debate until a later date. She said ministers should allow a proper debate and vote tomorrow on all measures, including the EAW. Cooper’s motion was defeated. But, under Commons rules, that meant MPs went straight on to a vote on the main business, instead of carrying on the debate until 10pm. Cooper’s move caused some panic on the government benches, and David Cameron had to rush back from the Mansion House banquet, dressed in white tie, to vote.Cooper has accused Theresa May, the home secretary, and Michael Gove, the chief whip, of not allowing a vote on the EAW because they wanted to minimise the Tory revolt. At one point it was claimed up to 100 MPs might rebel over this. In the debate Cooper said: Isn’t the truth that they took [the EAW] out of the motion because the home secretary and the chief whip thought they were being clever. They took it out because they wanted to minimise the rebellion. They wanted to tell journalists that it was a vote on the European arrest warrant, but tell the backbenchers not to worry, because they were only voting on prisoner transfer arrangments instead. They wanted to pretend to parliament that it was a vote on package of 35 measures, and yet their MPs fend of Ukip in their constituencies by claiming that they never voted for the most controversial plans.But May said there was no vote on the EAW because parliament did not need to vote to allow the government to opt back into it. On the 11 measures, MPs did have to vote for them to be incorporated again into UK law, she said. It has been reported that Tory whips are blaming the Home Office for the decision not to allow a vote on a motion that could be amended.Labour and Tory figures have started to blame each other for the fact that the Commons has not had a proper debate on the EAW. (See 8.51pm.)Some 38 MPs have voted against the EU criminal justice measures. According to one account, 37 were Tories. Some of them were probably using their vote to signal their opposition to the EAW, while others may have been motivated by more widespread opposition to EU involvement in criminal justice matters.That’s all from me for tonight.Thanks for the comments.Updatedat 8.26am GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.05pm GMT21:05Cooper accuses May of handling the EAW debate 'dreadfully'Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has put out this statement following the vote.  Labour proposed to the government to have a vote on the European Arrest Warrant and the remaining EU measures tomorrow, which there is time for and which we would support. It was within the government’s power to put right the chaos and deception they have created, but they chose not to do so.  The House of Commons should be able to vote to endorse the European Arrest Warrant, putting it beyond legal challenge – which we know Eurosceptics have been planning. Despite being promised this vote, the Commons has been denied the chance to give overwhelming backing to this crucial crime fighting measure. The government must put that right at the earliest opportunity.Theresa May was very foolish not to listen to the strong support across the House both for the European Arrest Warrant and for the opportunity of a comprehensive vote. She has handled this dreadfully. It’s a complete mess.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.00pm GMT21:00And here is some Twitter comment from journalists.From ConservativeHome’s Paul GoodmanPaul Goodman (@PaulGoodmanCH)Tory Whips very clear that cause of today's palaver was Home Office desire not to have amendable motion - i.e: it's not our fault, Guv.November 10, 2014From Sky’s Faisal IslamFaisal Islam (@faisalislam)EAW story done now...

Expect a viscous blame game to follow. #EAWNovember 10, 2014And Isabel Hardman at Coffee House says Yvette Cooper and John Bercow have done most to annoy government ministers. Here’s an extract from her blog. Today has seen one of the best Commons performances that Yvette Cooper has given as Shadow Home Secretary. She managed to highlight the absence of the arrest warrant before the vote and exploited Speaker Bercow’s statement to the full. Then she showed cunning by introducing the motion that the question on the order paper asking MPs to vote on the measures was delayed.But the main catalyst was Speaker Bercow, who gave the statement saying this was not a vote on the warrant that so enraged Tory MPs. Conservative ministers are furious with Bercow now.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.51pm GMT20:51And heres’s Ian Swales, the Lib Dem MP, on the result of the vote.Ian Swales (@iswales)38 UKIP cheer leaders in parliament vote against EU justice laws to keep us safe. 37 are still in the Tory party.November 10, 2014FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.51pm GMT20:51Labour and Tories blame each other for EAW debate being shelvedWell, after that expect an almighty blame game as Labour and the Tories blame each other for parliament not having a proper debate on the European arrest warrant.The real victors are probably Ukip, who will be able to claim that the Commons has reneged on a promise to allow MPs to debate and vote on the European arrest warrant.Here is some preliminary blame-slinging.From Labour whipsLabour Whips (@labourwhips)426 maj for opt-ins they dared bring forward, so why did govt not bring forward motion on full package inc EAW rather than play silly games?November 10, 2014From the Conservative MP James WhartonJames Wharton MP (@jameswhartonmp)Labour, trying to be too clever by half with Parliamentary procedure, have closed down debate on the European Arrest Warrant!

We have got a debate on at the moment about what is a successful negotiation by this government, which is that we got out a lot of Europrean rules which don’t work for us and we are just staying in ones that do, such as this European arrest warrant.Updatedat 8.39pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.30pm GMT20:30Here’s Ukip’s Douglas Carswell on tonight’s proceedings.Douglas Carswell MP (@DouglasCarswell)Govt plan to get EAW thru Commons with minimal fuss not really worked outNovember 10, 2014Douglas Carswell MP (@DouglasCarswell)PM promised vote on EAW in PMQs.
