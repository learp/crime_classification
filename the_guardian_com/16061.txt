An experienced ferry officer insisted he had not left three yachtsmen to die in cold, dark water after the huge vessel he was controlling either hit or swamped their sailboat.The prosecution in the trial of Michael Hubble at Winchester crown court has claimed that the Ouzo was hit by the P&O car ferry, the Pride of Bilbao, that he was controlling, but he did not stop or alert coastguards. Instead, they claimed, he "crossed his fingers" and ferry continued on its way to northern Spain.Hubble said the 177m-long ferry had missed a small boat it had passed on the night the 7m-long Ouzo vanished south of the Isle of Wight, adding that he would have gone to help if he had thought the yacht he encountered was in danger.Under intense cross-examination, Hubble conceded that the yacht he saw was so close to the 37,000-tonne ferry that he carried out a manoeuvre perceived as a last resort.He said he was certain the yacht was safe after the close encounter as he had seen its lights when he looked back. "I had no doubts it was safe," he told the jury.Friends Rupert Saunders, James Meaby and Jason Downer died after the Ouzo vanished in August 2006 en route from the Isle of Wight to a regatta in Devon.Two of them survived for at least three hours while the third lived for as long as 12 hours before succumbing to hypothermia, it is claimed.The prosecution alleges that the men would have been saved if Hubble had turned back or alerted rescue teams.Hubble, 62, of Folkestone, Kent, denies manslaughter through gross negligence and three counts of engaging in conduct as a seaman that was likely to cause death or serious injury.Opening the defence, his barrister, Richard Barraclough QC, said his client, who has been a sailor since the age of 16, was "steeped in the ethos of the sea".When asked what he would do if another ship were in peril, Hubble said: "We would offer assistance without even thinking. It comes naturally."The defence case is based on the claim that the yacht Hubble saw could not have been the Ouzo.Hubble, who as officer of the watch was in control of the bridge, told how he was alerted by his lookout, Dave Smith, to the presence of a yacht on the night the Ouzo vanished.He said he saw a white light of a much smaller vessel and then performed a "dogleg" manoeuvre. "The reason for doing this was to give the chap a bit more room," said Hubble, adding that the yacht then passed safely down the starboard side of the ferry.After performing the dog-leg, Hubble looked out of the bridge window and initially could not see anything so he switched off some of the Bilbao's powerful lights. He looked back again."That's when I saw a single red light," he told the court.Asked by Barraclough if he was satisfied the red light was the yacht he had passed, Hubble said: "Absolutely satisfied".He told the court it was the closest he had come to a yacht in open water but said he did not consider it an emergency.Under cross-examination by prosecutor Christopher Parker QC, Hubble was asked about exchanges between him and his lookout, captured on the ferry's "black box", in which Hubble was told: "Head on, head on, it's pretty close."Hubble disagreed that the conversation showed the situation was an "emergency".Parker suggested the yacht was "five or 10 or 15m" from the Bilbao. Mr Hubble said she was not that close."This plainly was an emergency," said Parker.Mr Hubble replied: "I was merely giving the other chap more room."The defence is to argue that the Ouzo was not hit or swamped by the Bilbao but came close to a tanker, the Crescent Baune, that was in the area at the time.The captain of the tanker has admitted breaking the law by having only a second officer and not another lookout on his bridge that evening.The trial continues.
