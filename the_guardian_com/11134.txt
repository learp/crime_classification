An online fund to help a disabled pensioner who was violently mugged has been halted by his grateful family, with donations standing at nearly £330,000.Beautician Katie Cutler, who set up the fund, said there would be a presentation to hand over the £329,751 cheque to Alan Barnes, 67, whose ordeal inspired thousands of people to donate to help him move home.Barnes, who is and 4ft 6in and visually impaired, suffered a broken collarbone when he was shoved over outside his home in Gateshead by an assailant demanding money.In a message posted on the fundraising page on Wednesday morning, Cutler said: “Good morning, after speaking with Alan & his family. They have asked me to stop any further donations to his fund.“He is very grateful for all your love, support & donations. We will be having a little presentation to hand him his cheque so il [sic] keep you all updated. X”Cutler, who has been dubbed the Angel of the North for her fundraising efforts, set up the fund with the aim of raising £500 for Barnes.But she was quickly inundated with more than 24,000 donations totalling six figures.On Sunday, Cutler met Barnes for the first time as the mugging victim spoke of his amazement at the show of generosity, saying: “It’s like magic really. I didn’t expect anything.”Cutler has now shifted her efforts to another worthy cause: a two-year-old girl with severe spinal muscular atrophy who needs a special wheelchair costing £27,000.As donations came flooding in to the new fund, Cutler said: “It will be customised especially for her, with special supports and controls, so she can join in with all the other children at nursery and in the park. “She will be able to move her seat up and down to reach different surfaces, and be free to move for the very first time. Kacie is such a happy little girl despite what she has been through.“I’d like to generate as much money as possible so we can help towards the cost of her wheelchair & give her a special princess party that she deserves.”
