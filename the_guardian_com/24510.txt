The extremist preacher Anjem Choudary has applied for permission to appeal against his conviction for drumming up support for Islamic State.Choudary, 49, was jailed for five and a half years this month after posting a series of talks on YouTube in which he urged Muslims to support the terrorist group and argued that a caliphate had been created in June 2014. He finally fell foul of the law after spending two decades as a thorn in the side of British authorities. A string of former supporters went on to be convicted of terrorism. The judicial office confirmed that Choudary had applied for permission to appeal.
