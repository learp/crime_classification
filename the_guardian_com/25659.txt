Sex offenders are having to wait for up to a year to attend specialist rehabilitation programmes due to a cash crisis facing public protection teams, The Observer has learnt. The cutbacks are part of a wider financial crisis, according to those in the field. Last night, the Conservatives accused the Justice Secretary, Jack Straw, of increasing the risks to the public. 'Straw is telling magistrates to use more community sentences, but probation officers are saying they can't deliver them,' said shadow Justice Secretary, Nick Herbert. 'While ministers lurch from one penal crisis to the next, public safety is compromised because offenders don't get the sentences they deserve or the rehabilitation that is needed to stop them re-offending.'The cutbacks to the Sex Offender Treatment programmes are alarming public protection experts. In Sussex, 'acute staffing difficulties' were blamed for the decision to cancel one programme. In Northern Ireland, court orders compelling offenders to start a programme have been expiring before the courses are completed. Similar delays are reported in London and Nottinghamshire.In addition, a number of probation supervisors are being ordered not to propose unpaid work as a possible sentence. A confidential document obtained by The Observer instructs probation supervisors in Staffordshire 'to cease making active proposals for unpaid work in their reports for hearings at magistrates courts'.'It is clear that restrictions are being placed on sentencers as to what conditions they can add to community orders,' said Harry Fletcher, spokesman for the probation union, Napo. 'This is fuelling the rise in the short-term prison population.'
