A man police believe to be one of the biggest illegal gangmasters in Britain was among 40 people arrested this morning in a series of raids cracking down on illegal immigrants being used as cheap labour.Officers made a series of dawn swoops in Scotland and England in an operation coordinated by Norfolk police.Detective Inspector Paul Cunningham, who is leading the investigation, said of the plight of some immigrants working illegally: "These people are modern day slaves, working 15-hour days, living in overcrowded unsuitable conditions and paid a pittance for their trouble whilst their gangmasters live in luxury and launder the profits."At 6am this morning, police went into the home of a man in his early 40s from King's Lynn and arrested him on suspicion of assisting illegal entry of people to the UK, helping them stay illegally and money laundering. Police say he is responsible for employing over 200 foreign nationals, mainly from the Baltic states, and supplying them with false identification.Another man in King's Lynn was also arrested. The Scottish arm of the operation saw 38 arrests made in Aberdeen, including four men who are alleged to be "lieutenants" in the gang. The other 34 were workers, of eastern European origin, arrested as they travelled in two vans to a fish processing plant in Aberdeen. They are now being interviewed by immigration staff.The coordinated raids - codenamed Operation Absent - involved officers from Norfolk police, Grampian police, the Metropolitan police, Cambridgeshire police and the immigration service. Police say, while the fish processing plants in Scotland pay the going rate for labour, the gangmasters take a cut of the workers' pay, deducting unreasonable sums for their rent.
