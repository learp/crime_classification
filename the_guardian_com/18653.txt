The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, says his party will help set up a public inquiry into the causes of the riots if David Cameron continues to insist he will not hold one.Cameron has said he will await the outcome of a parliamentary inquiry by the home affairs select committee which begins in the autumn.Speaking during a visit to Brixton, south London, Miliband said: "If the government doesn't do it, then I will make sure we do it."Labour officials said Miliband was convinced, after talking to people in Manchester, Tottenham and Brixton, that a formal judicial inquiry was not what was needed.Instead, he wants some form of inquiry that gives residents an opportunity to describe what their lives are like and what may have caused the eruption of violence. He has also spoken of the need for a commission on social equality.Cameron will by Monday start to address the deeper causes of the riots and how it relates to his responsibility and "big society" agenda.One senior Liberal Democrat said the issues raised feed into many areas of policy, including social mobility, parenting, absent fathers, family structures and consumerism.London mayor Boris Johnson also suggested he will be providing a measured analysis shortly, saying: "There are rich ideological pickings for both left and right. And there are issues here that can cause heart-searching on both sides of the political argument."I do not think we can simply ascribe it to wanton criminality or simply ascribe it to 'Tory cuts' or whatever."With Cameron having described the riot's causes in the Commons on Thursday as "cultural", Miliband said: "We have got to avoid simplistic answers. There's a debate some people are starting: is it culture, is it poverty and lack of opportunity? It's probably both."Miliband accepted that his party must bear some of the blame for the culture in which the rioters grew up, saying the party had not done enough when in power to reduce inequality."We did better at rebuilding the fabric of our country than the ethic of our country," he told the BBC.But he added: "There are issues about responsibility in our society, parental responsibility is a big issue … there is also an issue about responsibility of people at the top of our society and the message they send to our young people …"What happened in the banking system, what happened with MPs' expenses, what happened with phone hacking isn't the same as looting, but it is about responsibility."And there's responsibility on those at the top of Britain to send the right message out, because if we are going to ... have a culture of responsibility in our country, it's got to start with the most powerful."I also think it's about opportunity. It's about showing people they have a stake in our society, and the best thing they can hope for isn't just to go and loot a telly or vandalise a shop."The shadow local government minister, Jack Dromey, admitted that all governments had to take their share of the blame. He called for rioters to be named and shamed.Kit Malthouse, , the Conservative deputy London mayor for policing, accused the rioters of "criminal venality", and refused to accept claims from some rioters that they suffered from poverty.
