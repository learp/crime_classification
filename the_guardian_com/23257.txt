The Duchess of York's former dresser, Jane Andrews, who was jailed two years ago for the murder of her lover, 39-year-old Thomas Cressman, has been sent back to prison after treatment in hospital for an apparent overdose.Andrews, 36, was discovered unconscious in her cell at Bullwood Hall prison in Hockley, Essex, on Monday morning, and taken to hospital in Southend in a critical condition. It was thought she may have overdosed on the medication she was receiving for depression, but friends said yesterday there was still no confirmation of the cause of her collapse. Harriet Wistrich, her lawyer, said it was not clear whether Andrews, who lost an appeal - based on her allegedly being sexually abused as a child - against her conviction last month, had suffered any permanent damage. She was reported to be deeply depressed after losing the appeal, and seeing an "adverse" ITV1 documentary about herself and her relationships.
