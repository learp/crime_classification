A woman has been raped after smoking a spiked cigarette (or "fry") in what is thought to be the first case of its kind in Britain. Experts at a rape referral centre in Kent said the woman, who as a victim of sexual assault cannot be named, described symptoms consistent with having smoked a cigarette dipped in formaldehyde.Spiked cigarettes were first used in America, where they were nicknamed "fries". They induce a feeling of disorientation almost immediately. When combined with recreational drugs such as angel dust or PCP, they can kill. The case was detected at the Renton rape referral clinic at Darent Valley hospital in Dartford, Kent. Harry Smith, a nurse at the hospital, said the victim had accepted a cigarette from a man she had just met at a bar in south-east London.She had not been drinking, but began to feel effects which were consistent with a drugged cigarette, he said. "We believe that what initiated the sexual assault was the cigarette. She had not had any alcohol that night."He added: "It's certainly the first case that I'm aware of where you can say: 'Yes, it's a spiked cigarette'." Mr Smith said the effects of smoking the drug-soaked cigarette were instant but short-lived. However, a woman under the temporary influence of a drugged cigarette might be enticed to accept a spiked drink from a stranger. "Not only do you need to keep a close eye on your drink, but don't accept cigarettes from people, especially the roll-up types. You have to be careful."Forensic experts have been aware of the use of date rape cigarettes in the United States since the 1990s, but until now there have been no confirmed cases in the UK.
