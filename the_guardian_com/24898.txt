The parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler have spoken on the third anniversary of her disappearance of their need to 'know the name and see the face' of her killer.A joint statement by her parents, Bob and Sally, and her elder sister, Gemma, read: 'The anniversary of Milly's disappearance is always an extremely poignant time. This year, her friends have embarked on their A-levels, and watching them start to think about their futures is a constant reminder of what Milly might have been doing. 'We need to know the name and see the face of the person who murdered our beautiful daughter.' Milly disappeared as she walked home from school in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Her body was found in Hampshire woodland six months later. Neither her clothes nor mobile phone have been found. A post-mortem examination proved inconclusive, but there were no obvious signs of injury. Last week, police announced that the man responsible for Milly's murder may be a serial killer. Detectives now believe her attack was part of a series of at least eight assaults dating back two years - three murders and five attempted murders. These include the murder of 22-year-old French student Amelie Delagrange last August, the killing of 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell and the attempted murder of 18-year-old Kate Sheedy, who was deliberately run over in west London in May 2004. Kate, a former convent schoolgirl, spoke last night for the first time about how her life was ripped apart by the attack: 'Even nearly 10 months on I'm still recovering from both the physical injuries and the psychological trauma. 'I have only recently been confident enough to leave the house alone, but still won't stay by myself after dark. I also suffer from panic attacks. To target innocent young women is cowardly and sickening. There aren't words to express how much I want this person caught.'
