The number of prisoners in England and Wales has risen to a record high of almost 81,000, the Prison Service said today.The figure of 80,977 prisoners is 165 higher than the previous record, set three weeks ago, and means the prisons are just 481 places away from their official absolute capacity.The prison population in England and Wales exceeded 80,000 for the first time in November 2006.There have been repeated disagreements between ministers and judges over the rapid increase in prisoner numbers - the average figure for 1997, the year Tony Blair came to power, was just above 61,000.Last month, Britain's most senior judge called for an end to the automatic recall to prison of released offenders for technical breaches of their licence, such as not showing up for a probation appointment.Lord Phillips, the lord chief justice, said research had shown that up to 48% of prisoners in some local jails were there for technical breaches. He called it a "trapdoor to prison" which was swelling the record jail population. Many of these cases involve people who have "a disorganised lifestyle, but with whom it is worth persevering", he argued.In March, Lord Phillips questioned mandatory life sentences and said some murderers were serving too long in jail, comments dismissed by Mr Blair's office.
