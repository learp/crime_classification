Pupils from three schools who arranged a mass fight over the internet have been stopped by police.The youths were carrying metal bars, pieces of wood, baseball bats and bicycle chains. Up to 80 children, some as young as 11, are believed to have been involved.Police were called on Saturday lunchtime to what they described as "a potential large-scale disorder" in Cullompton, Devon.A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said: "Officers had received reports that the children had arranged a fight over the internet, orchestrated by groups from Tiverton, Cullompton and Uffculme."The arrangements appear to have been made via a website called Bebo and by emails, mobile phone calls and text messages."Police moved on the youngsters as they gathered on fields in Cullompton, north-west of Exeter. They returned to the town centre with a variety of weapons but were eventually dispersed without any disorder.A 17-year-old youth received a verbal warning for the possession of cannabis, and cigarettes were taken from several children.Police inspector Anne Higgins said: "Police will be liaising closely with the schools involved, and will work closely in partnership to curb this behaviour."Any attempt to repeat such a gathering will be subject to the full use of police powers under public order legislation, including the stop and search of people within a five-mile radius of any potential location for disorder."In addition, should the situation in future warrant it, we will consider applications for dispersal orders," she said."Parents are asked to be mindful of the seriousness of this type of behaviour and of carrying weapons in public."A spokeswoman for Bebo said: "We would, of course, assist immediately with any investigation."Illegal and inappropriate communications are in direct contradiction of our strict terms of use."
