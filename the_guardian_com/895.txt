A married woman who claimed she had been raped to cover up the fact she had had a one-night stand was jailed for a year yesterday.Merete Underwood, 32, from Kingston, Surrey, was spending an evening out with her husband and son in February last year when she disappeared with an interior designer. Realising that she had been reported missing, Underwood then accused the 34-year-old designer of rape to prevent her husband discovering the truth. Joanne Hacking, prosecuting, told the court a few drinks in one pub were followed by several more in another. "Then at about 9.30pm she went to the bathroom. A few minutes later her husband asked bar staff to check the toilets," she said. "There was no sign of her there and no sign of her outside." Although worried, Mr Underwood took his son home. He woke at 5am the next day to find his wife was still missing and reported her disappearance to the police. Middlesex Guildhall crown court in London heard the woman lost no time claiming she had been raped and indecently assaulted by two men. Miss Hacking said the defendant later identified the innocent interior designer. The man spent 24 hours in a cell and endured the prospect of prosecution for three months, the court was told. Even after his accuser was charged with perverting the course of justice, she continued to lie for a further year. It was only as the jury was about to be sworn in to try her that she confessed.
