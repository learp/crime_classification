Police investigating the murder of a married couple have pledged to work around the clock to catch those responsible.Avtar Singh Kolar, 62 and his wife Carole, 58, were found dead at a house in Birmingham on Wednesday morning by their policeman son.Detective Superintendent Richard Baker said: "We currently have over 60 detectives from West Midlands Police CID along with a lot of our uniform colleagues working around the clock to catch the offenders responsible for this and bring them to justice."I can assure the local communities and the family that we will catch the people who have done this horrendous crime."Baker said the couple's bodies were discovered in the Handsworth Wood area of Birmingham by one of their four sons, who is a serving officer with West Midlands Police.Baker said: "It was obvious from the scene the couple had been assaulted and had more than likely died of their injuries."He added that forensic post-mortem examinations were yet to take place but would be carried out either on Thursday or Friday.The couple's son discovered the bodies at 8am at the house in Friary Road when his parents failed to answer the phone, Baker said"At 7.15pm last night a family member spoke to Carole and there were no issues. At 8am this morning their son went round to find the couple dead at the scene."He said the couple have four grown-up children and eight grandchildren and that this is a very difficult time for the "close-knit, loving family".Baker went on: "We're appealing for anybody who may have seen or heard anything suspicious within the Friary Road area of Handsworth Wood to come forward with any information they have, and please can I stress that any information could prove vital to coming to a very quick and swift conclusion to this inquiry."I'm absolutely convinced that local people within the area of Handsworth Wood have that vital bit of information that will lead to the identity of these offenders and bring them to justice as quickly as we possibly can."Baker added: "We are in the really early stages of the investigation and we are keeping an open mind about a possible motive."When asked if it might be a revenge attack linked to their son's police work, he said: "We are looking at that as a possibility but we have no information to suggest it is the case at this stage."
