The home secretary, Charles Clarke, today announced plans to extend powers to seize criminals' assets.Currently police can seize cash or assets over the value of £5,000 if they believe they are the proceeds of crime or are to be used to perpetrate offences. But the government wants that threshold to be lowered to £1,000 as part of crackdown on small-time criminals.The move would widen the number of criminals police could target. Officers say it will help them tackle criminals such as small-scale drug dealers. Announcing the move, Mr Clarke said: "Reducing the threshold so officers can seize cash stashes of at least £1,000 will allow the police to target local drug dealers and other small-time criminals whose activities destroy lives and blight communities."The Home Office today also published a report which it claimed showed government measures to tackle antisocial behaviour are working.The survey shows that in "action areas" where such behaviour is being targeted, the proportion of people concerned about antisocial behaviour has fallen from 25% to 19% in the last two years - twice as fast as the national average. Yesterday writing in the Observer, the prime minister, Tony Blair, signalled a new war on yobbery was to be launched with a crackdown on inadequate parents.
