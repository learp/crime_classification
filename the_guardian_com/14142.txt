Media claims that judges are imposing overly lenient prison terms are incorrect and undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system, the most senior judge in England and Wales has warned.After several weeks during which the press has scrutinised sentencing, the lord chief justice, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, said the body that sets down guidelines for the courts had not been "portrayed fairly in some sections".In his foreword to the Sentencing Guidelines Council's annual report, he highlighted the coverage of robbery sentences and, in particular, a report in the Daily Express that claimed he believed muggers must not be sent to prison."[Our guidelines] stated that the starting point in relation to robbery should almost always be a custodial sentence - a long one where serious violence or injury was involved," he said."There was one exception, in the case of young first offenders using minimal force or threat of force. This earned me the headline in one tabloid, in letters an inch high, RIDICULOUS, followed by 'Muggers must not be sent to prison says new lord chief justice'."He said the reporting erroneously presented draft guidelines as binding. "Public confidence is profoundly affected and even undermined by this type of portrayal," he said.A straw poll of judges by the Times suggested some were ready to quit over recent sentencing controversies - thrust into the headlines after the home secretary, John Reid, criticised a decision to reward a paedophile for pleading guilty by reducing his sentence to six years.One unnamed judge said colleagues were "seething" that ministers had "departed from their constitutional role" and suggested Mr Reid should "consider resigning". Another said: "I feel so grumpy about it all that I have had enough ... I will throw my wig into the Thames and stagger, glass in hand, into the sunset."
