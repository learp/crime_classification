The grandmother of a five-year-old girl who was mauled to death by a pit bull may have been "sacrificed" by her family, a court was told today.John McDermott QC said Jacqueline Simpson's relatives could have "invented" part of the prosecution's case to lessen their involvement in the tragedy.Simpson, 45, was babysitting Ellie Lawrenson in the early hours of New Year's Day when she let the dog into her house in St Helens, Merseyside.The powerfully-built and illegal pet attacked the youngster, shaking her for 20 minutes and inflicting 72 injuries. Simpson denies manslaughter by gross negligence.In his closing speech at Liverpool crown court, Mr McDermott, for Simpson, asked: "Have part of the family invented part of this case to distance themselves from what happened?"Has Jacqui Simpson, the grandmother in this case, effectively been sacrificed? Finding her guilty would be a harsh, harsh judgment."Earlier in the trial, the jury of seven men and five women heard how police officers arrived at the house after the attack to find it "awash with blood."The court was also told that Simpson, who smoked up to 10 cannabis joints a day, had been almost twice over the legal limit for drinking and driving at the time she was babysitting Ellie.She had around 140mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in her system - the legal drink-drive limit is 80mg - and had also taken sleeping tablets and was on medication for depression.Neil Flewitt QC, for the prosecution, said loving Ellie was no excuse for her grandmother. He said her judgment had been clouded by drinking, smoking and taking prescribed medication."There can be no doubt that, when you put yourselves in that position and consider all those facts, you are driven to the conclusion that she breached that duty of care to Ellie Lawrenson," he added."A moment's thought would have led to the inevitable conclusion that if that dog had attacked Ellie, it could quite easily have killed her."This wasn't an accident or minor misjudgement, it was reckless and cavalier and grossly negligent conduct. It was the direct cause of Ellie Lawrenson's death."In April, Ellie's uncle, Kiel Simpson, 24, pleaded guilty at Liverpool magistrates' court to owning the pit bull terrier, called Reuben, contrary to section one of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. He was jailed for eight weeks.The jury in today's case is expected to retire on Monday.
