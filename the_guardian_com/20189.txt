A woman died at Styal prison a day after the Cheshire jail was criticized for failing to meet the needs of vulnerable women, it was reported yesterday.Valerie Hayes was found hanging in her cell on Wednesday afternoon. Staff tried to resuscitate the 42-year-old, who was serving a two-year sentence for arson, before she was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead.Six women died in Styal between August 2002 and August 2003.Following the fatalities, a series of new facilities were introduced, but the report - carried out by the Prisons Inspectorate - said they "only skimmed the surface" of the problem of women in prison.Inspectors found the facilities and procedures for receiving and inducting new prisoners had "transformed" Styal.However, they said the positive findings were not repeated elsewhere in the jail, and found a number of "extremely vulnerable and seriously mentally ill women, who were repeatedly self-harming" were held alongside inmates who had been segregated as punishment.They described the care, support and re-integration unit as a place where self-harm was "normalised and increasing".Official statistics show that self-harm, mental health and drug problems dominate the history of the majority of women in prison.Two-thirds of the female prison population show symptoms of at least one neurotic disorder and/or have a drug problem, while 37% of female prisoners say they have attempted suicide at least once in their life.Juliet Lyon, the director of the Prison Reform Trust said Hayes's death was a tragedy for her and her family and for a prison struggling to care for exceptionally vulnerable women."Styal is a dumping ground for the most vulnerable women in the region," she said. "It is in no way equipped to manage these women, and nor should it be asked to do so."A Home Office spokesman said the prisons and probation ombudsman would carry out an investigation into the death at Styal, which serves the north-west and North Wales and holds around 460 inmates.
