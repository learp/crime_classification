An 18-year-old boy failed his first driving test yesterday, after two robbers commandeered his car during the exam.Police said the teenager and his examiner were told to get out of the car 20 minutes into the test in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Shortly before the incident two men had snatched a cash box being delivered to a post office. A spokesman for Essex police said: "Their getaway was frustrated when their motorcycle was blocked by another vehicle. "The two men then commandeered a red Ford Fiesta being driven by an 18-year-old man, who was taking his driving test. The pupil and examiner were forced to hand over the car to the thieves." Marc Shadbolt, owner of Tendring School of Motoring, which taught the teenager, said he had failed the examination because the incident happened near the beginning of the 40-minute test. "He was just about to do a reverse manoeuvre when it happened," Mr Shadbolt added. "As far as I am aware, two men came up to the car, and one stood in front and said 'Stop', which the pupil did. "Then they asked the examiner and the pupil to get out of the car, the examiner was a bit reluctant and I understand they dragged him out." The car was later found abandoned. The police spokesman said a man had been arrested on suspicion of theft.  Press Association
