A burglar serving six years for 311 raids was praised by prison authorities today for owning up to a further 126 crimes. Darren Schoning, 31, who was jailed in April, confessed to a string of break-ins stretching back a decade. Officers told Gloucester crown court they were impressed by how helpful Schoning had been in helping them clear up old crimes. Recorder Paul Garlick QC also praised Schoning's decision to wipe the slate clean. Schoning, from Gloucester, was given a three-year jail sentence that will run concurrently with his existing punishment and he will not serve any extra time.
