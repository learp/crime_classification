The lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, today promised a wide-ranging review of sentencing policy.His pledge followed four days of controversy sparked when the home secretary, John Reid, claimed judges were handing out "unduly lenient" sentences.Lord Falconer told the BBC that every option would be studied in the sentencing shake-up.It is designed to clear up contradictions that are leading some serious criminals to be released after relatively short sentences while others are imprisoned indefinitely.The lord chancellor's remarks came after Mr Reid criticised the sentence given to convicted paedophile Craig Sweeney, which allowed him to be released from jail after just over five years."Everybody is agreed there is a problem about the [Sweeney] sentence," Mr Reid told the BBC. "We need to look at the system and we need to make changes to ensure it doesn't happen again. We need to have a system the public has confidence in."Mr Reid wrote to the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, within hours of Sweeney's sentencing to recommend an appeal. The action brought an irritated response from Lord Goldsmith's office and accusations of political interference in the judiciary.However, Lord Falconer today defended Mr Reid's behaviour, saying it had not gone beyond the boundaries of permissible political behaviour."There is nothing wrong with a minister raising the fact that the system may be producing a sentence that is too low," he told the BBC. "I believe the sentence is too low. He did not attack the judge."Tony Blair and David Cameron yesterday clashed at prime minister's questions, with the Conservative leader blaming sentencing guidelines in the 2003 Criminal Justice Act for allowing Sweeney's theoretical release date.Lord Falconer's announcement of a review followed calls by the shadow attorney general, Dominic Grieve, for a change of policy.Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Grieve - who described it as "extraordinary" that Mr Reid had not apologised for his intervention - said there was a need to go "back to basics" on sentencing."The sentencing exercise that the judge carried out was entirely the result of the government's own 2003 Criminal Justice Act - he followed it to the letter," Mr Grieve said."And if it produces a result which appears to most people to be very odd and unacceptable, that's entirely, I'm afraid, because the government didn't listen."When he sentenced Sweeney at Cardiff crown court on Monday, judge John Griffith Williams acted in accordance with guidelines under the 2003 act.The notional sentence of 18 years for the abduction and sexual assault of a three-year-old girl was halved to reach the actual sentence, with a further third removed in view of Sweeney's guilty plea.However, a separate part of the legislation has seen a large number of offenders imprisoned without any release date set at all, Mr Blair said yesterday.The prime minister said that, in the last 12 months alone, more than 1,000 people had been given so-called indeterminate sentences.That is a situation in which a judge can set a minimum tariff but, to qualify for release, the prisoner must satisfy authorities they no longer pose a risk to others.
