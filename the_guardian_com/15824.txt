Court proceedings against the England and Gloucester rugby player Lesley Vainikolo were adjourned today to allow the injured winger to fly to New Zealand to "deal with sensitive family matters".Vainikolo, 29, was charged with causing grievous bodily harm following an incident outside the Second Bridge nightclub in Bath on 26 October last year after which a man in his 20s was taken to hospital with head injuries.At a short preliminary hearing at Bristol crown court, counsel for Vainikolo, who appeared on crutches, asked for a plea hearing to be put back to allow the Tonga-born player to visit family abroad. Judge John Foley moved back a plea and case management hearing to 8 May.Vainikolo will not play again this season after undergoing surgery on a ruptured Achilles tendon, an injury sustained while he was playing for Gloucester against Saracens on 3 January.
