The former partner of a woman found dead with a man in east Belfast is in custody. The 33-year-old was arrested in connection with the discovery of the two bodies in Ravenhill Court on Friday as police began a double murder inquiry.A spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland said the door to the flat where the two people lived had been damaged. The PSNI said their officers went into the property and found the bodies. Both of the victims were middle-aged.PSNI detective chief inspector Una Jennings said: "We are treating this at the moment as a suspected domestic homicide."She said said she believed the perpetrator may have been in a relationship with one of the victims and that the exact causes of death would not be confirmed until post-mortem examinations were carried out in the coming days.Police did not want the identities of the victims to become public at this stage as not all of their next of kin had been informed of what had happened. Officers found their bodies in the living room of the flat in the Ravenhill Court area on Friday afternoon. They had been alerted by a member of the public who noticed the front door of the property had been badly damaged.Asked if the perpetrator posed a danger to the wider public, Jennings said: "We don't consider they pose a risk to the public at this time."Detectives appealed for anyone who noticed anything suspicious in the Ravenhill Court area between 3pm on Wednesday and 3pm on Friday to contact them.
