The board overseeing child protection work in Birmingham today launched an independent inquiry into the death of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, alleged to have been starved at her home.The Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board said it had "now commenced a serious case review, an independent examination into the circumstances surrounding the death of Khyra"."The findings of this review will be made public in due course following the completion of the criminal process," the board said in a statement. Police are still awaiting the results of a post-mortem examination on Khyra's body, but sources said the girl was believed to have died of starvation. She and her five siblings are reported to have been in an emaciated state when paramedics were called to their home in Leyton Road, in the Handsworth area of Birmingham.Khyra's mother, Angela Gordon, 33, and her partner, 29-year-old Junaid Abuhamza, have appeared in court charged with causing or allowing her death through neglect.All agencies involved in child protection in Birmingham will conduct internal reviews as part of the inquiry into her death."This is partly to provide information to other investigations but, equally importantly, it is to find out if there are any gaps in the processes, procedures or guidance which could have made a difference," a Birmingham City council spokesman said."If any are found, immediate changes will be made without waiting for the findings of the investigations."The council expressed its sympathies to Khyra's family and pledged to take care of her siblings, who have been taken into foster care."Khyra's death is a tragedy, and our thoughts are with her family, friends and the local community within which she lived," the spokesman said."All those people can be reassured that the city council and all other agencies involved are doing everything they can to find out what happened and look after her brothers and sisters to the best of our ability. "Council psychologists were offering support to pupils and teachers at Khyra's school, Grove Primary, in Handsworth.The council spokesman added that efforts had been made to update and reassure the local Labour MP, Khalid Mahmood, who has been critical of the handling of Khyra's case.Yesterday, he accused the council of taking a "head in the sand approach" and said it needed to do more to reassure the local community.The MP said some council officers had been instructed not to talk to him about Khyra, who died at Birmingham Children's hospital after paramedics were called to her home early on Saturday. It has also been claimed that some of the children in the house may have eaten scraps of bread left out for birds in a neighbour's garden. Mahmood told reporters on Wednesday that the siblings had been removed from school by their mother 10 weeks ago after claims of bullying. He was told that an educational social worker had paid a visit to the family home, but no follow-up checks were made.
