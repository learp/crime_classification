A teenage boy has been charged with the murder of two men in Ipswich, Suffolk police said. The 17-year-old, who has not been named, is due to appear in court on Monday. He was held by police following the deaths of Barry Street, 32, and Nathan Oakley, 18, who died on Thursday from suspected stab wounds. Police had first responded to reports of a stabbing at West Meadows, Ipswich. They received another call 15 minutes later reporting that a male had collapsed outside Ipswich hospital with suspected stab wounds. Post-mortem examinations confirmed that the pair died as a result of stab injuries. The suspect was detained a short time later and taken into custody. He is due to appear at Ipswich youth court on Monday. Anyone with information about the incident, or who was in the West Meadows area between 8am and 3pm on Thursday, is asked to contact police.
