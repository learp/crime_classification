The comedy actor Chris Langham looked at graphic images of children being sexually assaulted because it made him feel like a better man, a court heard yesterday.A woman who claims the Bafta-winning star began abusing her when she was 14 years old said Mr Langham had admitted looking at images of children on his home computer when the pair met in 2005.But she told Maidstone crown court that he claimed to have been more interested in the adults. "He said he was not looking at the children but at the people who were hurting them and looking into their eyes because it made him feel like a better man."She added that Mr Langham, 48, had told her he had also watched torture images on the internet. "He said the press only focused on the child pornography because that was the worst of it. But he was looking at images of people having their heads and bodies being chopped off."Mr Langham, from Cranbrook in Kent, denies 10 counts of indecent assault and two counts of buggery between January 1996 and April 2000. He also denies 15 offences of making indecent images of children on computers between September and November 2005.The woman said she was sexually abused by Langham for three years.The jury heard that when they met at a north London hotel when she was adult, they had sex during which the actor told her she was still "like a little girl to him"."I was a bit surprised because I knew him and trusted him ... I was angry, I was very, very confused."After the child pornography allegations came to light in 2005, Mr Langham met the woman in a central London park. "He was not the man I knew. He was very hurtful." The case continues.
