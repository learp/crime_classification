A teacher whose wife's dismembered body was found in a freezer was charged with her murder last night.Paul Dalton, 34, was arrested at Heathrow airport on Monday afternoon - two weeks after body parts of his Korean-born wife were found at the couple's home in Kingston upon Thames, south-west London. The couple had been married for seven years and ran a language school in Kingston. Mr Dalton, who met his wife Tae Hui at university, has a master's degree in microbiology and several qualifications in teaching English as a foreign language. The school's website reveals that he first taught English in Korea, specialising in preparing students for university. He returned to Britain in 1997 and the couple married in January that year in Islington, north London. Dalton was due to appear before Kingston magistrates today charged with the murder on or before May 23.
