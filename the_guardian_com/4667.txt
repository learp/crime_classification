It has always been our fear that the Serious and Organised Crime Agency would evolve into a single, stand-alone agency, but now we may be faced with two British FBIs; two Failed Bureaucratic Institutions, one based in England, the other in Scotland. Twin headquarters, twin lines of communication and two sets of competing priorities will not encourage joint-working, whatever the good intentions of politicians in Westminster or Edinburgh alike.While Scottish National Crime Squad and National Criminal Intelligence Service officers will retain their status as officers of the crown, under current plans, in England and Wales, the very same officers could be forced to transfer and become Soca officers. Overnight, highly experienced officers will become quasi-civil servants with limited police powers, in sharp contrast to fully-sworn police officers who are politically independent and on duty 24/7. The border between England and Scotland presents no greater a challenge to criminals than that of England and Wales: they are mere lines on a map. Legal complexities mean that Scotland will have its own version of Soca and the director general in England and Wales will have to seek Scottish ministerial approval. The ingenuity and dexterity of criminals must be matched with a coordinated and integrated response, but in doing so, we must not present criminals with new opportunities by erecting an institutional Hadrian's Wall. Jan BerryChairman, Police Federation of England and WalesReading Helena Kennedy's article (Comment, November 27), I was persuaded to look up the observation of John Philpot Curran in 1790, that "the condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance; which condition if he break, servitude is at once the consequence of his crime, and the punishment of his guilt".
