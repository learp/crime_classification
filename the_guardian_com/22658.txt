A 25-year-old man on his way home from a night out has died after being hit by a stolen car that had spun out of control, police said yesterday.David Gaylor was walking along London Road in Bedford just before 4am yesterday when two cars being driven by joyriders collided and one struck him before slamming into a block of flats. Gaylor, from Bedford, was taken to Bedford hospital, where he died of his injuries.A spokeswoman for Bedfordshire police said that six people had been arrested in connection with the incident, which involved a Ford S-Max and a Hyundai Coupe, both believed to have been stolen.She added: "Three of the people that have been arrested are at Bedford hospital south wing, two of which are described as receiving treatment for serious but not life-threatening injuries." The third was receiving treatment for minor injuries, and the other three people arrested were being held at Greyfriars police station.London Road remained closed to traffic yesterday as police examined the scene for evidence. The Hyundai was taken away by a recovery lorry, but police said the Ford could not be removed because it was so badly damaged. The impact of the crash caused extensive damage to the block of flats, which is owned by Bedfordshire Pilgrims Housing Association. It left a hole in the wall of a bedroom and damaged a neighbouring flat and stairwell. No residents were injured.Detectives were still looking for a number of car passengers seen running away after the crash.Flowers were laid at the scene yesterday. One label said: "David, God Bless Mate, we love you so much", while another read: "Can't believe you have gone. Love you so much, you will always be with us."
