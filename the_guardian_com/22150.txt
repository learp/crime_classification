Martin Boothby was sleeping in a caravan in a scrapyard and wanted to freshen up. All he needed was access to a decent bathroom.One place he knew with good facilities was the home of his mother-in-law. But after his divorce, she was his ex-mother-in-law and might not be too welcoming. So he waited until she was on holiday and let himself in, magistrates in Macclesfield, Cheshire, were told. He cleaned his teeth, took a bath, dropped a towel on the floor, and made himself a cup of tea. Then he left, handing the key to a neighbour who was keeping an eye on the house. She found evidence of Boothby's visit. He was arrested and admitted stealing tea and toothpaste valued at 1p. Mark James, for the defence, said: "There is a history in this case that puts it into context. He was separated and divorced from his wife, and there was a dispute over accommodation that left him homeless. "He has stayed with friends and slept rough for years, and at the time was sleeping at a scrap metal yard in a caravan. He knew his ex-mother-in-law was going on holiday. He consumed some items and that amounts to burglary, but it is difficult to imagine a case less serious." Mr James said Boothby had developed a drink problem and found it difficult to deal with everyday issues, and urged a community sentence. Magistrates adjourned the case for a pre-sentence report from the probation service. Boothby also owed almost £150 in unpaid fines, and was given a seven-day suspended jail sentence while he paid off the debt at £10 a week.
