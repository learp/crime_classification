A 17-year-old girl has been raped by a gang of men in a secluded nature spot, police say.The teenager was attacked in woods near the Jubilee river in Slough, Berkshire, on Friday evening after meeting a group of men earlier in the day.She started talking with one of the men and walked with him along the high street, stopping at an off licence.The pair then walked along Spackmans Way before moving on to a footpath and into some woods near the Jubilee river, Thames Valley police said.Four other men, who were part of the earlier group, arrived at the location in a small silver car. The girl was then raped by several of the men, police said.Detectives have urged anyone who believes they saw the men, who are described as Asian, or the victim to come forward.DI Nicola Hurdley said: "We are still speaking with the girl at this time to get a full picture of what has happened, but what we do know is that while she was in this wooded area she has been raped by several of the men."We have specially trained officers with her now, who are supporting her while we carry out our inquiries in the area."There will also be additional patrols by uniformed officers in and around the area, who will be on hand to discuss any concerns that people may have."Right now our investigation is focused on identifying the men involved and gathering information about their whereabouts."I would like to speak to anyone who may have seen these men in the Chalvey area last night, around early evening, and who may have seen them driving around in a small silver car. All the men are described as being Asian."There have been no similar offences reported to the police but I would appeal to anyone who thinks they saw the victim, the offenders or the vehicle to come forward. I would also like to remind people to be vigilant and take care when out and about on their own."Anyone with information should contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
