Twelve teenagers appeared in court today charged with the murder of Sofyen Belamouadden, who was chased into one of London's busiest train stations and stabbed repeatedly in front of hundreds of commuters.The 15-year-old was killed at Victoria station at the height of the rush hour last Thursday.His death came two days before another teenager, 17-year-old Godwin Nii Lawson, was fatally stabbed in east London.Today, police said four more teenagers had been detained in connection with Sofyen's murder, bringing the number arrested to 24.Witnesses said Sofyen was chased into the station at about 5.15pm. The attack began on steps leading into the station in Terminus Place and ended in a ticket hall for the Circle and District tube lines.He was stabbed several times in the chest and back and was pronounced dead in hospital soon afterwards.The teenager, a keen footballer, played for the Acton Garden Village Youth Sunday league team, in west London, and for Chelsea Kicks, a scheme run by the Premier League club for young people in deprived areas.A spokesman for the club described him as a "talented footballer" and a "valued participant" in the scheme.Twelve teenagers – four aged 16 and eight aged 17 – were charged with Sofyen's murder today. The boys, all from south London, were remanded in custody to appear at West London youth court.Two 15-year-olds, four 16-year-olds and a 17-year-old were released on bail. A man in his 30s was also arrested but was later released.Sofyen's death came two days before Godwin Nii Lawson was stabbed to death in east London.Police found the 17-year-old in Amhurst Park, Hackney, at about 1.50am on Saturday. He was pronounced dead at the scene.Two other men, aged 18 and 20, were taken to hospital with stab wounds. One was said to be seriously ill, though neither was thought to be in a life-threatening condition.YesterdayGodwin's mother, Yvonne, said her son had moved away from home to join Oxford United's football academy in an attempt to escape gangs in north London.Detective Chief Inspector John Macdonald said the three were attacked in Amhurst Park, near the junction with Durley Road, and at least four male suspects fled up Durley Road."The area would still have been quite busy at the time of the attack, so we need to speak to anyone who saw what happened," he added.According to figures released by the Metropolitan police, Godwin is the fourth teenager to be stabbed to death in London this year.In 2008, there was a surge of youth violence in the capital, with 22 teenagers fatally stabbed. Last year, the number fell to 10.
