A serial swindler was behind bars yesterday after being convicted of carrying out a string of conspiracies and deceptions.In one scam Wayne Fyffe, 35, of Shoreditch, east London, posed as a US fashion photographer to dupe De Beers into lending Â£160,000 of jewellery for a photoshoot. Within seconds of turning up with the diamond-studded gems, the guards looking after them were mugged and the haul stolen. A day later he masterminded an almost identical swindle against Cartier. Sentence was adjourned at Southwark crown court, London, until next month.
