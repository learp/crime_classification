The story of Britain's largest robbery, the audacious raid on a Securitas depot in Tonbridge, Kent in which £53m was stolen, is to be made into a Channel 4 film.Production company Oxford Films, the company behind the 1995 Oscar-winning Restoration and 1998's Oscar-nominated Hilary and Jackie, has secured a deal with the channel for what is expected to be a 90-minute drama about the case.Five men are facing the possibility of life sentences after being convicted yesterday at the end of a seven-month trial at the Old Bailey. The diverse team of criminals from south London, Kent and Albania will be sentenced today after pleas of mitigation.The planned film will not enter production until several legal obstacles are overcome. Several gang members, including a purported "Mr Big", are reportedly still at large, meaning the company would risk contempt if it were to dramatise aspects of the story which might be used as evidence in a future court case.Patrick Forbes, a director of Oxford Films and the proposed director of the drama, said the film was in early script development after securing a Channel 4 deal.He said the feature would be pitched somewhere between Paul Greengrass's cinema verité-style 2006 feature about the 9/11 attacks, United 93, and the 2003 mountain-climbing documentary Touching the Void.However, there were no plans to move to the next stage until the legal barriers had been removed, and no casting details were available."I would imagine it will be between nine months and a year," he told Guardian Unlimited Film. "Until we know where we are legally we don't know what we can and can't dramatise."The story of the previous biggest UK robbery, the 1963 Great Train Robbery, has never been made into a film, although the experiences of gang member Buster Edwards were channelled into the 1988 comedy-drama Buster, starring Phil Collins and Julie Walters. The 1967 film Robbery starring Stanley Baker was loosely based on events.
