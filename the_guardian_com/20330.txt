This sad case (Their mothers beside them, boys aged 10 and 11 are convicted of attempted rape, 25 May) highlights the inappropriateness of dealing with very young children in an adversarial, formal court system designed for adult offenders. Children of this age – both the witness and the defendants – cannot be expected to understand and respond properly to the sophisticated arguments of barristers; the criminal justice system cannot be the proper place to discover the truth of matters such as this.The National Association for Youth Justice has long advocated that the age of criminal responsibility should be raised, and that younger children should be dealt with by a process that is inquisitorial rather than adversarial, that focuses on the welfare of all the children involved and that facilitates interventions that are broader than those available to a court to address the needs of all concerned.That way, we stand a realistic chance of ensuring child offenders understand the serious nature of their actions and are less likely to reoffend in later life. The criminal justice system cannot do this. It is, therefore, particularly concerning that under the new government the responsibility for children in trouble with the law has been removed from any department concerned with child welfare and is now solely the remit of the Ministry of Justice.Pam HibbertNational Association for Youth Justice
