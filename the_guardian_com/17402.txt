A security officer is facing a prison sentence for smuggling a camera into a high-security psychiatric hospital in an attempt to take photographs of the serial killer Ian Brady and sell them to the News of the World.Alan Hagan, 48, was found guilty of committing misconduct in public office over his dealings with the defunct newspaper’s then crime reporter Lucy Panton in 2008, while he worked at Ashworth hospital in Merseyside.He had denied wrongdoing at London’s Old Bailey. Hagan, from Liverpool, will be sentenced by judge Mark Lucraft QC on 26 June.The court had heard he was paid £1,000 for a story headlined “Suicide Brady hid pills in his sock” in February 2008, a month after he first made contact with Panton.The jury was told that they went on to hatch a plan nicknamed “The Project” to smuggle in a camera to take pictures and videos of the Moors Murderer – which would have been the first since his mugshot was released in 1966.Hagan, who wanted to take “revenge” on his bosses for their treatment of him, discussed payment of £50,000 for the photos, the court heard.He managed to smuggle a camera into the hospital but the resulting pictures were not of a good enough quality and they were not published.Brady, 77, murdered five children on the moors around Manchester with Myra Hindley between 1963 and 1965. They went on trial in 1966 and were described as “sadistic killers of the utmost depravity” when they were sentenced to life imprisonment.In April 2008, Hagan tried and failed to smuggle a camera into the hospital, the court heard.The court was told that in August, Panton emailed her boss about meeting her Brady contact in Liverpool and told him: “Meet Friday, it looks like there will be an opportunity to get the project back on.”By October, Hagan had procured a new piece of kit enabling him to take pictures and video inside the hospital, but they were not good enough to be used.Mark Trafford QC, prosecuting, said Hagan first approached the NoW because he was disgruntled with his employer and believed he had been “badly treated” by the management.He said: “His revenge, and his road to seek large sums of money, was to seek to sell pictures to the media. He had the position and the opportunity. He had seen and worked near people whose faces, whose crimes and whose past were known to many members of the public.“He knew that such an action was not just forbidden, as you can well imagine, but was something that, the crown says, was quite obvious to anybody who worked in or around the secure hospital system, an act that went to the very heart of the system and helped undermine all efforts to run such a system.”Earlier this year, Panton was cleared on appeal over payments to public officials. The prosecution dropped further charges against her.
