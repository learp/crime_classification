A man has been arrested for using a broadband internet connection in the street without the owner's permission.The 39-year-old was using his laptop while sitting on a wall outside a house in Chiswick, west London, when two community support officers challenged him.He was detained after admitting using the wireless internet connection without permission.Detective Constable Mark Roberts, of the Metropolitan police computer crime unit, said dishonestly using an unsecured wireless connection was a criminal offence."This arrest should act as a warning to anyone who thinks it is acceptable to illegally use other people's broadband connections," he said."To do so potentially breaches the Computer Misuse Act and the Communications Act ... computer users need to be aware that this is unlawful and police will investigate any violation we become aware of."Since the Communications Act was passed in 2003, only a handful of people have been prosecuted.In April this year, a man was cautioned by police after neighbours saw him using a laptop in a car parked outside a house in Redditch, Worcestershire.In 2005, a man was fined Â£500 for illegally using someone else's wireless broadband connection in London.The man arrested yesterday was released on bail until October pending further inquiries.Wireless networks must usually be protected with a password to block unauthorised users.
