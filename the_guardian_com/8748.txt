Gated communities, currently the preserve of homeowners prepared to pay a premium to protect their property, should be adopted by councils to improve community safety, the home secretary, David Blunkett, said today.Mr Blunkett's call to "make available to the many what is currently available to few" came at the New Local Government Network annual conference.Speaking on the theme of decentralising government, Mr Blunkett pitched the concept of localism at the micro level, suggesting self-contained communities could be the way to re-engage residents to local democracy and return a sense of community safety. He said: " As part of the government's big conversation we want to hear how we can make available to the many what is currently available to the few."Take, for example, gated communities where people contribute to the security of law and order of the area in which they live and to the quality of the environment."He envisaged residents paying for the upkeep and security of their immediate surroundings in a bid to make them feel greater ownership and involvement with their area. "The impact is about giving people confidence as well as working around regeneration," he said.Street wardens were already an example drawn from the gated community model, he said. Until local people took a greater part in community safety the police would continue to have an uphill struggle in preventing crime and anti-social behaviour, he added. "People who are fearful and frightened in their own lives are most likely to disengage," he said. "The moment that self-esteem and self-belief disappears in the community is the moment people try to get away from them. They undermine the capacity of communities to be part of the solution."Mr Blunkett took the opportunity to reassure the local government audience he would be speaking to police authorities about the charge they plan to levy on councils for this year which have a bearing on local council tax rises.An Audit Commission report published late last year revealed that several council tax rises had been forced up partly as a result of police authority precepts.
