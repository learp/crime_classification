It was in the afternoon that we heard the news that there had been a killing on our streets. Like everybody, I was in shock at the news – I had seen the footage – and I was obviously upset that a young man had been murdered, supposedly in the name of Islam. It was terrible. Lee Rigby's murder generated a strange atmosphere in our community and there was tension about what might happen.In the long-term local people, church groups and police came together to offer support. But in the aftermath there was anxiety. Five hours after Rigby's death, I had arrived at the mosque. It was about 7.15pm, just before prayer time, and I was helping to make snacks with a colleague when I heard a loud bang. I looked out of the kitchen window and saw smoke pouring out downstairs.Outside, a man had kicked the door open and thrown a smoke grenade inside. But at the time we didn't know that so we thought there must be a big fire. We tried to escape and crawled out of the window on to a flat roof – then we saw the man below, waving two knives. I warned him we were going to call the police. The guy began shouting: "Why don't you call your god, Allah? You guys are killing our people and I've come to take revenge and I'm going to slit your throat." We were trapped: we thought the mosque was on fire and if we jumped down we'd be jumping on to his knives.Luckily, the police came swiftly. The man, who we later learned to be Geoffrey Ryan, seemed pretty shocked by their arrival. When I went to see Ryan in prison, at first he avoided me, but eventually he came to me and apologised. He said: "Tell your guys you don't need to be afraid of me, I've learnt my lesson. I just lost it for a bit.'
