Leading politicians, clergy and prison reformers joined forces yesterday to launch a campaign aimed at overturning a 134-year old law which deprives prisoners of the right to vote.The campaign, Barred From Voting, is sponsored by the Prison Reform Trust and Unlock, the national association of ex-offenders. Supporters claim the ban contravenes article 3 of protocol 1 of the European convention on human rights which guarantees "free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot", for all citizens. The campaign seems certain to be resisted by the government, whose position on the issue was recently made clear by Lady Scotland, a Home Office minister. She said: "Prisoners convicted of a crime serious enough to warrant imprisonment have lost the moral authority to vote." That view is not shared by other politicians. Mark Oaten, the Liberal Democrats' spokesman on home affairs, said Britain's prisons are "failing prisoners, communities and taxpayers" by not equipping prisoners with the social skills required by responsible citizens. "Logic tells us that if we want people to return to their communities as law-abiding citizens, we must encourage them to play a part in their own futures by their own efforts and commitment," he said. Peter Bottomley, Conservative MP and a former minister, backed the campaign: "Voting in prison can be a useful first step to engaging in society." Ireland and the Netherlands have no ban on prisoners voting while eight other EU countries including France and Germany have laws which allow courts to take away the voting rights of prisoners as an additional punishment.
