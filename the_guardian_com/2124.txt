Police investigating the murder of the Cambridge student Sally Geeson are trying to establish whether her killer, Lance Corporal David Atkinson, was a serial sex attacker.Detectives said yesterday that forensic evidence had convinced them that the 31-year-old soldier, who leapt to his death from the seventh floor of a Glasgow hotel at the weekend, murdered Ms Geeson, 22. They now want to find out if he had struck before. The officer leading the murder investigation, Detective Superintendent Garry Swain, said Atkinson's DNA profile would go on the national database. He said police were following up reports about assaults "inside and outside Cambridge". Ms Geeson's body was found on Friday in woodland near the barracks where Atkinson was stationed. A postmortem examination showed she had died of asphyxiation and had been subjected to a "serious sexual assault". The student, who was in her final year at Anglia Polytechnic University, disappeared early on New Year's Day after celebrating in Cambridge. It is thought she was abducted as she tried to hail a taxi. Yesterday it emerged that Atkinson served eight months in a military prison after falsely imprisoning an 18-year-old Polish woman while based in Germany nearly eight years ago. Soldiers at Waterbeach, the Royal Engineers' barracks near Cambridge, where Atkinson lived, said he was a sexual predator who often drove around at night in search of women. Atkinson, from East Kilbride in Lanarkshire, returned to his unit after serving his prison term.
