If there is a precedent for the reform and rehabilitation of child criminals publicly assumed to be intrinsically evil and beyond help, then it comes in the form of Jon Venables and Robert Thompson.In 1993, after their abduction and murder of James Bulger, the 10-year-olds were not just deprived of their liberty but put through a comprehensive programme of psychotherapy, education and consistent, strict discipline.By 2001 the then-teenagers – equipped with A-levels and an ability to speak fluently about emotions and remorse – convinced parole boards that they were ready to be freed.The brothers behind the Edlington torture case are the most notorious British child criminals since Venables and Thompson. Hard as it might be for their victims' families to accept, it is possible that they, too, could turn their lives around.Five years after the Bulger killers were jailed, the Youth Justice Board (YJB) was set up to supervise the placement of young criminals into children's homes, training centres and young offender institutions.Peter Minchin, head of placements at the YJB, cannot discuss individual cases but is clear about the wider issues."We recognise that the issue of protecting the public from young people that commit horrific crimes is equally as important as trying to address the behaviour of the young people that have committed them," he said."It has to be done in parallel, but you can't wash your hands of people who are still so young. You can't throw away the key. They deserve another opportunity."The brothers in the Edlington case, aged 11 and 12, will be kept in a secure children's home. The usual progression would be to a secure training centre at about 15, and then to a young offender institution, but their many personal problems and notoriety could see them stay in a home.Such a regime, Minchin says, typically involves six hours of formal education a day, along with activities such as psychotherapy and art therapy."Each young child that comes into a secure children's home has a detailed plan put together specially designed to meet their individual needs," he said."Obviously, there is the punishment of taking away their liberty. But once this has been done you've then got an opportunity to do complex work and make a lot of progress."While Venables and Thompson had their anonymity removed, the brothers' names remain unknown outside a few streets in Doncaster.However, Minchin notes, it is hard for things to stay secret in a children's home."Children being children, they will talk. You often can't avoid them finding out what other people have done. We try and minimise the problem by keeping similar offenders in the same place."Sentencing outcryWhen Jon Thompson and Robert Venables, two 10-year-old boys, were sentenced to be detained for the murder of two-year-old James Bulger in 1993, they were the youngest people convicted of murder in English criminal history.The trial judge recommended a minimum tariff or term of eight years, saying the two should be kept in custody for "very, very many years to come".Shortly after their trial, the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, raised the minimum tariff to 10 years, but this did little to assuage a populist tabloid campaign – including a 300,000-signature Sun newspaper petition – claiming the case highlighted moral decay in Britain.In 1994 John Major, as prime minister, declared it was time for "society to condemn a little more and understand a little less". His home secretary, Michael Howard, raised the minimum tariff to 15 years.In 1997 this was overturned by the House of Lords. Peers condemned the higher tariff as "institutionalised vengeance ... by a politician playing to the gallery". In the process, the law lords ruled that it was unlawful for home secretaries to decide on the minimum tariffs to be served by offenders under 18.In 2000 the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, restored the original trial judge's recommendation of eight years in recognition of the good behaviour of Thompson and Venables."We ought not to forget that, although they committed those very serious crimes, they were first of all human beings and secondly they were children," he said."Children can do things when they are children that they would never do in their later life when they had matured and appreciated."The fact that Thompson and Venables had served all their sentence outside the prison system in local authority secure homes was also a key factor for Woolf, who described the prison service's young offenders' institutions as "a corrosive atmosphere" for juveniles.In 2001, after a six-month review, the parole board ruled that Venables and Thompson were no longer a threat to public safety and could be released on a life licence as their minimum tariff of eight years had expired that February.The decision was approved by David Blunkett, as the home secretary, and the two were given new identities and moved to secret locations under a witness protection-style programme.Their rehabilitation was regarded as a success for the criminal justice system.
