Britain is facing an epidemic of fuel theft, with police forces across the country reporting a steep rise in the number of people driving away from garages without paying. With the price of a litre of diesel and petrol now averaging £1.37 and £1.22 respectively, organised gangs are moving on to the forecourts, stealing number plates from the cars of innocent motorists to cover their tracks.Police report a rise in bilking - the driving off from petrol stations without paying - of between 5 per cent in Staffordshire and 65 per cent in Fife over the first four months of this year compared to the same period last year. North Yorkshire saw a 9 per cent rise over the same period, the West Midlands 30 per cent and Durham 60 per cent.Increasing numbers of forecourt owners have installed Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems and closed circuit television to stem the losses. Latest figures from the British Oil Security Syndicate (Boss) show total losses suffered by forecourt retailers in Britain during 2007 increased by 13 per cent to £32.5 million, due largely to petrol theft. 'It is costing the industry a lot of money,' said Kevin Eastwood, executive director of Boss. 'And reports from our members about the first quarter of 2008 suggest the problem is getting much worse.'
