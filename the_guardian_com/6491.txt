The mother of Shannon Matthews was today arrested in connection with the disappearance of her daughter.A West Yorkshire police spokesman said: "Police investigating the alleged abduction of a nine-year-old girl have arrested a 32-year-old woman in Dewsbury on suspicion of perverting the course of justice."A source connected to the investigation confirmed that the woman is Shannon's mother, Karen Matthews, 32. Shannon went missing in Dewsbury on February 19. She was found in the base of a bed at an address one mile from her home after a police search that lasted 24 days.News of the mother's arrest came as it was reported that Michael Donovan, 39, who is charged with Shannon's kidnapping and imprisonment, had been taken to hospital after cutting his wrists.Donovan, who is the uncle of Shannon's stepfather, Craig Meehan, has since been returned to prison.A prison service spokesman would not confirm details of the incident but said staff had responded "promptly and with great professionalism".Donovan's trial has been provisionally set for November at Leeds crown court.The West Yorkshire police investigation of Shannon's disappearance involved hundreds of officers and 60 detectives.Meehan, 22, appeared at Dewsbury magistrates court last week charged with 11 counts of possessing indecent images of children. He was remanded in custody to appear again on April 11.Meehan's sister, Amanda Hyett, 25, who lives next door to Shannon's mother in Moorside Road, and his mother, Alice Meehan, 49, were both arrested on Thursday in connection with the case.Meehan's sister was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, and his mother on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice.They were released on bail the following day pending further inquiries.
