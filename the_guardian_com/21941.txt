Last week, a report by Dame Anne Owers drew attention to the dangers of adopting a blanket approach to Muslims in prison – labelling them all extremists was likely to foster a sense of alienation that could, ironically, lead to radicalisation, she suggested.The detail of the report contained some interesting snippets of information: that prisoners might convert to Islam because of the sense of belonging and purpose it gave them, because of the better food during Ramadan, or as part of an effort to reform themselves.If it's true that religion finds fertile ground in places where people are at a low ebb, then it would seem natural that religion could flourish in prison. Certainly, there have been several high-profile converts.But can the moral and material structure that religion provides improve prison life, not just for the individual, but for everyone who works or lives there? Or is it simply a sticking plaster for a very desperate wound?Monday's responseErwin James: If religion can provide a measure of peace in a troubled environment or a troubled heart then it has to be a good thingTuesday's responseFrancis Davis: As a support system – and even, yes, as a way to make life more comfortable – religion is an essential part of prison lifeThursday's responseDanny Afzal: When I first went to jail, I gave up God for sausages and bacon butties. But in the end, it was religion that helped me surviveFriday's responseNaomi Phillips: Religion should be accommodated as far as is reasonable. But prison must remain a secular space
