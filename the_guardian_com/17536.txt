When people hear what I do for a living, they often say: "Oooh, I couldn't do that!" But it isn't about me, it's about protecting victims of abuse. As a content analyst for the Internet Watch Foundation, I assess reports of child sexual abuse and work to get illegal material blocked and removed.First, I have to decide, is the content illegal? Second, I need to look at the severity of the abuse. I view the act, then examine the likely age of the child involved. I look for clues that might tell us where the abuse took place. Any intelligence is passed to the police.It's not your everyday profession, but as a father I appreciate the need to protect children. Unsurprisingly, when it comes to parental chat at children's parties, my job can be a real conversation killer. I usually say I'm an "IT worker".Normality is my antidote. I shed the emotional detachment of my professional life with a change of clothes, a hug with my daughter and a hectic family life. We receive counselling at work. The counsellor asks how my home life is, how I am getting on with my daughter, partner, our unborn child. She asks: "Do you remember the images?" but I don't. I forget about them and process them away. I wonder if I am emotionless, but that's why I do this job. I seem to be able to cope with what I see.Report images of child sexual abuse anonymously and confidentially to iwf.org.uk.• Tell us what you're really thinking at mind@theguardian.com
