More than 60 eastern Europeans, allegedly required to work long hours for little money, were removed from Lincolnshire leek fields yesterday morning in the UK's biggest move against human trafficking for labour exploitation.Police believe the workers, aged 15 to 67, ended up with pay far below the minimum wage, after working up to 16 hours a day, six days a week.On top of the punishing shifts in the fields of East Anglia, the workers were spending up to four hours a day travelling in vans between the farms and their cramped accommodation in Northamptonshire and the West Midlands, according to the Serious Organised Crime Agency. It is thought some of the vegetables they picked went to the big supermarkets.Three men were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking for the purposes of labour exploitation, and four men and a woman were held on suspicion of people trafficking and money laundering. All are UK residents but their nationalities have not been not confirmed.Possibly hundreds of victims had been exploited, police said. Detectives suspect the workers, most of whom were in Britain legally, were recruited through adverts and agencies abroad, including in Poland and Lithuania.Police believe they would have been given money to get to the UK but then been required to pay it back, possibly with interest, from their earnings, and that passports or ID cards would have been taken and cash deducted for rent and transport to the fields. The system was "debt bondage", Andy Baker, Soca's deputy director, said.Baker said police believed violence was used against some of the people and that some worked without protective clothing and had cuts to their hands. Yesterday's swoop took place in pouring rain and the workers allegedly wore only light clothing. "There were virtually no health and safety measures taken. These conditions were pretty poor."More than 200 staff from nine organisations were involved in the operation in Holbeach, south Lincolnshire, and in Kettering, Northamptonshire, and other areas of the Midlands, where 21 houses were searched. The move took six months to plan.
