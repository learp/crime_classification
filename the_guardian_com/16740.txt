A police officer filmed driving at 159mph in order to "familiarise himself" with his vehicle must face a retrial for dangerous driving and speeding charges, the high court ruled yesterday.In December 2003 PC Mark Milton, an advanced driver with West Mercia constabulary, was recorded by his police car's video camera travelling at over 150mph on the M54 motorway, over 130mph on a road with a 60mph limit, and over 90mph on urban roads with a speed limit of 30.The court overturned the decision by district judge Bruce Morgan, sitting at Ludlow magistrates' court, to acquit Mr Milton, 38, from Telford, Shropshire, of dangerous driving and speeding charges. Dismissing the charges last May, Mr Morgan had said the officer was the "crème de la crème" of police drivers. But, ordering a fresh trial, Lady Justice Hallet, sitting with Mr Justice Owen, said whether a driver was "a total incompetent or Stirling Moss - or Jenson Button" was irrelevant.Edmund Lawson QC, for the director of public prosecutions, said: "This case raises issues of real public interest concerning whether a police officer can, with impunity, drive a police car at eye watering speeds when not responding to an emergency." John McGuinness QC, for Mr Milton, said the district judge had been right to take account of the officer's advanced driving skills, claiming the prosecution failed to establish that PC Milton's driving "fell far below that expected of a careful and competent driver".Lady Justice Hallett also invited chief constables to review whether police drivers were being "encouraged to hone their skills in unfamiliar vehicles at grossly excessive speeds on unfamiliar roads, both urban and motorway".
