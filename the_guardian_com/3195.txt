A university student is facing life imprisonment after being convicted of killing a fellow student and stuffing him into an airing cupboard.Emlyn Evans-Loude, 27, held his head in his hands on Wednesday after being found guilty of murdering Michal Mazur, 28.He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on Friday.Evans-Loude, the son of teacher parents from Barnstaple, Devon, had wept during his trial saying: "I beat him to death â€“ of course I was not in control. I lost it."Mazur, from Poland, was found in the cupboard of Evans-Loude's flat in Leytonstone, east London, by police in January.He had been beaten over the head with a dumbbell handle eight days after meeting the defendant at London Metropolitan University, where they were both students.Mazur, who was studying international relations, had gone to Evans-Loude's home for drinks.After the killing, the politics, philosophy and economics student telephoned others to say he had a "stiff" in his house and asking for help in getting rid of it.Evans-Loude was arrested at Exeter St David's railway station in Devon after the body was discovered.Bobbie Cheema, prosecuting, said he had left another message saying: "I've got a dead Polish bloke in my flat, I need to bury him in Epping Forest."Evans-Loude also asked his girlfriend for pictures of her in underwear and contacted a prostitute in the hours after Mazur's death.Cheema said he had been cautioned in the past for having cocaine and assaulting a former girlfriend after drinking.Evans-Loude claimed Mazur attacked him but friends and family said he was a hard-working student who was never aggressive.Mazur's father, Kazimaerz, said: "The death of my son has impoverished many people. He was an older brother to many of his colleagues at university."His mother, Stefania Mazur, said she would never understand what led to the anger which resulted in her son's death, but hoped his killer would one day be able to "repair and change his life".
