The Home Office is ramping up its campaign to recruit top graduates to its fast track police trainee scheme in the wake of positive publicity over the service's emergency response to the London bombings.While keen not to appear "crass" by basing an entire campaign on the work of the police since July 7, the service's PR advisors plan to use some case studies of people who worked in the emergency response to the bombings and on the following investigation to promote the scheme.The three-year old High Potential Development scheme recruits high-flying graduates and existing officers to fast-track into senior roles following an intense tailor-made programme of working in different departments of the police force. They might spend a period on the beat, then with CID, in a managerial position and on policy. But they could also spend time working in the anti-terrorist branch or with the anti-drugs squad.The government has appointed the Blue Rubicon PR agency to head-up its Autumn campaign, which will feature high-profile advertisements designed by M&C Saatchi.Gordon Tempest-Hay, managing director of Blue Rubicon, said: "The scheme is not about going straight into armed response situations. We want to identify future leaders of the force and we want to provide them with a suitable training programme so that they can manage the police service in the future."He emphasised there was no lack of skilled people within the force, but said the scheme was about identifying future leaders."Following the first London bombings everyone said the police had done an amazing job. However awful the recent bombings were, they provide a platform for demonstrating the kind of valuable work that senior officers are involved in."Lindsay Broadway, head of the scheme, said: "The Home Office is committed to working with forces across England and Wales to develop the future leaders of the police service."The police High Potential Development scheme is a structured programme to develop officers with leadership potential through to these senior roles and forms part of the wider police reform agenda to build a modern, citizen-focused police service that responds to communities' needs."
