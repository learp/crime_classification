Missing schoolgirl Shannon Matthews was last night in protective custody after police found her less than a mile from her home, hidden in the base of a bed.Police smashed their way into a flat in Batley Carr yesterday afternoon after a neighbour reported hearing light footsteps in the property above. A 39-year-old man who was in the flat - believed to be the uncle of the girl's stepfather - has been arrested on suspicion of abduction.Soon after learning her daughter was alive, Shannon's mother Karen, 32, and her stepfather Craig Meehan, 22, were taken from their home in Dewsbury's Moorside estate after being told the nine-year-old was safe. They first heard their daughter had been found alive by text message from a family friend.The couple had run a high-profile campaign to find Shannon, who disappeared on February 19 shortly after leaving school. Shannon's grandparents had accused Meehan of driving her away, an accusation he and Ms Matthews denied.They had maintained throughout the investigation that their daughter would be found alive. Shannon's biological father, Leon Rose, said he was thrilled Shannon had been found alive. "I did say I wasn't going to give up until she was found," he said. Witnesses reported seeing Shannon looking calm as she was taken out of the property by police. Shortly afterwards a handcuffed man was taken from the property into a police vehicle. Neighbours said he was a loner who rarely spoke to them.The rescue brought to an end a search for Shannon. Hundreds of police officers and dog search teams had scoured the area. Earlier this week West Yorkshire police described the search as the largest operation of its kind since the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper.
