Victorian laws under which thousands of gay men have been prosecuted are to be repealed as part of an overhaul of Britain's sexual offences laws proposed by the Home Office yesterday.The official review set up two years ago by the home secretary, Jack Straw, to develop a new code of sex offences proposes changes not only to the laws on gay sex but also creating new offences of persistent child abuse, voyeurism and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The proposals are also laced with recommendations for much tougher sentences for transgressors. But while the review group recommended radical change in the gay sex laws it is more cautious in its approach to the rape laws. The report, Setting the Boundaries, rejects suggestions that it should be made easier to prosecute alleged rapists by reversing the burden of proof or introducing a lesser offence of "date rape". However, it is the proposals to remove remaining discrimination against gay men by abolishing the offences of buggery, gross indecency and soliciting by men which are likely to prove contentious. Home Office ministers are said to be nervous about the political impact of any such action. The review group, which proposes legalising all consensual sexual activity between adults in private which cause no harm, says the time when the criminal law could be used to discriminate against homosexuals should be long gone.
