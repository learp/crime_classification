A nurse who tried to kill an elderly widow with a drug overdose, allegedly so she could get her hands on money she stood to inherit, was yesterday found guilty of attempted murder.Donna Cumming, 42, of Exeter, had been friends with Dorothea Andrews, 81, for 23 years when she administered a large dose of drugs to Mrs Andrews as she recovered from a stomach operation in hospital.Cumming, who was formerly a nursing home matron earning £27,000 a year, was the sole beneficiary of Mrs Andrews's will and had been due to inherit more than £100,000 when Mrs Andrews died.The court heard that Cumming, who is married with a daughter, gave the pensioner a potentially fatal overdose of the painkiller diamorphine by deliberately tampering with the machine which delivered the drug intravenously.Cumming, who pleaded not guilty to the charge, said the overdose happened accidentally when she picked up the machine and she did not tell hospital staff because of "panic", but experts said it was impossible to deliver such a large dose in this way.A housekeeper noticed that Mrs Andrews was in a coma and called nurses. They revived her with an antidote and she recovered completely, but died of unrelated causes two months later.When nurses called Cumming with the news that Mrs Andrews's medication dispenser had been tampered with, they were surprised by her reaction. She did not seem surprised and even giggled.Mrs Andrews's estate was valued at more than £100,000 and after a £10,000 and professional fees, Cumming stood to inherit £110,000.The court also heard that Cumming had been given power of attorney over Mrs Andrews's affairs days before the murder attempt.She had already used it to close one of Mrs Andrews's building society accounts and transfer the £4,000 balance to her own daughter's account. The court heard Cumming was worried Mrs Andrews would have to pay for her care once she was discharged from the Royal Devon and Exeter hospital, where she was recovering from a colon operation, and this would swallow up the inheritance.The two had been best friends since living next door to each other in Exeter 23 years previously, and had stayed close when Mrs Andrews moved to a flat in Hevitree, Exeter. Mrs Andrews had no heirs, as her husband and daughter had died and she had lost contact with the rest of her family.Following the jury's guilty verdict at Exeter crown court, the judge, Mr Justice Steel, granted Cumming bail with conditions, while he waited for a sentencing report to be prepared.The judge accepted that Cumming was of previous good character, but told her defence counsel, Ian Pringle QC: "Your client must be under no illusion - a custodial sentence of some significance will be the outcome, but I need to know a great deal more about her."Mrs Andrews's estate is being held by solicitors pending the result of the case, and the judge may have to decide how to dispose of it when he sentences Cumming next month.
