A Spanish journalist who claimed that the disappearance of four-year-old Madeleine McCann was linked to a international paedophile ring has been questioned by police.A spokesman for Portuguese police said Antonio Toscano, 36, was interviewed by police for two hours yesterday but added that they were "cautious" about treating the information as a new lead.Mr Toscano had told the media he believed a man known as The Frenchman, who he said was involved in a Europe-wide paedophile network, was linked to Madeleine's disappearance.He claimed The Frenchman was overheard saying he was travelling to the Algarve before Madeleine went missing from her room in the resort of Praia da Luz on May 3 while her parents, Gerry and Kate, were eating in a restaurant 100 yards away.Police confirmed Mr Toscano originally contacted them several weeks ago but gave few details. He has described himself as an "investigator" who specialises in missing person cases.A spokeswoman for the McCann family would not comment on Mr Toscano's claims but said Madeleine's parents were urging anyone with information to come forward.
