A lawyer who stabbed his wife to death in a ferocious attack was found guilty of manslaughter today and jailed for five years.A jury at Manchester crown court cleared Christopher Lumsden of murder but found him guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.Lumsden, a banking partner at the international law firm Pinsent Masons, attacked his wife, Alison, at their home in March last year.Five days before the killing, Mrs Lumsden, 53, had told her husband that she was leaving him for a family friend, Roger Flint, and wanted a divorce.Mr Flint and his wife Fiona had known the Lumsdens for around 15 years. The couples played tennis and bridge together, and Mr Flint and Lumsden went to rugby matches, even after the affair had started.Lumsden told the court how he had tried to put on a brave face, carry on with normal life and continue to entertain colleagues. But on the night of March 16, after returning home from a business trip to London and dinner with a colleague, he "broke".He plunged a 12cm kitchen knife in his wife's back at their home in Bowdon, Cheshire, and stabbed her repeatedly in the face and neck.Pathologist Charles Wilson said the wounds were so severe that he was unable to tell how many times the knife had been thrust in and out.A clinical psychologist, Keith Scholey, told the court that Lumsden had "schizoid" traits and had had a troubled childhood. He also had a rare form of muscular dystrophy which was causing him pain and limiting his mobility.Judge Mr Justice Mitting told Lumsden, 52, that he would serve half the sentence and the time he had spent on remand would count towards that.
