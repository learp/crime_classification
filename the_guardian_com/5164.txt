Three customs officers are to face criminal charges after a six-year corruption investigation by West Midlands police, it emerged yesterday.The officers, including one of a senior rank, are to be prosecuted for misconduct in public office - an anti-corruption charge carrying a maximum of life imprisonment.Charges against a further five officers and a former Customs informant are not being pursued.The Guardian understands that the allegations relate to evidence collected during an undercover operation against two customs officers and an informant.Further allegations are believed to be linked to a Customs operation in 1993, called Operation Begonia, in which members of the Cali cocaine cartel were persuaded to import £37m of cocaine into the UK. Two Colombians were convicted.The investigation into corruption, known as Operation Brandfield, started as an undercover operation by the National Crime Squad in 1998, but was transferred to the West Midlands police the following year.The investigation originally centred on operations in Latin America, but expanded to include at least 11 Customs "controlled deliveries" in which up to 200kg of heroin from Pakistan was imported by Customs' participating informants in the 90s.A controlled delivery takes place when officials are able to monitor, via an informant or undercover officer, an existing smuggling operation through to delivery and catch not only the suppliers but also the end buyers in Britain.There are strict guidelines covering such operations. Law enforcement agencies are not permitted to initiate the plotThe West Midlands inquiry has already led to at least one man being released over fears that he may have been the victim of a miscarriage of justice.Shauket Ali was sentenced to five years in prison in 1998 for the possession of heroin said to be worth £10m, imported by a Customs' participating informant. It was later discovered to be so impure that it was worth less than £2m.While serving his sentence Mr Ali was contacted by the Scottish prosecution agency, which suggested he appeal. In 2002 his conviction was quashed in a 15-minute hearing.In a statement West Midlands police said: "Following the submission of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service three officers, one serving and two retired, of Her Majesty's Customs & Excise are due to be summonsed for the offence of misconduct in a public office."
