Police have launched a triple murder investigation following a house fire in which a father and his two children died.Officers spent the early hours of Sunday morning interviewing motorists around the area where the fire was started, following the death on Saturday of Thomas Starkey from burns he suffered in the blaze a week ago.His 21-year-old son, also called Thomas, was killed in the 24 July fire in Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, and his eight-year-old daughter Bridget died shortly after arriving at the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley.Their mother Angela Sharkey, 46, is still critically ill in hospital, and is not aware that her husband and children are dead.Between 4am and 6am on Sunday, exactly one week after the blaze, officers from Strathclyde Police stopped approximately 95 vehicles around the family's home.Detective Inspector Graham Cordner from the inquiry team said the interviewing of motorists was part of their ongoing inquiry."We had received an encouraging response from motorists and we will be following up each piece of information given to us," he said. "Someone, out of misplaced loyalty, may well be protecting this killer and it is time for them to look at their conscience and make that call to us."Three members of a family are now dead and their wife and mum has yet to hear this devastating news."Emergency services were called to the fire at around 5.10am last Sunday. The blaze broke out in the living room and quickly spread. Police said the building had just one door and the family had been trapped.
