A cyclist who became Britain's most prolific tyre slasher after being soaked once too often by passing drivers apologised yesterday for his vendetta against the motorists of Dorset.During his 10-day rampage last December, Ashley Carpenter stabbed more than 2,000 tyres in Bournemouth, Boscombe and Christchurch. His revenge against "inconsiderate motorists" cost almost Â£250,000. Mr Carpenter, 37, of Bournemouth, was jailed for 16 months in April but has emerged from prison a changed man. On his release, he said that, if he won the lottery, he would take a cheque to the police and ask them to give the money to everyone whose tyres he wrecked. Mr Carpenter, who is on curfew, tried to explain what had made him crack. "It was all due to the incompetence of the people on the road. I was nearly knocked off my bike, abused and swerved into. "I was walking home one night and a car sped up into a massive puddle and I was drenched. That was the last straw. I went out and deflated the tyres. I was just so frustrated. "But when the inconsiderate driving continued around me I just thought I might as well go on another night. "I just thought: 'Why not target the whole town to make it look like a ghost town for a day?' That was my only intention. I didn't want to endanger anyone." He admitted he had gone too far: "It was wrong and it was shameful."
