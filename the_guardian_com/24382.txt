The supermodel Naomi Campbell was yesterday charged with six offences after allegedly assaulting two police officers at Heathrow during last month's baggage chaos at terminal five.She allegedly became abusive towards British Airways cabin crew after they told her one of her checked-in bags had not been loaded on to a Los Angeles-bound flight. The cabin crew had apparently told her she could either fly to Los Angeles without her bag or disembark and book on to a later service. During the fracas she was handcuffed and taken off the jet by police officers and held in custody for eight hours. If convicted, Campbell, 38, who appeared at Heathrow police station yesterday to answer bail, could face a prison term and a fine of up to Â£5,000 for the assault.The Crown Prosecution Service said the charges included two of using threatening, abusive words or behaviour to cabin crew and one of disorderly conduct.Reading a statement on her behalf her lawyer, Simon Nicholls, said: "Miss Campbell is bitterly disappointed that the prosecutors have advised her she is to be prosecuted for various offences. Prosecutors in this case have decided she needs to be prosecuted at magistrates court. She respects that decision and she hopes this matter is dealt with expeditiously." After a half-hour interview with Heathrow police, the model was whisked away in a chauffeur-driven Mercedes. Nicholls said his client was due to appear at Uxbridge magistrates court on June 20.There have been previous run-ins with celebrities at Heathrow. In 2006 a fracas in a British Airways lounge resulted in the arrest of the US rapper Snoop Dogg and several of his 30-strong entourage.
