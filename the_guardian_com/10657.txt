The premises of British businessmen suspected of involvement in an international conspiracy to pay bribes for securing contracts in developing countries were raided today by the Serious Fraud Office.Two British businessmen were yesterday arrested as part of a series of globally co-ordinated raids and were last night being interviewed. The SFO, responsible for investigating serious and complex fraud, said search warrants were executed in London, Surrey, Hampshire, Thames Valley and Cumbria in connection with an investigation jointly mounted with Australian federal police.SFO inquiries were focusing on "employees and agents" of Australian firm Securency International, a company that specialises in the production of polymer banknotes and is half-owned by the Reserve Bank of Australia.The UK warrants coincided with a series of raids in Spain and Australia. Two warrants were executed by Spanish authorities in relation to three British nationals, the SFO said. Six warrants were executed on residential premises in Australia.Eight residential and commercial properties in the UK were searched in an operation involving more than 80 SFO staff, supported by police from five forces.Huge bribes are alleged to have been paid by Securency or its agents to foreign officials, including politicians and bankers in Africa, South America and Asia, between the 1990s and 2009.SFO director Richard Alderman said: "This is an excellent example of how anti-fraud agencies around the world are working together to fight economic crime."
