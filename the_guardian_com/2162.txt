Two soldiers have been jailed after viciously assaulting two disabled teenagers for their own entertainment in what a judge described as a “chilling and sadistic attack”.Jason Ferguson, 18, and John Ward, 19, lured their victims into an alley after meeting them on a drunken night out near their army camp at Sennybridge in the Brecon Beacons.The teenagers – a 16-year-old deaf boy with autism and his 18-year-old autistic friend – were then assaulted and subjected to verbal abuse.Prosecutor Sue Ferrier said: “What happened beggars belief. They were unlucky enough to cross the paths of these men who had been drinking all night and were heavily intoxicated.”“Their two victims were targeted. They were identified because of their particular vulnerabilities.”Merthyr Tydfil crown court was told that the “naive, trusting and innocent” teenagers believed the two squaddies, who were based near their home village, were being friendly.Ferrier said that the two young victims led sheltered lives, adding: “They were particularly naive. They did not appreciate they were being lined up with what was to follow – a brutal and sadistic attack.”After coming across the teenagers as they were walking home together, the two soldiers began verbally abusing them and filming the insults on their phones, the court was told. After they were led into the alley, the younger boy was beaten and kicked unconscious by Ferguson as his friend was held back by Ward. The 16-year-old was left in a coma for three days.His friend was then punched, kicked and hit with a terracotta pot from a nearby house, but managed to escape and raise the alarm at home.Ferguson and Ward, privates attached to 3 Scots, burned their clothing in woodland before heading back to their camp after the attack in July 2015.One of their victims is deaf while the other was described as a “caring young man” who spends a lot of time indoors on his Xbox and struggles to mix with people.Ferguson, of Leyland, Lancashire, admitted two counts of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. His defence lawyer said that he had a wretched upbringing and had been abandoned by his drug-addicted parents before entering the army at the age of 16.Ward, of Oakley, Fife, admitted wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm and unlawful wounding. His lawyer said that Ward would have not done what he did had it not been for Ferguson.Ferguson was sentenced to eight years and eight months in a young offender institution and Ward for seven years.Judge Daniel Williams told them: “You saw those boys as entertainment and you saw their differences as reason to torment and bully them and beat them unconscious.“There was gratuitous degradation. Miraculously, there was no long-term physical injury.”
