Two men have been charged with the murder of the oil executive Carole Waugh.Rakesh Bhayani, 40, and Nicholas Kutner, 47, will appear at Croydon magistrates' court on Thursday.Both Bhayani and Kutner have already been charged with fraud offences linked to Waugh's disappearance.Waugh's body was found with a single stab wound inside a car at a garage in Lime Court, New Malden, south-west London, on 2 August.Originally from Durham but living in London, Waugh, 50, had not been seen by her family since mid-April and was reported missing on 7 May.Bhayani, who is unemployed, of Chamberlayne Avenue, Wembley, north-west London, is due to appear in court next month on three charges of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation worth about Â£280,000, following transactions associated with Waugh's identity.Kutner, of no fixed address, was originally arrested on suspicion of murder and kidnap on 1 August.He also faces two charges relating to renting Waugh's property at Tressard Court in central London and one of unlawfully withdrawing funds from her bank account.He is facing a fraud charge after being accused of pretending to be Waugh's brother Chris in a bid to sell her London home.Waugh had lived and worked in Libya for a number of years but returned to London in 2008 and would regularly visit relatives in Durham and Cumbria.Her former boss, Stuart Anderson, told journalists she had fled Libya after being threatened by someone in Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime but a Scotland Yard spokesman has said inquiries are focused on London.So far 13 people have been arrested in connection with the inquiry into her disappearance. At least three women have tried to pose as her since she vanished, police have said.Her flat is in an affluent part of central London and her brother Chris Waugh has said she was "very frugal and careful" with money. Scotland Yard has investigated links to dating sites and appealed for information about the blue Volkswagen Golf in which Waugh's body was found.
