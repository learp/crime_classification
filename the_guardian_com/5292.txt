The system for dealing with deaths in custody in England and Wales breaches the European convention on human rights, a study published by the human rights group Liberty yesterday concludes.Relatives of people who died in police custody or prison backed the report, which calls for radical changes to the way such cases are investigated. The 80-page study, which took a year to compile, proposes reform of the inquest system and the procedures for deciding on prosecutions of police officers, prison warders and others involved in prisoners' deaths. The research was overseen by an advisory board chaired by the Labour MP Vera Baird, QC, and included academics, senior lawyers and police representatives. The report condemns the current system as often "ineffective, secretive, slow and insufficiently independent". Overlapping roles of the police, coroner and police complaints authority left relatives of the dead "too often excluded and marginalised", it says. It calls for deaths in police custody, prison and secure hospitals to be investigated independently, and urges the setting up of a standing commission to learn lessons from each case.
