An Irish businessman has become the first person to be convicted in connection with the Northern Bank robbery, which netted the IRA more than £26m.Ted Cunningham, 60, a Cork-based financial adviser, was found guilty yesterday of laundering more than £3m connected with the heist - the biggest cash robbery in the UK. After deliberating for nearly six hours, a jury of seven men and five women at Cork circuit criminal court found Cunningham guilty on 10 counts relating to money laundering.The jury heard evidence from 75 prosecution witnesses and two defence witnesses, and they were given access to 65 exhibits produced in the case, which began on 14 January.Judge Con Murphy told the jury on Thursday he was sending them home for the evening. He asked them to reconvene at 10.30am yesterday at the courthouse to resume deliberations. "This is the people of Ireland against Mr Cunningham, not the Northern Bank against Mr Cunningham or the garda against Mr Cunningham. I require from you a unanimous verdict on each of the 10 charges."The judge, who spent more than 11 hours summing up the case, told the jury that to convict Cunningham they had to be almost certain that he possessed or used the money at issue and that he knew or believed it to be stolen.The robbery at the Northern Bank's Belfast headquarters was carried out by the IRA, according to Sir Hugh Orde, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.Cunningham is due back in court for sentencing on 24 April.
