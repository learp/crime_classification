Two men have been arrested in connection with the continuing investigation into child sexual exploitation which led to the jailing of nine men in Rochdale earlier this month.The arrests are the result of information given by one of the five girls who gave evidence at Liverpool crown court in the case of sexual abuse of children and young women in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.The court heard the girl was also abused from the age of 15 by four men who she knew only by their nicknames.A spokesman for Greater Manchester police said: "Two men have been arrested in connection with an ongoing investigation into child sexual exploitation in Rochdale, which led to the jailing of nine men. Both men, aged 33, from the Rochdale area were arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and rape."They have now been released on bail pending further inquiries."The inquiry is separate to a suspected second child grooming case in the town – pre-dating the Liverpool crown court case – which concerns one of 47 women questioned by police.Nine men, aged between 24 and 38, who were arrested on suspicion of sexual activity with a child from 2005 are on bail pending further inquiries.Earlier this month, eight men from the British Pakistani community and an Afghan received jail sentences of between four and 19 years. The judge said they treated their victims "as though they were worthless and beyond any respect".The trial in Liverpool heard the five girls – aged between 13 and 15 – were given alcohol, food and money in return for sex and were sometimes subjected to violence. The offences happened in and around Rochdale in 2008 and 2009.The men were convicted of conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children under the age of 16 and other sexual offences including rape and trafficking for sexual exploitation.
