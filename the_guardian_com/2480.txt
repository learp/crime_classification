Downing Street and the Conservatives were today at loggerheads over police numbers in Nottingham, as crime took centre stage among election issues.Local MPs will tonight meet the police minister Hazel Blears after an allegation at the weekend from chief constable Steven Green that a lack of resources forced him to "farm out" murder investigations to other forces.But as the Tories today pounced on the issue to claim the police were "handcuffed by political correctness and paperwork", one Labour Nottingham MP turned on the chief constable for his "very naive or very foolish" remarks.And the prime minister's spokesman said the force had received "significant support" in resources. He added: "Everyone recognises there are problems in Nottinghamshire but there are different views about the cause of these problems."He said the force had seen a 4.8% increase in its grant - "well above the minimum granted to all police authorities". It had 200 more officers than in 1997, and 267 more civilian staff.Nottingham North MP Graham Allen said the comments - made in the Sunday Telegraph - were "very regrettable" and smacked of "talking Nottingham down". He also insisted there was a determined effort to fight back against crime locally."Nottinghamshire Constabulary have got an extra 319 police officers since 2000, which is a serious increase. One has to ask whether they are being properly deployed," he said."The remarks are either very naive or very foolish. When you're trying to fight back against serious crime, it demoralises officers to read from their own chief constable through the media that he can't keep up with violent crime."Mr Allen said he had spoken to Mr Green at least twice last week but the officer had not raised the matter with him. Highlighting the issue in the media was not the way to resolve the problem, he added."The meeting with Hazel Blears and Nottinghamshire colleagues will discuss the conduct of the chief constable and the conduct of policing in the Nottinghamshire area," he went on."If there is a problem we will raise it ... but, in a way, the chief constable has to operate as the person responsible for the police in Nottinghamshire rather than as if he were an outsider with no direct accountability for some of the difficulties."He should be a part of the answer. I hope he won't become a part of the problem."At a press conference today, Mr Howard, a former home secretary, said a Conservative government would scrap targets and cut back on paperwork to free up officers to tackle crime.He said: "The police now spend as much time behind their desks filling in forms as they do on our streets."We are never going to tackle crime and disorder if we don't trust police men and women to exercise their common sense and their judgement.In the Sunday Telegraph Mr Green said he had been in talks with another force about help in tackling the latest in a string of fatal shootings in Nottingham - that of 34-year-old Paul Thomas in Radford on Thursday.He also said he was preparing to pass on category C murder investigations such as domestic cases to colleagues in other forces because his own detectives were over-stretched.Mr Green highlighted figures showing that Nottingham had seen a sharp rise in high profile category A murders. Whereas before 2001 there was one such investigation every 12 to 18 months, there have been some 21 in the past four years."We are getting by because of the incredible hard work of our officers, and my detectives are extremely hard-pressed to cope with all this."If they were combat troops they would be getting six months off," he said."We are struggling to cope with the number of murders we have got to deal with and we are only able to cope because we are bringing in officers from other forces."John Hammond, chairman of Nottinghamshire Police Federation, said they had sympathy with Mr Green's standpoint and that it further highlighted their repeated calls for increased resources.He said they were looking for an increase in the annual Â£140m in Home Office funding to help in the prevention, rather than the detection, of crime.Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said it was "vital" that ministers took note of the concerns."Form-filling should not be getting in the way of fighting violent crime. The police should be out on the streets deterring and detaining criminals, not stuck behind desks filling in endless mountains of paperwork."It was unclear whether there would be a press conference or any public reaction following this afternoon's meeting at the Home Office.
