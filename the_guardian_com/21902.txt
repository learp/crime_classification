Three Labour MPs and a Tory peer face up to seven years in jail after they were charged today with several counts of false accounting in relation to their expenses claims dating back to 2004.Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, said charges relating to tens of thousands of pounds had been laid against them, that involved "dishonestly claiming" mortgages, rent, stationery and cleaning services, and in, some cases, the use of allegedly false invoices.The criminal cases against the Labour MPs Jim Devine, David Chaytor and Elliot Morley, and the Tory peer Lord Hanningfield, will involve a complex legal battle over the extent to which they were covered by parliamentary privilege."Lawyers representing those who have been charged have raised with us the question of parliamentary privilege," Starmer said. "We have considered that question and concluded that the applicability and extent of any parliamentary privilege claimed should be tested in court."Today all four of those charged said they would defend themselves. They will appear before City of Westminster magistrates on 11 March, charged with false accounting under section 17 of the Theft Act 1968, which carries a maximum jail term of seven years.Gordon Brown said: "I am very angry about what has happened. We took steps some months ago to remove the right of these people [the MPs] to stand as candidates for the Labour party. These are very serious criminal allegations. All criminal allegations have got to be investigated. It's a matter now for the courts. We have got to get rid of that old politics, it cannot be part of the new system."Lord Hanningfield, who is charged with six counts of false accounting between March 2006 and May 2009, said he was "extremely disappointed" and insisted all his expenses claims had been made in good faith. He resigned as frontbench business spokesman in the Lords and from his post as leader of Essex county council, and was suspended from the parliamentary Conservative party.The three MPs have engaged the same legal firm, Steel and Shamash, who also act as the Labour party's solicitors.The MPs said in a joint statement: "We are clearly extremely disappointed that the DPP has decided to instigate proceedings against us. We totally refute any charges that we have committed an offence and we will defend our position robustly."They added that they believed their cases should have been dealt with by the parliamentary standards commissioner, adding: "We are confident of our position and have been advised by eminent QCs."Some MPs and legal experts questioned whether a defence of parliamentary privilege could be sustained. David Heath, the Liberal Democrats' constitutional affairs spokesman MP, said: "If there is any question about whether parliamentary privilege gives protection against prosecution for fraud, then parliament should make it very clear by passing a resolution to say that it does not."Speaking later in a television interviews, Devine, MP for Livingston in West Lothian, said he did not understand why he was being "picked on." He said: "We've never argued we are above the law. What should have happened, I believe and we believe, is that we should have been referred through the parliamentary procedure in the first instance."Chaytor, the MP for Bury North, told the Guardian: "I did not profit from the expenses system, I deny all charges. We will be fighting our case through the court and clear our names."All three MPs have already been barred from standing as Labour candidates at the next election.The charges were announced after a nine-month inquiry by the Metropolitan police that led to detectives handing over files on six individuals to the CPS. They came after the damning verdict, on Thursday of Sir Thomas Legg, about the "deeply flawed" House of Commons allowance system. Legg ordered about 390 MPs and former MPs to repay a total of £1.3m, reduced to £1.12m after appeals.Starmer said, after a careful review by prosecuting lawyers, there was sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the four individuals and that it was in the public interest to do so. All are charged with false accounting dating back to 2004.Morley, MP for Scunthorpe, faces two charges that he dishonestly claimed £30,428 more than he was entitled to via second-home expenses on a house in Winterton, near Scunthorpe, between 2004 and 2007, including an 18-month period after the mortgage had been paid off.Chaytor is accused of three counts involving £1,950 worth of IT services, using allegedly false invoices, dishonestly claiming £12,925 for purportedly renting a property he owned, and claiming £5,425 for renting a home in Bury, Lancashire, from his mother.Devine was charged with two counts involving dishonestly claiming £3,240 for cleaning services and £5,505 for stationery, using false invoices.Hanningfield is charged with six counts of false accounting between March 2006 and May 2009 for submitting expenses claims for overnight stays in London when records show he was driven home.Starmer said the CPS was considering one further unnamed case, while insufficient evidence had been found to charge the Labour party's former chairman, Lord Clarke of Hampstead.The Tory leader, David Cameron, said: "The police and prosecution authorities should prosecute anybody who has broken the law, without fear or favour."
