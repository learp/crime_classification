A man in Greater Manchester has been arrested on suspicion of "child destruction" after he allegedly punched his pregnant partner in the stomach, causing her to lose the baby.The 16-year-old girl was seven months pregnant when she miscarried on Thursday this week, following the domestic incident at Copster Hill Park in Oldham.An 18-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of child destruction and a section 18 assault, Greater Manchester police said. He remains in police custody while inquiries are ongoing.Detective chief inspector Jamie Daniels said: "The circumstances surrounding this are exceptionally tragic."We have specially trained officers supporting the girl, who is distraught by what happened in a way I cannot begin to imagine."To punch a heavily pregnant woman in the stomach is an unthinkable act and I can only reassure people that we are doing everything we can to fully and thoroughly investigate the full circumstances of this appalling crime."The incident happened in a public park in broad daylight and we know from what people have already said to us that others may have been present in or around the park who have seen this take place or have information that can help us with this investigation."We need to speak to these people urgently. If anyone has any information, please don't hesitate to contact us."The charge of "child destruction" is rare these days, but is occasionally used by prosecutors to mark the violent death of an unborn child.The offence comes under the Infant Life Preservation Act 1929 and aims to protect the rights of an unborn child that is capable of being born alive. In UK legal terms, murder cannot be committed against a baby in the womb.Anyone with information in relation to the Oldham incident is asked to call the police on 101, or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
