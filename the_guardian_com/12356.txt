Clare Dyer rightly highlights the concern that services for complainants of sexual assault are becoming increasingly disparate across the UK, with many police forces outsourcing these services to commercial companies that employ overseas doctors with little experience or commitment to the work (Evidence-gathering in rape cases in crisis, doctors warn, May 8).The new faculty of forensic and legal medicine, which has been established by the Royal College of Physicians, shares this concern. Although the number of reported rapes represents only a tiny proportion of all recorded crimes, the severity of its impact on victims and the fear of the crime give it major importance within the criminal justice system.The marked decline in the percentage of successful prosecutions for rape offences, which in the UK has dropped from 33% in 1977 to 5.6% in 2002, is therefore a cause for serious concern. While there are many causes for the unacceptably high attrition rates, one of these is unquestionably the variable quality of medical evidence in court.Complainants of sexual assault are entitled to be examined by a forensic practitioner with the specialist knowledge, skills and attitudes to gather evidence objectively, impartially and with compassion - anything less than this can rightly be considered further abuse.It is clearly unacceptable for a complainant to be examined by a doctor whose command of English is so poor that he can communicate with neither the complainant nor the jury, as Dyer reported. Nor can it be right that two adolescent girls should be examined by a locum doctor who normally works as an orthopaedic registrar and who has no theoretical or practical experience of dealing with victims of sexual assaults.But not only must doctors be competent to examine complainants of sexual assault, they must also have the training and experience to understand the pitfalls of giving expert evidence in court, and be able to express high-quality opinions that are evidence-based and free of dogma. Clearly doctors also need to be in this country - and not their homelands - in order to give evidence.At present there is no formal specialist recognition within the medical establishment for those who practise forensic and legal medicine, such as forensic physicians who examine rape victims.Key objectives for our faculty are to obtain such recognition and ensure the highest professional standards of competence and ethical integrity. It must become unacceptable for outsourced companies to provide services without appropriate specialist support.The Home Office, in recognising the importance of improving forensic and healthcare provision to the police service, has provided us with support and resources. It is to be hoped that those police forces which outsource forensic medical services share these views, and ensure that providers employ doctors with the appropriate expertise and experience. If not, there is a real danger of the innocent being convicted and the guilty going free.· Dr Guy Norfolk is president of the Royal College of Physicians' faculty of forensic and legal medicine guy.norfolk@btinternet.com· The Response column offers those who have been written about in the Guardian an opportunity to reply.
