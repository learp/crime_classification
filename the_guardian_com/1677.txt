Police should be given powers to seize young troublemakers' mobile phones or bikes as punishment for antisocial behaviour, the Conservatives said today.Chris Grayling, the shadow home secretary, said he wanted officers to confiscate such possessions for up to a month to deter badly behaved youths.He said losing their phone or bike would be a "21st century clip around the ear" for youngsters who stepped out of line, and would help disrupt gang activity.The idea is part of wider plans to give officers more discretion to hand out punishments in communities blighted by antisocial "yobs".Grayling has already suggested young people could be grounded by the authorities and only allowed out to go to school.In a speech to a thinktank in central London, he said government policies aimed at tackling louts, such as antisocial behaviour orders, were "over-prescriptive" and "over-bureaucratic".He told an audience at the Centre for Policy Studies that all police officers ought to be given more discretion and better punishments to deal with the "Nokia generation".Informal community punishments would help police deal with antisocial behaviour without leaving troublemakers with a long-term criminal record that could harm their employment prospects, he said.He said: "If we are to deter potential troublemakers, the consequences they face have to be relevant to the lives they lead, and to be immediate. Otherwise why would they stop what they are doing?"I'd like to see police given the power to confiscate, temporarily, a young troublemaker's mobile phone, removing their sim card, with all their mobile numbers and text messages on it, for a fortnight or a month; not permanently, but long enough to make a point."Earlier this month, Alan Johnson, the home secretary, admitted the government had been complacent in tackling loutish behaviour.He revealed that some victims of antisocial behaviour are having to wait up to two years for the people who targeted them to be dealt with.While accepting that the government had "dragged its feet" on the issue, Johnson said he wanted to give it an "extra push".
