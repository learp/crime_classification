A female police officer killed herself because of a long-standing culture of bullying in an elite firearms unit, a coroner was told yesterday.PC Paula Tomlinson, 35, was found hanged in the home she shared with her policeman husband, Jim Collins, in Birkdale, near Southport, in January 2004.Her family claims she took her life because she was bullied by fellow firearms officers in Merseyside police after she complained that colleagues had watched an adult movie during a training session.The Sefton coroner, Christopher Sumner, heard that two inquires carried out by West Mercia police and the Independent Police Complaint Commission failed to find any wrongdoing. But Ms Tomlinson's relatives are attempting to use European human rights laws to argue that details of the alleged bullying should be heard at the inquest into her death.Jeremy Baker QC, representing the family, said it was "a case, firstly, of a long-standing culture of discriminatory bullying in the firearms department of Merseyside police. Secondly, of a systematic failure of management to deal adequately with that, which led to the victimisation of not just the deceased but a large number of decent and hard-working members of Merseyside police. This had the effect of being the sole, or at the very least a significant cause of the deceased's death."The court heard that during a training session held at Catterick Army barracks in North Yorkshire Sergeant Tommy Mutch branded Ms Tomlinson "miserable" and told her to "buck her ideas up" after she complained when her colleagues watched an adult movie.Ms Tomlinson claimed that Mr Mutch had leant on her shoulder and berated her when she was taking "critical" shots to allow her to re-qualify for her firearms licence, the court heard. The inquest also heard that Ms Tomlinson was stopped from taking any practice shots when others were allowed to.Subsequently, Ms Tomlinson failed to re-qualify and was removed from the firearms unit. Soon afterwards she took sick leave from work suffering from stress and depression.Mr Baker told the court Ms Tomlinson believed there had been a "strategy to remove her". He added: "One doesn't need to be a psychologist to know the insidious harm that can be caused by bullying."In a statement, acting Inspector John Armstrong of Merseyside police said Ms Tomlinson had been "crushed" by being removed from the firearms department."I believe Paula was crushed by the armed response section discarding her and she never wanted to seek another pathway," he said. "I was very sorry that we all failed to appreciate how much the loss of the job she loved doing had affected her."He said the force should have known there was "a real and immediate risk" of Ms Tomlinson taking her own life.Samantha Leeke, representing Merseyside police, argued that the force had no basis of knowing that Ms Tomlinson was about to take her life as she had made no official complaint.She said: "There remains no evidence that the force ought to have known of a real and immediate risk to her life."The coroner will rule today on whether to admit the evidence of alleged bullying.
