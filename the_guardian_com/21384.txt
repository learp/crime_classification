A murderous trail of events which began when hikers found a 20-year-old man's body on a Yorkshire moor ended yesterday when the suspected murderer died after shooting himself in the head.Police called off the hunt for an "apparently respectable" overnight guest at a lonely Pennine pub who shot and wounded two detectives from a new homicide squad when they tracked him down for questioning about the moorland murder.He was named last night as Alexander Edward Lawton, 28, from the Almondbury area of Huddersfield, where he is thought to have met Zubair Munir, 20, whose body was found in heather just off the A58 Halifax-Rochdale road on Sunday, with a single bullet wound to the head.Mr Munir, who had a conviction for possessing a class A drug and was nicknamed Ninja, Bear and Treasure, was last seen in Huddersfield 10 days ago, shortly before Mr Lawton turned up at the Fleece Inn close to the site where the body was found, saying that he needed to stay for a few days.He seemed to be "perfectly respectable", according to staff at the pub, who took his credit card for identification and gave him a room when he said he was moving in locally but his place was not quite ready. Then, on Monday afternoon, two unarmed detectives from West Yorkshire police's new homicide and major inquiry team called, and shortly afterwards pistol shots were heard.One of the detectives, a 44-year-old woman constable who had previously talked to Mr Lawton about the shooting of Mr Munir, was hit in the thigh.Her colleague, a 39-year-old male detective constable, suffered a minor stomach wound. Both were allowed home on Monday night after hospital treatment.Lawton escaped from the Fleece in a red P-registration Peugeot 106 which was then seen at 7pm on Monday night in the village of Northowram, between Halifax and Bradford.The car was parked on a quiet stretch of Hall Lane with Mr Lawton slumped over the wheel, blood running from a single gunshot wound to his head, and a handgun on the floor.He died at lunchtime yesterday in Bradford royal infirmary.Police had been checking possible links between Mr Lawton and Mr Munir in the drug underworld of Huddersfield, and the woman detective was said by police colleagues to have built a trusting relationship with him.Neither of the injured officers had taken body armour to the Fleece, where they were expecting to find Mr Lawton, and the initial interviewing had gone without incident.But Detective Superintendent Paul Kennedy, the senior investigating officer in the case, that an argument had broken out when they told Mr Lawton they were arresting him.The officer said: "A number of shots were fired and both officers sustained gunshot wounds, but their injuries are not life-threatening."They acted properly and bravely. They performed their duties exceptionally well. I have been in touch with them and have given them my regards and support."Mr Kennedy moved to allay gun crime fears locally and said the series of shootings was not random.The Fleece was still sealed off yesterday, with knots of shocked onlookers nearby."It's a real shock - it's a lovely pub and you don't expect shootings to take place on an afternoon," said one regular who did not want to be named.Peter Strong, managing director of the Chameleon Pub company, which owns the Fleece, said: "It is a very upsetting incident, everybody is very shocked. This is a beautiful spot and it is totally out of character."
