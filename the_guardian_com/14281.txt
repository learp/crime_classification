A Prison Service administrative office is being relocated because its staff are too white and not well educated enough, an MP claimed today.The 90 staff at Crown House in Corby, Northants - which handles prison contracts for catering, transport and prisoner escorts - have been told their jobs are to move to a new building in Leicester.One of the factors behind the move is said to be that the city boasts a more diverse workforce with a higher proportion of university graduates.Philip Hollobone, the Conservative MP for nearby Kettering, said some of his constituents had been told they were to lose their jobs.In the letter, seen by the Press Association, Anne Beasley, the Home Office's director of finance, lists the four main reasons for transferring the office to Leicester.In that list, the top two clauses are: "Our ability to recruit professional procurement and other staff (the population of Corby is around 53,000 of which 9% are qualified to degree level: the population of Leicester is around 280,000 of which 17% hold degrees)."Our ability to attract a more diverse workforce (93.7% of the population of Corby are white British, compared to 59.6% in Leicester)."Mr Hollobone said: "It is the wrong move for the wrong reasons."My constituents are affected and employees are being told they are too white. Another factor listed is to do with the number of graduates in the area, so they are also being told they are too stupid." But the Prison Service said diversity issues were only a "secondary" consideration behind the move.The move was almost forced on officials as the building was in the middle of a major redevelopment plan going on in the centre of Corby.He added: "To suggest the government is going to move offices for diversity reasons is ludicrous."The potential sale of the property has given Her Majesty's Prison Service the opportunity to look at what provides the best option for the Prison Service and therefore the taxpayer."The key factors that influenced our decision to relocate to Leicester were the closer proximity to a greater number of prison establishments, better transport links, the ability to recruit professional staff and the ability to attract a more diverse workforce."
