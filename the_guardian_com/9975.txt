Metropolitan police have arrested a man in his 60s in connection with the Jimmy Savile investigation into child sex abuse, as they confirm that 450 victims have come forward with allegations.The man, from Bedfordshire, was arrested on Thursday morning by Scotland Yard detectives on suspicion of sexual offences. He is the fourth person to be arrested by detectives from the Operation Yewtree investigation into allegations of sexual abuse stemming from the Jimmy Savile scandal. Others arrested include the former pop star Gary Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, the comedian Freddie Starr, and the former BBC producer Wilfred De'Ath.Scotland Yard said 450 victims had come forward and recorded 200 allegations of sexual assault since the investigation launched formally on 19 October.The Met said it was in the process of contacting all the victims. A team of 30 detectives and staff were working on the operation.On Thursday the children's charity NSPCC said it had received 236 calls relating to Savile – an average of five a day – since the first sexual abuse allegations were made at the beginning of October. It said it had received 550 phone calls and emails from people reporting other incidents of sexual abuse in the past month, an increase of nearly 200% on the average month.Peter Watt, director of the NSPCC helpline, said: "It's crucial that people continue to come forward, whether they have information about Savile or anyone else. Our prime focus has to be on protecting children, particularly those unable to speak out themselves, and bringing offenders to justice."Sometimes people wait months or years before reporting abuse but we would urge them to act quickly so they can get help as soon as possible. While the whole Savile episode has been distressing it has also led to more victims of abuse seeking support, which is positive."
