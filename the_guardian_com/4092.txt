The publicist Max Clifford told police it was "revolting" to be accused of being a paedophile when he was first questioned over allegations of indecently assaulting a teenage girl, a court has heard.Jurors at London's Southwark crown court were read extracts from police interviews after Clifford, 70, was arrested on 6 December 2012.The court heard that officers told him he was being detained in response to allegations from a woman who said she met Clifford while on holiday with her family in Torremolinos, Spain, in 1977.She claimed he went on to make her perform sex acts on him when they were back in the UK, promising he would help her become a model. She later sent him a letter accusing him of abusing her, which was found by police in his bedside table.Jurors heard that when questioned by police about the letter, Clifford said he received many nasty letters because of his job but had never before been accused of being a paedophile.The court heard he told officers: "I've received letters about controversial things, when I was involved in OJ Simpson and Guant√°namo Bay. It's the first one I've ever received accusing me of being a paedophile. It's disgusting and totally without any foundation at all. I didn't abuse this girl."Jurors heard that Clifford claimed he had exposed paedophiles during his career.Asked why the letter was found in his bedside drawer, the publicist said it was so he could show his wife.Jurors were told that earlier the same day Clifford gave police a statement he had written with the help of his solicitor, and told them he would answer all their questions with "no comment".The statement read: "I am both shocked and amazed at the nature of these allegations. I wish to emphasise that I have never forced any female to indulge in any form of sexual behaviour with me against her will."Asked whether the allegations had come "out of the blue", Clifford told officers: "Because of my work, I'm totally aware of what's going on out there."The court heard that Clifford told police he had no recollection of meeting the teenager, but he confirmed he had gone on holiday to the resort.Four charges relate to the woman, who claims Clifford made her take off her bra on a visit to his offices in Bond Street, central London.She alleges he visited her home and impressed her parents by speaking about how he could make her a star, then took her out in his car and abused her.Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls. He denies all the charges. The trial continues.
