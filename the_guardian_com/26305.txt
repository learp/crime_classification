A man was arrested on suspicion of murder after a 22-year-old was killed in the early hours. The dead man was named locally as Aaron and described as "a humble person who loved life". He was found with gunshot wounds in Clerkenwell, central London, and pronounced dead just after 5am. The suspect, who is in his 20s, was being held in custody at a north London police station, Scotland Yard said. Officers and ambulance staff were called to reports of the shooting at about 4.10am in Portpool Lane. Next of kin have been informed of the death and a postmortem examination will be held tomorrow.
