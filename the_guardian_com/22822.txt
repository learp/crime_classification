Organised criminals are moving into child pornography and trafficking an increasing number of women to work as prostitutes in the UK, according to the first report from the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca).It warns that the internet and the sophistication of crime syndicates mean the threat posed by gangsters is increasing in scope and complexity. It also finds that offenders are "unlikely to have difficulty" in acquiring firearms and that they use prison as the "basis for many later criminal collaborations".The agency also suggests that corruption remains a problem, saying that on a number of occasions UK law enforcement officers have colluded with criminals. It does not offer further details.The government launched Soca in April promising it would "make life hell" for organised criminals. Its priorities are tackling the trafficking of Class A drugs and organised immigration crime, although it also deals with other offences.Its first report concludes that the number of active sex offenders remains unknown, but suggests that they are growing, in part because the internet has reduced the risk to perpetrators.Major criminal networks are moving into child pornography, although very few sites are hosted in the UK. At the same time intelligence officers have recorded a growing number of women from eastern Europe and Africa being trafficked to Britain to work as prostitutes.The report also suggests that people smugglers are charging as little as £150 for passage to Britain from France.But migration campaigners said they were sceptical about the low figure. Keith Best, director of the Immigration Advisory Service, said: "I'm not convinced the government is serious enough about combating trafficking and smuggling. They don't - as the US and France do - give someone residence and work permits if they are prepared to help bring to book a perpetrator."The report found that the average street prices of heroin and cocaine have fallen over the last five years, with the cost of a gram of heroin down from £70 to £54 and that of cocaine from £65 to £49.It estimates that 25 to 35 tonnes of heroin are smuggled into the country every year, and an estimated 35 to 40 tonnes of cocaine. It warns that the highly addictive drug crystal meth may also become as widely abused in Britain as it has been in the US.In a separate announcement today, the government will cut the threshold for seizing suspect sums of money from criminals from £5,000 to £1,000.Vernon Coaker, a Home Office minister, said: "We are determined to reduce the harm caused by serious organised crime and ensure that those involved in it are deprived of the financial benefits."By seizing cash sums as low at £1,000, law enforcement agencies will be in a better position to target those petty criminals who think they are beyond the law."Last month it emerged that the Assets Recovery Agency, which Tony Blair promised would double the amount of assets seized each year from criminals, collected only £4.1m last year, having spent £15.5m.
