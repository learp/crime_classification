I thought they were fireworks at first, then I heard it two more times.“I heard big bangs – really loud. There was a party going on and we thought it was fireworks from the party. I came out and saw the police.“A couple of my friends know the guy who died, he was just unfortunate really. He wasn’t at the party. I think he lives in the area, but I don’t know him personally. My friends are pretty upset.”Another woman, who lives on the street with her teenage daughter, said she arrived back at 10pm to find it cordoned off by police and a forensics tent set up.She was allowed back home in the early hours of Sunday morning and saw bloodstains on the road.She said: “It happened near my front door, but I don’t know him. This morning when I opened my door I saw the blood everywhere. It is just so awful what happened. I cried.”Scotland Yard said it was not aware of any shots being fired during the incident.A section of the road was cordoned off on Sunday, while uniformed officers stood guard at either end, only allowing residents to pass in and out.Scotland Yard said the teenager’s next of kin have been informed but they are awaiting formal identification. A postmortem is scheduled to be held at Greenwich mortuary.Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. No arrests have been made.
