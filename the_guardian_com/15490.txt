A man pleaded guilty today to attempting to pervert the course of justice by switching identities with his twin brother, causing him to be wrongly released from custody.Simon Maclellan, 27, who was on remand at Winchester prison in July for a serious assault, walked free from a court after he pretended to be his brother, Mark.Maclellan, of Gosport, Hampshire, was released by magistrates but arrested the following day at an address in Fareham.He entered a guilty plea at Portsmouth crown court to the charge of perverting the course of justice but pleaded not guilty to a second charge of escaping from lawful custody.Judge Ian Pearson ordered a hearing to determine whether Maclellan's reasons for pleading guilty were acceptable to the Crown Prosecution Service.The court heard that on 10 July Maclellan was sharing a cell with his twin brother at Winchester prison and that there was a mix-up with the dates of their court appearances.Maclellan said he believed he was due to appear in court that day and when he was collected from his cell, the prison guard checked only his surname.The court heard that when he was later released from custody at Fareham magistrates' court, Maclellan claimed he only took advantage of the case of mistaken identity and it was not a planned attempt to escape from prison.Dan Sawyer, prosecuting, said the prison guard said both surname and first name, as well as prison number, were checked before Maclellan was taken from his cell.The hearing to determine the issue will be held on 17 December, and Maclellan was remanded in custody until then.
