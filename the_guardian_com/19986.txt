The Conservatives would make it easier for chief constables to sack bad officers, David Cameron said yesterday in a speech setting out his plans for police reforms.The Tory leader promised officers a reduction in centralised control in exchange for flexibility in pay and conditions. He argued that while Conservative and Labour governments had poured money into the service, it had not improved accordingly. "The Conservative party has always valued and supported the police ... but there cannot be a blank cheque," he said in a speech in east London."Today, I would make this offer to Britain's police. If you make the changes which will improve police performance, we will stop the centralisation, bureaucracy and political correctness that gets in your way of doing the job properly."That would mean, for instance, scrapping the requirement for police to record details every time they stop someone, but retaining the need to record searches to maintain the confidence of ethnic and other minority groups. Mr Cameron said local flexibility for police pay and conditions would allow earnings to reflect skills and performance, rather than merely length of service or seniority. Pension reforms were needed to enable talented outsiders to join the police "at all ranks".New contracts should be introduced so that bad officers could be sacked, he said. Police should not be allowed to have second jobs, while measures should be taken to tackle the large number of police receiving full pay while carrying out restricted duties due to ill health.He attacked Labour's proposals to merge forces, and argued in favour of an American-style system, with police chiefs accountable to communities rather than central government via elected police authorities, commissioners or mayors.Jan Berry, who chairs the Police Federation, said structures were already in place to deal with "lazy" officers and pension transfer and said the service was in a "constant state of being reformed".
