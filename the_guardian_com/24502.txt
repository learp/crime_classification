The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday January 19 2007The prisons minister is Gerry Sutcliffe, not Sullivan as we mistakenly stated in the article below.The home secretary, John Reid, was facing a fresh crisis in Britain's overcrowded jails last night when it emerged that prisoners were forced to sleep in basement court cells on Monday because emergency overspill police accommodation in London was full. It is believed to be the first time that court cells, which have no overnight facilities, have been used to cope with an overcrowding crisis in the prison population.Home Office ministers held urgent talks yesterday in an attempt to avoid a repeat of the situation last night. But they were struggling to find overspill places for about 450 prisoners locked out of full jails across London and the south-east, with only 300 spare places available in emergency cells in police stations.The Â£2.6m-a-month Operation Safeguard, the emergency support plan under which police cells are made available, was put into operation on Monday when the prison population in England and Wales hit 79,273 - a rise of 115 in a single day.A prison service spokeswoman said: "Prisons minister Gerry Sutcliffe is deeply concerned that a small number of prisoners spent last night in court cells. This morning he met with ministerial colleagues and senior officials to discuss an interim arrangement. Everybody involved in this situation - the prison service, the national offender management service, private contractors, the police, local courts and others - are working hard to meet the demands placed on them by this difficult situation."The immediate crisis has been triggered by problems in the London area exacerbated by a decision to take two wings at Norwich and Winchester prisons, which contain 400 places, out of use for refurbishment.It comes after two women prisoners killed themselves in the past 10 days and ministers faced repeated questions about the number of inmates absconding from open prisons.The decision to use court cells in London to hold an estimated 20 prisoners is particularly troubling, as the cells are only designed to hold people for a short time while they are awaiting a court appearance. They are unlikely to have mattresses and meals would need to be brought in.Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, last night described the decision as a "dreadful mess of the government's own making ... If you create a climate of fear and introduce a raft of mandatory penalties, it makes it more difficult for the courts to feel confident about using alternatives to custody, or to exercise proper discretion in sentencing, for the parole board to make unfettered decisions about release, or for prison governors to transfer those people ready for open conditions. Unless the home secretary is prepared to act to reserve prison for serious and violent offenders, detention will become progressively less safe and less humane."Mr Reid has won Treasury backing to build 8,000 more prison places. Downing Street recently overruled an attempt to extend the early release scheme, under which non-violent prisoners go home and are placed under a curfew.
