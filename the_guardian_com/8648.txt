Two schoolchildren suffered head wounds after being beaten with a metal bar in an unprovoked attack.Friends Callum Leonard, 14, and Jessica Wilde, 13, were sitting near playing fields at Wallbank primary school in Tipton, Birmingham, texting friends when a man walked up behind them and attacked them.Despite being hit from behind and each being struck at least twice on the head, the teenagers managed to scramble to their feet and escape along a path.Both youngsters required hospital treatment for several deep cuts to their heads, between 4cm and 7cm deep, and have been left traumatised by the incident.The white male attacker, believed to be aged about 20, approached the youngsters at 5.40pm on Tuesday 20 November.The parents of the pair, who described them as bubbly and outgoing youngsters, said they were still too scared to go outside after dark – but were on the mend.Callum's mother, Claire Leonard, of Tipton, said: "The first I knew, I got a phone call to say they had been attacked but I didn't know how bad it was."They had managed to run away, and when I got to them they were waiting for the ambulance with Jessica's dad."They had run for about 15 minutes before they stopped to ring anyone, they were that frightened."Callum's head was bleeding, and he'd got a 5cm cut on the front of his head, and a 4cm cut just above his ear, and the blow has actually left a dent in his head."The man who attacked them never said anything to them, and although they were on their phones, he didn't seem interested in going after what they were carrying."Jessica's mother, Claire Wilde, of Coseley, West Midlands, said Callum was her "little hero" after he grabbed her daughter off the ground and helped her run off, as the attack continued.She said her daughter had also been badly shaken by the assault."She's got a 7cm cut on her head and grazes all over her scalp," said Mrs Wilde."She couldn't go horseriding for two weeks afterwards, and she's still not sure of going out."Before she would go out to friends' houses after school but now she's too scared."They are both very lucky considering what could have happened."I cannot understand why anyone would do it. The person who did do it must be psychopathic."The youngsters were treated at New Cross hospital in Wolverhampton and were able to go home the same day, and are now back in class at the Coseley school.West Midlands police are appealing for help to find the attacker, and have also appealed directly to the man to hand himself in.Detective Constable Gareth Homer said: "This was a completely random and brutal attack on two schoolchildren who were simply minding their own business."This could have been much worse and we have got to find the person responsible and bring him to justice."I believe the attacker was a white man, aged about 20."I want to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the attack to contact me – perhaps you were in the area at the time and saw the person responsible."I would also appeal directly to the attacker to do the right thing and come forward to speak to us."Homer said although both victims were recovering well, "the psychological scars will take time to heal".
