The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, today announced plans to abolish police "stop and account" forms in three pilot areas after a new report on the future of policing called for a drastic reduction in red tape.Her response followed the publication by Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the chief inspector of constabulary, of his long-awaited review. It addresses "unnecessary bureaucracy and brings forward concrete recommendations to reduce it in ways equivalent to more than 3,000 additional officers".The report includes a proposal for officers to give out a card when they stop people in the street instead of filling out a lengthy form, which Flanagan calculates consumes 48,000 hours a year, not including additional work back at the station.He said "only a small proportion of the tasks that are carried out by the police actually require sworn officer powers", as he warned that police numbers "were not sustainable over the next three years".Flanagan, who called for a radically new approach to policing, wants civilian staff taking over some duties, although the report says further work would be needed to explore the viability of such a drastic change.In a statement to the House of Commons, Smith announced the trial abolition of "stop and account" in three areas with a view to rolling out the policy nationwide "as soon as possible".For officers conducting a stop and search, there would still be a form, but it would be shorter and, using handheld devices, the time the task would take could be reduced from an average of 25 minutes to six minutes, she said.Smith also said that, from April, she would extend the powers allowing officers to conduct searches in areas where gun or knife crime was suspected.Her lack of enthusiasm for the greater use of civilian staff came after Jan Berry, who chairs the Police Federation in England and Wales, warned it could lead to a "de-skilled" force."It produces a totally different kind of police service, one that's only dealing with confrontational situations, like a paramilitary force," Berry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.But Chief Constable Ken Jones, the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, welcomed the report and said it "lays down the gauntlet to all those involved in the leadership and governance of policing"."Serving neighbourhoods effectively is placing new demands on the service and requires the flexibility to respond to local needs, unencumbered by a plethora of central targets and over-regulation," he saidIan Johnston, the president of the Police Superintendents' Association, said there were dangers in greater use of civilian staff. People would be specialising in "little bits of policing" and the force would not have enough uniformed officers to deal with national disasters, he said.He welcomed the move to address the issue of paperwork, saying police had "no argument with being accountable" but describing the current level of form-filling as "nonsense"."Why should a constable have to fill this form in to account for his actions when all he's doing is stopping someone and saying 'why are you here?' and 'what are you doing?'" he told the Today programme.Flanagan describes the use of such processes as "disproportionate" and pointed out that regulations, codes of practice and operating manuals have grown so much that 41 pieces of "doctrine" have been introduced in the past two years - and 22 more are in development.The formal completion of a form would still be required for "stop and search" to recognise the fact it is a more invasive process than simply asking someone to account for themselves. It would also enable police to respond to concerns that the force was targeting individuals from particular minority groups. Flanagan suggested the process could be streamlined by the introduction of handheld computer systems which can transmit data to the station.The report criticised the Home Office for withdrawing funding from the national non-emergency telephone number, 101, describing the decision as "regrettable".Flanagan recommended changing the way neighbourhood policing was carried out, recommending new forms of local democratic accountability and the introduction of "citizen-focused policing".He is not a supporter of elected local police commissioners or elected neighbourhood boards - both ideas which have been floated in the past - claiming they could leave the police subject to the "control of maverick leaders which would hamper their ability to serve the community as a whole".He called for an overhaul of the way police record crime, saying too many offences are recorded to meet targets. He suggested a streamlined system of comprehensively recording serious crime should be given a four-month trial, with minor offences only recorded in a shorthand form."This new process will ensure that crimes are subject to proportionate recording, with a suitable minimum standard for all crimes and more comprehensive recording for serious crimes," Flanagan said.He also calls on the Home Office to ensure police performance indicators are "brought into alignment and set against the core objective of convicting the guilty".He said that the current system of activity based costing for police officers "can create the wrong incentives, can be overly rigid and fail to reflect local differences and can be overly bureaucratic to administer".
