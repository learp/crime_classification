David Chaytor, the first former MP to be convicted over the expenses scandal, was today sentenced to 18 months in prison.The former Labour MP for Bury North last month pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to three charges of false accounting, days before he had been due to stand trial. He faced a maximum sentence of seven years.Chaytor had admitted false accounting involving a total of £18,350. He had agreed to pay back the sum before today's hearing at Southwark crown court.Mr Justice Saunders said a significant penalty for the 61-year-old was "the only way public faith in the system can be restored and maintained"."The whole expenses scandal has shaken public confidence in the legislature, it has angered the public," he said."Chaytor only bears a small part of responsibility for that erosion of confidence and the public anger. But it is important because he has accepted his conduct was dishonest."Saunders said the offences had "wider and more important consequences than is to be found in other breach of trust cases", adding: "That is the effect they have had, and will have, in the confidence the public has in politicians."Chaytor gave no reaction as he was sentenced. Court sources told the Press Association that the former MP would be taken to Wandsworth prison, in south-west London, to spend his first night in custody.During submissions today, James Sturman QC had pleaded for any prison sentence to be suspended and a community punishment imposed.He said Chaytor, a former university lecturer, faced further public humiliation if ordered to pick up litter or similar work because he would be photographed."We submit that the sums he received, if he had gone about it transparently, honestly and frankly, he would have been entitled to every penny, if not more than he claimed," Sturman said."The fact that he would have been entitled to claim for a second property has been somewhat lost in the clamour and hysteria surrounding the case."He added that Chaytor had pleaded guilty out of "deep and genuine remorse".But Peter Wright QC, for the prosecution, said the fact that Chaytor submitted false invoices proved that he knew he was breaking the rules."We say Mr Chaytor knew the rules, and we say why else would he produce false documents in support of his claims otherwise?" he told the court."It is maintained by the defence that his purpose in creating those documents was in fact to short-circuit the route by which expenses could be claimed. We, on behalf of the crown, do not accept that."Chaytor had claimed £12,925 between 2005 and 2006 for renting a flat in Regency Street, Westminster, producing a tenancy agreement purporting to show that he was paying £1,175 a month in rent to the landlord, Sarah Elizabeth Rastrick.But she was his daughter – although her name was disguised by using her middle name as a surname – and the flat was owned by Chaytor and his wife, who had already paid off the mortgage.Chaytor also claimed £5,425 between 2007 and 2008 for renting a home in Castle Street, Bury, which was owned by his mother.He produced a tenancy agreement falsely showing he was paying £775 a month. House of Commons rules do not allow MPs to claim for leasing a property from a family member.A third charge related to two invoices of £995 each for IT support services in May 2006 when the "services had not been provided or charged for". The court heard that money was never paid to him.Chaytor, from Todmorden, Lancashire – who held Bury North from 1997 until stepping down following the expenses scandal – took his case to the supreme court, the highest in the land, to try to prevent it being heard by the courts.He argued, along with the former Labour MPs Elliot Morley, 58, who represented Scunthorpe, and 57-year-old Jim Devine, formerly the MP for Livingston, that criminal proceedings would infringe parliamentary privilege.Chaytor changed his plea after his arguments were rejected by the supreme court. Morley and Devine face separate trials at a future date.Labour confirmed that the former MP, already suspended from the party, had now been excluded.
