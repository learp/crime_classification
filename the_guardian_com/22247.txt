A “predatory armed killer” has been jailed for life for the murder of schoolgirl Claire Tiltman in an attack in 1993.Colin Ash-Smith, 46, must serve a minimum of 21 years in prison for the “frenzied and remorseless” attack.Already serving life for attacks on two other women, Ash-Smith stabbed Claire to death in an alleyway four days after she turned 16.The former milkman was first questioned as a suspect in 1995. Claire’s parents, Linda and Cliff, were convinced he was the killer but they died before he was charged.The judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, said Claire had an engaging and lively personality and was extremely popular, with a wide circle of friends.He told the absent Ash-Smith: “I have no doubt that this was a premeditated murder that you carried out because of the feeling of power that it gave you.“In so doing, you not only ended Claire’s young life, which was so full of promise, but you also caused unbearable grief and upset to her family and friends.He added: “This was a premeditated murder. Your intention was to kill. You took a knife to the scene for the purpose, and Claire was vulnerable by reason of her circumstances.”Ash-Smith chose not to attend Inner London crown court to hear the verdict.Sweeney said he had to sentence Ash-Smith on the basis of the law as it stood at the time of the murder, even though there were no mitigating factors, so he escaped being handed a “life means life” sentence.Around a dozen of Claire’s schoolfriends packed into the public gallery to hear the sentence.The judge commended Claire’s family and friends who sat through the trial, and the police for their work in bringing her killer to justice.“I would also like to commend the members of Claire’s family and her friends who have attended this trial for the dignified way in which they have conducted themselves,” he said. “And I express my sorrow for the burden they have had to carry for many years at Claire’s untimely loss.”Ash-Smith was branded “pure evil” by police, while prosecutors said he got a “warped pleasure” out of attacking women.Claire was stabbed at least nine times as she walked to her friend’s house in Greenhithe to discuss college options. The Dartford grammar school pupil, known to her friends as Tilt, had just finished her mock GCSEs and wanted to become a firefighter.But Ash-Smith, whom she knew through the local British Legion club, pounced on her on 18 January 1993. He attended her funeral with his councillor parents a month later in the same beige jacket he wore when he killed her.His mother, Diane, a Labour councillor and later the local mayor, provided him with a false alibi, claiming he was out leafleting with her when Claire was killed.The trial heard chilling details of how Ash-Smith killed Claire as part of a “spree” of attacks on females across Kent.A self-confessed “animal” with “no moral compass”, he was plagued by a hatred of women who he said he felt humiliated him. He went on midnight walks armed with knives hunting for victims, and bragged about his attacks in diaries.Asked why he attacked, he said: “I wanted to feel empowered, that I had control over someone, that I wasn’t a doormat.”In 1988, he attempted to rape and murder a young mother in a quarry. And in 1995 stabbed 22-year-old Charlotte Barnard 14 times just metres from where he killed Claire. A year later he was handed three life terms and ordered to serve 15 years for the attacks.He was not charged with Claire’s murder until earlier this year, on the day he was due to be considered for release by the Parole Board.Sweeney said the tireless work of Claire’s family and friends helped to trace her killer.“The efforts of Claire’s family and friends kept her murder in the public conscience, and thanks to the recent re-activation of the inquiry by Kent police, further evidence came to light and you have finally been brought to justice.”Diane Ash-Smith could face criminal charges for providing her son with a false alibi.Asked about this possibility, Detective Superintendent Rob Vinson, one of the leads on the investigation, said: “We haven’t considered that yet. It will need to be looked at.”He said if Ash-Smith had not been charged with Claire’s murder the day the parole board met to discuss his case there was a “strong likelihood” he would have been allowed home visits and day release.Friday’s sentence means Ash-Smith will be 67 before he is considered for release.
