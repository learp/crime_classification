Police were yesterday continuing to question a 22-year-old man about the murder of student Marsha McDonnell.Boyd Keppel was surrounded by armed officers at a train station in south west London on Thursday evening and taken to an undisclosed London police station, where he was also being questioned about attacks on a 17-year-old girl and an 18-year-old youth.Ms McDonnell, 19, was hit with a blunt instrument after she got off a bus to walk to her home in Hampton on February 4.Police have linked the murder to the attack on the girl in nearby Strawberry Hill last month, in which the victim suffered a blow to the head which left her unconscious.Detectives got their first description of the attacker this week after the youth was attacked in Hampton, less than half a mile from the murder scene.Witnesses described the arrest as a well-planned operation, involving plainclothes and uniformed officers and a number of police cars trapping the man in an alley.Sid Wootton, 60, said: "There were about 10 cars, loads of police, all of them armed. We heard them yelling 'Get down, get down.'"The arrest came after a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of the murder, although police said they were acting on a tip-off .
