Police investigating the murder of a masseuse at her home are considering the theory that she could been killed by a man mistakenly expecting sexual services.Detectives said yesterday that Angela Chiu, 48, ran a legitimate massage business from her home in Canford Cliffs, Poole, Dorset. Her body was discovered in the bathroom by her 18-year-old daughter on Friday. She had been stabbed to death. Detective Inspector Steve Thorpe, who is leading the murder inquiry, said his team was examining her work which she advertised in the massage section in the classified section of Bournemouth's Daily Echo. Mr Thorpe said: "We are looking into that aspect of her lifestyle. Obviously there is a dangerous side to that sort of business. "If you ... advertise in the local paper then you are always going to run the risk of getting the odd call from people thinking the business is something more than it really is." Ms Chiu, who had a degree in computing from Keele university and had done a post-graduate degree in law, spoke five languages. She had started the massage business after separating from her husband, a Hong Kong based businessman, 12 years ago. A statement from her family said: "Angela took a strong interest in many aspects of alternative health ... [she] also studied nutritional medicine, general counselling as well as remedial and therapeutic massage." Her family described her as a "loving and caring mother as well as a wonderful daughter, thoughtful and fun-loving sister and an admired aunt". She was last seen alive on Wednesday and police are appealing for witnesses who saw anything suspicious.
