Government claims that the level of prisoners absconding from open prisons was the lowest for a decade were dismissed by the Conservatives today as meaningless because such institutions now hold more serious offendersJunior Home Office minister Gerry Sutcliffe disclosed in a parliamentary written answer that the number of prisoner absconds from open prisons in England in 2005-06 was 702. He added that the Prison Service recognised the rate had to be reduced further and was continuing to "drive forward work to meet this aim".Mr Sutcliffe said: "There were 702 absconds from open prisons in the financial year 2005-06. "This represents the lowest figure for absconds in the last 10 years."However, the Prison Service recognises that this abscond rate needs to be reduced further and continues to drive forward work to meet this aim."The answer was in reply to a question from the Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman, David Laws.THe shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "The Home Office's claim that the level of absconds from open prisons is the lowest for 10 years misses the point entirely."Ten years ago the people absconding from open prisons were not dangerous criminals or deportees. "Since the government's decision in 2002 to put such people in open prisons, every abscondee represents an unnecessary potential risk to the public."
