The comedian Paul Whitehouse today told a jury that there was no need for fellow actor Chris Langham to watch explicit videos of children being sexually abused as part of research for a BBC comedy the two were writing.Giving evidence at Maidstone crown court, the star of the Fast Show said Mr Langham had not told him he was downloading child pornography when the pair were working on Help, and said he was unhappy that he had been dragged into the "sordid affair".Mr Langham's defence counsel told the court the actor had downloaded the images as part of research for a sex offender character called Pedro.Prosecutor Richard Barraclough QC asked Mr Whitehouse: "Did Mr Langham ever discuss with you that he was undertaking any research for the shows?""Not to my knowledge, no," Mr Whitehouse replied.Mr Barraclough asked whether he had done any research for characters in the show."None whatsoever, we felt we did not need to, or I didn't any way," Mr Whitehouse said.Mr Langham, 58, denies 15 counts of making indecent images of a child. He also denies 10 counts of indecent assault and two counts of buggery, which relate to a teenage girl he met at the stage door of a London musical in the mid 1990s.The jury heard that the character of Pedro was due to appear in the second series of Help, which was never broadcast.Mr Whitehouse, who played several people visited by a psychiatrist played by Mr Langham, told the court that he had come up with the character whose catchphrase was "I'm only a minor offender".He said: "It was unclear what he had done, but it was implied that he was a Peeping Tom or a flasher or something even worse."Mr Barraclough read from draft scripts in which Pedro rubbed himself up against people on trains and complained that it was difficult to tell how old young women were.In one sketch the character complained that Shakespeare's Juliet was only a young girl."Juliet was only 13 but everyone thinks that is alright because it is Shakespeare, but I think Shakespeare is a dirty old man," the script read.Mr Barraclough asked Mr Whitehouse if he had held discussions with Mr Langham about developing a character that had sex with little girls."Absolutely not," Mr Whitehouse replied.He was then asked if the pair had discussed additional sketches in which Pedro would reveal that he had been abused as a child."No," Mr Whitehouse said.Earlier, a police computer expert described how he had found graphic videos of children on Mr Langham's home computer, including images of seven-year-olds being sexually abused and in some cases raped.Christopher Crute, a forensic computer analyst for Kent Police, said some of the file names referred to young children and babies while others included the words Lolita, incest, and rape.Many of them included the acronym PTHC, which Mr Crute explained referred to "pre-teen hardcore" material.The images were found during a police raid at Mr Langham's home in Golford, near Cranbrook, in November 2005.
