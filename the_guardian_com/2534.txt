An empty carton of milk sits on the worktop next to a plastic box containing only discarded wrappers. A dining room chair has been pulled up to the worktop to allow little arms to reach cupboards that would be otherwise be impossibly high. On the floor a tin of baby milk has been opened and abandoned, the smears of powder on the floor showing the traces of toddler-sized footprints.Stark photographs have emerged of the home in which a 22-year-old woman abandoned her four children for 24 hours while she went on a drink and drugs binge. The pictures show their pitiable attempts to find some food in the family kitchen.Rebecca Stevenson was given a 20-month suspended jail sentence for neglect earlier this week after the incident in July, in which she left her children, aged between three months and four years, in their Blackburn home while she went drinking with friends. The alarm was raised when Stevenson's stepfather called round, to find her oldest daughter, aged four, leaning out of a window and crying "Where's Mummy?"He climbed in, only to discover his "hysterical" one-year-old grandson in a urine-soaked cot upstairs. The two girls, aged four and three, had managed to dress themselves, and the older of the two had attempted to mix powdered milk for her three-month-old brother, Preston crown court heard.The two girls are now in the custody of their maternal grandparents, while the younger boys live with their father. Stevenson is allowed only supervised visits.
