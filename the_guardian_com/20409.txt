  The efit of a man police seek in connection with sexual attacks on young women in Cambridge. Photograph: Cambridgeshire police/PAPolice have warned students at Cambridge University not to walk alone at night after a number of assaults in the city by a bike-riding sex attacker who is thought to have struck nine times since August.Cambridgeshire police have increased patrols in the areas where attacks have taken place and launched an action called Operation Majesty to catch the man, who cycles alongside victims before grabbing and groping them, then escaping when they struggle or scream.The victims, eight of whom study at the university, range in age from 19 to 32. Dr Mark Wormald, a senior tutor at Pembroke College, has emailed a warning to students, fellows and staff, urging them to take extra care after another woman was attacked on Saturday. The woman was not a student at the university but the attack followed the pattern of student victims.Police have issued an efit image of the attacker who is described as tall – between 5ft 10in and 6ft – white, aged 20 to 30, of medium build and physically strong.Detective Sergeant Phil Priestly urged women not to walk alone in the dark and appealed for witnesses. "He appears to have good local knowledge and is travelling to and from the offence locations on a bike," he said."We have increased patrols in the areas where offences have been committed and would urge women to take sensible precautions of not walking at night and early in the morning alone."In his email to staff and students Wormald said: "The predator continues to operate in the vicinity of the college and its hostels in the west and south of the city. You are requested to remain vigilant when walking in and around the city, particularly after nightfall."
