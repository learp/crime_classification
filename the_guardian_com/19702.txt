One of the two boys seriously injured in a vicious attack in a former quarry in South Yorkshire has been allowed home from hospital, police confirmed today.Doncaster Royal Infirmary discharged the nine-year-old overnight, hours after two brothers of primary school age were charged with attempted murder and robbery over the incident.The nine-year-old, who underwent two operations on his injured arm, was attacked on Saturday in the former pit village of Edlington, near Doncaster, along with his 11-year-old friend and uncle, who is still recovering in the hospital.The older boy was found semi-­conscious and with life-threatening injuries in an isolated part of a reclaimed quarry and brickworks on the edge of the town after the younger victim wandered, dazed and covered in blood, on to a nearby housing estate on Saturday afternoon.A South Yorkshire police spokeswoman said: "The 11-year-old boy is still recovering in Doncaster Royal Infirmary after he was transferred from Sheffield Children's Hospital on Tuesday. The nine-year-old boy was released from hospital overnight."Times and dates to interview the victims have yet to be decided."The father of the 11-year-old said his son was too bruised to be hugged and was so traumatised by his ordeal that he cried when he saw an unfamiliar face.Police were called at 2pm on Saturday when the nine-year-old boy was found wandering, covered in blood, in Auburn Road.The boy told the people who found him where to find his uncle, who was discovered unconscious in a nearby wooded ravine.The two victims suffered a series of assaults, which allegedly included being burned with cigarettes, attacked with bricks and being slashed.The two accused brothers, who cannot be named for legal reasons, each face the same charges: attempted murder of the two boys and robbing them on the same date. The brothers are accused of taking a mobile phone from the younger boy and £5 from the older boy.They have been remanded into secure council accommodation until 14 April.
