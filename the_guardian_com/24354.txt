The police are failing to record as much as 20% of crime – equal to three-quarters of a million offences – including 14 cases of rape and some serious sexual offences, according to the first official inquiry into the integrity of the police crime figures.The interim report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Tom Winsor, was ordered by the home secretary following claims of widespread fiddling of the police recorded crime figures by a whistleblower which have been endorsed by MPs.Winsor says that his initial results from 13 out of the 43 forces include the two biggest forces, the Metropolitan and the Greater Manchester police, and so cover 60% of total police recorded crime. A final report covering all the forces across England and Wales is to be published in October.Norman Baker, the crime prevention minister, said the failure of police to record data properly is completely unacceptable but he defended official crime figures that state overall levels have fallen.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: "It is completely unacceptable that crimes haven't been recorded properly. We want crimes to be recorded completely accurately, and indeed more worrying that issues such as rape have not been recorded in a small number of cases. We were concerned about this matter, that's why the Home Office asked for this report to be commissioned.The official police watchdog says he is seriously concerned about the emerging picture which shows weak or absent management and supervision of crime recording, significant under-recording of crime, and some serious sexual offences not being recorded at all. The interim report also shows that some offenders have been issued with out-of-court fixed penalty fines when they should have been prosecuted instead.His disclosures are likely to lead to a politically embarrassing spike in the police recorded crime figures in the run-up to next year's general election.The home secretary acknowledged that the findings are likely to lead to a rise in police recorded crime. Theresa May said: "If that increase is driven by improved accuracy in the recording of crime or more victims reporting crime to the police, we should welcome it. Such an increase would not mean crime itself is rising," adding that the fall in police recorded crime figures was substantiated by the separate crime survey of England and Wales. "We can be confident that crime is falling," she said.Winsor says the police failure to record crime properly may stem from poor knowledge of the rules or workload but adds that he can't rule out that it might be the result of discreditable or unethical behaviour by officers.Among the cases HMIC cites as wrongly written off are:• An allegation by a 13-year-old autistic boy who told his parents he had been raped by a 15-year-old male friend which was wrongly written off by the police as sexual experimentation.• A report to the police of rape by a doctor on behalf of a female patient who had consented to sex but told the man to stop when it began to hurt. A supervisory officer ruled that no crime had occurred.• A young man who was not believed when he reported he had been grabbed by the throat by a woman at a party. The woman was interviewed and denied the assault.Winsor said: "The accuracy and integrity of police-recorded crime data are vital to public trust in the police. The consequences of under-recording crime are serious, and may mean victims and the community are failed because the crimes are not investigated, the levels of crime will be wrongly understated, and police chiefs will lack the information they need to make sound decisions on their deployment of their resources."The HMIC finding that the police recorded crime figures have understated the crime rate by as much as 20% will further damage their credibility. The implication of the findings are that last week's police recorded crime figures should have been 4.3m rather than the 3.7m declared.The interim report found that out of a sample of 2,551 incidents that should have been recorded as crimes officers wrongly failed to record 523 of them including sexual offences, crimes of violence, robbery and burglary.But this snapshot of integrity of the police figures does not undermine the long-term sustained fall in crime in England and Wales since 1995 as measured by the totally separate Crime Survey of England and Wales. This is based on people's experience of crime and showed a further 15% drop last year, according to the latest results published last week.
