At 2pm yesterday, the pavement outside Tesco on the Portobello road, west London, the site of David Cameron's recent bike theft, is busy with shoppers. So, how easy is it to have a bike stolen from a busy thoroughfare? Across the road from the bollard where the Tory leader left his bike - and where the Guardian attaches a brand new cycle in similar fashion - is a row of 14 u-shaped racks, surely a safer bet for Cameron to store his bicycle? Perhaps not. A single wheel hangs forlornly from one rack, while others are decorated by bike locks in various states of decay. Before long a group of boys aged 10-14 walk by, casting an eye over the incongruously shiny bike. The fishmonger outside the supermarket is sceptical of the veracity of Cameron's tale. "It's a publicity stunt, innit," he says. "So he can point the finger at Brown and say the country is not safe. This isn't a bad area." The waiter in the cafe next to Tesco seems to have cottoned on to the Guardian's scheme. He talks to passersby, gesturing at the bikes. Our cover is blown. Eventually a middle-aged man in a baseball cap yanks the chain lock off the bike and makes to ride away on it. But he thinks again when he spots our photographer across the street. The waiter says: "I've seen him nick stuff before, so I told him he might as well have the bikes." Various other passersby stop and examine the bikes but sense something fishy and move on. Two police officers stroll into Tesco chatting. Hours pass before another group of hoodies catch sight of the bikes, but they swarm across the street to the cafe where we are stationed. When asked if they know what happened to Cameron's bike, one youth replies: "Tell him he can come and get it, but he has to come alone." The Guardian's bike is still there, attached loosely to the bollard, but this group seems to have little interest in it.
