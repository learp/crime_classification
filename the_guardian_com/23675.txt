The Portsmouth FC manager, Harry Redknapp, today lost part of his high court case against police over the way in which he was arrested and bailed as part of a corruption inquiry.Two high court judges threw out Redknapp's complaint that police had tipped off the press prior to a raid on his home in November.The 6am raid was caught on camera by Sun photographers, as was Redknapp's departure from Chichester police station after being bailed later the same day.The football manager and his wife, Sandra, were taking action against the police for the manner in which the raid was carried out. "It is our case that they [the media] had been deliberately informed about this by the police," his lawyer told Lord Justice Latham and Mr Justice Underhill in London.Redknapp had been abroad at the time of the raid. When he arrived back in the UK later that day, his lawyers said he voluntarily attended Chichester police station, where he was immediately arrested and detained for seven hours.Redknapp held a press conference after his release on bail at which he spoke of his "bitter disappointment" at the way the raid and his arrest had been handled. He said he believed he had only been arrested because he was a "high-profile" figure.However, police strongly denied that they had tipped off the media, and the judges rejected Redknapp's complaints about the circumstances of his arrest and release on bail. Judgment on whether or not the search warrant to go in to Redknapp's home had been issued legally was reserved to a later date.The manager and his wife were also challenging the City of London magistrates court decision to issue the warrant. His lawyers argued that, for legal reasons relating to the nature of the material being sought, the court had "no power" to grant the police the right to arrest him.Nine people are currently on bail in connection with the continuing police inquiry. Birmingham City's co-owner David Sullivan and the club's managing director, Karren Brady, were arrested and questioned.
