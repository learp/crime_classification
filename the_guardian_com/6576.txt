The furore over the cross-examination of Milly Dowler's parents has placed advocacy in the courts under a fierce spotlight. Putting the rights and wrongs of the Dowler case to one side, the public debate has probably come at a good time for the Joint Advocacy Group (JAG), which will shortly introduce a controversial quality assurance scheme for advocates (QASA) working in criminal law.JAG is made up of the three main regulators of advocates – the Bar Standards Board, the Solicitors Regulation Authority and ILEX Professional Standards – and originated with Lord Carter's 2006 report on legal aid procurement, which identified a "client-driven need for the quality assurance of advocacy" as a vital part of an effective justice system.JAG has argued that regulatory intervention is also needed because of concerns raised by judges over the quality of advocacy (while recognising it is only a minority of advocates causing problems), "the fallibility of relying on market forces" to eliminate underperforming advocates, and the need for consumer confidence.In 2009 a report on the Legal Services Commission's pilot of a similar quality assurance scheme backed up judicial concern about advocacy standards. Professor Richard Moorhead, deputy head of Cardiff Law School and part of the research team, says some of the failure rates were at a level "unparalleled in any assessment of lawyer quality in which I have been involved in the last 20 years".He adds: "These required either a regulatory response or further investigation. The regulators appear to accept the need for a regulatory response."QASA will assess all advocates against agreed standards, but has changed a fair bit since work on it began in 2009. There has been a particular debate about the role of judges in assessing the competence of advocates to move up the four levels within the scheme, from working in the magistrates' court to handling the most serious crown court cases.The argument (from the bar and the judges themselves) has been that judges are the ultimate "consumers" of advocacy, but at the same time they can only see what is in front of them.The dominant role of judges was criticised on various grounds, such as whether it could compromise advocates worried about upsetting a judge, the fact that judges cannot assess the work done outside the court, the extra workload it would heap on them, and concerns that the senior judiciary in particular – as it is made up almost exclusively of barristers – might discriminate against non-barrister advocates.An assessment route that minimises judicial involvement has now been introduced. Also, advocates who remain at the same level must re-accredit every five years.If an advocate registers as a cause for concern – either by failing an assessment or being referred by a judge – they will have to undergo remedial training and, ultimately, will lose their accreditation at their existing level.The Law Society and solicitor-advocates have made a late bid to derail the scheme, saying there is not enough evidence to back up the imposition of a compulsory scheme on this scale, and that they have continuing concerns about discrimination.But this is almost certain to fail. Solicitors' and barristers' regulators have both signed off the scheme, with ILEX Professional Standards due to vote on it next month. It will then be submitted to the Legal Services Board for approval, with a view to QASA being phased in from 1 January 2012.The board has taken a very active interest in the scheme's development, and some of the changes made were in response to heavy pressure from the board, which even threatened the regulators with the first ever use of its enforcement powers a few months ago, such was its unhappiness.It is hard to argue against ensuring standards are at an acceptable level, especially when the liberty of an individual is at stake, but the challenge for JAG will be to introduce this new bureaucracy without being heavy handed in how it operates.QASA comes within the "developing a workforce for a changing market" strand of the Legal Services Board's work programme, and can be seen as part of a wider movement – driven by the Legal Services Act 2007 – to assure quality and check lawyers' competence on a regular basis. If judged a success, family advocates will be next.The act is often described as a deregulatory measure. As QASA and many other current initiatives in the legal market show, it is anything but, which in the current climate is probably just as well.Neil Rose is the editor of legalfutures.co.uk
