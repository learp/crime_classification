A father who threw his two children off a hotel balcony in Crete, killing his son, today won permission at the high court to challenge an inquest verdict that the boy was unlawfully killed.Two judges said John Hogan's case raised "serious points that are plainly arguable" and ruled he could seek a judicial review. Hogan pushed Liam, six, and his two-year-old sister, Mia, before jumping himself following a row with his then wife, Natasha, while the family were on holiday. Liam died, but Mia survived the 50ft plunge from the fourth-floor balcony two years ago. Hogan, 34, of Bradley Stoke, near Bristol, wants Avon coroner Paul Forrest's ruling earlier this year, that Liam was "unlawfully killed", overturned. Former tiler Hogan, who is currently being held in a secure psychiatric unit in Greece, was cleared of murder by a court in the country in January, but the inquest verdict led to a police inquiry that opens up the possibility of a new murder trial in Britain. The Greek jury decided he had been suffering from "an earthquake of insanity".However, the inquest into Liam's death in March was told the trial had ignored evidence from key witnesses. Lawyers instructed by Hogan's older sister, Christine O'Connor, from St George, Bristol, won the ruling at the high court today.Hogan's former wife, Natasha Visser, who has married again, was represented as an "interested party". The row that preceded Liam's death came at a time when her marriage to Hogan was under stress.It is believed Hogan could be released in the near future.
