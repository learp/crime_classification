A father appeared in court today charged with murdering his newlywed daughter weeks after giving her away at her wedding.Terry Rodgers, 55, looked pale and drawn as he faced magistrates over the death of hairdresser Chanel Taylor. He is alleged to have shot the 23-year-old at her home in Huthwaite, Nottinghamshire. Mr Rodgers, who was living with his daughter and her new husband Lee, was arrested in woodlands outside Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, two days ago. He stammered slightly as he gave his name to the court during a short hearing before Mansfield magistrates today. The former security man, who had a grey trimmed beard and several tattoos, sat in the glass-fronted dock wearing a white T-shirt and blue tracksuit bottoms. The body of Mrs Taylor was discovered by her new husband at around 1pm on July 30 at the home they shared in New Street. Mr Rodgers did not enter a plea to the single charge of murder and no application for bail was made by his defence counsel. Magistrates remanded the 55-year-old into custody and adjourned the case for a hearing by video link from prison at Nottingham crown court on August 25.
