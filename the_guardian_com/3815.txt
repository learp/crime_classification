The Old Bailey jury trying Levi Bellfield for the abduction and murder of schoolgirl Milly Dowler is expected to retire on Wednesday.The panel of 11, which has heard four weeks of evidence, was told by judge Justice Wilkie to consider its verdicts coolly and dispassionately.Bellfield, 43, denies the murder and kidnap of Milly and the attempted kidnap of 11-year-old Rachel Cowles. In 2008, he was convicted of murdering two students and the attempted murder of a third.Milly, 13, disappeared on 21 March 2002 in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, while she walked home from school. Her remains were found six months later in a wood at Yateley Heath, Hampshire, some 25 miles away, but the cause of death could not be determined.
