The grounds of Lord Byron's stately home were closed yesterday after a young woman's beaten body was found by the lake. Detectives began forensic searches of 120 hectares (300 acres) of wild and formal landscapes around the part-medieval Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire.The unidentified body was found by a walker. No attempt had been made to hide it, but it could have lain undiscovered since Tuesday by a muddy path which skirts the lake and the 19th-century fernery and Japanese garden. Detective Chief Inspector Helen Jebb of Nottinghamshire police said the victim, in her 20s, had been given a sustained beating, though not with a weapon. She was described as white, slim, 5ft 4in, with brown eyes, light brown cropped hair, and three piercings in each ear. She was wearing a short-sleeved red US Athletic T-shirt, light blue jeans, and blue and white Hi-Tech trainers. There was no evidence of sexual assault. Police believe the woman may have been killed elsewhere and her body brought to the park, which is open all year round. Detectives are combing registers of missing people, after house-to-house inquiries in Newstead and the neighbouring village of Ravenshead drew a blank. The woman had a fracture to the left side of her pelvis earlier in her life, unconnected to her injuries. Newstead was Byron's ancestral home, inherited by him in 1798 but later sold to pay debts. Once used to exercise his pet bear and wolf, the park now has a road through it connecting the two villages. Officers are questioning estate residents and staff at the house preparing to open for the tourist season on April 1. The abbey was founded in 1170 by Henry II in atonement for the murder of Thomas Becket. Its grounds contain the grave of Byron's favourite dog, Boatswain, and many claim to have sighted a 19th-century ghost, the White Lady.
