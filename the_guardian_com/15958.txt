The brother of an Iraqi-born British engineer killed with his wife and mother-in-law at an Alpine beauty spot last year has been arrested by Surrey police, French officials have confirmed.Zaid al-Hilli, 54, is being questioned over allegations of a conspiracy to commit murder.Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife, Iqbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, were murdered with two shots to the head at close range near Lake Annecy in the Haute Savoie in France in September.Their daughter Zainab, aged seven, was shot in the shoulder, bludgeoned over the head and left for dead at the scene. A second daughter, Zeena, aged four, escaped unhurt after hiding under her dead mother's skirt in the rear footwell of the family's maroon-coloured BMW estate car for eight hours.Frenchman Sylvain Mollier, 45, a father of three, who is believed to have stumbled across the scene at the top of a narrow and winding road near Chevaline while cycling, was also shot dead.From the beginning French police, who have been working closely with their counterparts in Britain, said the murders bore the hallmarks of a contract killing.In a statement on Monday, Surrey police said: "Detectives investigating the deaths of four people near Annecy, southern France, in September last year have this morning arrested a man on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder."The 54-year-old man was detained at an address in Chessington, Surrey, at around 7.30am and is currently in police custody."While British police refused to name the arrested man, Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud, who has overseen the French investigation since last September and who had warned there would be no "quick solution" to the crime, confirmed it was the dead man's brother."That doesn't mean he is guilty," he said, adding: "Some serious questions will be asked of him."Aeronautics engineer Saad al-Hilli, his dentist wife, and their daughters, from Claygate in Surrey, and his mother-in-law, who lived in Sweden, were on a family holiday and staying on a camping site near Lake Annecy when they drove to the remote beauty spot at the top of La Route de Combe d'Ire on the afternoon of 5 September.Photos taken on a camera found in the BMW showed what Maillaud described as a "smiling and relaxed" family enjoying their holiday.Shortly after the pictures were taken, however, the family appear to have been ambushed by one or more killers.Former RAF pilot Brett Martin, from East Sussex, was the first to discover the bloody scene. In an interview with the BBC shortly after the quadruple murder, he described how Zainab had stumbled towards him before collapsing.Police said a total of 25 shots were fired and cartridges found at the scene suggested the murder weapon was an early issue Luger, similar to those once used by the Swiss army. Maillaud said each victim had been shot at least three times, and each had two bullets in the head.About 100 police officers in Britain and France have been involved in the investigation, which has spanned several countries. They were aware from the beginning that the al-Hilli brothers were involved in a bitter family dispute over their father's will, but refused to rule out any leads.The inheritance included a Swiss bank account containing €1m, an apartment in Spain, and property in Iraq including an apartment in the "green zone" in Baghdad.Maillaud said the surviving sisters, who are with a foster family, had been questioned recently, but had not added anything to the inquiry.He said Zaid al-Hilli was called in for questioning on 21 June in France, but failed to show up. He has previously denied all allegations against him.
