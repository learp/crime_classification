A teenager carrying a hairbrush was shot and killed by police officers who thought he was charging at them with a gun, US police said today.The 18-year-old's mother called police last night after arguing with her son and told them he had a gun.The 911 operator could hear the teenager shouting in the background during the call, claiming he had a gun, an NYPD spokesman, Paul Browne, said.When officers arrived at the residence in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, the teenager began screaming from the window at his mother and officers before climbing out of the window and beginning to cross a sidewalk toward the officers, holding a black object in his hand, Browne said.He said the officers backed off and ordered him to stop, but when the teenager refused and kept approaching them, they opened fire, he said.It was initially unclear how many shots were fired, with some US reports stating it was as many as 20.Investigators later discovered the object the teen was holding was a hairbrush, Browne said.He said the boy's mother had attempted to have her son, who had a history of mental illness, hospitalised yesterday morning, before the dispute that ended in the fatal shooting.At the scene, a New York City councillor, Charles Barron, said: "How many times are they going to come on the scene and [it will] lead to an unnecessary killing."This young man should still be alive today."His mother should be able to call the police department and get protection, not like she's dialling M for murder."
