A driving instructor who groped young women students over a 27-year period was yesterday jailed for nine months.Peter Knowles, 67, fondled students' breasts while pretending to adjust their seatbelts and squeezed their thighs while claiming to help them with their clutch control, Preston crown court heard.Knowles, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, assaulted nine women between 1977 and 2004. The court heard he would ask the women to lean over him after parking in order to see how far from the kerb they were and then made inappropriate sexual comments.He was convicted in September of seven indecent assaults and two counts of sexual assault. He denied all the charges and claimed some of the women were motivated by his criticism of their driving. But following his initial appearance before Rochdale magistrates, four other women contacted police with similar complaints.The most serious attack took place in September 1977 when he told a learner driver to park on secluded moorland. Knowles then lunged at her, kissing her and touching her chest before placing her hand on his groin. In a separate attack on a different girl, Knowles was invited into the victim's kitchen while she got ready. As she bent to tie her shoelaces, he walked up behind her and grabbed her chest.Stuart Denney, defending, said Knowles and his wife had fostered 200 children and had been a positive contributor to society. He had suffered from depression since his arrest last November.Passing sentence the judge, Andrew Blake, said: "These offences go back a very long way and they were committed against young girls who were vulnerable."
