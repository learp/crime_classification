As Stephen Griffiths appeared in court charged with the murder of three women, police defended their investigation, saying they had had no reason to link the disappearances.Officers in Bradford also said they had a "passionate commitment" to helping local sex workers deal with the addictions that often led to them working on the streets.Police search teams, meanwhile, were continuing the hunt for the bodies of two of the women. The remains of the third were found in bags in a river north of the city. One group of officers could be seen searching drains opposite Griffiths' home that had been opened up with a mechanical digger.The alleged connections between the cases of the three missing women became apparent only last Monday, more than 48 hours after the death of the last woman to go missing, Suzanne Blamires, 36. "Before that, we could only work on the basis of the evidence we had at the time," a West Yorkshire police source said.There has been some criticism of police in the area where two of the women, Blamires and Shelley Armitage, 31, lived, with a number of residents complaining that officers were slow to respond to reports that they were missing.However, police did mount large-scale investigations after the disappearances of the women. When Susan Rushworth, 43, a heroin addict, epileptic, and former prostitute, disappeared in June last year, officers scoured parks, railway lines and cemeteries. Police divers searched nearby rivers, and a lake was dredged.Detectives mounted numerous public appeals, distributed leaflets asking for information, spoke of their "grave concerns for her wellbeing", and helped relatives make appeals for information through the media.As the weeks dragged on without her mobile telephone being used or her bank account being accessed, police admitted that they feared the worst.However, while detectives said they thought it was possible Rushworth's disappearance could suggest she had returned to work in prostitution, they thought it more likely that it was the result of her drug addiction: she had recently returned to heroin abuse after six weeks of abstinence, and had telephoned her dealer shortly before she was last seen.When Armitage, 31, vanished on April 26th in the city's red light district, police again distributed leaflets and posted hundreds of posters around the city, interviewed large numbers of fellow prostitutes and other associates, and spoke of their concern for "a much-loved daughter and sister".They said at that time that they were not linking her disappearance with the case of Rushworth, and today insisted they could not have connected the cases as there was no evidence that would have supported such a link.Zoe Harford, who lives in the same street in the Allerton area of Bradford as Blamires, said she did not believe officers responded as quickly as they could."When Shelley went missing a month ago we called them up and told them we'd had an argument with her and hadn't seen her again and it took them three days to come and take a statement."It was only then that they came round and started prodding around her dustbins. I think it would have been different if she wasn't a prostitute."Police rejected that criticism. They opened the missing persons inquiry when Armitage's boyfriend contacted them the day after her disappearance.John Murray, another Allerton neighbour, said the police seemed to take much more interest in Blamires' disappearance than when the other women went missing. "When Shelley disappeared we didn't see the police, but on Monday police were knocking on everybody's doors," he said.One senior Bradford officer, Superintendent Angela Williams, said the alleged murders had been "a huge shock" to the city's vice squad officers.She added: "They are a group of police officers who have a passionate commitment to not just arresting women involved in prostitution – which in itself is a short term fix and solves very little long term – but in getting them out of what is often a vicious circle of sex work in order to feed a habit of drink and drugs."Williams said police worked closely with local health agencies and drugs programmes, and have a high success rate in their attempts to persuade women to seek help."We have about a 90% success rate at getting these women to engage with the services … the first step in helping women break away from their dependencies."It's easy to forget that every woman involved in prostitution didn't start out that way. They all have families, personal stories and often personal tragedies which have led them to where they are today."But many locals were angry that police ignored their complaints until it was too late. A businessman whose firm operates on Sunbridge Road, the main street where the sex workers pick up their clients, said the police could have done more to prevent the murders."When I used to work the night shift I would call the police ever other night to complain about the prostitutes on the street outside or the drug addicts shooting up in the back, but nothing was done about it," he said, asking not to be named "because we don't want our business tainted any more"."This area isn't residential, so they're not so bothered about it," he added. "Most of the people who do live here are the crack addicts housed here by the council."Looking out of the second floor window, he pointed out a sex worker outside. "They're here at all times of the day," he said. "They just don't care. If the alley at the back wasn't cordoned off you would see what they get up to. There are syringes, items of clothing, foil from the crack and heroin."Meanwhile, police in North Yorkshire who are investigating the disappearance of a woman 14 months ago said they are liaising with colleagues in West Yorkshire.Claudia Lawrence, 35, a chef, was reported missing after she failed to arrive for work.A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire Police said: "Consultation will take place with our colleagues in West Yorkshire police to ensure that any factors that are common to both cases are identified and investigated promptly."
