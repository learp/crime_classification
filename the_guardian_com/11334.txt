The most vulnerable victims of violent crimes, including abused women and refugees, are being put at a greater risk over uncertainty in funding to frontline services, officials have warned in a letter to the government. Police and crime commissioners (PCCs) from across England have called on the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to provide urgent clarification of the grants available to victims’ services.Vera Baird, PCC for Northumbria and chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners Supporting Victims Group, said: “Despite repeated requests to the Ministry of Justice, police and crime commissioners are still in the dark about how much money we will have to support victims of crime and vulnerable people.“Putting victims first is at the heart of everything we do. The uncertainty created by this delay means that help and support for victims and vulnerable people may not be available in some areas, putting people at greater risk.”There have been repeated calls for clarifications, sometimes on a daily basis, put to the MoJ from PCCs, about the issue of victim support funding – which has become a matter of urgency as many contracts come to an end in March.The delay in critical funding for vulnerable people means that many organisations may have to start redundancy processes for their staff, Baird said, leading to a lack of specialist help and support for vulnerable people.Provisions to support victims of forced marriage, “honour”-based violence, domestic slavery, trafficking and FGM, as well as specialist support for female and male victims of sexual exploitation or those involved in survival sex work, are among the support services that could be at risk, according to the PCC. Sue Pearce, chief executive of Rape Crisis Tyneside and Northumberland, a charity supporting victims of rape and sexual assault, said: “The delay in hearing about this funding is a huge cause for concern, forcing us into a position of great uncertainty where we are unable to plan ahead and ensure that we’re able to continue all our work in supporting the people who depend on us.“Important services like ours need to know where funding is coming from, and PCC funding is essential in keeping our service running to a level where we can meet the needs of vulnerable victims that need and want our support to recover from what can be the most traumatic experience.”She added that the funding had helped ensure the wellbeing of victims across Northumbria. “It would be catastrophic if it’s something we can no longer continue to deliver at a level that is so vitally needed. We can’t afford to be kept waiting any longer.”For the financial year 2015-16, the government grant to PCCs to commission victim support services was at £63m.The victims of crime bill, brought forward by Keir Starmer, the Labour MP for Holborn and St Pancras, is due to have its second reading in parliament on 29 January. The bill proposes to provide a framework for victims’ services and a legally enforceable code for victims, including the right to question the CPS on a decision not to pursue a case.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Providing funding for victims’ services is a key priority for the Ministry of Justice. Specific funding allocations will be communicated to PCCs imminently.”
