Two teenage loners plotted a massacre at their own school to murder teachers and pupils before killing themselves on the 10th anniversary of the Columbine shootings, a court heard .Matthew Swift, now 18, and his friend, Ross McKnight, 16, both from Denton, Greater Manchester, planned to bomb a shopping centre and then go on a killing spree at Audenshaw high school, a jury at Manchester crown court was told.Swift was a former pupil at the school while McKnight, his friend, still attended the school in year 11.Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Swift and McKnight had plotted the massacre, fantasised about the killing spree and agreed to carry out their plans to copy the Columbine school killings of Tuesday 20 April 1999 that saw 12 students and a teacher killed by two students. They were also fascinated by the April 1995 Oklahoma bombing.Speaking of Swift and McKnight, Wright said: "They set about planning to detonate a bomb, some form of improvised explosive device, at a shopping centre in north Manchester known as Crown Point North, and then travel to Audenshaw high school, at which they had been or were indeed still pupils of, and embark upon a killing spree in which they would murder teachers and pupils alike before killing themselves."Swift was working at an Ikea shop in Ashton-under-Lyne at the time of the alleged plot. He was described as a "prolific writer" who put his thoughts down for posterity, Wright told the court."The crown's case is, these documents were to be his epitaph," the prosecutor said. The boys had become close friends and, from the evidence, it appeared Swift had exercised a degree of influence over the younger boy, he added.McKnight had written about the Oklahoma bombing for a school IT project in which he reproduced a final poem written by the bomber, Timothy McVeigh. The younger boy had also written a piece of schoolwork, purporting to be creative writing, that portrayed an Audenshaw massacre the prosecution claimed had "unnerving parallels" with what the pair had planned."Both were loners and like-minded souls who found each other," Wright said of the defendants. On 14 March, a female friend of McKnight, whom he met through an interest in weightlifting, received a call from him in the early hours in which McKnight sounded intoxicated, the court heard.He told her he could not wait until 20 April, and that he and Swift had planned something at their school, the court heard. He spoke of the massacre at a school in Germany three days earlier, saying it would soon be the season for such things, the jury was told. McKnight allegedly told her the two had been making plans ever since he had known her, and he had kept journals.Wright quoted the friend as saying McKnight would make a bomb "and plant it in a shopping centre on a busy day when there will be thousands of people there"."He and Swift would go to school and park a car near to the entrance and put a bomb in it and go and shoot as many people as possible before killing themselves."The girl asked why he would commit such serious acts. "He informed her that he just wanted to do it and said: 'I hate them all,'" the prosecutor said, adding that she was concerned about his mental state and felt he was depressed and a loner, and called the police.The prosecution said both young men were isolated and "ominously, both hate society". Both separately submitted applications to join the army in January this year, the prosecution added.Swift and McKnight sat impassively in the dock, listening to the evidence. The jury heard McKnight had professed his love for a girl, but this was not reciprocated as she loved someone else, so he had "consoled" himself with his plans for Project Rainbow – the school massacre and the "wake-up call" he and Swift were planning to deliver.McKnight, who referred to himself using the nickname 72, put an entry in his diary: "72 + Swift = God and shitloads of dead people."Further entries and page after page of "rantings" from the diary were read to the jury by Mr Wright. They included talk of Project Rainbow's official start day, when plans and maps of the school were made in November 2007."They can do what they like while they still have a chance," McKnight wrote. "Because in about one and a half years I will fucking kill them with a great big smile on my face."Mr Wright added: "Of course, from November 2007, by moving forward one year and a half, you come to the 10th anniversary of the Columbine massacre."The diary entry continued: "I can't fucking wait to do it now, killing the shitheads off, one by one. The best thing is walking around kicking the heads as I walk past, just laughing, ha, ha, ha."McKnight talked of "sparing" two students who were friends by warning them not to come to school before the alleged attack. Swift also sent an MSN message to a female student.It read: "If I ever text you not to come into school don't question it, just don't go in."McKnight's diary goes on to talk about the "greatest massacre ever" and killing thousands of people."We will walk into school and at the end of it no one will walk out alive ... after we have finished in Audenshaw we will have to kill ourselves there and then."Swift had been given an "exclusion order" banning him from the Crown Point shopping centre in September 2007, which sparked his resentment towards the place, the jury was told.After police arrested Swift at his Ikea workplace on 14 March, officers searched his house and found the manual The Anarchist Cookbook.It contained instructions on ingredients to use in explosives and how chemicals could be converted into explosives, chapters on lethal weapons, booby traps, IEDs and Molotov cocktails, and formulae for nitroglycerine, mercury and dynamite.Police also recovered a safe from Swift's bedroom. Inside it were plans of the school.Both defendants plead not guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit murder and one count of conspiracy to cause explosions between 11 November 2007 and 15 March this year.
