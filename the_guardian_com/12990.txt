Police are to re-investigate the activities of a man believed to be the UK's most prolific paedophile after one of his victims made new allegations regarding other possible accomplices.The millionaire businessman William Goad died in prison last year where he was serving a life sentence after being found guilty of abusing thousands of boys over 40 years. But victims have long claimed that accomplices of Goad escaped justice.A spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall police said: "A victim of William Goad has made a number of allegations which are currently being investigated. This investigation is likely to take some time and is being progressed by experienced detectives in Plymouth."Victims of Goad, who was from Plymouth, cheered as he was jailed in 2004 aged 60. Judge William Taylor said he must not be freed while he remained a danger to children.Goad targeted children he employed in shops and market stalls. He owned two houses overlooking school playgrounds, set up play areas, and ran a camping club, as well as approaching children on the street. He even offered some boys a Â£50 "finder's fee" to introduce him to their friends.Goad raped the children in his home, his warehouse, his van, on camping trips and in a cottage in Dartmoor, buying their silence with drugs, money, sweets and toys, and threatening violence if they told anyone. He once boasted that he had abused almost 150 boys in one year.By 2008 alleged victims were still coming forward at a rate of one a week.
