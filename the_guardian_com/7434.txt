Derek Bond is not the only innocent man to have fallen foul of the FBI. One US newspaper last year branded it "the Federal Bureau of Incompetence". Some senior British investigators prefer "Famous But Incompetent."The agency would argue that mistakes are bound to be made. It has 11,400 special agents currently hunting 12,000 fugitives. But when the bungles come, they tend to be spectacular. Ask Lotfi Raissi. Acting for the FBI, Scotland Yard detectives arrested Mr Raissi at his home near Heathrow in September 2001. At Belmarsh magistrates court, he was accused of being the lead instructor for four of the September 11 suicide bombers, and kept in custody for six months to give the FBI time to present its evidence. The files never came. He was eventually released and cleared of all allegations, which were completely unfounded.The FBI's anthrax investigation after September 11 led vice-president Dick Cheney to declare the attacks could be linked to Osama bin Laden. They weren't. Disgruntled Americans were responsible. Frequent and ill-defined FBI warnings of imminent terrorist attacks led the New York Post to conclude: " One of these days, the FBI will issue a warning - and something will blow up. Then the agency will be able - finally - to say: 'We told you so!' "
