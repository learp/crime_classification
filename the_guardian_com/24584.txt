A former tax inspector who became fixated by the thrill of blackmailing the supermarket chain Tesco was jailed for six years yesterday.Philip McHugh sent 76 letters last summer threatening to bomb company stores, as well as threatening to contaminate dairy products with caustic soda if it refused his demands for money, which eventually rose to £1m. Fourteen stores were closed in the bomb scare but postal delays meant scores more remained open because letters arrived after the deadline McHugh had set.Judge Marie Catterson, jailing McHugh at St Albans crown court, said he was guilty of "a sustained and serious effort to extort money". McHugh, 52, from Clitheroe, Lancashire, had pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to three counts of blackmail and two of carrying out a hoax bomb threat. The court had heard he was addicted to online gambling and had debts of £37,000. He had started his campaign last May with letters to Tesco, followed by hoax bomb warnings to 76 stores. Tesco lost an estimated £1.4m in revenue.After the hoaxes McHugh wrote to Tesco executives demanding £200 a day, and an overall £1m. "I'm absolutely desperate and blood will flow if you do not cooperate," he wrote. "And I WILL destroy your business and others will pick up your customers." He was caught when he withdrew £800 from cashpoints in Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley and Carlisle last July after police decided to lure him into giving himself away.Richard Simons, defending McHugh, said he had a history of depression and had attempted suicide several times. When interviewed McHugh had said: "I knew what I was doing. It was my last gamble."
