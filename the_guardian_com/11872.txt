As the school holidays begin, children's freedoms shrink a little further. Already, anti-social behaviour laws allow police to disperse groups of two or more young people. Now, under-16s have been banned from the West End and other areas of central London after 9pm, unless accompanied by an adult. The idea, that officers will target potential deportees and drive them home, is fraught with complexity. In the absence of Mr Blunkett's ID cards, ascertaining children's ages is an imprecise science. Furthermore, it seems possible that well-heeled teenagers, burdened with Top Shop carrier bags and short of a Tube fare, would welcome a free chauffeur drive to the suburbs.But the police are not targeting the movie and pizza set. They are after the vulnerable and 'those who hang around and make trouble for others'. We do not deny the gravity of anti-social behaviour. But any tourist consulted about the perils of the West End would be likely to place litter, wheel-clampers and over-priced theatre tickets far above teenage yobs. And anyway, what is to stop young girls hanging out with 20-year-old men and claiming they are with a responsible adult? Children have rights too, and safety is prime among them. However much the police and the government might wish that all under-16s were safely engaged in a table tennis tourney in a closely monitored church hall, that is not how most modern children live. Attempting to narrow their horizons through an officious, unjustifiable and unworkable curfew that would never be imposed on any other section of the population will not make children better protected or the streets of the capital safer. It will simply swell the criminal underclass that the government seeks to eradicate.
