The Real IRA bomb makers who constructed the device that caused the Omagh atrocity built 28 similar bombs and mortars within a six year period from the massacre, Belfast high court heard yesterday.Some of these devices were used to blow up commercial targets in England, the civil action against five suspected Real IRA leaders was told.Northern Ireland's top forensic scientist also revealed to the court that some of the victims who died in the August 1998 attack could have been exposed to a 1,000C fireball. Giving evidence on the third day of the trial, Denis McAuley, a forensics expert, identified up to 28 other bomb and mortar plots in Northern Ireland, England and the Irish Republic between 1998 and 2004 in which components from the same manufacturers' batch had been used.The timer used in the devices' power units had identical factory, product and date codes to the one that set off the Omagh bomb, the court was told.The Forensic Science Northern Ireland expert gave a detailed account of how the explosives were constructed and the dissident republican strikes either side of Omagh where they were used.The court was shown a mark 19 timer power unit, the type used to trigger the bomb at Omagh and a series of other attacks. Lord Brennan QC, who is representing some of the Omagh victims' families, asked McAuley why the timer knob used to set the detonation time would have no markings to assist those planting the bomb.He replied: "I would suggest the person causing this event isn't particularly interested in a very specific time."McAuley also revealed that the 500lb bomb packed into the boot of a Vauxhall Cavalier car would have caused three separate types of lethal injury: blast, thermal and fragmentation. On the thermal injuries, McAuley said: "Anyone in the vicinity of the device would be exposed to that high temperature and would sustain extreme burns. You could be talking well in excess of 1,000C."The families of those represented in Court No 2 are suing five men they claim were central to the Omagh bomb plot. They are convicted Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt, and Seamus McKenna, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly. All five deny having anything to do with the explosion on August 15 1998 in which 29 men, women and children died. The case continues.
