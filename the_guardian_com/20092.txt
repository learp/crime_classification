A 24-year-old man is in hospital after an alleged racially motivated attack at a Tesco in north Wales.Police arrested a man on suspicion of attempted murder, after witnesses of the incident on Wednesday reportedly heard the words “white power” being shouted and saw an Asian man being chased down an aisle by an assailant with a “huge” knife and a hammer. No one else was injured, police said.The Daily Post quoted one witness, who was inside the supermarket in Mold, Flintshire, as saying: “We heard screaming. My dad looked around the corner and we followed. You could see a man who, by this time, was being held by a man we’ve been told was ex-army. He didn’t seem fazed..”Another man said: “I saw one lad chasing another lad with a knife. It was huge – it was like something out of Crocodile Dundee.“The lad he attacked was Asian. He had his hands in front of his stomach. I couldn’t tell whether his hands were cut from protecting himself or if he’d been stabbed. It looked to me like his hands were cut.”Tesco confirm the store was shut until Thursday morning as police carried out crime scene investigations and talked to witnesses.Lead investigator, DCI Alun Oldfield of North Wales police said: “A 24-year-old man was shopping in the store when he was attacked. As a result, the man sustained serious but not life threatening injuries and was conveyed to a local hospital. Initial indications are this is a racially motivated attack.”A Welsh ambulance service spokesman told the BBC: “We responded with a rapid response vehicle and an emergency ambulance and a man with serious injuries was taken to hospital.”Tesco said: “This is now a police matter and we are helping them with their enquiries.”The Daily Post said police assigned an extra 11 officers to carry out high visibility patrols in the area.Police inquiries are ongoing.
