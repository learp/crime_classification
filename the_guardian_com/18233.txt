The prime suspect in the murder of Alice Gross was discovered hanged in woodland four days after the schoolgirl ’s body was pulled from a river, an inquest has heard.The decomposed body of convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns was found in Boston Manor park, west London, on 4 October and was identified by dental records.Only press attended the brief hearing at west London coroner’s court as the inquiry into the 41-year-old Latvian’s death was opened and adjourned on Monday.Coroner’s officer Lana Atkinson told the court: “Mr Zalkalns was found on 4 October and his body was found suspended by his neck in dense woodland in Boston Manor park adjacent to the canal.“A postmortem conducted on 6 October found a conditional cause of death is consistent with hanging. There is no evidence of third-party involvement.“Police are still investigating and he was identified by dental records.”The inquest has been adjourned until December. Zalkalns served seven years in prison in Latvia for bludgeoning and stabbing his wife Rudite to death.The general labourer, who worked at a building site in Isleworth, west London, is believed to have come to the UK in 2007, but authorities here are thought to have had no record of his murder conviction.CCTV revealed him cycling behind Alice along the tow path next to the Grand Union canal on 28 August – the day she disappeared.He was reported missing from his home in Ealing, west London, a week later.Alice’s body was found wrapped and weighted down in a shallow stretch of river by London fire service divers on 30 September.The 14-year-old schoolgirl from Hanwell was identified using dental records and a postmortem examination proved inconclusive, a brief hearing into her death heard earlier this month.Her inquest was opened and adjourned until January.Scotland Yard deputy commissioner Craig Mackey has previously said that the investigation into Alice’s murder is still live despite Zalkalns having been found dead.He also defended the amount of time that it took to find Alice and Zalkalns’ bodies.Officers from 17 other police forces were drafted in to help with the search, including underwater experts from five forces and victim detection dogs and handlers from four forces outside the Met.The search was the largest operation that Scotland Yard has carried out since the aftermath of the 7 July bombings.
