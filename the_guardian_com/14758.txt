A soldier who admitted assault and unlawful wounding has had his sentencing delayed so that he can return to his regiment in Afghanistan.Gunner Christopher Barnsley, 24, who attacked two stable hands in a brawl in the North Yorkshire market town of Thirsk, was told by a judge that the move was unusual but in the public interest.He was facing a possible prison sentence at Teesside crown court, which would have led to his dismissal from the army, even if it had been suspended. But Judge Howard Crowson heard that Barnsley was keen to rejoin the Royal Artillery in Helmand province, where one of his best friends was killed by a sniper last week.Barnsley's barrister, James Kemp, told the judge: "He is due to replace anyone who is injured, at a moment's notice, but he is unable to go out because of this court case. An adjournment would unleash him to go out to Afghanistan to be deployed."Kemp added that the risk to Barnsley's future was greater than any he might pose to the public. He said: "If a term of actual or suspended imprisonment was imposed, his army career ends."At an earlier hearing, Barnsley, of Alanbrooke barracks in Thirsk, admitted unlawful wounding and assault causing actual bodily harm to Emrah Dogan and Josinaldo Junior, who work for racehorse stables near the town.Crowson adjourned sentencing until Barnsley's unit returns to Yorkshire from its tour of duty in September. He told the soldier: "It is an unusual step to adjourn a case in this way but the public interest says I should. I am very sorry to hear about the loss of your friend and I understand your desire to do your duty."Turning to the court, he said: "Public interest falls in favour of making Mr Barnsley available to carry out the service for which he has volunteered."
