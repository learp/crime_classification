Police were today hunting a gang who raided a Securitas van and escaped with up to £1m in cash.The robbers rammed the van with a tractor in Warrington, Cheshire, as it travelled to a cash delivery at 8.15pm yesterday.Cheshire police said the van had stopped behind a Volvo low loader lorry at a give way sign in the Woolston area when it was rammed by the tractor, pinning it against the truck.Two men wearing balaclavas and carrying crowbars smashed the windows and took cash before setting the flat bed truck on fire. The two guards in the van were uninjured.They are believed to have fled on foot, but police said a Volvo V40, which could have been meant to be used as a getaway car, was found less than a mile away.The vehicles have been removed from the scene for forensic tests to be carried out, and officers said they had no information about who could have carried out the raid.Carl Courtney, a Securitas spokesman, said the gang had not got away with all the money in the van and had taken "almost certainly less than a million". An unspecified amount of cash was left on the road, and Mr Courtney said details of the extent of the theft were likely to be released tomorrow."It [the raid] was during a routine run," he added. "There are nearly two raids a day in the UK on cash in transit. Some are small and quite amateur, and some succeed."Inspector Tony McEvitt, of Cheshire police, said attempts to put a figure on the amount taken were "pure speculation". One report had put the amount taken at £8m."Due to the nature of the forensic examination of the vehicle, we can't categorically state if any money was taken, let alone how much," he added.The raid came a fortnight after a gang stole £53m from a Securitas cash depot in Tonbridge, Kent. "There is nothing to link this robbery to the incident in Kent at this stage," a police spokesman said.Today, a large polythene bag, rubber vehicle trim and a broken headlight could be seen at the junction of Hardwick Grange and Kingsland Grange, where the robbery took place.Shattered glass and burned debris were also visible on the roads, which are in a sprawling industrial estate just off the M6.
