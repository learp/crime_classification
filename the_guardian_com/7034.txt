A major terror suspect involved in a forthcoming trial last night emerged at the centre of the row over foreign prisoner releases engulfing the home secretary, Charles Clarke.The Home Office confirmed that the foreign national, who comes from east Africa, was not deported after he spent two years in a British prison for robbery.It is understood that Home Office officials have no idea whether he was considered for deportation despite the fact that the rules clearly stated that his case should have been looked at. It appears there are no records to explain if his case was considered for deportation.The disclosure that a terror suspect, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was released without his deportation being considered was made by the New Statesman magazine. He was released after serving two years of a five-year sentence in September 1998 when Jack Straw was home secretary.Home Office sources insisted last night that he was not among the 1,023 foreign prisoners that Mr Clarke admitted last week had been released without their deportation being considered. But it is clear from the rules in force at the time that his offence was so serious that he should have been considered for deportation.It appears that he is not among the 1,023 because the system for dealing with foreign national prisoners was in such chaos that the Home Office does not have the file. It did not start keeping detailed central records on such releases until five months later, in February 1999.To compound the discomfort for Mr Clarke, it was also confirmed that the terror suspect applied for citizenship and got a British passport in September 2004 despite the fact that he had served a sentence for robbery. That was three months before Mr Clarke took over as home secretary from David Blunkett.The man involved was sentenced to five years for robbery in 1996 at the age of 17. Home Office sources said last night they did not know if the judge involved had recommended him for deportation. They thought it was unlikely because he was a juvenile at the time.The Conservatives said the case amounted to "an unforgivable failure to protect the public against the most serious threat to their safety".Nick Clegg, for the Liberal Democrats, said if true it would be the "gravest possible development".The new disclosure underlines the precarious position that Mr Clarke finds himself in. The police and immigration services are continuing to mount an intensive operation to find the 38 most serious offenders who have gone missing after being released without being considered for deportation.Earlier this week it emerged that the man wanted for the murder of the Bradford police officer Sharon Beshenivsky was not deported because of "logistical problems" in returning him to Somalia.Police in Hull announced they had arrested an Iraqi Kurd, Caliph Ali Asmar, in connection with an alleged sexual assault on a 15-year-old and the separate stabbing of a man in the city. The Home Office allowed him to stay in Britain despite a recommendation from his trial judge that he be deported after his release from prison last year.More than 70 leading human rights lawyers last night damned Mr Clarke's proposal to introduce the near-automatic deportation of all convicted foreign nationals, including those who have not been in prison, as too "drastic and severe".Leading immigration lawyers in a letter to the Guardian also complain of "invidious racism" not far beneath the surface of the media chorus of complaint that foreign nationals "have been left free to offend again".The signatories include barristers from Doughty Street, Matrix and Garden Court chambers as well as Asylum Aid and the Immigration Law Practitioners Association.The reform to the deportation laws will mean that not only foreign nationals who have served a prison sentence will face removal but also those who have been convicted of an imprisonable offence - even if they have only been given a community punishment.Andrew Nicol QC, of Doughty Street Chambers, said this new definition covered an enormous range of crimes: "If somebody is convicted of shoplifting for which a small fine is appropriate, is it right that they should be deported?"What people have to realise is that deportation is effectively banishing somebody from the UK. If they have been here for some years that could be a disruptive and painful measure. What is troubling is the prospect of automatic deportation for offences that are trivial."
