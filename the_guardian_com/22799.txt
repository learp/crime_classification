A restaurant owner accused of killing a schoolgirl and joking that her remains had been put into kebabs will face a retrial after a jury failed to reach a verdict.Iyad Albattiki, 30, who owns the Funny Boyz fast food shop in Blackpool, Lancashire, denied strangling 14-year-old Charlene Downes after having sex with her.His business partner, Mohammed Reveshi, 50, denied disposing of her body. Both men said they did not even know the missing teenager.Mr Justice Henriques, sitting at Preston crown court, discharged the jury today when he was told that after 11 days of deliberations they were "highly unlikely" to reach a verdict.The judge said: "It is with very great regret I discharge you from returning a verdict. There will be a retrial. I would like to thank you for the very, very conscientious way you have gone about this case."During the trial the jury heard that Charlene, who was said to be "well and happy" but whose home life was "chaotic", was one of a number of teenage girls who congregated around a district of fast food shops in the seaside town.She vanished on November 1 and no trace of her body has ever been found.Outside court, Charlene's mother, Karen, said: "We're devastated that the jury could not reach a verdict. Justice will come one day."
