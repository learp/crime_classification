A multimillionaire rabbi developed a Â£1,000-a-week cocaine habit and turned to prostitutes to blot out the pain of his wife's death, a court heard today. Rabbi Baruch Chalomish, 54, was described by his counsel, Jonathan Goldberg QC, as a "broken man" who had been a pillar of the community and charity donor. Manchester crown court was told Chalomish, a property investor and share dealer, became an alcoholic and a cocaine addict after the death of his wife, Freda, 40, in 1996. He denies supplying the drug but admits possession. His co-accused, Nasir Abbas, is being sought by police.
