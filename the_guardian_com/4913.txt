The home secretary, John Reid, last night justified the decision to split up the "not fit for purpose" Home Office as essential to win "the struggle for values and ideas" against terrorism in Britain.The stronger role for the Home Office in tackling terrorism means the creation of two new units within it - the 450-strong office for security and counter-terrorism which started work yesterday - and a cross-government "research, information and communication" unit to tackle the spread of radical Islamist ideas.The shakeup, which has been triggered by the review in the aftermath of last summer's alleged airlines plot, sees Mr Reid's security role expanded to charge of the "strategy in relation to security threats in the UK, including their overseas dimension". But much of the existing international security apparatus including MI6 and GCHQ is to remain unchanged.The decision to split the Home Office into two separate ministries - dealing with national security and with justice - was greeted with some anxiety and demands for safeguards from police and senior judges. Enthusiastic welcomes from penal reformers for the new justice ministry were tempered by the news that the home secretary will retain a "core public protection role" in sentencing policy decisions.The announcement by Tony Blair that the Home Office is losing control of criminal justice policy, including running the prisons and probation services, was made as the jail population in England and Wales reached a record 80,299, with hundreds in emergency court and police cells.The Ministry of Justice will open for business on May 9, having acquired 50,000 former Home Office civil servants and the tasks of running the criminal justice system and reducing re-offending, including creating new criminal offences. It will also take in the responsibilities of the current Department of Constitutional Affairs.Mr Reid made it clear that the new justice secretary will be an MP rather than a peer, confirming Lord Falconer, one of Tony Blair's closest advisers, will leave the job after the transition has been made. Jack Straw, Hazel Blears and Liam Byrne were all being canvassed as possible names.He claimed the shakeup will be made at no extra cost but it is expected that more money will move from the Home Office after Lord Falconer agreed a "below inflation settlement" with the Treasury in anticipation of the changes.The creation of the office of security and counter-terrorism in the Home Office has involved 150 Cabinet Office civil servants joining 300 Home Office counter-terrorism staff. The Cabinet Office remains responsible for the overall coordination of intelligence and the work of the security services.The home secretary strongly denied the new Home Office, which will be responsible for policing, immigration and identity cards as well as terrorism, will be a US-style department for homeland security. "Neighbourhood policing, the British-style of policing, will not only remain with the Home Office but so will antisocial behaviour," he said.The Home Office unit for security and counter-terrorism will be responsible for "horizon-scanning, strategy, planning and programme management" of the terrorist threat.A new ministerial committee on security and terrorism will take in the current work of the Cabinet's defence and overseas policy committee on international terrorism and "counter-radicalisation" responsibilities. It will meet monthly and be chaired by the prime minister. A weekly board, chaired by the home secretary, will include the head of MI5, senior police officers, key Whitehall departments, including the Cabinet Office and the drive to engage the Muslim community.Ken Jones, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, who will sit on the new board, welcomed the counter-terrorism changes but warned it would be a difficult transition. But he added a veiled warning about the justice ministry, saying it must strike a proper balance between "what the public need and the interests of the judiciary and legal profession who will now have a greater stake in criminal law and sentencing".The former Home Office minister, John Denham, put it more bluntly, warning criminal justice policy was now split between two departments and the police would have to run around Whitehall looking for the right civil servant to lobby.The lord chief justice, Lord Phillips, said the judges would have no objection to the justice ministry as long as structural safeguards protected the independence of the courts. He said prison overcrowding and squeezed budgets risked recurrent crisis and judges being placed under pressure to pass inappropriate sentences.The former home secretary, Charles Clarke, described the split as "an irresponsible decision" that would delay essential reforms of the criminal justice system. The shadow home secretary, David Davis, described it as "a massive distraction" which would undermine public security.The breakup: who gets whatHome OfficeOffice of security and counter-terrorismCrime and policingAntisocial behaviourDrugs policyCommunity safetySerious Organised Crime AgencyCriminal Records BureauBorders and Immigration Agency,Identity cards and passportsMinistry of JusticeNational Offender Management Service, covering prisons and probationCriminal justice reformCriminal, civil, and family lawYouth justiceCourts and tribunals, legal aidSupporting the judiciaryPrivy CouncilElectoral reformHuman rightsFreedom of informationDevolution
