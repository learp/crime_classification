The jury in the Damilola Taylor murder trial at the Old Bailey retired today to consider its verdicts.Mr Justice Hooper sent the four women and seven men out following the three-month trial. Ten-year-old Damilola Taylor died in November 2000 after bleeding to death from a thigh wound caused by broken glass on the North Peckham estate, south-east London.The prosecution alleged he was stabbed with a broken bottle after being surrounded by a gang of young robbers. The defence claims Damilola, who had arrived in Britain from Nigeria two months earlier, could have been injured accidentally after falling on broken glass. Two brothers, both aged 16, from south London, deny murder, manslaughter and assault with intent to rob. The judge told the jury: "There is no pressure of time on you. Take as much time as you need." The 12th juror was discharged by the judge in the closing stages of the trial for an undisclosed reason. Two of the original four defendants were found not guilty on the directions of the judge after he threw out the evidence of a teenage girl who claimed to have seen Damilola attacked. Mr Justice Hooper told jurors they must look at all the evidence in the case. He added that the jury must decide if alleged confessions by the brothers that they were involved in Damilola's killing were true. The prosecution has presented evidence of confessions which were allegedly made by the brothers at Feltham young offenders institute.And they must examine evidence of mobile phone records, which showed calls were made on the brothers' phones in Bermondsey at the time Damilola's body was found in Peckham, he added. The judge told jurors: "Unless you are sure the defendant did not make that call, unless you are sure he lent his phone, you could not convict."The trial continues.
