A country gardener has been cleared of poisoning a retired high court judge's lawn after being sacked following a long-running feud with the judge's horticulturist wife. Edward Hancock, 45, was accused of spraying weedkiller on Sir Richard Tucker's garden at Stanton, in Broadway, Worcestershire, after a "clash of egos" with Lady Jacqueline Tucker, a garden designer. Tucker, 77, who presided over high-profile cases such as the Polly Peck fraud trial, returned from holiday with his wife to find their lawn had turned orange, Gloucester magistrates court heard. Hancock, of Northway, Tewkesbury, had been employed at the property for 20 years before his relationship with Lady Tucker boiled over in April when she offered him a cup of coffee, which Hancock said gave him a headache.

Hancock said he had gone back to the £1.5m property after his sacking to try to fix the lawn after moss killer he sprayed earlier - at Tucker's request - had begun to turn it "bluey". He hoped that putting fertiliser on it would repair it in time for a charity open day. There was no malicious intent, he said. The chairman of the magistrates, Carol Francis, said the bench was satisfied Hancock's spraying had killed some exotic plants, but said they were sure there had been no sinister intent in his actions. He was found not guilty of causing £500 of criminal damage to flower borders and a grass verge at Tucker's farmhouse. Hancock said he was "very pleased" at the outcome.
