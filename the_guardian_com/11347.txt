Amanda Knox has moved on from being the subject of headlines to writing them. The woman facing a murder charge retrial in Italy is now working as a journalist.She has been contributing articles to the West Seattle Herald for a couple of months, reports the Daily Beast. Knox, 27, was reconvicted in January this year of the murder of Meredith Kercher, the daughter of a British journalist, in Italy in 2007. That decision was taken in her absence and she has made it clear she will not return to Italy to stand trial.The Herald used to report on the twists and turns in the murder case against Knox, such as the Italian court ruling that she must stand trial again.Now the Herald is featuring articles by Knox, such as an interview with theatre director, and a preview of a high school drama production. The Herald, a local weekly in Washington state, invited Knox to write after she sent in samples of her work, said the paper's managing editor, Ken Robinson.He told the Daily Beast: "We simply asked her as we would ask anyone of that age and stage, if they would be interested in writing for us as a qualified writer of that scale and this level of journalism."The paper initially agreed that Knox could use a pen name "to give her the protection," said Robinson. She started to use her own name after she "got her feet wet." Robinson said: "Amanda's a very bright, very capable, highly qualified writer... It doesn't matter what people say or think â€” the truth is that she's a West Seattle resident, she grew up here. Why not give her the opportunity to be an actual human being versus a celebrity?"Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were found guilty of the murdering Meredith Kercher in 2009. They were acquitted on appeal in 2011.In January this year, the original verdict was upheld. Knox, who has always maintained her innocence, is appealing against that ruling.Source: Daily Beast
