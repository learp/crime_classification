South Yorkshire police yesterday issued a security camera picture of a white Transit van they want to trace after it was involved in a hit and run accident in which a seven-year-old boy was killed. Detectives believe the van may be damaged at the front and urged anyone with information to come forward. They suggested it could be a company vehicle, possibly W-registered or newer, and appealed for help in tracing the driver. Kyle McDermott died in Sheffield children's hospital after he received multiple injuries when he was struck by the van as he rode his bike near his home on Monday night.
