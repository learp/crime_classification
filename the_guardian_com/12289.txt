I can still vividly remember his dark, pinstripe suit, so skilfully tailored that it retained its immaculate shape even when he sat down, and his lightly tanned, manicured hands emerging from stiff white cuffs. It was the summer of 1990 and Lord Justice Woolf, as he was then, had come to visit the high-security Midlands prison where I was being held as part of his inquiry into the Strangeways riot and other prison disturbances. At that time the prison was well known in the system for holding mainly "hardcore" offenders. Long sentences and cramped accommodation made for a tense atmosphere. Wing life could be precarious, with a stabbing or a scalding almost every other day. "Paranoia City", the inmates called it. Lord Woolf had already spoken to the governors and the prison officers, and now he wanted to talk to the prisoners. There were about 30 of us present that morning, serving sentences ranging from five to 35 years. We sat on soft-backed chairs, set in three semi-circle rows in the prison chapel. After some polite small talk, Woolf explained why he was there: "We need to try and find out what it is actually like to be in prison." Until that moment, this was not something I had spent much time thinking about. What was it like to be in prison? Didn't he know? Of course he didn't - how could he? But for the first time since beginning my sentence six years earlier, I contemplated the fact that the people responsible for sending us to prison had no idea what it was like. Perhaps that was the problem. Around me, men I had never before heard discussing their feelings about prison were doing their best to fill in the blanks. It was "educational", one said. "In what way?" the judge wanted to know. "Well, you learn to understand yourself better," came the reply. "You spend so much time in your head". Others talked about the loneliness, the fear, the paranoia. I sat there and drifted back to my first day as a prisoner. I'm walking along a gantry-style landing on the long-term wing of a large London prison. I'm on the third floor - "the threes". I'm carrying a plastic bucket inside which clatters a plastic cup, knife, fork and spoon. Under my arm I have a "bedroll": two flannel sheets rolled up inside two coarse blankets. I'm guided to my cell by a large prison officer sporting a handlebar moustache. The peak of his cap has been "slashed" so it fits low over the bridge of his nose. We reach the cell and with a noisy rattle of his keys he unlocks the door and pushes it open. He's smiling "In you go son, don't be shy". The door slams shut behind me. The cell is dimly lit by a small, grime-covered fluorescent light. The walls are covered in cracked and flaking emulsion. There's a table, a chair, and a metal bed, with a stained mattress and half a foam pillow. The heavily barred window high up on the wall is closed, and the urine-tainted air makes me want to retch. I sit down on the bed. Time to collect my thoughts - but no, I hear a sound like rolling thunder approaching fast, and suddenly the cell door is unlocked and pushed open again. "Slop out and get your tea," instructs handlebars. A stream of denim-clad men in identical blue-and-white-striped shirts are shuffling past my door. I step out and join the flux. Down two flights of metal stairs to the ground floor; we're headed towards a set of trestle tables. A row of prisoners in white are serving food. Before I get there I am stopped in my tracks by a scream: "He's fuckin' dead meat!" "Nonce! He's fuckin' dead meat!" I turn and see two men: one wields a mop handle, the other a metal bucket. They are using the domestic implements to beat a third prisoner who cowers in a cell doorway. "He's fuckin' dead meat!" Suddenly I'm aware that no one else is stopping. Nobody is intervening. Few even look in the direction of the violence. I fall back in line, pick up a tray, collect my meal and return to my cell. As I sit on the chair and spoon down the food, all thoughts and feelings about why I am in prison are relegated. My first priority, I now understand, is to learn to survive. Back in the chapel, a prisoner was telling the judge that life inside was "a war of survival". I recognised the angry voice instantly: it was John, who lives on my spur. The same John who a few months earlier had led an attempt to burn a number of sex offenders. John's accomplice had been transferred out of the prison following the riot but he had remained, his status with other prisoners enhanced. I half wished that somebody would explain this to the judge, and say: "Your honour, that's what prison is like." The judge's visit set me thinking. Prison was no doubt necessary. But it was unsettling that prison life was such a mystery to society. There seemed an assumption among many on the outside that people in prison were inherently different. Prisoners were not individuals, but a collective, with the same crude standards, values, and culture - a sub-race, almost. It made me think about some of the people I had met inside. There was Dave, who on the out had been a postman; Howard, who had been a student; and Tam who had been a council worker. The four of us played pool at the weekend. Tam was the captain of the wing football team, nicknamed "the Commander" for his prowess in midfield. Dave had asthma so he'd taken up jogging. He'd lost two stone, bolstered his health and begun doing sponsored runs around the football pitch for charity. Howard spent his days in the education department studying and dreaming of becoming a teacher. Three and a half years later, my next movement order came through. By then Tam had been transferred to Scotland. Dave was in a semi-open prison, let out regularly to take part in charity road runs. And Howard was dead - diabetes-induced coma. One night in bed he went to sleep with his face in the pillow and never woke up. Prison life is mostly a continuous repetition of the same day, over and over again. Finding a purpose and a meaning beyond "punishment" can be a struggle. Often people are not in prison long enough to discover anything worthwhile beyond a new set of criminal alliances. Or people end up inside for so long that any good that might have been achieved along the way is undermined by bitterness and resentment. The paradox of imprisonment lies in society's expectations: the community wants retribution, but also rehabilitation. For many, sending people to prison is not enough; they must suffer while there. But only somebody who has never been to prison would believe that jails are "soft" places. I remember the campaign a few years ago calling for prisons to be made more "austere". But the truth that the austerity brigade failed to grasp is that the harsher a prisoner feels himself to have been treated, the less of an obligation he will feel to abide by society's rules, and the more likely new victims will be created after release. Official figures speak for themselves - more than half of prisoners reoffend within two years of release. I have seen it with my own eyes: a young man serving four years, and not prepared to kowtow to what he sees as the intransigence of the prison regime. Why can't he go out on the exercise yard when it's raining? Why has his mother not been allowed to visit him just because she brought the wrong visiting order by mistake? He gets known as a "troublemaker", goes "on report", and loses his "time off for good behaviour". Less than two years after he is freed, he is back, serving a minimum 25-year sentence. Any connection? A fair answer to Lord Woolf's question would not be entirely bleak. Opportunities for personal advancement abound in prison. I have never been in a jail which did not have an education department, library, gymnasium, chapel, psychologists, probation officers and counsellors. I have been a beneficiary of all the above. When I sat on that bed in that London prison 17 years ago, I never dreamed how my life would be transformed. I could barely string two sentences together; now I sit here with an embarrassment of qualifications, which include Braille transcription, sports leadership, a clutch of O levels and an arts degree. There are many fine people who work in prisons. I recall the cookery teacher who made sure everyone in her class got to make a Christmas cake to send home to their families, even when they couldn't afford the ingredients. The teacher who taught his play-reading group to love Shakespeare. The young prison officer who treated prisoners with such respect that, when he died suddenly, dozens in their best striped shirts lined the route from the gate to the prison to bow their heads to his hearse. And the governor who had the courage to tell a man convicted of brutal crimes that, in his view, considering the man's background, he was as much a victim as his victims. But the fact remains that I've never been in a jail where making prisoners feel good about themselves was a priority. Many prisoners were sceptical about private prisons at first. The morality of making profit from imprisonment seemed questionable at best. But the message began to spread that they were preferable to state-run prisons. A conversation with a prison auxiliary helped me understand why. He had transferred prisoners to a private prison. "You should see the difference," he said. "As soon as the cons get out of the van, they're greeted with a 'Good morning, Mr Smith, would you like to come this way?' They're reminded that they're people first and prisoners second. Their whole demeanour changes. They're polite in return to the staff, and each other!" I had to admit I had never been to a prison like that. Prison is designed to disempower. Everyone in jail is vulnerable to a greater or lesser extent. Prisoners live at the mercy of those who are in charge, and of each other, and dignity is a scarce commodity. If the regime is accompanied by an attitude that undermines a prisoner's confidence and self-esteem, then all the stated good intentions will be worth nothing. It is when prisoners feel that they are not being afforded respect as people that the cynical prison culture - the culture of John and the nonce beaters - thrives. During the course of his inquiry, Lord Woolf visited 43 prisoners. When his 600-page report was published, optimism surged through the system. That was until it was all but mothballed by the "prison works" philosophy of the mid-90s. More people in prison, the theory went, meant less criminals on the streets, so less crimes being committed. Before this idea took off, the chaplain in a jail I was in told me: "Mark my words, in future imprisonment will be about warehousing." I witnessed what he meant. Within two years the jail doubled its population, but had its education budget slashed. Staff and prisoner morale collapsed. Similar changes occurred all over the country. Since then prison numbers have soared, as have suicides, and the best those who serve society can come up with is more of the same. Prison can work, but not if the system is overloaded and under-resourced. And if it is to work in society's best interest, it is imperative that only those that really need to be locked up, are, and that all prisons work towards a positive regime where respect and dignity for inmates is not compromised for misguided reasons. A few weeks ago, Lord Woolf urged politicians to stop "playing the jail card". Those who do play a dangerous game of bluff, and there can be no winners in the long run - only more victims.  Erwin James is serving a life sentence. He writes fortnightly in G2.
