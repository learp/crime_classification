A church organist was subjected to a "brutal attack" on his way to midnight mass on Christmas Eve, police have said.Alan Greaves, 68, from Sheffield, who later died from his injuries, was described as "highly respected" in his community and police appealed for any information to assist their investigation.Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, of South Yorkshire police, said the motive was not yet known but, based on the injuries Greaves suffered, it was likely that a weapon was used.Fenwick said: "At 11pm on Christmas Eve Mr Greaves left his house and walked towards the nearby church where he performs as an organist."Between his house and that location he was subjected to the brutal attack. At 11.15pm a member of the public found Mr Greaves and called the emergency services."He was a family man and the family are devastated about what has taken place. I would like to appeal on their behalf and on my behalf for anyone who might have witnessed any part of this incident or anyone who has information that could assist this investigation to please contact us."He said officers could not think of any motive for anyone to attack Greaves and that robbery was one of the lines of inquiry they were pursuing.The community was described as being appalled by what had happened and a number of witnesses have already come forward.
