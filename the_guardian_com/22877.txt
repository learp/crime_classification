A schoolboy who repeatedly threatened to kill a teacher before raping her in a deserted classroom was sentenced to life in prison yesterday.Sentencing him at the Old Bailey, Judge Christopher Moss described the assault last September as a "truly dreadful crime" which had left the woman emotionally and physically scarred.He said he agreed with a doctor's report which said that there was a high risk of the boy reoffending, and that he had probably planned or rehearsed the rape in a fantasy."You subjected your victim to the terror of a physical, sexually degrading and humiliating attack in her own classroom," he told the boy, who had admitted the attack at an earlier hearing. "This was a prolonged, persistent and violent rape."The assault happened at the Westminster City School for Boys in central London.The court heard that the 28-year-old had been marking books at the end of the school day when she was grabbed from behind.Brendan Kelly, prosecuting, told the court: "He was telling her to be quiet and dragged her the length of the classroom. He is a large boy. He had no trouble dragging her, while continuing to tell her to be quiet."The woman tried desperately to fend him off, kicking him in the groin and stabbing him with a pen, but he throttled her and repeatedly threatened to kill her."He made it quite clear he would kill her and repeated the threat throughout," said Mr Kelly. "It was clear to her that he intended to rape her vaginally and she did all she could to resist. He then head-butted her."The teenager ripped off the teacher's clothes and subjected her to repeated sexual assaults before running away. The court heard that after the attack the woman's face was so badly injured that her colleagues were unable to recognise her.After the teenager's arrest, it emerged that he had been implicated in two other allegations of serious sexual assault, but was not prosecuted for either. He was also on bail for the alleged possession of a knife.A joint inquiry has been launched by the Metropolitan police, social services and the school to see if "any lessons can be learned" in light of the case.But yesterday the woman, who described teaching as her "vocation", said that if the authorities knew of the youth's history he should not have been at the school.She insisted the boy was an "obvious threat" and said she was considering legal action against the school authorities."I always said I can't be the only one who's been attacked by him," she said. "If they had known that, it seems quite clear to me that he shouldn't have been in there."Steve Sinnott, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, which is representing the woman, said she was "considering various actions against those in charge of the school".Earlier the court heard that the boy was one of the school's brightest pupils and had been in line to win a prestigious scholarship and had hoped to continue his studies in the US.When the life sentence was announced there were cries from the public gallery and the teenager broke down in the dock.Judge Moss said the youth would not be eligible for parole for four and a half years and would not be released until doctors were convinced that he was no longer a danger.Speaking outside the court, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Rowell, who led the investigation, said the sentence was "a true reflection of the appaling nature of this crime".After the sentence the woman said that she was determined to return to teaching. "Until sentencing was over, I felt that I couldn't get on with putting my life back together again, returning to my career. My commitment remains intact, but the effect of the attack is that I'm going to be very limited in the spheres I can work in, certainly for a few years."She added: "I am glad the boy has been given a lengthy period of incarceration; not out of vengeance but to protect others from what I have been through."But she said that prison on its own was not enough. "He needs help and treatment. Had he received that help and treatment at an earlier stage, maybe I would not have suffered at his hands."
