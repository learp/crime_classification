Plans to extend police powers to stop and search people with minimal bureaucracy are to be announced by Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, next week.Smith will allow police forces to designate hotspot zones within their areas where officers would be able to carry out searches, backed up only by a brief voice-recording of explanation.The plans were taken to cabinet yesterday after she received the final report from a review of policing by Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the chief inspector of constabulary.The proposals are likely to be controversial, particularly within the black community, for fear that they will be used to unfairly target ethnic minorities. But the government believes they will help cut down paperwork and release more police time for maintaining a street presence.In September Flanagan said in his interim report that officers were being tied down by "a culture of risk aversion which can seriously dilute, or at worst remove, discretion or professional judgment".Changes to "stop and account" rules were changed following the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence, with police being required to record all stops. Government sources say trials of the new scheme have not provoked a negative reaction from local communities.
