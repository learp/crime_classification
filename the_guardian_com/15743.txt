A young mother was starting a minimum 23-year sentence today for the murder of her four-year-old daughter, whose naked body was found covered in bruises, bite marks and cigarette burns.Sharon Wright was jailed with her partner, Peter Mckenzie-Seaton. His rages when he could not get skunk cannabis were blamed for the brutal killing, and he was also given a minimum 23-year term.A jury at Bradford crown court took under five hours to find both guilty of murdering Leticia Wright, whose injuries were described as like those of a traffic accident victim.Passing sentence, Mr Justice Walker, said the mother was "undoubtedly in it together" with Mckenzie-Seaton when it came to the brutality. "That applies just as much to the biting, burning, and branding as it does to all the other injuries."The court heard that neighbours had grown anxious about the child after McKenzie-Seaton, 22, who had a record of violence, moved in with Wright.Social workers called at the home in Huddersfield four weeks before the girl's body was found. They saw no injuries, found her weight normal, and noted she was registered with a local nursery. Soon afterwards, the court was told, she must have been subjected to a vicious attack which left her with 100 separate injuries.Paul Johnson, head of safeguarding at Kirklees council, said an independent report had concluded the death could not have been foreseen by its staff, but procedures were being reviewed.
