An illegal immigrant who abducted a nurse, and then left her bound and gagged in the boot of her car for 10 days, has been jailed for at least eight years.Justice Ngema, 35, who entered the UK using his brother's passport, was also told he would be deported back to South Africa as soon as the parole board decides he can safely be released from prison.Ngema was jailed at the high court in Glasgow today for the "appalling" and "chilling" abduction and assault of Magdeline Makola, a 38-year-old nurse from Livingston in West Lothian, in December last year.After Ngema stole her bank cards to fund a Christmas spending spree, he left Makola bound, gagged and without any food and water in the boot of her own car. She was found 10 days later in Airdrie, Lanarkshire, on Boxing Day, severely dehydrated and ill with hypothermia.Lord Menzies, the judge, told Ngema: "What you did was to inflict a truly dreadful physical and mental ordeal on a young woman who had done you no harm at all."He continued: "It is quite remarkable that she survived for so long: if the weather conditions had been different, or if she had not been so strong, she could easily have died."The medical evidence is that she would not have survived a further two days in the boot of her car … It must have been incredibly uncomfortable and terrifying for her – the stuff of nightmares."The nurse, who was born in South Africa and works at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, said today that she had begun "making friends with death" during her ordeal.In an interview with Sky News, she said: "The most worrying thing was that rope in my neck. All of a sudden I just started making friends with death."I tried to kick the boot but I started to lose hope. I said, 'what else could I do?' because people were not hearing me at all."Lord Menzies said Ngema's behaviour after the abduction was "particularly chilling". He had behaved entirely normally with friends, and had shown no remorse about his behaviour with psychiatrists appointed by the court to assess his risks to the public.He told police he abducted Makola, whom he did not know well, because she had "disrespected" him.The judge continued: "The author of the risk assessment report observed that you lack any empathy, you have an egocentric perception of the world and the offence, and you tend to externalise blame for your actions, minimising responsibility for your offending. She expressed the opinion that, if at liberty, you pose a high level of risk to the safety of the public at large."Ngema had previously tried to claim asylum in the UK, but was refused and deported in May 2002. The following August, he returned to the UK, entering on his brother's passport.
