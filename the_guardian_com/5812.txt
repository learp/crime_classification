The Archbishop of Canterbury last night blamed the government for the current jails crisis, accusing it of an obsession with a "custodial fundamentalism" that was choking an already "overloaded and ineffectual" prison system.Rowan Williams, calling for a commission of inquiry into the "failing" prison system, said that the creation of "more and more criminal offences" all carrying a prison sentence was simply leading to a costly penal culture that was "worse than useless" in tackling reoffending.Delivering the Prison Reform Trust lecture in London, the archbishop was also sharply critical of the government's new legislation putting parts of the criminal justice system out to franchise, the exclusion of deaths in custody from the current corporate manslaughter bill and the failure to give prisoners the vote.His intervention comes as the prison population in England and Wales has gone through the 80,000 barrier, with hundreds of inmates locked out of overcrowded local jails in police and even court cells.Dr Williams warned of the dangers of a victim-led criminal justice system. Instead he called for much greater consideration to be given to "restorative justice" and "community justice" alternative approaches involving more informal mechanisms such as mediation, apologies and reparations between victims and offenders.He added: "I say nothing - though a great deal could be said, and indeed has been said in the last week or so - of the way in which the custodial obsession, the creation of more and more offences with a custodial tariff, simply chokes the prison system and compounds all the failures in responsibility for prisoners ... nor will I elaborate on the cost to taxpayers of an ineffectual and overloaded system, and the wider costs in patterns of reoffending."But the archbishop said that a penal culture in which there was no real attention to how offenders change was worse than useless because it reinforced low self-worth and a lack of any sense of having a stake in the community.He argued that it was not at all obvious that the "stigma" of jail worked as a sanction amongst the petty criminals whose theft, vandalism and drug offences stemmed from their educational deficits or mental health challenges."Paradoxically, brief custodial sentences are likely to be the least effective in changing or challenging behaviour, given ... overcrowding, frequent movement, uneven provision of rehabilitative services and so. There is good evidence that re-offending rates are proportionately higher among short-sentence prisoners."The archbishop also attacked the franchising of probation services being discussed by MPs in the management of offenders bill: "Moves to put parts of the system out to tender or franchise sends the message that the community as a wholly is not fully committed [to the] business of challenging offender behaviour."He added that the time had come for a comprehensive commission on penal policy and non-custodial options, including restorative justice schemes: "We cannot for much longer manage with an expanding prison population whose levels of re-offending are so high."
