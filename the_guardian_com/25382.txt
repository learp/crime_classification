 Alison, 16, from StockportIt wasn't just the theft of my mobile that upset me, it was the abusive phone calls that followed. It was a Saturday afternoon in Manchester and all my mates were Christmas shopping. I stopped to have a burger with two friends. It was crowded and I was wearing a backpack with my phone in a pocket. Someone must have undone my bag. I noticed about an hour later. I dialled my number and an 11-year-old kid answered, laughing that he'd swiped my phone. There were obviously other kids with him. I wasn't shocked as you see groups of 12-year-old scallies round here a lot. I've seen them since and I'm sure they're doing the same thing to other people. The boy on the phone said the gang would return the mobile if I met them and paid them £30. In the course of five more calls they raised the price to £60 and then to £80, all the time insulting me. The phone was worth £100. I had bought it with a mixture of birthday money and savings and I'd had it for six months. I told the police who said plainclothes officers would come with me to meet the thieves. But when I phoned the boys they began shouting obscenities, saying I had the police there and they weren't going to meet me. So they got off scot-free. That afternoon they sent a couple of abusive text messages to the phone I'd used to call them. My mobile wasn't insured but I replaced it that day. I still spend around £20 a month on calls, mostly text messages to friends. I was gutted by the theft. But I wasn't surprised. Now I always have my mobile in my pocket. I know some people who have had more than one mobile stolen. There doesn't seem to be any way to stop it.· Interview by Angelique Chrisafis
