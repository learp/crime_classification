An 11-year-old girl, who became a symbol of youth crime when she was pictured allegedly vandalising a supermarket, appeared in court yesterday after being arrested for the 36th time this year. The girl was arrested yesterday morning outside a Sainsbury's store in Brislington, Bristol. She was also arrested on Tuesday outside the store, and officers had to use CS spray to restrain her. Last month she was photographed allegedly attacking the Sainsbury's store. A youth court banned her from going near it as part of her bail conditions. In the first incident this week the 11-year-old, who can not be named for legal reasons, was reportedly spotted in the Sainsbury's car park and police were called. Avon and Somerset police say their officers were pelted with stones and that they had to use CS spray in order to handcuff her. Bristol youth court granted her bail after that incident. Police say the girl was then arrested at 5am in the same Sainsbury's car park. She appeared before the youth court yesterday afternoon where Dudley Thomas, chairman of the bench, told her: "We keep asking you to try to resolve and help us, but you're not doing it are you? "Please just try to conform. It upsets your mum." She was bailed until April 15 and will appear to face charges of assault, criminal damage, theft and breach of bail. Her mother said her daughter was not a yob, but just a "frightened little girl" who desperately needed help. Courts cannot send children under 12 to youth jails or secure accommodation except for grave crimes and with the approval of the home secretary. In a separate case, an 11-year-old boy appeared in court for the 151st time in a year yesterday. Police say the boy, who cannot be named because of his age, is said to have stolen a car almost every day for the past two years. The boy was freed again by Cardiff youth court. His parents said he was being failed by the justice system.
