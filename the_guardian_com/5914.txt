Police have launched a fresh investigation into the murder of a police constable who was killed during the Broadwater Farm riots more than 18 years ago, Scotland Yard said today.PC Keith Blakelock, a father of three, was set upon by a mob and hacked to death during the riot in Tottenham, north London, on October 6 1985.Police said a review of the case had identified "new lines of inquiry" which were to form the basis of the new investigation.Winston Silcott was convicted in 1987 of the murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison but his conviction was overturned on appeal because of tainted police evidence.He was awarded £17,000 in compensation by the home secretary for his wrongful conviction and in 1999 received a further £50,000 from the Metropolitan police for wrongful arrest and imprisonment.Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur said the new investigation would be a "tightly focused inquiry"."The review took us in a number of directions, but there are some specific leads which we are now looking at."We cannot go into exact details as this could seriously prejudice our inquiries. Suffice to say that we believe this information is strong enough to merit further investigation."At this stage we cannot be sure where the new inquiry will lead us but I would like to reassure members of the local community that this is not something we have undertaken lightly."The decision to reopen the case had been taken only after consultation with PC Blakelock's family, he added."We are grateful for the input we have received, particularly from Keith's family, the local community and the wider black community, whose views have greatly shaped how we will approach this new inquiry."This was a brutal murder on an unarmed police officer who was protecting the local community. This new inquiry is a mark of our commitment to protect our police officers and the people they serve and bring to justice those who seek to harm them."A fresh investigation had also been launched into the attempted murder of PC Richard Coombes, who was injured in the riots.
