Police hunting the fugitive father of a murdered bride said yesterday that the number of unconfirmed sightings had topped 50.Detectives believe that Terry Rodgers, 55, who vanished along with an illegally held shotgun after his daughter, Chanel Taylor, 23, was killed last Friday, is hiding near the village of Huthwaite, near Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, where she lived. Details of the missing man, who gave Mrs Taylor away at her wedding seven weeks ago, have been sent to all police forces but are also being shared with manhunt under way in central Nottinghamshire for the former miner and murder suspect Robert Boyer. Mr Rodgers, who was known to police before his daughter was shot at close range, had recently sold his business after financial difficulties. Described as domineering and possessive towards his daughter and his son Colt, 19, his own marriage had broken down and he was taken in three weeks ago by Mrs Taylor and her husband, Lee, 22. Neighbours said he had previously spent a period living in a caravan and friends' houses, and police have raised the possibility that someone may be sheltering him. His wife and son have made public appeals to him to give himself up to police. Mrs Taylor was found dead by her husband at their rented terrace house in Huthwaite early on Friday afternoon. She had suffered a single shotgun wound to her head. Mr Rodgers' car was later found abandoned in Hucknall, 10 miles south along the M1, where he had lived before his marriage and where he also has friends. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Cottee said: "There has been a massive response to the appeals for help. "Officers working on this case are actively seeking people who know Terry Rodgers, and information we have received over the past few days has given us interesting new lines of inquiry to follow up."
