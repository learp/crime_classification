He will be sentenced at a later date.The former Royal Marine, who heard "You're fired" from Lord Sugar in week eight of the show, made a guest appearance on Sunday night's final, when he was part of winner Stella English's team creating, marketing and selling an alcoholic drink.His Apprentice profile said he claims to show no emotion, likes to be pushed and, as a former marine, is not afraid to give people a "kick up the backside".A keen golfer and health and fitness fanatic, he also claims to be "focused and driven".He told BBC executives: "I've been to the other side of things where friends lose legs, lose limbs, so I know I'm lucky to be where I am."I was a sniper in the Royal Marines and I take that killer instinct across into business."
