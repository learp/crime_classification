Declining crime rates in Britain will deliver savings of more than £80m a year on the government's criminal legal aid bill without the need of further cuts, according to an economic report commissioned by the Law Society.The figures are revealed in the organisation's Law Society Gazette a week after criminal barristers and solicitors staged a mass walkout in protest at Ministry of Justice proposals to reduce the annual legal aid budget by £220m a year.More than half of the MoJ's cutbacks – £120m – are due to come from reducing the cost of lawyers attending police stations, representation in magistrates court and cases being heard in crown courts.The report, by Oxford Economics, is a critique of the Legal Aid Agency's (LAA) "steady state" forecasts for criminal legal aid expenditure. The Oxford economists have built an "alternative forecast based on plausible assumptions of future trends in crime and the criminal justice system".The study points out that "crime has been on a steady downward trajectory for the last decade".Assuming further drops in crime and therefore reduced demand for criminal legal aid, the Oxford Economics study says, the MoJ's annual bill could be £84m lower by the year 2018-19.The work was commissioned by the Law Society of England and Wales, the Criminal Law Solicitors Association, the London Criminal Courts Solicitors Association, the Legal Aid Practitioners Group and the Big Firms Group whose solicitors will lose up to 17.5% in cuts to fees under the MoJ proposals.The report notes that the LAA forecast – used by the MoJ to calculate its £120m annual savings – remains constant after the first year.The Oxford Economics research also maintains that the belated impact of past reforms is still delivering further reductions in legal aid costs, some of which may not have been taken account of by the department. The projected decrease in spending of £84m could, therefore, be even higher.Desmond Hudson, the Law Society's chief executive, said: "Taken as a whole, the cost of the criminal justice system to the taxpayer in England and Wales remains comparable with other countries in Europe after allowing for their different systems."The expenditure on criminal cases has not risen in two decades and is set to shrink further following more fee cuts. Additional cuts proposed in the latest plans could have a devastating impact on access to justice and many legal aid solicitors have already reached the point of despair."We are proposing a better way forward, so that our members may continue to uphold the rule of law and provide access to justice to the public. We will all be poorer if confidence in our criminal justice system falls. This approach and engagement with the MoJ has already secured the wholesale abandonment of price-competitive tendering which would have seen 1,200 legal firms go out of business as well as gaining concessions on client choice and quality standards."Nicola Hill, president of the London Criminal Courts Solicitors' Association, said: "What you see clearly with this independent report by reputable economists is that the government's numbers just don't stack up. The lord chancellor claims £120m needs to be saved from the criminal legal aid budget. This report shows quite clearly that substantial amounts (two-thirds, in fact) could be saved from the criminal defence budget simply by doing nothing at all."If ever there were hard and fast evidence of why the MoJ should rethink their devastating plans for legal aid, it's now. It's not too late but time is running out. We fully embrace continuing to improve and increase efficiencies in the criminal justice system but scrimping on legal advice and attacking justice for all is not the way to do it."Carol Storer, director of Legal Aid Practitioners' Group, said: "This report provides the clearest evidence yet that the cost of legal aid in the police station, magistrates and crown courts is already falling significantly. Indeed, the Legal Aid Agency's business plan for 2013-14 predicts that spend will be reduced to £1,828m, a reduction of 7.7% from the previous year."The MoJ persists in claiming that the cost of legal aid is around £2bn a year and describes it as "one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world".An MoJ spokesperson said: "We believe the analysis on which the report is based leads to inaccuracies. If we had used this methodology in past years, we would have repeatedly overspent on our litigation legal aid budget."In response to last week's protest by solicitors and barristers, a spokesperson said: "We entirely agree lawyers should be paid fairly for their work, and believe our proposals do just that. We also agree legal aid is a vital part of our justice system – that's why we have to find efficiencies to ensure it remains sustainable and available to those most in need of a lawyer."
