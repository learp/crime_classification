The Hatton Garden raiders boasted that the heist was the “biggest robbery in the fucking world”. In legal terms, they were wrong. As no violence or guns were used, the £14m theft was formally classed as a burglary, not a robbery.Here is a list of 10 of Britain’s biggest robberies and burglaries, updated to include Hatton Garden. They are ranked by the value of the goods stolen at the time of the crime, rather than being adjusted for inflation.1. Securitas depot robbery, Tonbridge, Kent – £53.1m (2006)Men posing as police officers kidnapped Colin Dixon, the manager of the Securitas depot in Tonbridge, which handled cash for the Bank of England, on 21 February 2006. As this happened, another band of fake policemen kidnapped Dixon’s wife and eight-year-old son. In the early hours of the following morning, all three were taken to the depot at gunpoint where 14 members of staff were tied up. Less than two hours later, the gang left with more than £53m in cash. 2. Graff Jewellers robbery, London – £40m (2009)Two men in suits, armed with handguns, walked into Graff’s New Bond Street store and took 43 items of jewellery, much of it diamonds, on August 6 2009. 3.
