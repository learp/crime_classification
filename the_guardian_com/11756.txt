Two gangland thugs who shot a 14-year-old dead as she walked home from a funfair were today jailed for life.Danielle Beccan was hit in the stomach in a drive-by shooting as she and friends walked home from the annual Nottingham Goose Fair through an area disputed by rival gangs.At Birmingham crown court, the judge, Mr Justice Butterfield, ordered that 20-year-old Mark Kelly, of Wilford Grove, The Meadows, Nottingham, and Junior Andrews, 24, of no fixed address, should serve a minimum of 32 years before they would be considered for parole.There were shouts of "yes" from the public gallery when the jury of eight men and four women returned their verdict after 16 hours of deliberation.Danielle was only yards from her home in the St Ann's area of Nottingham when she was shot just after midnight on October 9 last year.Her mother, Paula Platt, was among the first people on the scene, and cradled her dying daughter in her arms.Kelly and Andrews had denied murder, but the jury was told that Kelly had been driving the gold Citroen Xsara car his gang used to scour the streets of St Ann's looking for a victim. Andrews, who was a front seat passenger, had previously filmed himself bragging: "I'm a real killer"."You robbed a bright young girl of her life and blighted forever the lives of her family and friends," the judge told the defendants."It was a random killing involving the use of a firearm, and the appropriate starting point is 30 years."In my judgment, the aggravating feature in this case is that there was a significant degree of premeditation and the victim was particularly vulnerable because of her age."I can find no mitigating features. This is a joint offence - you are both equally responsible. The minimum term you must both serve is 32 years."Following the sentencing, the judge told Danielle's family and friends that nobody who had sat through the trial could have failed to be impressed by the dignity "with which they have watched these proceedings, no matter how painful"."Nothing can began to compensate you for your loss," he said. "At the conclusion of the trial, one chapter is over and you have the heartfelt sympathy of us all."During the trial, the jury heard Danielle's killers were long-term members of the Waterfront gang, who the proescution said had a hatred for people from St Ann's.The men, who had been out burgling in the more affluent area of Clifton in the hours before the shooting, had gone into St Ann's shortly after midnight, intending to "shoot up" people from the estate.Kelly, driving the Citroen Xsara, which belonged to his mother, dipped his headlights as the pair come across Danielle and her friends making their way along Rushworth Close.Pulling alongside the teenagers, Kelly slowed down long enough for the gunman to open fire with a handgun, hitting Danielle in the stomach.Realising she had been hit, the terrified youngsters dragged Danielle into a nearby alleyway as the gunmen sped off.Moments later, witnesses saw Andrews make a victory salute out of the car window, forming a "W" sign with his gloved hand, showing his allegiance to the Waterfront gang.Ms Platt rushed to her daughter's side within minutes of the fatal shot being fired.In an emotional statement, she recounted Danielle's last moments, revealing that her final words had been: "I'm not going to make it... I'm dying".Despite her mother's best efforts to keep her conscious, Danielle died on the operating table at the Queen's medical centre in Nottingham.Speaking outside the court after the verdict, Ms Platt said the last year had been "absolute hell". She said family members were pleased with the verdict, and wanted to get on with their lives.Detective Superintendent Kevin Flint, who lead the investigation, said the hunt for the other men believed to have been in the Citroen with Andrews and Kelly at the time of the shooting was continuing, adding that he was pleased with the sentences.He said the case had been "difficult", with many people having been afraid to contact police, but that the verdicts had shown what could be done if the "police and public at large work together".Kelly and Andrews fled Nottingham, hoping to cover up their role in her death.Kelly was arrested on October 11 in London after being pulled over by officers from the Metropolitan police for a driving offence.Andrews, a drug dealer, took a Â£350 taxi ride with his girlfriend, Natalie Gee, to his mother's home in Aberdeen. He was arrested and charged with murder on October 21.Kelly's car was seized by police from his mother's home in The Meadows immediately after being identified by Danielle's friends.Forensic examination found gunshot residue inside the vehicle, matching the bullets fired at the murder scene.Two of Andrews' mobile phones were also found in the glove compartment, and cell site analysis and mobile phone records put the two men at the scene of the shooting at the relevant time.However, despite the overwhelming evidence against them, both men denied they had been involved in the drive-by shooting.Andrews claimed he was in the Bomb nightclub in Nottingham city centre until 3am and had not been anywhere near St Ann's.He said the first he knew about the teenager's death was when he heard about it on the news the following day.He told the jury he had fled to Scotland with Ms Gee because he knew his name had been implicated in the murder and wanted to wait "until the heat was off".Andrews also denied he was involved with the Waterfront gang, but was unable to explain why he had the initials "WFG" tattooed on his right upper arm and "NG2", the postcode of The Meadows, etched on his neck.Kelly chose not to give evidence during the trial, instead relying on his lawyer, Timothy Spencer QC, to deny on his behalf that he had any criminal involvement in the schoolgirl's death.The lawyer argued that if the jury were sure it was Kelly's car that had been used, they could not be sure he had known what his accomplice was plotting.The evidence, Mr Spencer argued, added up to a charge of manslaughter rather than murder, but the jury rejected his claim and returned a guilty verdict by a majority of 10-2.
