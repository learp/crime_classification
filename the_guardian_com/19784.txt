The first statement given by Ian Huntley to police was today read out at his Old Bailey trial.In it, Mr Huntley described the last time he had seen schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. The statement read: "On Sunday [August] 4, I was standing out front of my house, brushing my dog. I saw two girls approach at about 6pm from the area of the college. "One asked me about my partner, Maxine Carr. Maxine worked at St Andrew's, but had had to reapply for her job and had not been given the job. "I did not know either of the girls. They obviously knew Maxine and obviously wanted to speak to her. They obviously knew where she lived. "One asked how Miss Carr was. I told her she was not very happy, as she had not been given the job. They said they were very sorry, and walked off in the direction of College Road. "I did not see them again. Both were wearing Manchester United tops with Beckham at the back." He described the girls as aged between nine and 10 years old, one with blonde hair and one with brown, both 4ft 9in tall and of slim build. Mr Huntley continued to tell police that, at around 11pm, he was walking his dog near the sports center. He went past three men who asked him whether he had seen two children."I said I had not. They did not give me any details, so I assumed I could not help," the statement said. "I knew the police were looking for two girls, but did not associate it with the two I had seen earlier. "This happened later when I spoke to other people. It was only when I heard the two girls were wearing Manchester United shirts that I connected the fact that I may have seen the girls earlier. "When I had an opportunity, I told police I may have seen the two girls earlier. I did not see the two girls before or since."Â· Ian Huntley denies murder, but has pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. The trial continues.
