Police have begun digging for bodies in the garden of a house alleged to be at the centre of a paedophile ring, neighbours said yesterday.The council house on the New Addington estate near Croydon, south London, is being searched by police after its occupiers received a letter alleging bodies were buried in the garden more than 30 years ago.The convicted paedophile Leslie Ford-Thrussell, 72, used to live there, but was not resident at the time of the alleged crimes. He is serving a 12-year prison sentence. The tip-off is believed to have come from the son of a former resident, according to the Sun.
