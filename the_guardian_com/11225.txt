A second person has been arrested in connection with police inquiries into an Olympic Stadium security guard who was caught with small quantities of explosives, it has emerged.A 43-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possessing an explosive substance at his home in Wales on Wednesday, Scotland Yard confirmed.The man was arrested a day after a 40-year-old female dog handler was arrested near the Olympic site after being found in possession of an explosive substance and a class A drug.Both are believed to be employees of Olympic security firm G4S, but police emphasised that the arrests were not being treated as terror-related. In a statement released on Wednesday night, the Metropolitan police said the incident "did not represent a threat to the safety and security of the Olympic site".The woman, arrested in a nearby car park on the day organisers were inside the stadium with International Olympic Committee (IOC) inspectors to celebrate its completion, has been bailed until mid-April.Another car was subsequently stopped and searched by police on the M11, and further searches carried out at addresses in London and Kent, but no substances were found.The man arrested in Wales on Wednesday was being questioned at an east London police station.G4S has been guarding the Olympic Park during its construction phase since 2008. Earlier this month it was selected to provide 10,000 security guards during the Games themselves.The arrests are also embarrassing for the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games in the week that IOC inspectors are in the capital to check on progress. Next week, the entire Olympic family descends on the city for the SportAccord conference.An Olympic Delivery Authority spokesman said: "There are robust measures to ensure the safety and security of the Olympic Park. We are working with the police in their investigation. At no point has the safety and security of the Olympic Park been put at risk."G4S said in a statement: "Our canine services team is licensed to hold small samples of explosives for training purposes and have to undertake rigorous training and follow strict operational processes.It added: "Our ODA canine services teams are highly effective because the dogs are able to train regularly using 'live' aids. All dog handlers are fully vetted and operate to the highest industry standards. G4S take breaches of operational processes very seriously and are assisting the police with their inquiries."
