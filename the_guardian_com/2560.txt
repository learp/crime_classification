The 'untouchables' used to be the nickname given to police squads tackling organised crime in America. Now, the term applies to the criminals themselves.According to security sources, between 150 and 200 crime bosses are operating in the UK. Their numbers are growing and the police are finding it impossible to get anywhere near them.These super-criminals are too far up the chain of command, too shielded by lieutenants and foot soldiers.It has emerged today that the country's most senior officers, including Sir David Phillips, the chief constable of Kent, have urged the Home Office to consider giving them sweeping new powers, similar to the anti-racketeering laws passed in America 30 years ago which were credited with smashing mafia families in New York, Boston and Chicago.But though the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organisations Act (Rico) gave federal agents giddying authority - allowing investigators to concentrate on the conspiracy behind the crime, rather than the crime itself - there are two good reasons to think similar laws would not work here.First, the UK does not have the equivalent of the tightly knit Italian/American mafia families which, over generations, had burrowed their way into unions controlling industries like rubbish collection and construction.Rico laws allowed investigators to seize control of public bodies suspected of being infected with mafia influence, and replace the management.Such powers wouldn't be much use in the UK. We don't have the levels of organised, systematic corruption in similar spheres.Secondly, Rico gave the FBI the right to use evidence gathered by phone tapping in court.This went to the heart of being able to prove conspiracy between the men who were issuing the orders, and the underlings who followed them.In this country, such material is inadmissible as evidence. The police use wire-tapping to gather "intelligence" on suspects, but that's all.Recently, the Home Office, after consultation with the police, decided to keep the status quo. Detectives told ministers they didn't want the techniques they use for gathering such material being described in court, giving criminals another potential advantage.For the laws to work, police officers would have to change their mind. Without phone-tapping evidence, Rico is a tiger without any teeth.Related articles20.04.2001: New laws to trap top crime bossesSpecial reportHome OfficeFBI
