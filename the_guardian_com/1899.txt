Michael Barrymore will not be charged with any offences connected to the death of Stuart Lubbock, crown prosecution officials said today.Mr Lubbock's body was found in the swimming pool at the entertainer's then home in Roydon, Essex, six years ago.In a statement, Essex crown prosecution service said it had advised police that no one should be charged over the 31-year-old's death.Mr Barrymore and two other men - understood to be Justin Merritt, 32, of Harlow, and Jonathan Kenny, 37, of Blackpool, Lancashire - were arrested earlier this year and questioned about the alleged serious sexual abuse and murder of Mr Lubbock, a Harlow butcher.The entertainer's lawyer, Henri Brandman, told journalists outside Harlow police station that his client had always maintained his innocence."Michael has not been charged with any offence," he said. "He has always protested his innocence in respect to the circumstances of the tragic death of Stuart Lubbock."Chris McCann, a casework lawyer with Essex CPS, said he had assessed historical and new information handed to him in July following a new investigation by police."There is still no answer in either the scientific or medical evidence how or by whose hand Mr Lubbock died," he said."If we are ever to consider a prosecution, we must be able to say that Mr Lubbock died as result of the actions of a named person or persons, as shown in the medical explanation for his death. "I have also considered the new evidence which has been presented, whether it alone could lead to any charges, and the likely response to it by the defence. "I am not satisfied that the prosecution can overcome the objections that are likely to be raised, and so I have decided that there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction against the three individuals."Mr Lubbock's body was found in March 2001. He had been one of a number of guests at a party at Mr Barrymore's house.Post-mortem tests showed he had suffered severe internal injuries which suggested sexual assault. Ecstasy, cocaine and alcohol were found in his bloodstream.A lengthy investigation was carried out, but no one was charged with any offence in relation to his death. Mr Barrymore accepted a police caution for drug offences.Essex police reopened the investigation into Mr Lubbock's death last December after reviewing their first inquiry. Mr Barrymore was arrested along with Mr Merritt and Mr Kenny in June. They were later released without charge on police bail.
