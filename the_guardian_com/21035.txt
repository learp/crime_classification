Detectives are questioning two 22-year-old men and three female teenagers aged between 15 and 19 who were arrested after a stolen Mercedes collided with a Ford Fiesta at Apperley Bridge, West Yorkshire, killing two 48-year-old women. The Independent Police Complaints Authority confirmed that the Mercedes had been pursued by a police patrol for just over a minute but said that after an independent assessment it was content to leave the investigation with West Yorkshire police. The dead women have been named as Janet Herd and Linda Tansley from Eccleshill, Bradford.
