A 15-year-old girl allegedly murdered for falling in love with an older man told a friend she thought she was pregnant and was going to run away, a court heard. Tulay Goren whispered the remark to Nadia Mahmood in a school assembly before she went missing, jurors were told. She disappeared in 1999 and has never been found. Tulay is alleged to have been murdered by her father, Mehmet, and her uncles Cuma and Ali because she fell in love with a 30-year-old man. Mahmood said: "I wasn't sure she was serious. It is the sort of thing teenagers sometimes say." The trial continues.
