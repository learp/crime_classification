The prime minister set the weather vane earlier today by insisting that the non-inflationary - and staged - public sector pay awards are due to continue under his watch.While Mr Brown insists this policy is crucial to a stable economy, public sector unions have no intention of blinking first when it comes to low pay for their members.Public sector unions makes up three-fifths of the country's 6.8 million union membership yet the threat of waves of national strikes, last seen in the winter of 1978-1979 does not seem to deter Mr Brown from his chosen path.The prisoner officers' wildcat strike yesterday was just the latest evidence of the unhappiness caused this year by Mr Brown, first in his capacity as chancellor, to impose a pay freeze, or real-term cut, on nearly the entire public sector, except the military. Now prime minister, a bullish Mr Brown has no plans for a change of tack.Tellingly, the Prison Officers' Association received a strong message of support from the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents civil servants.The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, whose union has already staged two national strikes this year over job cuts, pay and outsourcing of services, said: "Below-inflation pay awards leading to pay cuts in real terms are completely unacceptable, and is a problem that PCS members delivering vital public services also face."Mr Serwotka means it. Thousands of civil servants in the Department of Work and Pensions could end up taking strike action over a proposed three-year pay deal, which the union says would see 40% of the workforce receive 2%, 0% and 1% pay rises respectively over the next three years.The leadership is balloting members on the pay offer, with a strong message to turn it down, signalling more headaches for Mr Brown.And a wildcat strike this week was not the only unlikely sight provoked by this year's public sector pay awards.Even the Royal College of Nursing, traditionally averse to taking industrial action, held its first indicative ballot earlier this summer to do just that.Like prison officers, nurses were offered 2.5% staggered over six months - a real terms increase of just 1.9%. Over nine out of 10 RCN members who responded backed industrial action.Unison, one of the largest public sector unions, which also represents nurses, also held an indicative ballot which found resounding support for strike action.The collective protests prompted the new health secretary, Alan Johnson, to backtrack a few paces and offer a revised the pay offer, still staged but offering bigger percentage increases to the lowest paid in the workforce.Healthcare unions have already been warned to expect more of the same next year. But they have given short-shrift to notice from the NHS Employers that they should expect pay rises which are "non-inflationary and consistent with the government's current public sector pay policy".Another round of low pay in local government could also cause trouble ahead for the Labour government.After protracted negotiations local government unions are expected to accept a revised pay offer of 2.45% (rising to 3.4% for the lowest paid such as cleaners and kitchen assistants), from a starting position of 2%.But the government should not accept this as a signal of unbowing acceptance to relatively low pay rises in the future.There are worse things than bringing the country to a halt for a few successive days, as a Unison spokeswoman points out."If you get into a situation where pay is running at a much higher level in the private sector, it would start building up more resentment," she says."A widening pay gap could see people vote with their fee and decide to leave. Then you lose all that experience from the profession."But Mr Brown shows no sign of bending just yet. The fact that some of the largest public sector unions are also Labour party funders makes any attempt to bring unions to heel over pay a bigger political prize for a new Labour leader keen to appeal to the wider electorate and silence the Tories' criticisms of the strength of union-Labour ties.But misjudging the collective wrath of public sector unions could just as easily break Mr Brown as help to build him up in the eye of voters.
