A police officer was arrested today by detectives investigating a body-building drug supply racket.The 26-year-old Metropolitan police constable was held after a series of early morning raids in Swansea, south Wales.He was arrested on suspicion of supplying controlled class C drugs following an investigation by anti-corruption officers.Four other men were detained as officers searched five properties in the area, including homes, commercial addresses and a shop.A Metropolitan police spokesman said the men are believed to be linked to a network supplying steroids to hundreds of people across South Wales.He said: "Officers are expected to meet the highest standards of honesty and integrity. The Met is determined that those who fail to meet these standards will be dealt with swiftly and robustly."The operation was carried out by members of Scotland Yard's directorate of professional standards with officers from South Wales police's anti-corruption team.Officers suspect the men were supplying anabolic steroids in pill and injectable forms to bodybuilders and weight trainers.Some sportsmen claim steroids help them train harder, build muscle mass and recover from exercise more quickly.Steroids are categorised as class C drugs and can only be sold by pharmacists with a doctor's prescription.It is legal to possess or import steroids for personal use but possession with intent to supply is illegal and could lead to 14 years in prison.
