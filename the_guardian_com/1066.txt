Portuguese forensic experts will today meet their British counterparts to discuss DNA samples taken in the Madeleine McCann inquiry.Four members of the team investigating Madeleine's disappearance will join scientists from the UK's Forensic Science Service (FSS), based in Birmingham.It is understood that DNA samples taken from a car hired by the toddler's parents, Gerry and Kate, both 39, will be discussed.The samples were gathered as part of an investigation into the couple, who have been named official suspects in the disappearance of their daughter."We understand there is no intention for the McCanns to be interviewed, or indeed anyone else," the couple's spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, said."Such a meeting should not be seen as surprising. We do not see it as a significant development."The Portuguese experts are led by Francisco Corte-Real, the vice-president of the National Pathology Institute.His team includes two police forensic science officers and a senior detective. They will return to Portugal tomorrow.Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, vanished from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3, while her parents dined nearby.Portuguese detectives have since said that they found blood and hair at the scene of the four-year-old's dissapearance at the Ocean Club resort.They said they had recovered an "unusually large amount of hair" and some traces of body fluids from the back of the Renault Scenic hired three weeks after she went missing.Today, a spokeswoman for the FSS described the meeting, which will take place in Leicestershire, as "routine". A spokeswoman for Leicestershire police said: "Throughout the investigation there has been really good dialogue between the teams in Portugal and the UK, but they felt it was a good time to sit down and talk face to face."They are not going to be interviewing anyone else. It is a routine meeting and then they will be going home."The forensic team's arrival came as the lawyer for Robert Murat, the first suspect in the case, launched a withering attack on the McCanns.Francisco Pagarete, who has acted for Murat since he was made an official suspect on May 14, branded the couple "hypocrites" and said they should be "cursed" for leaving their children alone."The McCanns deserve to be cursed... for leaving their children unprotected," he told the Portuguese daily newspaper 24 Horas.
