A teenager who murdered his pregnant girlfriend has been jailed for life. Aston Robinson, 18, will serve a minimum of 14 years in prison for strangling Kayleigh-Anne Palmer, 16, at his parents’ home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, on 2 April.Robinson left his girlfriend – who was 24 weeks pregnant and in her school uniform – frothing at the mouth and blue in the face, then locked the house and headed to a nearby bookmakers to check on a £20 bet.Kayleigh-Anne, known as Kay to friends, died in hospital three days later after doctors induced the birth of her daughter, who also did not survive.Robinson later admitted he had punched his girlfriend and wrapped a tartan scarf around her neck in a bid to make her “be quiet” after she asked: “How would you like it if I met boys?”While awaiting trial in prison, Robinson wrote two letters to Kay’s distraught mother, Helen Bage, describing himself as “single forever me” after the death, and used the phrase “lol” – short for laugh out loud.In one letter he described how the pair had travelled to Birmingham together but did not have ID required to book a hotel room, so “took the train home and snuck into my house lol x”.Robinson, of Humber Road, Cheltenham, was on Friday convicted of Kay’s murder following a two-week trial at Bristol crown court. A jury found him not guilty of child destruction.Judge Neil Ford QC, the recorder of Bristol, sentenced Robinson to life and said he would spend a minimum of 14 years behind bars.“Mr Robinson became Kayleigh’s boyfriend in the summer of 2013 when he was 17 and she was 15,” the judge said.“She had the greatest affection for him and I am in no doubt that he valued the relationship with her, but he became irrationally concerned that Kayleigh would leave him for another boy or that another boy would lure her away from him.“He didn’t have the emotional maturity to cope with that situation. He became increasingly jealous, possessive and controlling. He simply couldn’t bring himself to trust in Kayleigh.”The jury was told Robinson used both hands to pull the scarf tight around Kay’s neck for at least 15 to 30 seconds at around midday.His sister Michaela arrived at their parents’ home a short time later and Robinson double-bolted the front door to prevent her from gaining entry before fleeing on a borrowed BMX bike.CCTV images showed Robinson checking a £20 bet, believed to have been made on a horse, at the same time as paramedics battled to save Kay and her unborn child.Kay was later taken to hospital but never regained consciousness and the heartbeat of her baby, named Lily-Rose, stopped the following day, on 3 April.Doctors induced labour and Kay, who had been in a relationship with Robinson for 14 months, was pronounced dead on 5 April.In the first letter written from his prison cell to Kay’s mother, Robinson said: “I am so sorry for your loss, my loss as well, lost a daughter as well. I’ve lost everything that mattered to me.”He added in a second letter: “I was hoping that after I waked up and after my jail sentence I would go back into Kay’s arms but God took her away in peace, away from my accusations and controlling behaviour.“All that because I loved and adored her.”The jury heard Robinson had been abusive to Kay throughout their relationship and punched her in the stomach when she informed him she had missed a period.“He said, ‘This will stop you having a baby,’” Christopher Quinlan QC, prosecuting, said.Kay was discovered face down in the lounge of Robinson’s parents’ home, with the scarf around her neck, at 11.47am.She was pronounced dead at 10.31 on 5 April, with a postmortem examination establishing the cause of death as brain injuries following her strangulation.A pathologist found 20 separate injuries to her body, from bruising to her cheek and arms and legs, to ligature marks from one side of her neck to the other.
