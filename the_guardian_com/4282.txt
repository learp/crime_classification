An amateur dancer who swindled taxpayers out of nearly £20,000 in disability benefits was spared jail today, after a judge heard how his passion for jazz and swing led to regular performances at care homes.Terence Read, 61, had also been chastened and humiliated by intensive publicity of his case in his part of Manchester, the city's crown court heard, making it impossible for him to "hold his head high" locally.Judge Martin Rudland was told that Read was one of millions of people whose life had been transformed by the hip joint operation, invented in Lancashire by the Bury surgeon Sir John Charnley.Jonathan Rogers, prosecuting, said that Read claimed disability benefit legally after developing arthritis aged only 25, but failed to tell the Benefits Agency when his condition dramatically changed.From being "virtually housebound," he became an accomplished dancer, enjoying public contests for three years until he was caught in 2008. The court heard that following an anonymous tip-off to the Department of Work and Pensions, investigators covertly filmed him gliding across a dance floor and repeatedly spinning his partner around.Rogers said that Read, who admitted failing to notify the department of his changed circumstances, had also been filmed lifting heavy audio speakers in and out of a van. He initially denied dishonestly claiming £19,915 but changed his plea last month on the first day of his trial.Sentencing him to a year's community order and 120 hours of unpaid work, the judge told Read: "Your case drifted into dishonesty but it is not in the public interest that you should be deprived of your liberty. You are doing good work by taking the music and dancing into care homes, that brings some pleasure and therapy into others' lives as a result."You learned to live frugally and contentedly, going out rarely, until the dancing came into your life, which seemed to transform your joie de vivre. I suspect over time the claim being made went to the back of your mind and it was something you took for granted."The court heard that Read had paid back £3,000 of the money and agreed a plan to settle the balance. His solicitor David James said that the dance sessions sometimes meant that he "went through the pain barrier" afterwards and suffered discomfort for some days."He is a proud man who has been humbled by his fallibility," he said. "The interest in this case has been quite a significant punishment. It is difficult for him to walk out and hold his head high now."
