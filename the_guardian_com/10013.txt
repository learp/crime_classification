A Labour peer facing allegations that he blamed a Jewish conspiracy for his dangerous driving jail term has resigned from the party.Lord Ahmed had been suspended from the party after he was reported to have been caught on camera blaming his prison sentence – for sending text messages shortly before his car was involved in a fatal crash – on pressure placed on the courts by "Jewish friends who own newspapers and TV channels".In a resignation letter, the peer said he was concerned that the party was content to proceed with a disciplinary hearing on Wednesday "on the basis of incredible and untested evidence"."That indeed leads me to believe the decision might have already been made," said the politician.He was suspended by Labour in March after the Times obtained video of an Urdu-language broadcast in Pakistan in which he discussed the decision to sentence him at Sheffield crown court, rather than a magistrates' court with lesser sentencing powers.He allegedly said: "My case became more critical because I went to Gaza to support Palestinians. My Jewish friends who own newspapers and TV channels opposed this."In the resignation letter, obtained by City AM, Ahmed said he did not recall when the interview was held or where it was carried out and rejected "the core story" that emerged.He argued that the film interview should have been subjected to forensic testing, adding: "Moreover, there is extrinsic evidence which suggests the translation could not truly be representative of what I have ever said and believe. My past record sufficiently bears this out."The peer also claimed: "It is somewhat sinister that because of my pursuit of the inquiry of a murder of a Pakistani politician in the streets of London, there are elements in Pakistan who bears grudge against me and might it be the brainchild of such elements to tamper with the footage of the alleged interview."Ahmed, 56, joined the Labour party in his teens and was made a life peer in 1998. He was jailed for 12 weeks in 2009 for dangerous driving after sending and receiving text messages minutes before his car crashed into a stationary vehicle on the M1 near Sheffield on Christmas Day 2007.He was suspended from the Labour party for three months last year over reports that he offered a $10m (£6.5m) "bounty" for the capture of the US president, Barack Obama, and his White House predecessor, George W Bush.The peer denied having made those comments, published in a Pakistani newspaper, and was reinstated after an investigation by Lord Bassam, Labour's chief whip in the House of Lords.
