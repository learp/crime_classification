A BBC Radio 4 presenter accused of raping a man he met at a New Year party said today that he would never have harmed him.Nigel Wrench, a presenter on the PM programme, told an Old Bailey jury that he believed the alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was enjoying himself and agreed to perform a sex act on him.Earlier, the Old Bailey jury was ordered to return not guilty verdicts on two other charges of sexual assault and of administering temazepam with the intention of "stupefying or overpowering" the man in order to have sex with him. Judge Michael Shorrock said there was insufficient evidence for a conviction. Wrench, of north London, denies raping the man, on January 1 last year.The presenter said he snorted cocaine with the younger man before inviting him back to his flat. He told jurors how, after getting there, they drank champagne before starting to kiss. "I said to him 'Let's go to bed'. He smiled and said yes," Wrench said. He added that he never did anything with the alleged victim that he had not agreed to and would have stopped if he had been asked. "The last thing - that is the irony of the situation, isn't it? - I would have done is to harm him," Wrench said.He told the court he had never made a secret about being gay and had presented a lesbian and gay radio programme, Out This Week, on BBC Radio Five Live. He said he was also open about the fact that he was HIV positive and had spoken on the radio and written articles about it.Wrench, 47, added that he told his alleged victim about his HIV status on the night they met. The court has been told the alleged victim also has HIV.The trial continues.· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
