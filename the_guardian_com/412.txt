One of the burglars shot by the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin during a break-in at his house has been granted legal aid to sue the farmer for the injuries he sustained.Brendon Fearon, 32, of Newark, Notts, was initially turned down for aid by the legal services commission, but suc ceeded after appealing to an area committee of independent solicitors and barristers. A spokesman for the commission said: "The area committee allowed the appeal and their decision to allow legal aid was binding on us." Legal aid will cover the costs of processing the case up to trial. A further application will have to be made for legal aid during the hearing if the case gets that far. The spokesman said: "We are reviewing the case every three months to ensure that it still meets the eligibility criteria. If at any time it becomes apparent that the criteria are no longer being met funding will cease." Martin, who shot dead Fearon's accomplice, 16-year-old Fred Barras, is serving a five year sentence after his murder conviction was reduced to manslaughter by the court of appeal. Malcolm Starr, a friend of Martin, said: "I think it's totally dreadful and I think it's time Tony Blair and the home secretary came out and gave a statement with their views." Martin shot Fearon in the legs at Bleak House Farm, Emneth Hungate, Norfolk, in August 1999. Fearon, who has a string of convictions for theft, drugs and burglary, is thought to be hoping to win up to Â£50,000.
