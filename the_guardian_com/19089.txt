Senior police officers are discussing whether to introduce quotas for black and Asian recruits in a last-ditch attempt to make forces more representative, it was revealed today.The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) is to consider whether it should press for a change in the law to allow "affirmative action" to recruit minorities.However, the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) dismissed the idea as a "smokescreen" and said more attention should be paid to why more people of ethnic minorities are not applying to become officers.Home Office figures last month revealed that the proportion of ethnic minority police in England and Wales reached 3.7% in 2005/06 - below a 4% target forces were supposed to reach two years earlier.Ministers have set a final 7% target for 2009. An Acpo spokeswoman said: "At a conservative estimate, it would take 23 years to reach that target with current legislation. Chief constables are going to start a debate on whether we need to change the law to enable us to reach those employment targets."In all, there were 5,236 black and Asian officers in the 43 police forces in England and Wales at the end of March last year, excluding the National Crime Squad and the National Criminal Intelligence Service, which have since been disbanded.The Acpo spokeswoman said a report being presented to the association's council meeting this morning by the Cheshire chief constable, Peter Fahy, would float the idea of introducing quotas and allowing forces to use affirmative action to meet them.It would also seek to boost the number of women in the police, who are currently "grossly under-represented", the Acpo spokeswoman said.Affirmative action describes the process of prioritising minorities once they have passed initial selection procedures. It differs from "positive discrimination" which means hiring minorities regardless of whether they are qualified for a job.Acpo will not make a decision today on whether to lobby for a change in the law. But chief constables are thought to be keen to begin a wider debate on the move, in consultation with bodies such as the CRE.A spokeswoman for the CRE said it would not support the move. "The CRE doesn't support positive discrimination and affirmative action," she said. "These forms of 'reverse discrimination' could actually increase community tensions, rather than ease them."In many areas forces are struggling to recruit people from diverse backgrounds because of people's negative perceptions and experiences. This is the real problem that needs to be addressed."She added: "The police ought to stop hiding behind the smokescreen of 'affirmative action' and start looking at the real reasons why ethnic minorities are not applying to become police officers."
