Police have made more than 100 arrests in and around Olympic venues across London over the last fortnight, according to figures released by Scotland Yard on Sunday.One teenager was arrested under section 58 of the 2000 Terrorism Act, which is used when police suspect that someone is collecting or is in possession of "information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism".But the 17-year-old, who was picked up at Stratford railway station near the Olympic Park on Saturday 28 July, was released after questioning and "de-arrested", Scotland Yard said.In total, 114 people were taken into custody between 21 July and 3 August – the latest figures available.But there have been only six arrests inside the venues themselves, a very small number considering hundreds of thousands of people have been to see events over the last fortnight, and how much British spectators have had to celebrate since the Games began.In fact, a breakdown from the Metropolitan police shows only three people have been seized for being drunk and disorderly since the Olympic Torch came to London. Two were caught for allegedly impersonating a police officer, and one man was also arrested for swimming in the River Thames.More than half the total number of arrests – 58 – were suspected ticket touts, who could face fines up to £20,000 if they are charged and convicted.The Met's figures show seven have been arrested for assault; two for begging; 10 for drugs-related offences; one for criminal damage; two for assaulting a police officer; seven for fraud; one for going equipped; one for immigration offences; two for impersonating a police officer; one for indecent assault; and 11 for public order offences, including some that were racially aggravated.Six people have been arrested for theft, four for robbery and one for being in possession of a firearm."These arrests are by officers working across London who are part of the policing operation for the Olympic Games," a spokesman said."This includes officers who are working in the footprint of the policing plan; the 'Park', 'River' and 'Central' zones that include the Olympic venues. It also includes arrests made by officers who are part of the operation but have been deployed on boroughs to support day to day policing."The figures do not include the cyclists who were arrested at the time of the Isles of Wonder opening ceremony. Police arrested 182 people who were taking part in Critical Mass, a monthly bike ride through central London.The police faced criticism for the manner in which the procession was halted, but the Met said the cyclists had ignored a police order prohibiting the protesters from travelling into the Olympic Park. Three cyclists have since been charged.
