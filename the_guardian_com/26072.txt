Luke Carey, 24, who admitted giving a fatal dose of methylamphetamine to Poppy Rodgers, 16, at a house in York, had boasted to her friends that the drug batch was so strong that it had led to the death of a man a year earlier, York crown court heard.Carey admitted seven counts, which included another count of supplying the drug, four of offering to supply the drug and one of possession with an intent to supply. He was jailed for six years and five months.Poppy, an unemployed waitress, had been socialising with friends at a house in the Tang Hall area of York on the night she died. Her friend Jamie Kelly was taken to hospital but survived, the court heard.Carey brought a bag of methylamphetamine, which he said he had been sold at a cut price after it was linked to another death, said Nicholas Worsley for the prosecution.Poppy collapsed and was taken to hospital but died as a result of taking the substance, Worsley added.Police searched Carey's home and found a bag of the substance with an estimated street value of £1,400, the court heard."Luke Carey had taken it himself but had far less in his blood when he was arrested," Worsley said."He was arrested and he was interviewed. He completely denied the offences. He said Poppy was easily led. He said everyone in the house had got their stories together to try to pin the blame on him."He said he was being set up by two of the lads in the house."Carey, who has no prior convictions, was going to plead not guilty to the charge but changed his plea to guilty on the day he was due to stand trial, added Worsley.In a statement read out to the court, Poppy's father said Poppy loved horseriding and dancing and her death had left a huge void."She wasn't just my daughter but my best friend," he said."She charmed everyone who met her. I was very, very proud of her. She loved children and I promised her that one day she would fall in love and have her own family."I cry for her every day."Carey wept and shook his head as he listened to the statement.Mitigating for Carey, Richard Reed said he had not been selling the drug, but supplied it because he enjoyed getting high with other people."He will have to live for the rest of his life with the consequences of his actions," he said. "That's small, he admits, in comparison to the devastation he's caused to Poppy's family."
