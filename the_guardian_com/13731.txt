Seven people have alleged that they were sexually and physically abused at a residential school linked to the late Sir Cyril Smith.The allegations from the 1970s onwards relate to Knowl View School in Rochdale, where the Liberal Democrat MP served as chairman of governors.In November 2012, Greater Manchester police said Smith abused young boys in the 1960s in his role as secretary of the Rochdale Hostel for Boys Association. He had been accused of abusing eight youngsters at Cambridge Hostel in the town by spanking and touching them.Police then began looking at fresh claims of abuse at Knowl View, a council-run school for vulnerable boys which closed in the mid-1990s.Police said the complaints from the seven alleged victims relate to "at least 11 potential suspects".It is understood the fresh Knowl View allegations are not against Smith.Detective Inspector Caroline Ward said: "Following the publicity surrounding Smith last year, seven people came forward to report physical and sexual abuse which occurred at Knowl View from the 1970s onwards."Those allegations relate to physical and sexual abuse that took place between pupils and adults at the school and these complaints are currently being investigated by officers from Greater Manchester police's public protection division."These complaints relate to at least 11 potential suspects, but as not all victims knew the full names of their abusers we cannot as yet confirm the exact number of different suspects. Also, we are working to establish if any of the potential suspects are now deceased."The allegations we have received are building up a picture of the regime that was in place at Knowl View at that time. We have also been working very closely with Rochdale council and we are now examining boxes of files held about Knowl View as part of the investigation."I would encourage anyone who was a victim of either sexual or physical abuse to come forward and speak to police as the more evidence we have the better the chances of bringing abusers to justice."We totally understand that for many people they will not want to relive the abuse they suffered, but for those who do want to come forward I want to give you complete confidence that your complaints will be treated seriously and thoroughly investigated."In 2000, police carried out a "comprehensive investigation" into abuse claims at the school which led to the conviction of one man for indecent assault and gross indecency. It was ruled that there was insufficient evidence to charge any other individuals and no specific allegations were made at the time against Smith.An independent review into the way Knowl View was run is due to report back to Rochdale council next month.Andrew Warnock QC is to investigate all council decision making on the school.Three separate files regarding Smith's actions at Cambridge House were passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the CPS, although on each occasion no prosecution was pursued.Smith, who died in 2010, served as an MP for 20 years before retiring.
