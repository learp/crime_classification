The judgment in the latest round of the women's legal action against the poilice is due to be made public tomorrow morning. It is due to be handed down at 10.30 am in court 71 in London's high court.The long-running legal action is being taken by ten women on the grounds that they were duped into forming long-term relationships with undercover police officers. They are being represented by Harriet Wistrich of Birnberg Peirce and Jules Carey of Tuckers solicitors.The background on the latest phase of the lawsuit can be found here and here. Much legal argument revolves around the police's contention that they have the legal power to authorise their spies to start sexual relationships with people they were sent to spy on.Yet, as Green politician Jenny Jones argues here, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, has also been insisting that sexual relationships between the undercover spies and their targets is forbidden. She calls this a "Janus-faced approach."Elsewhere, in recent postings, Eirlys Rhiannon, writes here about the aridity of the arcane legal argument, while Jane Fae examines the case as a whole here.
