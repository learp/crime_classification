A new nationwide police force which begins operations on Monday will be able to prevent international drug traffickers settling in the UK, the home secretary, Charles Clarke, predicted yesterday.He expressed his confidence in the Serious Organised Crime Agency - dubbed Britain's FBI - after the Guardian disclosed that leading members of a notorious crime gang had settled in the home counties after striking a deal with Customs & Excise.Members of the Baybasin gang, a Turkish Kurdish cartel which police believe controlled up to 90% of heroin imports into the UK, settled in Edgware, Middlesex, in the mid-1990s after their leader told Customs investigators what he knew about the involvement of senior Turkish politicians in the drug trade.A number of MPs suggested yesterday that the Home Office should launch an inquiry into the affair. But Mr Clarke said: "Organised crime is a massive and growing business in the UK. It reaches into every neighbourhood, damages our communities, and nets £20bn to £40bn each year for those responsible."The Serious Organised Crime Agency [Soca] is a powerful new law enforcement organisation which will work across operational boundaries and will focus its resources on where the harms are the greatest. Drug trafficking will be its priority along with human trafficking, fraud and ID theft."The 4,000-strong Soca is also tasked with taking an interventionist approach to major crime syndicates which would, if successful, lead to the imprisonment of leading figures for offences not necessarily related to their main activity. Al Capone's imprisonment for tax evasion in 1930s Chicago is the best known example of this approach. A Soca official said: "We are dealing with highly sophisticated people here with technical knowledge that moves with the times. We have to move with them."
