A paedophile whose partner is accused of murdering their two children in a Spanish hotel has been jailed for 16 years.Martin Smith, 45, who used hypnotism and violence to groom and sexually abuse a young girl, was sentenced at Liverpool crown court.He was found guilty in December last year of 11 specimen charges of rape, attempted rape, indecency with a child and indecent assault from May 1995 to May 2004.Mr Justice Stephen Irwin said Smith "trapped and overwhelmed" his victim with repeated sexual assaults over a sustained period of time."You had so domineered her that she was crushed by you," he said. "Despite all the evidence, you continued to deny what took place."The judge added: "In my view, you rewrite the world to suit yourself."Irwin said Smith posed a high risk of serious harm to any girls who might find themselves under his influence.The trial heard that Smith, originally from North Shields, had regular access to the victim and abused her for almost a decade from when she was aged just seven.He would attempt to hypnotise, hit and bully his victim to ensure she complied, the jury was told.Smith's daughter Rebecca, five, and son Daniel, 11 months, were found dead in the Hotel Miramar in the resort of Lloret de Mar on the Costa Brava on 18 May last year. Their mother, Lianne Smith, 43, faces two counts of murder.Lianne and Martin Smith left the UK for Spain in December 2007 with Rebecca. Daniel was born in Spain.Martin Smith was extradited last May. The children were found dead while he was in custody in England awaiting trial.Kim Whittlestone, defending Smith, said on Friday: "Since his extradition to the UK, the events in Spain were out of his control. He has found that extremely distressing."She said Smith was a man of previous good character and was finding his time in prison "very difficult".
