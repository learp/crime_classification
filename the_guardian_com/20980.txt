A care worker was today jailed for seven years for a "cynical and cruel" plot to hire a hitman to kill her husband. Zoe Kenealy, 44, of Kenley, Surrey, was found guilty at the Old Bailey in April of soliciting murder.The court was told she took out a £4,500 home improvements policy to fund the plot, and hoped to collect a £33,000 insurance policy. "This was a cynical and cruel attempt to have your husband killed," the judge, Gregory Stone, said today. "You did it partly for the insurance money but more because you could no longer bear to live with him." He praised Kenealy's family, particularly her father, for the "courageous decision" to give her up to police after learning of her plans. Kenealy's husband, Timothy Kenealy, with whom she had two sons, said he would stand by his wife and forgave her. But Stone said he had to consider the public interest in jailing her. Simon Wild, prosecuting, said Kenealy had given a neighbour, 31-year-old Lee Waite, £3,000 to hire someone for the killing, but he pocketed the money. She was arrested in January 2007 after members of the family called the police. She had sent her brother several text messages asking for money to have her husband killed because, she said, she hated him. Kenealy started applying for £10,000 loans from November 2006, but two companies turned her down before she was successful. Nicholas Atkinson QC, defending, told the judge today: "This is a desperately sad woman. She found her husband difficult to cope with." Atkinson said Kenealy had been infatuated by Waite, although there had been no sexual relationship.
