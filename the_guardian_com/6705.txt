Detectives hunting the killer of Patricia Parsons, a masseuse who was found slumped in her car in a country lane 17 years ago, are on the verge of making an arrest, it emerged last night.The 42-year-old, who was believed to have provided "discreet sexual services" to a range of celebrities and VIPs, including a senior judge and a television presenter, was found near Epping Forest in Essex in June 1990. She had been shot three times in the head with a crossbow.Despite a wide-ranging investigation and rumours that Ms Parson's death was linked to a series of gangland murders, the case remained unsolved.A blue notebook which was thought to contain the names and telephone numbers of prominent celebrities - and which officers believed would have provided crucial evidence - has never been found.In 2003 the murder was taken up by the police's cold case review team, which failed to make a breakthrough using the latest DNA technology.However, senior detectives said last night that they had identified a suspect using "traditional inquiry methods" and were expecting to make an arrest soon.Detective Inspector Bob Mahoney, leading the investigation, said a team of six officers had interviewed around 50 people as part of the investigation. "We were given several significant lines of inquiry to follow by the cold case review team and we are continuing to unravel what really happened to Patricia Parsons," he said.The 42-year-old worked at a massage parlour in Camden, north London, and saw clients from what police describe as the higher echelons of society at her Â£500,000 home in Friern Barnet.She was last seen on June 23 1990 when she left the house at around 9pm to go to a party at her boyfriend's restaurant in Harlow, Essex. She never arrived and the next day her body was found in a country lane near Epping Forest. Detectives say she was battered and then shot three times in the head with a crossbow.According to witnesses, Ms Parsons left her home with a man who was driving her car. Police appealed for information from anyone who may have seen Ms Parsons's car after reports that it had been spotted outside a pub near where her body was found. Detectives also asked for information from guests at a nearby wedding reception.At the time the case was linked to a series of gangland murders in east London, including the killing of Maxine Arnold and Terry Gooderham, whose bodies were found nearby six months earlier.Following the review of the case in 2003 detectives said they were attempting to identify Ms Parsons's clients, including people in the "highest echelons of politics and the entertainment industry".Officers began taking DNA samples from her friends and family, but detectives say their efforts were hampered by the disappearance of Ms Parsons's blue diary.Last night DI Mahony said: "This is one of the most fascinating cases I have ever worked on. One theory was that the answer to who killed Patricia Parsons, and why, would be found in her diary. It was rumoured to have contained the details of a top judge, TV presenters, barristers and accountants. However, it could not be found."Police are expected to make an arrest sometime in the next two weeks."This was a horrific murder and we are determined to keep on until it is resolved," said DI Mahony.
