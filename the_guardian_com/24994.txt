The former partner of Shannon Matthews' mother was today found guilty of child pornography charges and sentenced to 20 weeks in jail.Craig Meehan, 22, was convicted of possessing indecent images of children on a computer found in the home Meehan shared with Karen Matthews, the mother of nine-year-old Shannon, after the schoolgirl went missing on February 18.Meehan was released today having already spent 166 days, or 23 weeks, in jail on remand. He was driven to an undisclosed location by a police escort.Officers searching for Shannon took the second-hand computer from her home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, during the large police search sparked by her disappearance. Three weeks later Shannon was found less than a mile from her house hidden in a drawer under a bed.Meehan was charged with child pornography offences in April. The former supermarket fishmonger denied he had ever searched for, or viewed, child pornography.During his trial, Meehan blamed other people for downloading the images while using his password-protected computer. But the court was told it was "extremely unlikely" that anyone else was responsible as all the images had been downloaded when Meehan was at home. The court heard how ages of the children found on the indecent images varied between four and 16.District judge Jonathan Bennett said it was clear that Meehan had lied repeatedly since his arrest. "I thus find that the defendant has some attraction to child pornography and was both the owner and principal user of this computer," he said, finding Meehan guilty of 11 counts of possessing child pornography.This month, Karen Matthews was charged with the kidnap and false imprisonment of her daughter. The 32-year-old denies the charges, as well as an earlier charge of perverting the course of justice.Michael Donovan, 40, who is Meehan's uncle and also from Dewsbury, pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping and false imprisonment.Both were remanded in custody until their trial on November 11.
