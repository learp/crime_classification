An armed robber who was jailed for 15 years for a £1.7m raid on an art gallery has been convicted of a second gunpoint robbery, committed while on parole.Craig Townend was jailed in 2000 for stealing paintings from York City Art Gallery armed with a sawn-off shotgun.In July last year, while he was on parole, Townend and another man burst into the Torquay home of stamp dealer Steven Bennett and stole a collection worth £400,000.Townend and his accomplice, who has not been identified, were armed with handguns. At first they claimed they were police officers but then put on Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein masks and forced the collector to his knees with a weapon pointed at the back of his head.Exeter crown court heard that Bennett and his sons, James and Timothy, were then bound and handcuffed and had hoods put over their heads before the robbers fled with the stamps.After the raid Townend styled himself "the Laird of Glen Cairn" and pretended he had an office in London's Regent Street to try to sell the stamps on. He was caught after he put some of them on an internet auction site.Townend, 39, from Rotherham, was found guilty yesterday of armed robbery, possessing a firearm with intent to commit robbery and three charges of falsely imprisoning Bennett and his two sons.The court heard that days after the robbery Bennett received a death threat and was told the stamps had been thrown into the sea from a pier.Bennett told the court the collection was not insured, but it was very difficult to sell as all the stamps were known through his catalogues.He said dealers were notified through the Philatelic Traders' Society's "red call" alert system and he also rang round those he knew, telling them what had happened.Townend was arrested after seven stamps appeared for sale on the auction website eBay and four were identified as coming from the Bennett collection.Nine years ago Townend was convicted for the raid on the York City Art Gallery. He and an accomplice wore balaclavas and forced staff to lie face-down on the floor, where they were bound with cable ties.Twenty pictures worth £1.7m were stolen, although they were all recovered. Townend was convicted of armed robbery and possessing a firearm with intent to commit a robbery.He will be sentenced for the stamp robbery at a later date.
