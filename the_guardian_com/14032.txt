A pensioner who killed his wife of 50 years as they sat on a park bench before stabbing himself claimed they had entered into a suicide pact because they could not bear to be separated, a court heard today.Peter Cooper, 72, admits he stabbed his wife Audrey, 70, twice but denies murder, insisting the incident was part of a botched plan devised by the couple because they could not face her being sectioned as her mental health deteriorated.Winchester crown court was told that after stabbing himself, Cooper, a former warrant officer in the army, held his wife's body in his arms as he waited to die.Nigel Pascoe QC, prosecuting, called it a "devastating and heartbreaking human tragedy". He described how Cooper, of Southampton, waited for two hours after he had stabbed his wife before he contacted the emergency services.In a 999 call read to the jury, Cooper said: "I've stabbed her. Yeah and I've tried to stab myself, I didn't do quite such a good job on it."Pascoe said that Cooper wrote a letter to their daughter, Karen Bolarinwa, explaining their decision to end their lives.The letter said: "We have made a joint decision that the only way we can be together and be at peace is to end our lives. It is not an easy decision and it breaks our hearts knowing what it will do to you.Please forgive us, this is not at all the intended way but we just cannot go on like this."A note in Audrey Cooper's writing was also found attached to a piece of jewellery addressed to her daughter and grandsons Ben and Jordan. It said: "Jewels expensive, love you."Pascoe said that Cooper admits killing his wife and would plead guilty to a charge of manslaughter.He said the lesser charge would only be acceptable if it could be proven that the couple had genuinely entered into a suicide pact and that Mrs Cooper was in the right state of mind to make that decision.He added that a second defence would be that Cooper himself had been in a state of diminished responsibility when he killed his wife.Pascoe said: "In so serious a case as the taking of a life, the difference between murder and manslaughter should be resolved by a jury rather than by an agreement between lawyers â€“ these are issues too big to be dealt with in any other way."The court heard that Cooper told police that on the day his wife had died, 18 January last year, the couple had driven to Bournemouth and Lulworth Cove in Dorset to find a cliff to jump off together. But because the sites were too crowded, they bought two knives with the intention of killing themselves and drove on to the Mountbatten war memorial park in Romsey, where they had lived much of their lives.Audrey Cooper's sister, Gwen Marsh, told the court that the couple had always been "inseparable and utterly devoted to each other" but in the weeks before she died, her sister had talked often about death.The trial continues.
