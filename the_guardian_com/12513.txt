Antisocial behaviour should be increasingly treated as a criminal rather than civil matter, a report by the crime campaigner turned government adviser Sara Payne recommended today.The document said the wider justice system should be reworked to focus more closely on victims.It follows cases such as that of Fiona Pilkington, who killed herself and her disabled daughter after suffering years of abuse from local youths, during which no criminal charges were brought.Payne's report said police and local authorities should decide which forms of antisocial behaviour ought to be routinely treated as criminal.Victims of all antisocial behaviour should have access to the same network of support available to those whose cases were being dealt with in the criminal courts, it added.Payne – who campaigned for changes to the law on information about paedophiles living in communities after her eight-year-old daughter, Sarah, was abducted and murdered by a released sex offender in 2000 – was made "victims' champion" by the government at the beginning of this year.The one-year independent advisory role saw her meet victims, witnesses and frontline staff before drawing up the 49-page Redefining Justice report, which will be used to help amend the coroners and justice bill currently going through parliament.Speaking to reporters today, Payne said she was seeking a fundamental readjustment of the criminal justice system so it assessed the total impact a crime had on its victims rather than what classification of crime had been carried out."We need to be treating victims with the respect that they deserve, and asking what justice would be for them," she added.Victims were particularly likely to be failed when they faced what was classified as antisocial behaviour and was therefore dealt with by council officials rather than police, she warned."When a crime has been carried out, it should be treated as a crime," she said.The report also recommended that defendants lose the right to a reduced sentence if they pleaded guilty on the day a trial began rather than earlier in the process.It said prosecution and defence lawyers should face penalties if they were not ready to begin a trial on time.And it called for sentencing to be made clearer both in its terminology and in having the process of parole and sentence reductions explained properly."I want everyone – victims, witnesses, defendants – to walk out of court very clear about what time will be served," Payne said."I think that, by changing the way we look at victims, we change the justice system right through."Jack Straw, who as the justice secretary was one of the ministers who appointed Payne, welcomed the report and said the government was trying to improve services for crime victims."We are proud of what we have achieved, but realise there is more work to be done – and Sara Payne's recommendations will help us do this," he said.
