Ronnie Biggs, the ailing Great Train robber who surrendered to British police last year, yesterday married his former Brazilian lover, Raimunda Rothen, in a family ceremony at Belmarsh high security prison in south-east London.Their son, Michael, and two-year-old granddaughter, Ingrid, were present along with nine other guests. All were searched before the wedding in a side room off the prison's chapel building. The 20 minute service, conducted by Tony Jarman, registrar for Greenwich, began late because the bride, a former samba dancer, was delayed by traffic. Biggs, 72, is barely able to speak and remains partly paralysed as a result of four strokes. He was reported to have shed a tear during the ceremony but managed to sign the marriage register. Ms Rothen, 54, arrived with their son Michael, 27, in a black Mercedes with blacked-out windows from the east London flat where Michael is staying. Afterwards she showed off her ring and said: "I'm very happy." Michael added: "We are all together now as a family." Michael's partner, Veronica, was among the guests. Biggs met his wife in 1971 when he was on the run in Brazil. At that point he was still married to his first wife but by fathering a child with a Brazilian partner he was able to defy extradition requests from Britain and remain at liberty. He had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for his part in the 1963 robbery of the Glasgow to London mail train which netted their gang Â£2.6m. After serving 15 months, he escaped from Wandsworth prison, south London. Ms Rothen left Biggs when their son was nearly one year old and went to live in Europe. She agreed to marry the former fugitive because she knew he was nearing the end of his life. Biggs is not due for release until May 13 2020.
