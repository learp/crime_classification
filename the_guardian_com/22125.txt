A prisoner found dead in his cell this week with a ligature around his neck may have been the victim of a miscarriage of justice.Gordon Park, convicted of killing his wife, Carol, died in prison on the morning of his 66th birthday. Park had maintained his innocence and was supported in his campaign to clear his name by his third wife, Jenny, and the two children from his marriage to Carol.Carol Park went missing from the family home near Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, in 1976. Her body, trussed and weighted down, was found in 1997 in Coniston Water in the Lake District. The case was dubbed the Lady in the Lake murder.Park was arrested and held on remand for two weeks after the discovery, but murder charges were dropped the following January through lack of evidence.He was rearrested in 2004, and a year later at Manchester crown court he was convicted of murder, receiving a life sentence with a recommendation that he serve at least 15 years.Campaigners claimed Park was convicted on weak evidence and guesswork. The crown's case was supported by two prisoners on remand at the same time as Park, who both claimed the former teacher had confessed the murder to them. So-called jailhouse confessions have emerged in many cases of wrongful convictions.Park's appeal was turned down in 2008. It is believed he took his own life.A Prison Service spokesman said: "HMP Garth prisoner Gordon Park was found unconscious in his cell at 8am on Monday January 25. Staff and paramedics attended but Mr Park was pronounced dead at 9.40am. As with all deaths in custody, the prisons and probation ombudsman will conduct an investigation."Bob Woffinden, an investigative journalist who has written extensively on Park, has written a piece available on the Daily Mail website examining the evidence in the case. Park's wife and children, he notes, have vowed to continue the campaign to clear his name.
