An American nightclub bouncer accused of murdering a Yorkshire traffic policeman and trying to kill two others made his first crown court appearance yesterday at a hearing ringed by armed police.David Francis Bieber is alleged to have shot at the officers after being questioned for a suspected traffic offence on Boxing Day. The 35-year-old was brought to court from Wakefield jail. Security was as tight as it was during his remand by Leeds magistrates on New Year's Day after his arrest at a hotel in Gateshead. Mr Bieber, originally from Florida but now of Oakwood, Leeds, was remanded in custody until February 18. He spoke only to confirm his name. The judge said that a trial date had been set provisionally for June 9 in Leeds. Mr Bieber, who also uses the name Nathan Wayne Coleman, is charged with murdering PC Ian Broadhurst of Leeds, 34. He is also accused of attempting to murder PC Neil Roper, 45, of Wakefield, and PC James Banks, 26, of Leeds, in Dib Lane, a sidestreet off the main road to Selby. PC Roper has just been moved to a convalescent home from Leeds general infirmary where he had surgery. PC Broadhurst and PC Roper were investigating a suspicious car which proved to be stolen.
