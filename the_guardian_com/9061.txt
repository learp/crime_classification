Portuguese police have said very little on the record. Details of their investigation have been pieced together from numerous leaks to the local papers and from the questions they asked the McCanns when the couple were made formal suspects. Whether the McCanns are asked to return to Portugal or the police drop this line of investigation, may depend on the answers detectives receive on these points:路 How could strands of what could be Madeleine McCann's DNA have been found in the Renault Scenic car that the McCanns hired 25 days after her disappearance? Are the test results, which have been provided by the Forensic Science Service in Birmingham, definitive? Could the car have been contaminated accidentally?路 If detectives think Madeleine is dead, how do they think she died? According to friends of the McCanns, the police asked the couple about traces of Madeleine's blood that were found in the apartment, but also asked whether they had sedated the child. Is there anything else to support either theory?路 Comparing the testimonies of all the people who gave statements in the days and weeks after Madeleine disappeared, there are, it is said, discrepancies in reported timings concerning the night she vanished. Are these genuinely significant, or understandable in the circumstances?路 Who was the man seen walking down a street, with what could have been a small child wrapped in a blanket, beside the McCanns' ground-floor holiday apartment at the Mark Warner complex in Praia da Luz, at the time of her disappearance?There appears to have been no trace of the man sighted by one of the McCanns' friends and described as a Caucasian, aged 35 to 40, of medium build, 1.8 metres tall (5ft 10in), with mainly short hair, wearing a dark jacket, light or gold trousers and dark shoes.
