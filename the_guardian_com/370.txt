The Tories are to consider pulling out of the EU's fast-track extradition scheme, which helped bring failed London bomber Hussain Osman to justice, as part of their battle to resist further transfer of sovereignty to Brussels.Such a move would please the party's Eurosceptics, after David Cameron denied them a referendum on the Lisbon treaty last week, but alarm police chiefs and law enforcement agencies, who believe the European arrest warrant is vital to tackling domestic and cross-border crime.Chris Grayling, the shadow home secretary, said he had not made a final decision about whether a Tory government would take part in the arrest warrant scheme when it is brought under full EU control, but would judge all issues affecting justice and home affairs "on their merits" and according to the "national interest". However, he made clear that the Tories would not want to see any further switch of power over policing to Brussels. "Our instinct will always be against handing more sovereignty to Brussels unless there is a compelling reason to do so. That includes the arrest warrant."The warrant, which operates between EU member states and speeds up extradition cases, has been credited with helping to dismantle the "Costa del Crime" – British criminals fleeing to Spain for safety from prosecution – and of bringing some of Europe's most dangerous criminals to justice.Osman, one of a group who tried to detonate devices on Tube trains at Shepherd's Bush, Warren Street and Oval stations and on a bus in Bethnal Green, east London, on 21 July, 2005, took the Eurostar from Waterloo using his brother's passport after the attack failed, but was eventually arrested under the European arrest warrant in Rome. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007 and must serve at least 40 years after being convicted of conspiracy to murder.The warrant is currently administered "inter-governmentally" by ministers from the 27 EU member states, but does not fall under the competence of the European Commission, European Parliament, or European Court of Justice.But from the moment Lisbon comes into force, justice and home affairs matters will gradually be brought under full EU control over a five-year period. Experts say that, because amendments will soon be needed to the way the warrant operates, it will probably be switched to full EU control long before 2014. When this happens, the British government will have to decide whether or not to "opt in".Last night, Alan Johnson, the home secretary, said the Tories' failure to commit to the warrant scheme was a misjudgement: "In 2005, it was only because we had the European arrest warrant that we could fast-track the extradition of Hussain Osman to Britain. Do the Tories seriously think it would have been better for Britain to have made it harder for the police to get their man? Their European obsession would put Britain at risk."Both the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) have welcomed the role the arrest warrant has played in helping to track down criminals who have fled abroad. The Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, Edward Davey, accused the Tories of putting their ideological opposition to the EU above the pursuit of criminals and terrorists."Anyone who has looked at the facts knows that, before the arrest warrant, co-operation with many EU countries on catching these serious criminals was at best patchy, at worst impossible. British police simply couldn't rely on Interpol or any bilateral arrangements to deliver justice, even when the offences were as serious as murder, rape or child abuse, Davey said."When it's about co-operating to bring drug smugglers, murderers and paedophiles to justice, it's unforgiveable that Cameron would be prepared to put his Euroscepticism above the safety of our young people and the security of the streets. If the Tories were to take the UK out of the agreement, Cameron would be giving the green light to the restoration of Spain's 'Costa del Crime' and all the other European hideouts for Britain's most serious criminals," Davey addedAfter the Czechs became the last of the 27 EU member states to ratify Lisbon last week, Cameron disappointed Eurosceptics in his party by going back on a "cast-iron" pledge to hold a referendum on the treaty. But he pledged to fight to "repatriate" powers over social and employment policy when in government. He also said recently on television that he would try to wrest back control over home affairs issues from Brussels. "There are many things in the Lisbon treaty – giving more power over home affairs and justice – that we don't think is right," he said.Veteran Tory MP and Eurosceptic Richard Shepherd said last night it was a "fundamental constitutional principle" that a UK government should resist handing power over policing to the EU. The sceptics are now warning in private that they will demand a referendum on Britain's future in the EU under a Tory government if Cameron does not deliver on his pledge to repatriate powers.Other EU governments have poured scorn on the idea that the UK will be able to win back control over employment or social policy, because this would require another round of negotiations and the agreement of all 26 other countries, which would not be forthcoming.Last night, it appeared that Tony Blair's push to become the first permanent president of the European Council, a new post created under Lisbon, had all but disappeared as EU sources hailed the Belgian prime minister, Herman Van Rompuy, as the clear favourite. Blair's candidacy has been fiercely opposed by Socialist MEPs, who criticise him for having failed to take the UK into the euro or the Schengen open borders agreement. They also say he divided the EU over the Iraq war. It is understood that Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is unwilling to back the former PM for the job because of the extent of popular opposition to his appointment.The rejection of Blair means that David Miliband, the foreign secretary, would be firmly in the running for the other post created under Lisbon, that of EU foreign policy chief. Miliband, who is known to harbour ambitions to lead the Labour party, is reluctant to push himself forward for a job that would take him out of British politics for at least five years.Sir Stephen Wall, a former British ambassador to Brussels and ex-adviser on Europe to Blair, said he believed Cameron should be wary of promising too much to sceptics.If Cameron were to win the general election, his first challenge would to be protect Britain's £3bn a year rebate from the EU budget, which other member states will demand is abolished in a new round of funding negotiations."If he tries to demand too much on too many fronts, it will be difficult for him," Wall said. "The big challenge that he will need to confront when he enters Number 10 will be over the rebate."
