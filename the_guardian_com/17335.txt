Police and health workers missed four "key opportunities" that could have saved the life of a five-week-old boy murdered by his father, a damning report concludes today.Rilee Saunders suffered such horrific injuries that medical experts compared them to those suffered in a car crash or fall from a one-storey building.At Exeter crown court in March, his father Brian Saunders was jailed for life with a minimum of 18 years after the jury was told Rilee's injuries included a skull fracture and a fractured knee, caused by "gripping or twisting" with such force that the cartilage was "sheared off".During the trial it emerged that Saunders, then 31, from Torpoint in Cornwall, was not being monitored despite having a previous conviction for child cruelty against his eight-week-old daughter by another partner.That child suffered a fractured skull when Saunders lived in Plymouth, Devon and agencies only learned that he had a previous conviction for child cruelty after Rilee's death.Following the trial, a serious case review was conducted by the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly local safeguarding children board which concluded that if any of four opportunities had been taken to intervene, Rilee would have been saved.The report refers to Rilee as "Baby R", Saunders as Mr B and Rilee's 19-year-old mother Alicia Clark as Ms C.It states: "The overview findings are that there were four key opportunities for professionals in health and the police to have intervened positively in Baby R's case, and had any of these been taken it is almost certain that he would have been safeguarded."This is because his father's history would have come to light."The report revealed police and health workers saw Saunders and Clark 19 times between June 2007 and February 2008. Rilee died in March 2008.The report said: "The overview has further highlighted that there were opportunities for agencies to have acted differently after Mr B's other child was injured, which could have led to his whereabouts being tracked."This would have given agencies the opportunity to give appropriate information to Ms C and to ensure that Baby R was safeguarded."The inquiry, by Cornwall council, Plymouth city council, police, and health and probation services, said the failure was due to poor communication and procedures not being followed.It stated: "Multi-agency child protection procedures were not always followed by professionals, resulting in limited information being available to some agencies."Although there was some good communication between agencies, some agencies failed to pass on crucial information to each other and one agency failed to share information internally."Professionals did not carry out their duties as if they were part of a multi-agency team and tended to view the information that they obtained in isolation."In a joint statement, the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly and Plymouth city local safeguarding boards expressed their "deepest sympathy" to Rilee's mother, grandparents and extended family.The statement said: "Both local safeguarding children boards therefore wish to reassure Rilee's mother and extended family and the public that all the partner agencies are fully committed to learning the lessons arising from this, and have already implemented the recommendations."
