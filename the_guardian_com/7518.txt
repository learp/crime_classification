A former aircraft engineer serving life for a gangster-style killing of a retired science teacher tried to clear his name at the court of appeal yesterday - with the help of three jurors at his original trial 13 years ago.In a rare move, the jurors will tell the court of alleged remarks outside the jury room which could have prejudiced the jury against Andrew Adams.Adams, now 36, was convicted at Newcastle crown court in 1993 of killing Jack Royal, a 58-year-old grandfather, on his doorstep in Gateshead three years earlier. The shooting was said to have been in revenge for the fatal stabbing by Royal of a man during a street fight in 1987.Royal was later cleared after two trials heard he had acted in self-defence against David Thompson, his son's 29-year-old former business partner.Adams was charged with Royal's murder only after another man had been tried for the killing and acquitted.The trial judge, Mr Justice Ognall, told Adams, then 23, after the jury found him guilty: "You have been convicted of a brutal murder which was in every sense akin to an execution."His case has been referred to the court by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, the independent body which investigates possible miscarriages of justice.Adams' lawyers allege his defence was not handled properly. A key witness against him agreed to testify only after he was offered a deal by police in which he and his girlfriend avoided jail over an armed robbery, but the deal was not disclosed to the defence.The hearing was adjourned until Monday.
