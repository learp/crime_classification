Hannah's desperate attempt to contact the police by furtively dialling 999 on her mobile phone has revealed a technological deficiency in calling the emergency services. She was unable to speak and, in line with a national procedure for silent calls, she was transferred to an automated system at Scotland Yard. A recorded voice asks the caller either to tap the handset or to dial "5" twice. With no response the system automatically disconnected her call after 50 seconds. Emergency operators, under a code of practice approved by the Association of Chief Police Officers, can override this process if they can detect suspicious noises. But the quality of the background conversation between Hannah and the driver was too indistinct to raise concerns.However, the government is working on a texting solution for people with hearing and speech impediments. The technological solution has been identified and could be available nationally next year with the help of BT experts. But only those who register with their provider will be able to access it.Much of the impetus for the innovation has come from the Liberal Democrat MP for Torbay, Adrian Sanders, who was concerned how a person suffering a stroke could call an ambulance. "I got my office to do a little research and found that the government had actually given the matter some thought but hadn't progressed matters very far," he said. After contacting the four departments responsible for police, ambulance, fire and coastguard, he has been assured by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform that the work is progressing. It is being organised by the 999 liaison committee within the Department of Communities and Local Government. But Sanders's hope that people in danger might be able to text is not yet possible, he has been told.
