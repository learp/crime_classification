The serial sex attacker John Worboys was jailed indefinitely by a judge at Croydon crown court today and told he must serve a minimum of eight years after he was found guilty on 19 charges of drugging and sexually assaulting 12 women, in one case raping his victim.Worboys, 51, a licensed London taxi driver who preyed on female passengers late at night, was given an indeterminate sentence.More than 60 people, including several of Worboys's victims and the police investigation team, packed court number three to see him jailed.Mr Justice Penry-Davey said the cab driver would not be released until a parole board decided he no longer presented a threat to women.Wearing the same grey suit he wore for the entire trial, Worboys remained impassive as he was sentenced.The judge said: "Drivers of licensed black cabs in London have a worldwide reputation not only for the reliability of their driving but for their professional trustworthiness. As somebody with an enduring and powerful interest in sexual matters you saw an opportunity through cab driving. You exploited that trust and, through the use of alcohol and drugs, you sexually abused young women who had trusted you to take them home safely late at night as it was your duty in the circumstances to do."You developed and perfected a web of deceit that was sufficient to ensnare young, intelligent and sensible women who had enjoyed a night out and whose only mistake, as it turned out, was to get into your cab late at night."The judge ordered that Worboys be banned from driving a passenger vehicle for profit and that his black cab and a carrier bag filled with £3,680 be forfeited.The court heard that money from the sale of the £5,000 vehicle would be added to the cash and split between his 12 victims. He would be placed on the sex offenders register.Detectives said they had since been contacted by other women who claim the former stripper and adult film actor targeted them.They said Worboys was the prime suspect in at least 85 attacks in the London and Dorset areas dating as far back as 2002.Senior officers said they would interview Worboys in prison in an attempt to clear up dozens of unsolved sex crimes.Police repeatedly failed to respond to the complaints of his victims and now believe that Worboys may have drugged, raped and assaulted more than 100 women over six years.Worboys, from east London, hid behind the facade of a respectable taxi driver to pick up professional women from the centre of London and Bournemouth in the early hours of the morning. He targeted victims who looked like they had been drinking.He offered them champagne in his cab, claiming he had won money on the lottery or in a casino. The drinks were spiked with a powerful prescription drug and an over-the-counter medicine, a cocktail that left the women so incapacitated he was able to rape and sexually assault them. When they woke, many of the victims could not remember what had happened.Before Worboys was finally arrested and charged in February last year, 14 women had made complaints to police over several years that they had been attacked or had an unsettling experience in a black cab. But officers failed to see a pattern. The complaints began in 2002, and by 2006 Worboys was using an identical method on all his victims.The court heard that one victim came round to find Worboys raping her. The following day, said Johannah Cutts QC, prosecuting, Worboys put an envelope through her door containing £10 and a note wishing her a happy Christmas.Another alleged victim had a flashback to the defendant forcing a tablet into her mouth. When she awoke the following day in her bed, the tampon she had been wearing the previous evening had been removed, Cutts said.The case has raised serious questions over the police response to rape allegations and the Independent Police Complaints Commission launched an inquiry into why the Metropolitan police arrested Worboys and released him without charge in July 2007. He went on to attack 29 more women before he was caught, with a further 71 women subsequently coming forward to say they had also been attacked by him.Speaking before the sentencing, one victim, Carrie Symonds, waived her right to anonymity and said Worboys was "obviously a very sad, deluded person". She added: "I hate that it's being played down that he's just a weirdo. He's more than a weirdo, he's very, very, very dangerous."Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan police commissioner, expressed "deep concerns" over failures in the Worboys inquiry, and pressure grew on Britain's largest police force when it emerged that a second serial sex attacker, Kirk Reid, had raped and sexually assaulted more than 71 women over eight years.The south London chef had been identified as a suspect for a series of sex attacks in 2004 and crossed the police radar at least 12 times, but no one pursued inquiries into him. He went on to attack at least 20 women and was convicted last month.Deputy Commissioner John Yates wrote in the Guardian that the problems the force faced over its handling of rape cases had echoes of those that emerged after the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence, for which no one has been convicted."We need … to reinvent our response in the way that we did in relation to homicide after the tragic murder of Stephen Lawrence," he said.
