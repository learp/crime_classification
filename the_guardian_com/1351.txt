A knife-wielding attacker who disguised himself in a Santa Claus hat and beard has left police puzzled over the motive for the murder of a young accountant.Sikandar Shaheen, 25, was found bleeding in the hallway of his shared house in north-east London. Another resident, woken by the disturbance, saw the assailant fleeing downstairs wearing a red pointed hat with a white bobble on top. Police later recovered a Father Christmas hat and beard fitting the description which had been abandoned around the corner from the house in Leytonstone.Mr Shaheen came to London from Islamabad in 2001 to study accountancy and was employed as a trainee at a waste disposal company in Islington. Friends and housemates described him as hard-working and religious; he regularly attended local mosques. Officers were called to the scene shortly after 6am on Saturday morning. Mr Shaheen was taken to hospital but was unable to speak before he died. He had suffered several stab wounds.Shoaib Jillani, 26, who chased Sikandar Shaheen's killer, said yesterday: "I was sleeping and heard shouting like someone had woken up from a nightmare. I got up and went to the door and saw a person coming out of Sikandar's room."[The attacker] was wearing a red hat and he had a white beard and a silver jacket. I only saw him for one second."My immediate thought was this is a robbery. I didn't think it was serious until I saw Sikandar collapse."Detective chief inspector Keith Garnish, said: "We have no idea of motive at present. We are also appealing to anyone who knew Sikandar or knew his last movements leading up to Saturday to contact us."The police can be contacted on 020 8345 3715.
