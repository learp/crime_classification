A former Tory prospective parliamentary candidate today escaped a jail sentence after mounting a vicious hate campaign against political rivals in his constituency.Ian Oakley, 31, was given an 18-week suspended prison sentence at St Albans magistrates court.The former Conservative party candidate for Watford admitted a campaign of harassment against Liberal Democrats in the town at a hearing in August.Oakley, of Ryeland Close, West Drayton, north-west London, pleaded pleaded guilty to five charges of criminal damage and two counts of harassment. He asked for 68 other offences to be taken into account.At August's hearing the court heard Oakley had terrorised Liberal Democrat rivals Sal Brinton and Russell Willson, sending hate mail, making silent phone calls, daubing graffiti on Willson's house and accusing him of being a child abuser.Sentencing Oakley today, the chairman of the bench, Barry Northrop, said: "Mr Oakley, you pleaded guilty to a large number of charges of harassment and criminal damage and you did that in the particular context of the democratic process of this country."Your offences are quite seriously aggravated by a number of factors. They were planned, and you clearly ignored the very obvious distress that would be caused to the victims and others who became involved in your campaign of harassment."You targeted multiple victims and your campaign endured for something like 21 months." The court heard Oakley sent gay and lesbian magazines to Brinton's home and work and made silent late-night phone calls to her. Letters addressed to "Sal Bitchton" were also sent to her work and supporters were urged to "dump" her as candidate.In December 2006, a letter told her to "go back home to Cambridge you evil bitch". Oakley daubed graffiti across the Liberal Democrat headquarters in Watford, and slashed tyres of local councillors' cars.His campaign against Willson, from February to May this year, included daubing "scum scum perv" on his home and sending letters to him and supporters wrongly claiming he was a member of a child abuse ring. The court heard the 31-year-old was caught out when his fingerprints were found on several items.Northrop described some of Oakley's abuse as "vile" and said it was a deliberate attempt to "subvert the democratic process". He said its effects on his victims had included an inability to sleep, loss of part of employment, prolonged distress and even making some people too afraid to exercise their democratic right.He sentenced Oakley to 18 weeks in prison, which he suspended for 12 months. Oakley was also ordered to pay compensation to three victims whose tyres had been slashed, as well as prosecution costs of Â£70.
