Portugal's attorney general today said he would announce a "solution" to the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann on Monday.Fernando Jose Pinto Monteiro's comments raised the prospect of Kate and Gerry McCann finding out whether they will be formally cleared of involvement in their daughter's disappearance.Monteiro's words also fuelled speculation that the case could finally be drawing to a close.He told reporters in Lisbon today: "The Maddie case will have a solution on Monday and you will hear of it."Reports suggested he would announce whether the case would be closed, charges would be brought or more inquiries made.The McCanns' spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, said the family, whose daughter went missing from their holiday apartment on May 3 last year, had not been contacted by the Portuguese authorities."We've heard nothing official and our lawyers have heard nothing official," he said. "It may well be true, but we can't comment because we haven't heard. We're not going to prejudice anything."
