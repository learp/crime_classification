Cameras are to be allowed into English courtrooms for the first time in a pilot scheme to test whether filmed highlights of cases should be allowed to be broadcast on news bulletins. The Department for Constitutional Affairs has been working with senior judges and national broadcasters to hammer out details of the scheme, which it hopes will go live this year. The six-week scheme will not cover trials but appeals in civil and criminal cases, which are less likely to involve witnesses. Ministers and judges fear cameras could intimidate witnesses and hinder them from giving their evidence. Cameras - even still cameras - have not been allowed in the courts in England and Wales. Some filming of trials has been permitted in Scotland. Filming will take place in two courts at the royal courts of justice in London - those of the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, and the master of the rolls, Lord Phillips. Cameras will be fixed on the judge and barristers and there will be areas of the court which will be guaranteed not to be in shot. The scheme is likely to choose high-profile appeals, but the results will not be broadcast. Broadcasters will produce mocked-up news packages which will be shown to ministers, judges and legal professional bodies to decide whether filming for broadcast should be allowed to go ahead. A decision whether to allow an appeal to be filmed would be for the judge to take, but the parties to the appeal will be allowed to make representations. The DCA said: "We're hoping to launch a pilot later this year. We're still dotting the i's and crossing the t's." It said there were no plans to film trials as well as appeals. "It's very much one step at a time." In America, trials may be filmed if the judges give permission. Those televised include the murder trials of OJ Simpson and of the British nanny Louise Woodward.
