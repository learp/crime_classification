A Cambridge graduate referred to as the "tome raider" who stole antique books worth £40,000 from a world-famous library was jailed for three-and-a-half years today.William Jacques, who stole £1m of rare books in the late 1990s, drew up a "thief's shopping list" as he continued his life of crime.He used a false name to sign in to the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley library in London before stuffing valuable books under his tweed jacket and fleeing, Southwark crown court was told.Recorder Michael Holland QC told Jacques: "You have absolutely no intention of turning away from what seems to you to be an extremely lucrative and easy crime."Such crimes "undermine and destroy parts of the cultural heritage that's contained within these libraries", the judge said.The judge, who said Jacques had no mitigation, told him: "You are a Cambridge graduate and should know better, I suppose."This was a systematic and carefully planned theft and you had prepared what, in my view, was a target list, from your research at that library, of books that were worth stealing."This was a theft in progress and the list referred to books worth tens of thousands of pounds more."Your entire motivation was commercial and you intended to make whatever money you could from the theft of these books despite their cultural value."The effect of your criminality was to undermine and destroy parts of the cultural heritage that's contained within these libraries and make it more difficult for those who have a legitimate interest in these books to gain access to them because libraries have to take inconvenient and expensive steps to stop thefts of this kind."Jacques was "relying on the reluctance of library staff to challenge people" when they were used to dealing with members of the public whom they could trust, the judge said.
