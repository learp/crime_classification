Four prisoners who were facing deportation after finishing sentences for serious crimes have gone missing, immigration officials admitted yesterday.Lin Homer, the chief executive of the Borders and Immigration Agency, told MPs that so far 214 of the original 1,013 foreign national prisoners who were released without being considered for deportation have been sent home. Police and immigration officers have been unable to track down 149 of the prisoners, whose release led to the departure of Charles Clarke as home secretary last year. Officials assume many of them have already left the country.The disclosures of incompetence during the foreign prisoner crisis led to the present home secretary, John Reid, describing the Home Office as "not fit for purpose" and contributed to the decision to split the department.The official report into the crisis clears ministers but shows that Home Office staff were denied requests for extra funding to deal with the problem because of budget cuts, with at one point 85 staff expected to deal with a backlog of 9,000 cases. It also confirms that staff in the immigration service's criminal casework unit, which was dealing with the release of foreign prisoners, were left confused about whether their priority should be to hit Downing Street's "tipping point" target for removing failed asylum seekers, reduce the prison population or deport foreign prisoners. The foreign prisoner issue was not regarded as a strategic priority by the immigration service and ministers were not told about the scandal until March 2006, when Mr Clarke immediately made it public.The Conservatives claimed last night the report showed that Mr Reid had failed to get to grips with the crisis. The Tory immigration spokesman, Damien Green, said the report "lays responsibility for the foreign national prisoner shambles squarely at the feet of ministers. The large number of shifting targets has been a direct cause of serial shambles."The official update to MPs, published yesterday, shows that of the original 1,103 prisoners released without deportation being considered, 329 have been given the right to stay, 58 are still in prison and 263 are going through the removal process.Ms Homer said the 149 former prisoners who had not been found "have not committed any further offences to our knowledge, and given what we know about this group it is possible that many of those individuals have left the country of their own volition".She also disclosed to MPs that immigration authorities are working with police to track down four of a group of 25 ex-prisoners who have absconded after being released on bail by asylum and immigration tribunal judges. She said that in each case which involved people jailed for more serious offences the immigration service had opposed bail.
