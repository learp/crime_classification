Two teenagers were yesterday cleared of murdering a man outside a takeaway shop after a jury agreed that they had acted in self-defence. Kes Ingoldsby, 18, the son of a millionaire music producer, and James Diggens, 19, admitted getting into a fight with Stephen Langford last year, but claimed the 18-stone fitness enthusiast was the aggressor.Their defence accused the prosecution of "misleading" the jury by omitting from its opening crucial evidence from a witness who said the teenagers had been defending themselves. The defence branded the prosecution's action as an "affront to British justice".The pair had been accused of beating Mr Langford, a sales director, to death in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. The prosecution told Inner London crown court they laid in wait for the 43-year-old father of two after a row, knocking him to the ground and kicking him in the head.Mr Langford - a friend of the local Tory MP Boris Johnson - had stopped at a takeaway shop with a friend in the early hours of December 9, where witnesses saw him "laughing and joking" with staff.Mr Diggens, Mr Ingoldsby, his girlfriend and another youth arrived and a row ensued. Julian Baughan QC, prosecuting, claimed Ingoldsby "singled out" the older man, but the teenager said problems began after he noticed the businessman staring intently at his girlfriend.After they left the takeaway, Mr Ingoldsby said Mr Langford ran out and charged towards him with "fists clenched". Mr Diggens said he punched the "much bigger" executive in the face to defend his friend. Witnesses heard Mr Langford's skull crack as he hit the ground.A prosecution witness who saw the incident said Mr Langford had been the aggressor. "The man ran at them with his fists," said Desmond Dominic. "If they hadn't swung at him, he would have hit them. The first hit was in self-defence."
