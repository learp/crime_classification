While airport security has been increased to unprecedented levels to combat the threat of terrorists, the danger posed by ordinary citizens is not so readily documented.In a secret museum at Manchester airport, however, thousands of illegal weapons, ranging from loaded shotguns to credit card-sized knives, are on permanent display, and most have been taken from apparently ordinary holidaymakers. From two elderly women, one in a wheelchair, who were found to be carrying sword-sticks, to a man leaving on a stag weekend with a semi-automatic pistol in his possession, the Black Museum has collated the most vicious weapons from the most unexpected places. "We have no formal inventory, but we have literally thousands of illegal weapons", says John Cordingley, a security training consultant at the airport. "If you add the number of items we have seized that are dangerous but legal, from kitchen knives to pressurised cans, the total goes into the millions." Whether from absent-mindedness or sheer ignorance of the law, Mr Cordingley believes, most weapons are brought in unwittingly. "While there are criminals who come through the airport, most people are carrying weapons without thinking. They might leave for a self-catering holiday, for example, and take a kitchen knife in their hand luggage." An increasing problem for airport security inspectors is the number of imitation weapons that people carry. Keyring pistols that fire blanks, alarm clocks made to resemble sticks of dynamite, and cigarette lighters that look like hand grenades and play the Lambada when lit; all have been confiscated from passengers. Hidden in a secure room, the museum attracts airport security operatives from around the globe. "We supplement the weapons seized with others weaponry like rockets and mortars, so we can help train staff to recognise what they are looking for", says Mr Cordingley. He adds: "There is no other airport museum like it in the world."
