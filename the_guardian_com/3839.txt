The widow of an Egyptian billionaire accused of being a Mossad spy said today that he had been murdered after a coroner returned an open verdict.Dr Ashraf Marwan fell from the balcony of his fourth-floor flat, in central London, in 2007.The coroner, Dr William Dolman, rejected suggestions of suicide or unlawful killing, but the 63-year-old's widow, Mona Nasser, the daughter of Egypt's late president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, said: "I'm sure that there was somebody else involved."The truth will come out. They are still discovering things about Tutankhamun. How can he fall? Never. He was pushed." In 2002, Marwan was accused of tipping off Israel about the 1973 Yom Kippur invasion. Israeli media later reported that he was in fact a double agent who gave Jerusalem misleading information.
