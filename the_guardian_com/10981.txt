What the jury has been told about Warren's past: 1993 Stands trial at Newcastle crown court for conspiring to smuggle 1,000kg of cocaine into the UK. Huge quantities discovered inside lead ingots after tip-off. The Jersey court was told yesterday Warren was "so sophisticated he knew the length of the biggest drill bit that customs held". This meant he could hide the drugs just deep enough into the ingots that they wouldn't be discovered. The trial collapsed and Warren walked free after it emerged one of his co-conspirators, Brian Charrington, was a paid informant for customs officers.1997 Warren is sentenced to 13 years for drugs smuggling and possession of fire arms in the Netherlands.
