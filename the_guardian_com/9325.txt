A group of 50 criminal justice charities last night called on David Blunkett to retract his comments that he was tempted to celebrate the death of Dr Harold Shipman. The news came as two teenage boys were found hanged in separate youth prisons.Una Padel, who chairs the Penal Affairs Consortium, an umbrella body for organisations working with the prison and probation services, has written warning the Home Secretary he risks undermining the inquiry into the death of the mass murderer. Blunkett had sent mixed messages to prison staff about the importance the Home Office attached to tackling suicide in prisons, she said. 'It is difficult to believe that the Home Secretary openly expressing his pleasure at the thought of a prisoner committing suicide is a helpful message to be sending out to prison staff,' said Padel, who is also director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King's College, London.'Given the problems in our prisons, and the record number of suicides, they already have a very difficult job to do. The Home Secretary should be unambiguous in his support for the work of prison officers, not playing politics to get easy tabloid headlines.' Her comments came as the Prison Service opened separate investigations into the deaths of the boys found hanged, both in single cells. Philip Rustell, 19, was discovered in his single cell at Reading Young Offenders' Institute early yesterday. Rustell, from Hampshire, was on remand charged with wounding with intent. James Skelly, 18, was found at Portland Young Offenders' Institute, Dorset, at around 6.55am during routine checks. He was serving seven years, imposed at Chichester Crown Court, West Sussex, last year, for wounding. Prison reformers say both were in an age group which is largely forgotten by the prison system and is not covered by the specialist Youth Justice Board, which oversees child offenders.
