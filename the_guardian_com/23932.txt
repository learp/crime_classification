Sir William Macpherson disclosed today that he had received death threats over his controversial report on the Stephen Lawrence case, in which he accused the Metropolitan Police of "institutional racism".He is quoted in an interview in The Spectator magazine as saying the phrase was not his, that he hesitated before using it, and that he had expressly denied that every Metropolitan Police officer was racist. However, he insisted that it was the only way he could see to sum up what was clearly a systemic failure of policing in which unconsciously racist assumptions had played a part at several stages. He said: "It was a collective failure, little groups of people. Not just one person, not the rotten apple in the barrel, but each infecting the other."If they, the police, are losing their morale still, if they are still being shot away by it, that's because they ought to be rightly ashamed of what happened during the case. "It was primarily inefficiency and lack of proper control, but also infected by racism. That is what is at the root of it all. I could have bottled out. I could have decided not to mention racism at all and stuck to the policing questions. "But as this procession of coppers came in, our mouths sort of fell open, and we thought we are bloody well going to have the courage to say it all publicly. "I get awful letters from people who say they are going to come and murder me, and that Enoch Powell was right, and that I ought to have said they all ought to be sent back. "But what saddens me is the newspapers, because I hoped and believed they would be on the same side in getting the police to get it right for the future." Sir William said that unconscious racism was more dangerous in a way than out-and-out racism, "because it just sort of happens, and it fouls up the atmosphere between those who are misunderstood by the police when the police won't react properly to them and so on". When asked: "Why are we racist?", Sir William replied: "How difficult to answer. I suppose in the end we started in this country by being a totally white insular population and there is a resistance to the gradual arrival, and the spread of immigration." He went on: "Asylum seekers are one thing, but there are a tremendous number of people who come in legitimately, and so lots more places are going to become like Leicester because they tend to settle in the same area. "It's something that's got to be not confronted, but accepted, because you can't do anything about it."Â• The friend who saw Stephen Lawrence murdered today called on the home secretary, Jack Straw, to reverse his decision to reinstate a Metropolitan Police officer sacked for racism.He described Mr Straw's decision to reinstate Pc Steve Hutt - sacked for calling a 14-year-old boy a "black bastard" - as a "concession to racism". Duwayne Brooks, 25, was with 18-year-old Stephen when a white gang stabbed him to death in Eltham, south east London, in 1993. In a letter to Mr Straw today, he said the Macpherson report into the killing had sparked a backlash in the police - and the campaign which led to the reinstatement of Mr Hutt was part of this. Pc Hutt was sacked by the Met commissioner, Sir John Stevens, after he admitted shouting "sit down, you black bastard" during a struggle to arrest him. The decision was overturned by Mr Straw last month after thousands of police officers signed a petition demanding his reinstatement. The mother of the child also condemned the decision to sack him. Pc Hutt admitted he had made the comment in a "moment of madness". However, Mr Brooks said the campaign to reinstate the police officer was "coded racism". A home office spokeswoman said Mr Brooks' letter had been received this morning. "We will be looking at it and responding in due course," she said.Related special reportsStephen LawrenceRace in BritainRelated storiesWhat is institutional racism?Archive: all the Lawrence stories15 December 2000: Anger as Hague is accused of playing the race cardUseful linksFull text of the Macpherson report Summary: the Macpherson report The Spectator Commission for Racial Equality
