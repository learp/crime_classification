A young girl was in a life-threatening condition in hospital after being shot in the head by a man believed to be her father in a village in East Sussex.Neighbours said that the man arrived at his former partner's home in Northiam, near Rye, about 4pm before opening fire on the girl, who was aged between six and eight.Sussex police said the man then turned the weapon on himself and a body was found by armed officers in a parked car nearby.Chief Superintendent Neil Honnor of Sussex Police said: "We are treating this as a tragic domestic incident and do not believe that anyone else is involved. At this stage we are not in a position to confirm the relationships of all those involved but we can say that the girl and the man knew each other. The man does not live at the address. We are treating this as an isolated incident."One neighbour said that the girl and her mother had not lived in the area for long.South East Coast ambulance service described the gunshot wound as serious. She was flown to King's College hospital in south London.The area has been sealed off while officers investigate the incident and is likely to be closed for the next few hours," he said.
