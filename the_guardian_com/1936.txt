Halloween is meant to be a bit of harmless fun, but according to insurers 31 October is also the worst day of the year for malicious damage to your home.House insurance claims are expected to rise by 270% on Halloween, according to Axa Insurance, while Saga claims 3.6 million homeowners will face damage to their properties as some revellers go too far with nasty pranks aiming to deliberately cause damage.Claims submitted last year on Halloween included broken windows, theft, and damage caused to paintwork by broken eggs. Last year, 15% of 2,044 people questioned by Saga said their house had been egged or flour-bombed on Halloween.Damage caused to your property by an unknown third party is covered under your home insurance policy, but you should still be vigilant, according to Nick Kidd, head of household insurance at Axa."Any sort of damage caused to another person's property is not only antisocial but also a criminal offence," Kidd said. "And while insurance can pick up the cost it can't deal with the emotional trauma."It is not just Halloween that has insurers on standby: bonfire night (5 November) is also notorious for malicious damage claims, many the result of firecrackers being pushed through letterboxes.Kidd said: "Although it is difficult to avoid someone putting something through the letterbox, people should take extra care to ensure windows and doors are locked, garden gates are secured and outbuildings, such as garages and sheds, are locked."Axa said that following bonfire night last year the average claim for damage caused by a firework or firecracker pushed through a letterbox was Â£1,000.Many people said they turned their lights off and pretended to be out to avoid answering the door to trick or treaters, but police and local councils say it is more effective to display a "No trick or treat" sign in the porch or front window. Many councils and local police stations have printable posters for homeowners to download on their websites.Police advise homeowners not to open doors to trick or treaters if they feel intimidated by their presence, and to phone 999 should there be any disturbances or incidents outside or on their property.Meanwhile, trick or treaters are advised to play safe by respecting "No trick or treat" signs, only ringing the door bells of people they know, not entering houses, and staying in well-lit areas.
