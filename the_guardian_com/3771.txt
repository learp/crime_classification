Police are warning women to be on their guard after a series of sex attacks near the centre of Manchester.Five women have been indecently assaulted and one has been raped since February in the Gorton area. Reports from victims suggest that their attacker could be the same man. They agree that the man was white, 20 to 30 years old, approximately 5ft 10in to 6ft tall, with a local accent and deep voice. Although the descriptions match, police are reluctant at this stage to announce they have a serial sex attacker on their hands. Detective Chief Inspector Phil Owen said it was too early to say whether the attacks were linked but the police were not ruling out the possibility. Extra officers are patrolling local streets and DCI Owen hopes that this will reassure residents. "Obviously, [the attacks] may worry women in these areas, but I can reassure them and the rest of the communities that we are working extremely hard to catch those responsible," he said. "We have specially trained officers working as part of a dedicated team to solve these attacks, irrespective of whether they are linked or not." Police are urging women to take precautions. DCI Owen said: "There are a number of measures women can take to lessen the chance of being attacked, such as avoiding walking on their own at night and keeping to busy, well-lit areas."
