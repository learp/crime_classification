Two men have been found guilty of plotting to hurt the Celtic manager, Neil Lennon, and other prominent Celtic fans using crude, homemade parcel bombs.Trevor Muirhead, 44, and Neil McKenzie, 42, face lengthy jail terms after a high court jury in Glasgow said they had sent five devices packed with nails to Lennon, the late lawyer Paul McBride QC, the senior Labour politician Trish Godman, and republican campaigners last year.Muirhead, from Kilwinning in Ayrshire, and McKenzie, from the neighbouring town of Saltcoats, were accused of conspiring to seriously harm Lennon, McBride, Godman and members of the Irish republican group Cairde na hÉireann in Glasgow. On one charge of sending a first hoax device to Lennon the jury returned a verdict of "not proven" in the case of Muirhead.The judge said both men had been "convicted of unusual but serious offences". He said sentencing would be deferred until 27 April for social inquiry reports.Members of the men's families were in tears as the jury came back into court to deliver their verdict after deliberating for two and a half hours. One woman shouted as Muirhead was led down to the holding cells: "Keep your head up. You will walk out of here. You will." He nodded and raised his hand at the public seats.There were angry scenes outside the court as other family members shouted abuse at camera crews and photographers before being pushed away by police.The five-week trial heard that both men were committed supporters of Glasgow's Rangers FC, Celtic's traditionally Protestant arch rival, while Muirhead was an active supporter and admirer of Protestant loyalist organisations, including the Ulster Volunteer Force terrorist group.The men were arrested in May 2011 following a major anti-terrorist investigation involving the security services and undercover surveillance teams launched after potentially explosive devices were sent to Lennon, McBride and Godman in March.The police also believe the pair were planning further attacks: they found further similar materials after dawn raids on both men's houses.In the closing stages of the trial, the prosecution was ordered to drop charges of plotting to murder the victims after the judge, Lord Turnbull, ruled there was insufficient evidence. The pair instead faced reduced charges of plotting to assault their targets, and a second charge of making Lennon believe the first hoax device they sent was capable of exploding and injuring him.Strathclyde police were originally told by forensics experts that the devices were very dangerous as they contained a volatile homemade explosive called TATP (tri-acetone tri-peroxide) or organic peroxide, often associated with al-Qaida attacks.When the plot was revealed last April, police commanders warned that they were "viable devices" and "very definitely capable of causing real harm".But the jury learned that more detailed forensic checks found that none of the devices were viable. Their electronic devices, such as cheap digital watches and wires, were not capable of acting as detonators. The first parcel sent to McBride was an inert hoax device, using putty and 248 nails.Prosecution witnesses told the high court, however, that the presence of TATP and organic peroxide in three of the devices sent to Lennon, Godman – who had just retired as an MSP after serving as deputy presiding officer of the Scottish parliament – and the republican group Cairde na hÉireann still meant they were potentially dangerous.The TATP and organic peroxide was theoretically capable of exploding with a battery charge or shock.The incendiary device sent to McBride, an outspoken lawyer who was Lennon and Celtic's QC who died suddenly midway through the trial while abroad, included a small container of petrol and was packed with nails.Tim Niven-Smith, for the prosecution, told the jury that both Muirhead and McKenzie believed their devices were bombs and were capable of causing injuries.The jury saw CCTV images of McKenzie buying plastic travel bottles, padded envelopes and a watch from a local discount shop, and then nails from a nearby B&Q on 14 April, the day before the package for McBride was found in a postbox.A bug in McKenzie's car later recorded the men discussing how one had taught "thingwy [sic] how to make a bomb", and talking of placing one outside a police station and "letting the fucker off". Muirhead sent McKenzie a text message which read "Sorry m8 our package was in Pennyburn last night waiting on navy bomb disposbal [sic]."Muirhead's son Gordon, who lived near a postbox used to post the McBride device, said both his father and McKenzie had warned him not to turn left, in the direction of the postbox, the night it was sent. McKenzie had also told Gordon Muirhead: "If you hear a bang in the night don't open the curtains".In a police interview, Muirhead admitted watching the first device to Lennon being posted in March 2011, and to obtaining the peroxide hair dye for the devices, but wholly blamed McKenzie. He claimed McKenzie had "pure hatred" for Lennon and Celtic, and that he was terrified of his friend.In his police interviews, McKenzie admitted to building the devices. He told police "OK, then aye, I'm involved." He claimed the first was intended just to be a hoax, but said the latter devices were intended to "scare" their recipients. He had seen on the internet that using peroxide would make them "flash".The first of the devices was sent to Lennon on 3 March, the day after the Celtic manager had a violent touchline confrontation with the then Rangers assistant coach Ally McCoist following an ill-tempered cup match at Celtic Park which saw three players sent off and 34 fans arrested on the stands.The discovery of the first hoax device was originally kept secret by Strathclyde police. As more devices emerged, they asked for a media blackout to avoid jeopardising their undercover operation.Lennon, a hate figure for Rangers fans and Ulster loyalists, had previously received bullets in the post and death threats.Over the next six weeks four potentially dangerous devices were sent, including a second addressed to Lennon, using the peroxide-based explosive TATP. Bomb disposal squads were called out to deal with the devices at sorting offices and police stations in Ayrshire, Glasgow and Belfast, where the device addressed to Cairde na hÉireann had been sent to a postal returns depot after it could not be delivered.Both men had denied the charges. The police were unable to find any forensic evidence directly tying either man to the devices, relying heavily on witness testimony, the CCTV evidence and bugging.Their defence lawyers insisted they had only sent out hoax devices intended to scare and frighten their targets, and knew they were unable to explode.Donald Findlay QC, for McKenzie, said it might have been a "sick joke", but that was all it was. "They were sending a message to scare, cause alarm, cause panic or inconvenience. That is all that it was. It was not a conspiracy to cause severe injury."Gordon Jackson QC, for Muirhead, said: "No matter how horrid, nasty, even evil to do it, it's absolutely not the crime that is alleged."
