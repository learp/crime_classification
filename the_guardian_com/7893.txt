Sky1 will team up with the police next month to launch War on Knives, a week-long campaign against knife crime.The special week has been developed in collaboration with police forces around the country as the satellite channel attempts to build on its new-found campaigning zeal.Two live shows fronted by Donal MacIntyre and June Sarpong will be part of the knife crime week, which launches on October 14 with a live 120-minute show and closes with a 60-minute programme on October 21, which will feature those affected by knife crime, as well as looking at ways to get knives off the streets and how to tackle the problem.Cameras around the UK will follow concerned communities and local police forces."Knife crime and the toll exacted in recent months and years, on our young in particular, is one of the most important issues facing communities today," MacIntyre said."If a whole generation is casual about knives today then tomorrow it's guns and already we are seeing that trend developing."Throughout the week, the channel's campaign will include a number of interstitials featuring celebrities lending their support, including Olympic gold medal-winning boxer James DeGale, singer Estelle and Brooke Kinsella, the former EastEnders actress whose 16-year-old brother, Ben, was killed in June.Viewers will be able to get involved through the red button on their remote control and by filling in an online questionnaire.Andrew O'Connell, the Sky1 factual commissioning editor who ordered the shows, said: "The steep increase in knife crime we're all reading about in newspapers every day is staggering - 26 youths have lost their lives this year alone. "I'm proud that we are hosting this campaign on Sky1 and supporting the authorities in their work to put a stop to the violence."The programmes will be made by independent production company Leopard Films with Dan Berbridge and James Burstall as executive producers and Rachel Ford as series editor.The company's chief executive, James Burstall, said: "Leopard is committed to campaigning popular television and this major event is a fantastic opportunity for us to be working with Sky1 confronting this national issue head on." The special week follows the launch of Sky1's Noel's HQ on Sunday, which saw Deal or No Deal frontman Noel Edmonds attempting to mend 'broken Britain' through a series of initiatives.· To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
