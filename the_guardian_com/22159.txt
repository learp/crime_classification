A chief constable has ordered an internal inquiry after a court heard how up to 20 of his officers attended an emergency call at a house and left the occupant with injuries so severe that he needed 13 weeks off work.Stephen Whenary, 36, of Norton, near Stockton on Tees, told Teesside magistrates court he was sprayed in the face with CS gas, then pulled from the shower and beaten on the head with a baton.The court heard that Mr Whenary's face was left covered in blood. He had a cut on the back of his head and lacerations on his shoulders. A large bruise was visible on his arm and there were further minor cuts and abrasions on his wrists. Both his feet suffered deep cuts during the struggle.After being dragged from the house last September Mr Whenary was charged with assaulting police officers and resisting arrest.But he walked free after being cleared by a district judge who criticised the police evidence presented to the court.Following the acquittal Sean Price, chief constable of Cleveland police, said: "This case raises very serious issues and, as the public would expect, we will be investigating them regardless of whether any complaint is raised."The case against Mr Whenary began to unravel almost from the outset. The judge heard how police rushed to the house after responding to reports of an argument. Almost every police officer in Stockton responded when a PC put out a call for help.But whereas one officer said Mr Whenary ripped the shower door off its hinges to use as a weapon, another said it was kicked off by a policeman. Another officer said his notebook had been accidentally destroyed in the wash.Mr Whenary's solicitor, Carroll Slaney, said: "Stephen has always maintained his innocence... and he was confident that when the court heard the evidence his innocence would be confirmed."
