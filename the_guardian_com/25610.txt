A police and crime commissioner has been suspended from the Labour party after the Crown Prosecution Service launched an investigation into his expenses claims.The inquiry will focus on mileage claims made by Lancashire PCC Clive Grunshaw while he was a Labour county councillor and police authority member before his election in November.The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigated the matter and has passed its findings to the CPS, his office said.Grunshaw said on Wednesday he did not "willfully submit claims which I knew to be untrue" and that he would continue in his post until a final decision was made by prosecutors.A Labour spokesman said: "Clive Grunshaw has been suspended form the Labour party pending the outcome of the CPS inquiry."The details of the mileage claims – from when Grunshaw attended meetings of the council and the police authority on the same days – first emerged in an article in the Sunday Times and came following a freedom of information request from a local Conservative councillor.The matter was referred to the police watchdog by Lancashire's police and crime panel, which scrutinises the work of the PCC.In a statement on Wednesday, Miranda Carruthers-Watt, chief executive and solicitor for the office for the police and crime commissioner (OPCC), said: "This investigation relates to claims made when Clive Grunshaw was subject to the Lancashire county council expenses and allowance scheme as a Lancashire county councillor and a member of Lancashire police authority. The allegations do not relate to any expenses claims during his time as police and crime commissioner."The OPCC has assisted the Independent Police Complaints Commission throughout their investigation, and will continue to provide assistance now the matter has been referred to the Crown Prosecution Service."While we await the decision of the CPS we will continue to support the commissioner in carrying out his statutory duties, and we look forward to a swift conclusion to this matter."Grunshaw said: "I understand the public interest in this matter, and I wish to reassure the residents of Lancashire that during the last nine months I have complied fully with the investigative process and will continue to do so."I maintain that at no point did I willfully submit claims which I knew to be untrue and every expense claim I did make was genuinely intentioned."While I await the Crown Prosecution Service's decision I will continue to carry out my role as normal and be the public voice of policing in Lancashire."It was reported that Grunshaw allegedly "double claimed" mileage expenses for meetings of the county council and police authority in Preston on the same days from his home in Fleetwood.This was said to have happened on 23 occasions as Grunshaw allegedly claimed a total of £1,200 in mileage and about £350 in subsistence.The former parliamentary assistant had served as chairman of Lancashire police authority's resources committee before his election as commissioner last November.In a statement, the IPCC said: "The independent investigation began after allegations about expenses claims made by Clive Grunshaw before his election as a PCC were referred to the IPCC by Lancashire's police and crime panel."Mr Grunshaw was interviewed by IPCC investigators as part of the investigation. A full investigation report was sent to the CPS on 25 September. The CPS is responsible for making a decision on whether there is evidence to warrant criminal charges."
