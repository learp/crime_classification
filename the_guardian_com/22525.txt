The makers of a television talk show have defended their approach to guests after being criticised by a judge.ITV said The Jeremy Kyle Show did not involve "cruelty and exploitation" but provided an opportunity for people to resolve disputes.It came after Jamie Juste, 26, was jailed for two years following a hearing at Peterborough crown court on Wednesday.The court heard Juste had admitted assaulting Rebecca Langley, 24, in March at the home they shared in Peterborough.Police said Juste had attacked Langley after the couple had appeared on the show and taken lie detector tests.Judge Sean Enright said the show contained an "element of cruelty and exploitation".An ITV spokeswoman said: "With respect to the judge, we are surprised at his remarks given that he pointed out that he has not seen our programme, and we absolutely refute the notion that it involves cruelty and exploitation â€¦"Jamie Juste and Rebecca Langley approached the production team requesting an appearance on the show to resolve problems within their relationship."As well as discussing these issues in the studio they were given advice from our aftercare team about dealing with their difficulties and offered counselling sessions prior to this incident."The court heard the attack occurred after Juste had been drinking and taking drugs."In 2007 district judge Alan Berg, sitting at Manchester magistrates court, branded the programme "a form of human bear-baiting" while sentencing one of the show's guests, who had butted his love rival during filming.
