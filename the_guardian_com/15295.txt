A list of lawyers, insurers and finance companies that have used the services of rogue private detectives will remain secret after a plea to MPs from the information commissioner.Keith Vaz, chair of the home affairs select committee, which wants the names of the companies involved made public, has agreed to hold off publishing it after the commissioner, Christopher Graham, said publication could "impede the course of justice".Graham has begun a criminal investigation into possible breaches of data protection laws by the companies on the list. It was drawn up by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) after an investigation which led to the jailing last year of four private detectives for unlawfully obtaining private information.But Vaz – whose committee has been pressing for action to be taken against companies that have broken the law – said MPs remained frustrated at the slow progress of investigations into the firms."The committee has been frustrated by the lack of activity on this issue over the past four years," he said. "In contrast to the rigorous police investigation of those in the media who are accused of being involved in the unlawful trade in information, little, if anything, seems to have been done to investigate those in other sectors, such as law and insurance. In addition, nothing seems to have been done for the potential victims."Vaz has repeatedly asked the agency to release the list publicly. But the police – within the agency and the Metropolitan force – have refused to comply with his request because they say to do so could prejudice active investigations. Five of the companies named on the list are at the centre of an investigation into computer hacking and other breaches of privacy laws by the Met police's Operation Tuleta, investigating phone hacking at News International. Another four are being investigated in separate Met police inquiries.Vaz agreed that none of these companies would be named, but the police still claimed their investigations could be prejudiced.In a meeting, Graham urged Vaz not to publish while he carried out a criminal investigation into whether the firms had broken privacy laws. Graham was handed Soca's list after pressure from the home affairs select committee on the agency.Vaz said on Thursday that he had agreed that Graham would carry out a two-week scoping exercise to identify the key issues and report back to the committee."The information commissioner has given the committee an explicit commitment that he will pursue this matter to its appropriate end and that the victims will receive justice," Vaz said. "He firmly agrees with the committee that these organisations and individuals need to act within the law."We are pleased that these matters are now subject to a thorough investigation, albeit one delayed for several years."He said MPs would consider what steps to take next after Graham reported back to the committee.Vaz spoke after the Crown Prosecution Service announced that another journalist, Ben O'Driscoll, the former deputy news editor of the Sun, was to be charged. O'Driscoll faces a charge of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office for allegedly authorising payments of £5,000 to public officials, including police officers and employees of Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital, in exchange for information. He is the 14th Sun journalist to be charged.
