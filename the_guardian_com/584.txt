Police are investigating an alleged death threat sent to George Galloway at the Houses of Parliament. It is claimed that the letter included a mystery substance and a threat that the Respect party MP would "die from a deadly virus".According to a source, it was linked to his strident views on the Israeli-Gazan conflict and stamped with a postmark from Austria. Scotland Yard said counter-terrorism officers were called to investigate a letter, which was "being treated as malicious communications".The delivery of the letter came after an alleged violent attack on Galloway on a street in west London over which a man has been charged with religiously aggravated assault.The source said that he believed the letter was intercepted in the parliamentary post room. "There was a package, everything is scanned and, presumably, they picked something up and opened the package." He said the mail room was cleared and the police called.On Monday night, the pro-Palestine MP for Bradford West was speaking at a no campaign rally before the referendum on Scottish independence.He claimed to have been told that evening that he was "going to face a bullet" after being heckled by protesters at the event at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.He had earlier been interviewed by West Yorkshire police after a speech in Leeds in which he claimed Bradford was an Israel-free zone.Galloway tweeted: "The workers in the post room in parliament were the ones endangered and I'm grateful to them and metpoliceuk." On Tuesday evening, he added his belief that the letter was with "forensics".A Met police spokesman said: "Officers from the Palace of Westminster contacted the Met's counter-terrorism command on Monday 15 September following the receipt of a letter intended for a member of the House of Commons. This letter is being treated as malicious communications."No arrests have been made. Inquiries are ongoing."
