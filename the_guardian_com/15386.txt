There is a well-known saying: "Any fool can criticise, and fools usually do." My criticism of Securing the Future (pdf), Lord Carter of Coles' review of prisons, published yesterday, is not so much of its content but of what it failed to include.The acute disappointment was heightened by a sentence in Jack Straw's introductory statement to parliament, in which he said: "But there is no doubt that the prison population will continue to rise over the next few years," explaining that that would be due to "the increasing effectiveness of the system in bringing more offenders to justice". I doubt it.What I find particularly sad about it is that, after all the build-up to the report and the encouragement to wait to see what it says before asking yet more questions about the rising population and the corresponding rise in the reconviction of ex-prisoners, yet again the government appears to be accepting untested recommendations.What is more, the Ministry of Justice has announced the building of three vast new prisons, at enormous cost, before any of the practicalities of such a proposal have been discussed and thought through with those who might have a contributory view.That is precisely what happened to Carter's last report on penal issues, Managing Offenders, Reducing Crime. This resulted in the monster bureaucracy that is the National Offender Management Service (NOMS), consisting of 1,647 officials at a cost of Â£2.6bn. Just think what could have been done with, and for, offenders if those people and those billions had been deployed to improve facilities and programmes in prisons.What has not been included?Of course, I do not know whether Carter was told not to include the following suggested scenario or whether he chose not to do so. But I take it that his starting point was the immense cost, both economic and social, or the rising prison population and how it may be accommodated in the future.The first question that needs to be answered must surely be: accepting that prison has to be used for violent, serious, persistent and dangerous offenders (again, Jack Straw's own words), how many people, currently in prison, do not come into that category?Once you remove all children under 18 (who should be in children's accommodation), all those suffering from acute mental disorder, all those whose tariff has expired and who are not deemed dangerous, all women on short sentences who are not deemed dangerous, all asylum seekers and immigration detainees, all those who have been on remand for more than 110 days (the Scottish rule) and all those who choose not to accept bail because that carries with it the cancellation of benefits, you achieve a dramatic reduction.That is not to say that other solutions for these people must not be found; but expensive prison is not the right answer.My second question would be about how many prisoners there are in each region of the country, by type: women, children, young offenders, remanded or un-sentenced, short sentenced, long sentenced, life sentenced, sex offenders, and so on. This would tell me just how many prison places, of what type, are required in each part of the country, armed with which I would know how many of what type of establishment I needed, and where.Instead of saying that I needed N number of places in England and Wales, I would know precisely how many additional places I needed for young offenders in, say, the north-west, which would add precision to planning.Related to this question, I was very glad to see that Carter recommended that the government should produce "an operational specification for each category of prison which adequately reflects the characteristics of individual prisons". By that, I take him to mean what facilities each type of prisoner, and so prison, requires.But I would go further than that because, unless someone is made responsible and accountable for directing and overseeing the consistent provision of those specifications, in every prison of each type, nothing will happen, as has been proved over the years. Armed with those people, you could plan to provide the right numbers of prison places, for each type of prisoner, in each region.To ensure that offenders were properly managed, with the aim of protecting the public by helping them to lead useful and law-abiding lives, you would need a tier of governance in each region to ensure that all the resources of that region were deployed to help the Offender Management System achieve its aim. Regional managers of prisons and probation should sit alongside each other, with responsibility for planning not just this provision, but also all movement of offenders within that region. This would ensure that they only went where they needed to go to, at the right time.They would also have responsibilities within the "rigorous and effective framework of community penalties" that Jack Straw said should be in each region to cater for those whose offence or risk does not warrant imprisonment, or who have a community part of a sentence to complete. This should be appropriate for the particular region, bringing in employers, drug treatment agencies, education and voluntary sector organisations, to emphasise and ensure regional ownership of a regional problem.Had this kind of survey been carried out after Carter's 2003 report, he would not have needed to produce another in 2007. The government blew the opportunity to study all these key issues in detail then; I hope it will not do so again. To accept Carter at face value, when he is answering the wrong question, based as it is on a questionable assumption, would be to risk delaying a properly grounded strategy for yet more years. After all, the regional groupings of prisons were first recommended by Lord Woolf as long ago as 1991. By continuing to fly in the face of proven and received logic, in the way that other operational institutions such as businesses, schools, hospitals and the armed forces, to name but four, are run, suggests that both the government and the Prison Service are determined to remain on the wrong track.People say there are no votes in prisons. Of course there aren't, because they are inanimate objects. But that is not the point: the votes should be about prisoners, with people asking their MPs why prisons continue to fail to protect them because of the disgraceful proportion of those who come out and are reconvicted.No one has the magic bullet with which to resolve this. But more of the same unnecessary, expensive incarceration, whether in old, small or new monster prisons, will only produce more of the same failure. Surely it is time for the public to say enough is enough and demand a different approach based on what works.
