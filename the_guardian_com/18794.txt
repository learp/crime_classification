Two men today admitted plotting to firebomb the home of the publisher of a controversial novel about the prophet Muhammad.Ali Beheshti, 41, and Abrar Mirza, 23, pleaded guilty at Croydon crown court to conspiracy to recklessly damage property and endanger life.The pair were arrested after an arson attack on a four-storey townhouse in Lonsdale Square, Islington, north London, on 27 September last year.The building, the home and office of Gibson Square publisher Martin Rynja, suffered minor fire damage after fuel was poured through the letterbox.At the time of the attack, Rynja was preparing to release The Jewel of Medina in Britain. The novel, by first-time American author Sherry Jones, focused on Muhammad and the life of Aisha, his child bride.Mrs Justice Rafferty said a charge of arson with intent to endanger life against both men would remain on file. A separate charge accusing Beheshti of possessing an illegal pepper spray weapon would also remain on file.Beheshti, unemployed, of Ilford, Essex, and mobile phone salesman Mirza, of Walthamstow, east London, were remanded in custody. They will be sentenced later.The publication of The Jewel of Medina was cancelled by one major publisher in the United States over fears it could offend Muslims.The book was withdrawn in Serbia after protests from local Islamic leaders, but was subsequently returned to bookshelves.Speaking last October, Rynja said the novel was not offensive and added he felt its publication was part of a liberal democracy.A third man, minicab driver Abbas Taj, 30, of Forest Gate, east London, will go on trial next Tuesday.He faces charges of conspiracy to damage property with intent to endanger life and arson. He denies the allegations.The trial, in which Rynja will appear as a witness, is expected to last two weeks.
