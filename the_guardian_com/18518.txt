The Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland has confirmed that it is investigating how police handled the Liam Adams paedophile inquiry including any role his brother Gerry Adams may have played in the scandal.The independent watchdog, which has the power to re-open old police inquiries, said it had received a complaint from three members of the Democratic Unionist Party about the original criminal investigation.Gerry Adams has denied he did anything wrong. He is accused of withholding evidence about the rape and sexual abuse of his nice Aine, Liam's daughter.Liam Adams was convicted last week of raping and sexually abusing his daughter in the 1970s.His brother, the Sinn Féin president, said he first learned about the abuse allegations from Aine in 1987. He is accused of failing to act on the information his niece gave him. It has been established Gerry Adams continued to have contact with his brother for many years after he learned of the sexual abuse allegations.John Larkin, Northern Ireland's attorney general, is also to review a decision not to prosecute Gerry Adams for allegedly withholding information on his brother.It has also emerged that the current director of public prosecutions in Northern Ireland, Barra McGrory QC, was Gerry Adams's solicitor in 2007 at a time when the Sinn Féin leader was still allegedly holding back information on his niece's allegations about his brother Liam.A PPS spokesperson said: "I can confirm that he [McGrory] was Mr Adams's solicitor in 2007."She added: "As Mr McGrory is now the director of public prosecutions, it would not be appropriate for him to comment on any communication he had with a former client."On his appointment [as DPP] Mr McGrory drew attention to [the Adams case] and a number of other cases in which he was involved."
