"He was seen to make a Nazi salute," while placing his fingers across his lips.

He said, through his lawyer, that he was "deeply embarrassed" and "deeply remorseful" about what he had done.Fining him £2,500 plus £85 costs, district judge Sonia Sims told him: "This type of conduct tarnishes the whole ethos of the Games."

He was told that he would serve 28 days in prison if he failed to pay the fine.Undercover police were at the basketball arena after complaints about the behaviour of Lithuanian fans in their previous match against Argentina on Sunday.
