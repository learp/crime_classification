Police are hunting an elderly letter writer responsible for sending more than 50 racially abusive letters to people across the country, including the prime minister.The letters, some sexually explicit in content, have been sent to schools, hospitals, mosques, universities, doctors' surgeries and private individuals, leaving some recipients "extremely distressed".According to Hampshire police, which is heading the investigation, the letters are all pro-English in content and racially inflammatory, with many appearing to have been sent in response to Daily Mail articles. All the letters are offensive and racist against a wide variety of nationalities and cultures.Detective Inspector Donna Goff said nearly all the letters were postmarked Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, and had been sent to addresses across England and Scotland during the past two years.Similarities between the letters made it likely they had come from the same author. "The cursive script used in some of the letters indicates that it may be the writing of an older person. Repeat phrases used also indicate this, especially reference to 'working for 50 years' and regular reference to pensions."The letters regularly express anti-BBC views and accuse the corporation of racial bias, with the Scottish parliament and system also a regular target for abuse.Commonly used phrases in the text include "English parliament", "Exit Europe", "repatriation" and "BBC shutdown".Clippings from the Daily Mail have been included in many envelopes, which often also include cartoon drawings."We are hoping that someone will recognise the handwriting, or the particularly distinctive style of illustration used in many of the letters," Goff said.One of the letters was sent to Gordon Brown's constituency office in Fife in April. The most recent was posted to a private address in Havant, Hampshire, in July.Goff said police had taken hundreds of statements, and hundreds of articles had been examined for fingerprints and DNA.Various forces had already started their own investigations into the letters but Hampshire police has now taken control of the inquiry, codenamed Operation Heron. Officers in Hampshire have been liaising with colleagues in Fife, Strathclyde, Lothian & Borders, Derbyshire, Merseyside, Lincolnshire and Bedfordshire, and the investigation is being assisted by the National Domestic Extremism Team.An appeal for help from the public will be shown on tonight's Crimewatch programme on BBC1.
