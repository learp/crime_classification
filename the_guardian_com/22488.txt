Police are scanning CCTV footage from Northampton city centre hoping to capture images of a BMW and a Fiat Punto believed to have been used in a series of rapes and attempted abductions over nine days.Women in the town are being warned not to go out alone at night until the gang has been caught. Police have put up posters in shops, bars and restaurants.Police believe that three or more men, described as black with South African accents, are prowling the centre looking for young women as they pour out of nightclubs and bars. Between July 31 and August 8, three women were raped and two others managed to escape. All but one of the attacks took place within the square mile which houses many of the city's nightclubs and late-night fast food restaurants.A short walk away is a dual carriageway with a shopping complex, nightclubs and a taxi rank where many revellers look for their ride home.In three of the attacks a BMW and Fiat Punto were seen either alone or together in the early hours of the morning. Detectives are telling women to plan their journeys home, stay in groups and avoid talking to strangers.Alarm has been heightened by the fact that two of the attacks happened within 45 minutes.The first attack was between 12.30am and 1am on Sunday July 31, when an 18-year-old was approached by a man in his 30s outside Domino's Pizza on Horseshoe Street, part of the dual carriageway. He put his arms around her waist and neck and marched her to Marefair, where he raped her in a secluded area next to a church.The next night at 12.45am a 15-year-old girl was dragged into a white or silver Fiat Punto by two men on Doddridge Street, but escaped.At 1.30am the same night an 18-year-old was approached on Horsemarket by a man in a BMW with a Fiat Punto parked behind it.While she was distracted, a man got out of the Punto, came up behind her and pushed her into the BMW. She was driven a short distance, the man from the Punto got out, and she was then taken to Duston, where she was raped.On Wednesday August 3 between 1.30am and 1.50am a 25-year-old was approached by a man in a BMW on Cheyne Walk about one mile away, but she ran way as he grabbed her.On Monday August 8 a woman with head injuries was found on Exeter Place shortly before 3am. She had been raped after being hit over the head.Detective Chief Inspector John Jones said: "We don't want to make no go areas and we don't want to stop females going out and enjoying themselves, but obviously we need them to be even more vigilant and exercise common sense about where they go and how they get there."While Northampton has its fair share of pub brawls and late night fights - security guards patrol even the pizza takeaway - such serious crimes have left people shocked and scared."It is making people worried," said Louise Robinson, 20, who goes out in the area about once a month. "It is usually good fun but until the police have caught these men I am not going out again."My little sister, who is 14, is now being picked up by my dad wherever she goes."Alice Weston, 21, who regularly goes to one of the clubs that offer free drinks for a £9 or £10 entrance fee said she was not surprised that women were being targeted."It is not a nice place, you just have to look around to see that, but this is where all the bars are," she said. "Girls always go off on their own, it's what happens on Friday nights and there are blokes in their cars trying it on."Another woman, who only gave her name as Andrea, said binge drinking was creating easy targets."People are just throwing themselves into the road, they don't know what they are doing and no one will help them. The police are around but these girls are easy targets."Girls as young as 13 are among the crowds enjoying Northampton's nightlife at the weekend, and 16-year-old students Mandy Hoult and Keri Robinson admit they often find themselves parted from their friends."It is not the girls' fault, these things just happen and you can't help it," said Keri."My dad is picking me up as much as possible, but I do know that I have to make sure that I am not left alone any more."
