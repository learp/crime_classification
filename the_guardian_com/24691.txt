Britain's longest-serving prisoner, John Straffen, who was sentenced to hang more than half a century ago, has died in prison. Straffen, aged 77, was convicted of murdering a schoolgirl in 1952 and admitted killing two others, but his death sentence was commuted because he was "feeble-minded". The Ministry of Justice said last night that Straffen had died in Frankland prison, County Durham, yesterday after an illness. He was believed to be on a list of around 20 prisoners, which includes the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, who were never to be released.Straffen, who was born in Borden in Hampshire and lived briefly in India, where his father was posted in the armed forces, was living in Bath at the time of the murders and was known to police as a petty thief.Arrested in 1951 for the murders of nine-year-old Cicely Batstone and six-year-old Brenda Goddard, he was found unfit to plead because of his mental incapacity and sent to Broadmoor high-security hospital. He admitted strangling both girls and had threatened to kill a third. He escaped for four hours, during which he was alleged to have murdered Linda Bowyer, aged five. Straffen was convicted of her murder at Winchester in July 1952 and sentenced to death. His case was reopened in 2001 after it was claimed that he was not fit to stand trial. He admitted killing Cicely and Brenda, but always denied murdering Linda Bowyer.
