Eleven crimes are reported every minute in England and Wales and four people are arrested each minute, according to a first ever 'snapshot' of the criminal justice system on a single day.On the chosen day, May 1 this year, more than 16,500 crimes were reported in England and Wales, of which 3,372 were in London. The survey, commissioned by the Metropolitan police, was released yesterday as a curtain-raiser for a conference on crime next week. The Met said a second purpose was to highlight the volume of offences and the number of people who come into contact with the system, and the resulting pressure on the system. "The statistics revealed by the snapshot demonstrate the sheer size of the task facing today's criminal justice system," said the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens. The figures were compiled by the Met with statistics from every police force in England and Wales, the crown prosecution service, crown courts and magistrates courts, the prison service, the national probation service, custodial support services which transport prisoners to court, victim support and witness support services. The Home Office minister, Lord Falconer, said: "The snapshot illustrates the sheer volume and complexity of the day to day workload of the criminal justice system ... "However, we must remember that these are not national crime statistics and represent nothing more than a snapshot of a single, untypical day and an untypical location, when London was full of demonstrators." Sir John said the May Day demonstrations had produced so few crimes and arrests - 54 arrests and seven reported crimes - that they were statistically insignificant.
