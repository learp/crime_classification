Magistrates allowed a senior police officer accused of murder to keep his freedom after he broke his bail conditions in spite of a judge's warning that he would be returned to prison, it was revealed today.Judge John Bevan QC told Garry Weddell, 47, he would go "straight back into custody" if he breached any of his bail conditions, according to transcripts published today.Three months later, magistrates ruled that Weddell had broken the agreement but allowed him to remain free.Detectives believe Weddell, an inspector with the Metropolitan police, shot his mother-in-law dead and then killed himself. The bodies of Weddell and his widowed mother-in-law, Traute Maxfield, 70, were found on January 12.The Judicial Communications Office published transcripts of five court hearings following an outcry over Weddell's release.Weddell's wife, Sandra, 44, a London-born nurse, was found strangled at their family home in Lancot Avenue, Dunstable, Bedfordshire, on January 31 last year. Six months later, Weddell was charged with her murder. He was due to stand trial at Luton crown court in May.Bevan twice refused Weddell bail before releasing him on July 27 after the policeman's barrister brother put up a Â£200,000 bond.At the first hearing before at Luton crown court on July 3, counsel for the crown argued that Weddell could abscond or interfere with witnesses. The prosecutor also said there were fears that Weddell could harm himself. When he was interviewed by police, Weddell was found with the cable from a TV aerial hidden in his sock and told officers: "I just wanted to go to sleep", the court heard. On deciding to release Weddell at a subsequent hearing Bevan told him: "It is a very borderline decision that I have granted you bail at all and you understand that if you breach any of these conditions, then you will be straight back into custody."He said the prosecution had a "circumstantial case of reasonable strength" but Weddell was "undoubtedly a professional man with strong roots".On November 2, Weddell was brought before Woking magistrates court after allegedly speaking to a prosecution witness he was banned from contacting - his children's guardian - and going to a pub in Bedfordshire when he was prohibited from entering the county.The magistrates found that the second breach was proved, but allowed him to remain on bail because it was "so minor", the transcripts show.Police believe Weddell shot Maxfield, a retired carer, at her home in Gustard Wood, Hertfordshire, and then committed suicide at Broomhills shooting club, about 10 miles away in Markyate.An inquest into the deaths of Weddell, his wife and Maxfield was opened by the Bedford and Luton coroner, David Morris, on Tuesday. A full hearing will be held in Dunstable on March 18.
