A Sikh spiritual leader has denied "totally absurd" claims that he sexually abused a man who years later attacked him with an axe at a prayer service.Sirisat Guru Uday Singh said he had never even visited a village in the Punjab where his attacker alleges he was sexually assaulted as a child.A jury heard on Tuesday that the Indian-based guru suffered a broken arm last August at the hands of Harjit Singh Toor, who has admitted wounding but denies attempted murder.The crown alleges that the pre-dawn attack at a packed temple in Linden Street, Leicester, was motivated by religious hatred. But Toor, 27, of Oadby, Leicestershire, claims he was abused by the guru – who had yet to be elevated to holy status – in India in 1994 and 1995.Giving evidence via a videolink to Birmingham crown court, the religious leader rejected claims that he abused Toor at the Indian headquarters of the Namdhari branch of Sikhism.Answering questions from Toor's barrister, Francis Laird, the holy man repeatedly denied having visited a property where the sexual abuse is alleged to have taken place.Asked if he had visited one of Toor's relatives' homes in the Punjab in 1994 and again in the following year, the guru told the jury: "I have never been to their house. I have never met him [Toor] as far as my memory goes. I have not met him and there is no question of any events happening – I have never visited that particular village at all."Asked by Gordon Aspden, prosecuting, if there was a word of truth in the allegations, the Namdhari leader told the court: "Absolutely none, it's totally absurd."During almost an hour of evidence, the axe attack victim told the court he had been made aware that Toor was the nephew of a man he had known since at least the 1980s.Recalling the moment his right arm was broken in the early hours of 11 August, the guru said of Toor: "He removed his shawl or blanket and suddenly he came out with the axe. My sudden reaction was to lift my right arm and move slowly backwards. I felt a lot of pain. There was excruciating pain in the arm and I was dazed by the attack. It was so sudden."The trial, which is expected to last for a week, has been told that the guru was injured just hours after arriving in the UK and being taken to the temple in a vintage Rolls-Royce.
