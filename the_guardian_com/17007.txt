Lawyers for great train robber Ronnie Biggs launched a high court legal bid today to win his release on compassionate grounds.Biggs, who was 75 yesterday - 41 years to the day since the £2.6m raid on the Glasgow to London mail train - has suffered two strokes and his solicitors said he has facial paralysis that has left him unable to speak or eat.They are asking for a judicial review of his detention at Belmarsh prison in south-east London."I have to believe that sense will prevail and that my father will be released or sent to a lesser category prison," Biggs's son said. "I regard my father as a political prisoner in Britain nowadays because unfortunately it is a sad fact that terrorists and paedophiles are getting better treatment.""He can hardly walk, read or write. He cannot eat, speak or drink. He gets his food by an electronic pump. My father is a man is in very poor health," he told Sky news.Biggs was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment for his part in the raid on the Glasgow to London mail train on August 8 1963, when the 15-strong gang made off with £2.6m in used bank notes. He fled Britain after escaping from Wandsworth prison in a furniture van after just 15 months in jail. He underwent plastic surgery to change his appearance and fled to Spain, Australia, and then to Brazil. Biggs spent 36 years on the run but surrendered himself back into custody in 2001. He has now served three years at Belmarsh, where he has 24-hour nursing care. Manchester-based Tranters solicitors are challenging the Prison Service's refusal to transfer or release him as a violation of prison service orders and the Human Rights Act. "Belmarsh is a centre of medical excellence where we can provide 24-hour care. At a lower category prison there would not be this specialist round-the-clock care," a spokesman for the prison service said.
