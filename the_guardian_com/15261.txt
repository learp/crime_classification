A disqualified driver who killed two women and left a third seriously injured while he had twice the alcohol limit and traces of drugs in his system was jailed for eight years at Ipswich crown court yesterday. Emma Harold, 26, and Kate Wasyluk, 25, were killed instantly while Harold's sister Rebecca, who was also hit by the car, was left with injuries that mean she has to use a wheelchair. Scott Nicholls, 20, of Cawston, Norfolk, pleaded guilty to causing the deaths when his car mounted the pavement and hit them as they were walking home from a night out in Ipswich, Suffolk.
