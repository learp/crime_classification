Sussex police may be investigated over the murder of a young woman who was stabbed to death in a seaside resort hours after being visited by officers. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) last night confirmed it was assessing police involvement in the case of Cassandra Hasonvic, 24, who was killed in her home in Bognor Regis yesterday.Her husband, Hajrudin Hasonvic, 32, of Eastney, Hampshire, has been charged with her murder and was due to appear before magistrates in Chichester today. Sussex police said the case has been referred to the IPCC, as officers had visited her earlier on the day she died. A spokesman for the force said: "Because Mrs Hasanovic had been visited by police earlier that day, her death has been referred to the IPCC in line with the provisions of the Police Reform Act."This requires mandatory referral where a death occurs following recent contact with the police." Yesterday a senior investigator from the IPCC was sent to Bognor Regis to interview officers involved in the original inquiry.An IPCC spokesman said last night: "We are not looking into the murder itself but police contact with the victim before the incident. It appears to be a domestic related incident and we have deployed a senior investigator and expect to take a decision soon."The commission will decide today whether to launch an inquiry into how police handled the case.A second woman was also involved in the attack but is not thought to have been seriously injured. The incident follows the murder in June of Aresema Dawit, 15, who was stabbed to death in a south London lift five weeks after Southwark police launched an investigation into complaints that she was being stalked and had received death threats.Thomas Nugusse, 21, of Ilford, Essex, has been charged with her murder.
