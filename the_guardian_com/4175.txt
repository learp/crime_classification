One of James Bulger's killers is reported to have been released from jail for a second time. Jon Venables, 31, was freed after being locked up in 2010 for downloading images of child abuse, the Sun said.He had previously served eight years for murdering the two-year-old in Liverpool in 1993.James's mother, Denise Fergus, told the newspaper Venables is "a danger to the public". "He lies for his own sick ends," she said."I have been told that the terms of his parole mean that he must not enter the county of Merseyside."But the Probation Service didn't monitor him properly last time so I have no faith in their ability to do that now. They should've kept him locked up for a long time."Venables was just 10 when he and his friend, Robert Thompson, tortured and murdered James after abducting him from a shopping centre in Bootle.He was reportedly granted parole in July with officials putting the finishing touches to his new identity, which has reportedly cost £250,000.James's father, Ralph, believes Venables will commit more crime, a friend said. "He hasn't put a time on it but he is convinced he will reoffend," she said.She added that James's family were given scant information about Venables's release and Bulger was told via his lawyer. "As ever they are kept in the dark. They don't explain the terms of his release, I don't know whether they are going to."But I don't think Venables can enter Merseyside, however – that was one of the conditions which he repeatedly broke before."A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: "We do not comment on individual offenders."The re-release of life licensed offenders is directed by the independent Parole Board once they are satisfied they can be safely managed in the community."Their life licence lasts for the rest of their lives, and they may be recalled to prison at any time for breaching their licence conditions."Additionally, they will be subject to strict controls and restrictions for as long as their risk requires them."
