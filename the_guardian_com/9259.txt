Much has been made of the rural Pakistani and Muslim background of nine Asian men imprisoned for their involved in a paedophile ring based in Rochdale.It is said the men justified the abuse because these were girls of the decadent west, and therefore unworthy of respect. This is deeply hurtful to Muslims. Islam, they argue, is the cure for such behaviour, not a reason for it. Yet this too is a variation of "decadent west, unworthy of respect". It doesn't help.No cultural formula entirely insulates any human society from misogyny. Misogynists always appropriate the fragments of their own background that are useful to them in order to fuel and rationalise their hatred.A mass of factors made these girls vulnerable: family breakdown, intergenerational deprivation, an over-sexualised culture, fear of playing into the hands of racists, inadequate social services and much more. However, it is ridiculous to suggest that perverted interpretations of Islamic ideas could not be on this list. No creed is beyond the reach of those who wish to use it to justify their own repressive or evil thoughts and deeds. It would be nice if all right-thinking people of any faith, or none, could at least agree on that.
