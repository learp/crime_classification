So I thought that being a writer and having no assets, savings, investments, or pension schemes meant that I was blissfully exempt from the credit crunch. I've been smug, gleefully poring over newspaper articles profiling bankers trading in their Jaguars for bus passes.Then, the week before Christmas, my flat was burgled. I came home from an afternoon of shopping with a bag of overpriced biscuits from Whole Foods to find my desk empty, and my most prized possession - my MacBook Pro - missing. My boyfriend's laptop was gone too, as were those of the two house guests who'd had the misfortune to land on our doorstep the night before. Nothing else was disturbed; our doors and windows were all shut tight.Gone are my notes for my second book, my embarrassing collection of 80s music, and the photograph of my parents holding hands on a junk boat off the coast of Vietnam. All irretrievable, though having contents insurance would have taken some of the pain away. Of course, I didn't have that either.I've spent the last two weeks phoning friends and shamelessly begging for sympathy. One was burgled last year, right around this time. My downstairs neighbour was broken into last New Year's Eve. There's a comforting feeling of solidarity when exchanging these stories, but a strange pattern begins to emerge.The police officer who comes to write the report says that burglaries have gone up dramatically since the onset of the financial crisis. The Home Office has predicted a 10% increase in "acquisitive" crimes, including shoplifting, burglary and vehicle theft. Could it be those bankers, turning to organised crime? Or perhaps many more people are willing to buy a suspiciously cheap item from a dodgy-looking person in a pub. The police officer is also a sociologist. "These people are not like you and me," he says. "They don't feel bad. They're probably having a laugh somewhere. They're smug, they are." I vow to smirk no more, for I too am now a victim of the credit crunch.
