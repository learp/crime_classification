The notion that victims of crime are strong supporters of jail as the best approach to deterring petty criminals is challenged today with a poll showing that almost two-thirds believe that prison does not stop them reoffending.The unique ICM poll of crime victims shows that a clear majority believe that making offenders carry out unpaid work in the community is a better alternative to a short prison sentence.The survey, commissioned by Victim Support and the thinktank Smart Justice, shows that the overwhelming majority of crime victims believe that the best ways to curb non-violent crime are to provide more activities for young people, ensure they are better supervised by their parents, and provide more treatment for drug and mental health problems.The ICM poll asked crime victims about the best ways of curbing non-violent crimes such as shoplifting, car theft and vandalism. It found that more than half of victims (53%) did not feel the criminal justice system takes account of their needs.Peter Dunn, Victim Support's head of research, said: "Victims are often assumed to be vengeful towards offenders and favour harsh punishments."This is misleading. Most victims, while feeling angry about what has happened to them, want the offender to stop offending both against them and against other people."He said the research showed that many victims were interested in constructive work being done with offenders to tackle the causes of crime.Lucie Russell, of Smart Justice, said the poll was the first of crime victims, and it was clear they did not believe that prison produced law-abiding citizens: "The survey proves that victims don't want retribution; they want a system that protects the next victim."The survey showed that 61% of crime victims did not believe that prison reduced reoffending for non-violent criminals. There was far more support for making offenders work in the community with 54% believing this would be more effective. A majority (51%) also favoured meetings between offenders and victims.Only 28% of crime victims believed that prison was a suitable place to deal with drug addicted offenders. When asked about long-term solutions, 72% said they wanted to see more drug treatment programmes in the community, and 66% wanted to see better provision for treating people with mental health problems. The results come as a book on criminal justice warns that government plans to develop the National Offender Management Service, integrating the prison and probation services will backfire.The authors say the plan would lead to a fragmented probation service that would have little impact on cutting reoffending rates.Mike Hough of King's College London law school, one of the book's editors, said: "The government is trying to move too far, too fast. They should concentrate on 'joining up' probation and prison work and avoid getting distracted by high-risk plans for structural reform."Â· ICM interviewed a random sample of 982 adult victims of crime between December 19 2005 and January 7 2006.
