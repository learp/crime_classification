An army staff sergeant who killed a police officer when he pulled on the handbrake of a patrol car in which he was being carried to police cells was told yesterday that he faces an "inevitable" jail sentence.Steven Graham, 39, a communications instructor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, pleaded guilty at Newcastle crown court to the manslaughter of PC Joe Carroll in a 70mph crash on the A69 near Hexham, Northumberland.PC Carroll, 46, described as a "real old-fashioned copper" by Mike Craik, Northumberland's chief constable, died from severe injuries as he ferried Graham from Hexham to a police station in Newcastle in the early hours of April 13.Graham had pleaded guilty to manslaughter of the officer and not guilty to another charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against Inspector Brian English, who was also travelling in the car.At a previous hearing before magistrates in Bedlington, Northumberland, prosecuting solicitor Geoff Mason said that as PC Carroll was driving, Graham had leant forward and grabbed the handbrake, sending the car out of control.Mr Mason said Graham had been arrested after drinking and becoming involved in a domestic incident. "It's perfectly apparent that what he was seeking to achieve was to stop the car and escape from police custody," he said.In court yesterday, Graham's barrister Richard Bloomfield asked for psychiatric reports to be prepared, explaining that his client had suffered trauma during his army career."During the course of his career he was in the frontline artillery in the first Gulf war," he said. "He served in Bosnia and Kosovo and served two terms in Northern Ireland when hostilities were live there." He added that Graham's former girlfriend had told police that she was concerned the army was not providing enough assistance for the trauma he had suffered.PC Carroll's widow, Caroline, 46, said in a statement: "Joe Carroll, my vibrant and fun-loving husband, was killed because of a selfish act. Steven Graham was thoughtless and foolish. He did not think of the consequences of his actions."He now has time to contemplate the error of this. My hopes, dreams and plans for the future died with Joe. I am slowly re-forming my life."
