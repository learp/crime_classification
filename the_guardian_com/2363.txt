The home secretary, David Blunkett, today unveiled new powers to enable courts to place very young offenders in intensive foster care while they await trial.Under the new measures outlined in the criminal justice white paper, persistent young offenders aged 10 and 11, who are legally too young to be locked up, would be remanded in high supervision foster placements.The placements, which could provide round the clock specialist support, would allow the children to maintain contact with their family and schools.Chris Stanley, head of youth justice at the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders (Nacro), backed the plans. He said: "We support intensive fostering as long as it is used as an alternative to custodial remand and not extended to cover those who would otherwise be released on bail."The white paper also proposes extending drug treatment to young offenders as part of community sentences. A scheme to refer young people to substance misuse services even if they are not convicted or only cautioned would be piloted in 10 areas of England and Wales.It says young offenders sentenced for serious crimes would be released from custody halfway through their sentence and supervised in the community for the rest of the time.The date of release of all under 18s convicted for serious offences would also be decided by the parole board, which makes risk assessments on the release of prisoners.The government will explore the development of services for young people whose offending behaviour stems from a serious behavioural disorder.The youth justice board, which coordinates the youth justice system, will publish best practice guidance for dealing with young offenders early next year, as part of a system to monitor the performance of the 154 youth offending teams in England and Wales.Courts in 10 areas of the country have already received new powers to enable them to lock up persistent young offenders while they await trial.
