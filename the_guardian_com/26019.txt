Judges at the appeal court upheld the conviction of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in Britain, saying an attempt to overturn it was "without merit".The 28-year-old club hostess went to the gallows in 1955 for killing her lover, the racing driver David Blakely, as he emerged from the Magdala pub in Hampstead, north London.The three senior judges said that Ellis was properly convicted of murder according to the laws at the time of her trial.Michael Mansfield QC, appearing for her sister, Muriel Jakubait, asked judges to quash the murder conviction and substitute a verdict of manslaughter on the grounds of provocation or diminished responsibility.He said the trial judge, Sir Cecil Havers, had made a "substantial error" in withdrawing the defence of provocation from the jury, which took just 14 minutes to convict Ellis of murder, and claimed she was suffering "battered woman syndrome".The appeal court heard in September that Ellis had a miscarriage 10 days before the shooting after Blakely, the father, punched her in the stomach.But the judges ruled that the defence of diminished responsibility was not available at that time and for provocation to succeed it had to be proved that Ellis was subjected to an immediate affront and all her normal self-control had been lost.Lord Justice Kay, giving the ruling of the court, said: "If her crime were committed today, we think it likely that there would have been an issue of diminished responsibility for the jury to decide. But we are in no position to judge what the jury's response to such an issue might be."Two years after Ellis's execution - and largely prompted by her case - parliament changed the law to allow a defence of diminished responsibility.Mrs Jakubait said after the ruling: "The whole thing seems very unfair and I am never going to give up over this until I am taken from this earth."Ruth always said she hoped the truth would come out one day and now, more than 50 years later, I hope to do something about all the lies that have been written about her."Lord Justice Kay also criticised the case's referral to the appeal court by the Criminal Cases Review Commission."We have to question whether this exercise of considering an appeal so long after the event, when Mrs Ellis herself had consciously and deliberately chosen not to appeal at the time, is a sensible use of the limited resources of the court of appeal."
