The widow of the murdered headteacher Philip Lawrence is supporting his killer's appeal against a transfer from an open to a closed prison.Frances Lawrence has accused the home secretary, John Reid, of being "cruel" in his decision to move Learco Chindamo from Ford open prison to a more secure, category B prison.The transfer of Chindamo, who has an Italian father and a Filipino mother, followed a decision by the Home Office in May to move foreign prisoners from open to secure institutions.Chindamo, who was found guilty of Mr Lawrence's murder in October 1996 and was sentenced to life imprisonment, has been given leave by the high court to appeal against his prison transfer.Mrs Lawrence, whose husband was stabbed to death outside St George's Roman Catholic school in London in 1995, said in an interview in the Times today that she backed his appeal.She said: "It feels peculiar but I am on the side of Learco Chindamo, my husband's killer."I don't really want to think of it as taking his side, but I feel that there has been an injustice and the government has created that injustice. They shouldn't be allowed to get away with it."Mrs Lawrence said the decision by the Home Office to move foreign prisoners to secure prisons was a "knee jerk" reaction to the publicity it received over failing to consider more than 1,000 foreign prisoners for deportation before they reached the end of their sentence.She said: "It's unusual to care about him [Chindamo], but if anything is to come out of this he has to be rehabilitated. I fear that his move could have hindered his rehabilitation."Mrs Lawrence said she felt so strongly about his transfer that she is considering resigning from the Philip Lawrence awards - a scheme, sponsored by the Home Office, that recognises citizenship achievements of young people aged 11 to 20.When Chindamo received his life sentence, at the Old Bailey, he was told he had to serve a minimum 12 years before he could be considered for parole. The earliest date he can be released is 2008.
