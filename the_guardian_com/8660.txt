The jury in the Dale Cregan murders trial has retired to consider its verdicts.Cregan, 29, previously admitted he murdered four people and attempted to murder three others. In the second week of his trial in February he changed his pleas to guilty to killing police officers Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, and last month he admitted to taking the lives of father and son David Short, 46, and Mark Short, 23.He also changed his pleas to guilty to attempting to murder three other men as he gunned down Mark Short in the Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden, Greater Manchester, last May, but continued to deny one remaining count of attempted murder.Nine other men are on trial at Preston crown court and face allegations concerning the deaths of either David or Mark Short.
