The son of the former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin was today jailed for five years for his role in a north London gang attack last year.Faisal Wangita was part of a 40-strong gang that attacked 18-year-old Somalian Mahir Osman in Camden.Mr Osman died within a minute of being stabbed 20 times, attacked with baseball bats, bottles and hammers, and punched and kicked.Reporting restrictions shielding 25-year-old Wangita's identity were put in place over concerns that his parentage could prejudice the outcome of his trial.The restrictions were lifted after sentencing today, and the Old Bailey was told by his lawyer that he was Amin's son - also the first time police were made aware of his true identity.Wangita claimed he was born in November 1981, but a document showed his date of birth as February 1983.His papers said he was born in Uganda, but he told police he had been born in Saudi Arabia. He had stayed at a number of addresses in London after arriving in the capital some time ago.The attack on Mr Osman, which happened in January last year, was captured on CCTV cameras and played to the jury. Wangita had joined in the attack, kicking the victim while he was on the ground, and blood was found on his trousers.Eight defendants were convicted of various offences. In May, three youths were given life sentences for murder, but Wangita was cleared of that charge.He was jailed for five years for conspiracy to wound with intent and violent disorder after the court heard he was a "serious risk to the public".Wangita had previous criminal convictions for possessing an offensive weapon and fraud in November 2000, and for threatening behaviour in May 2002, for which he was given a community rehabilitation order.He also had convictions for theft and for having an offensive weapon in 2006.David Spens QC said Wangita's previous convictions "don't establish any pattern of committing any offences of violence".However, Judge Stephen Kramer said Wangita was "seen on the video to take part". He added: "You were seen to raise your left leg or foot and bring it down in the area of Mahir Osman on the ground in the road."Amin ruled Uganda as a brutal dictator for eight years during the 70s. It is estimated that up to 500,000 people disappeared during his regime. He died in 2003, aged 78.The Amin family fled Uganda when Tanzanian-backed Ugandan rebels ousted him in 1979. They lived in exile in Saudi Arabia, where many remain.
