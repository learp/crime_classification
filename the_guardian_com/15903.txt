Seventeen patients at Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport were poisoned by saline solution contaminated with the diabetes drug insulin, Greater Manchester police have said. Three died – Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Alfred Derek Weaver, 83 – but 14 recovered.All had been unlawfully administered insulin, the force said. A further 16 patients have been eliminated from the inquiry and nine other cases are still under review.Last month, a nurse, Rebecca Leighton, was released after charges against her were dropped. Detectives said they were looking at about 40 potential victims. This number has now been reduced. A criminal profiler has been brought in by the force to help identify the poisoner. The forensic clinical psychologist is helping detectives draw up the likely background of the saboteur.Leighton, 27, from Heaviley, Stockport, spoke of her horror at being portrayed as an "angel of death" and "killer nurse" by the media. She said she was passionate about her job and wanted to return to a normal life.The Nursing and Midwifery Council allowed her to return to work, subject to conditions, after allegations that she had stolen opiate-based drugs from the hospital.The alarm was raised at the hospital on 12 July when a higher than normal number of patients were reported to have unexplained low blood sugar levels.
