A gang of thieves proved they were as light-fingered as they were light-footed when they stole thousands of pounds' worth of family jewellery after distracting a shop owner with a display of traditional dancing.The 12-strong troupe, who claimed to be Spanish but who police believe are Romanian, put on displays in two stores in Nelson, Lancashire, but as the dancing was taking place their accomplices were plundering nearby living quarters.The 10 women and two men targeted a newsagent's, where they stole Â£1,800 worth of jewellery. They also struck at the Gilani Food Store, where Sayeeda Fatima, 59, was looking after the shop. Initially she was glad to have so many customers and believed they were tourists. The family, who have run the shop for 20 years, discovered the theft later.Salma Kalsoon, 35, the owner's daughter, said her mother was devastated by the theft. "They were here for 20 or 30 minutes, and all of them were asking her for stuff and buying bits of things that she had to take her eye off them to get," she said."Then they started saying they were Spanish and dancing, saying this was how they danced in their country. She didn't suspect anything. She was just talking to them, thinking they were guests to the area and glad she had so many customers."Mrs Kalsoon said her family only noticed after the gang had left that thousands of pounds' worth of family jewellery was missing."It's breaking our hearts because that jewellery was part of dowries, and it has a lot of sentimental value on top of what it's worth in money," she said.Sergeant Louise Darcy, of Lancashire police, appealed for anyone with information about the gang to come forward.
