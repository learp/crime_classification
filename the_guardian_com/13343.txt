A convicted sex attacker raped and murdered a popular A-level student after lying in wait for her, a court heard yesterday. Viktors Dembovskis attacked Jeshma Raithatha three days before her 18th birthday as she made her way home from school on May 16 last year. He wrestled her into bushes at knifepoint close to her home in Greenford, west London, raped her and stabbed her in the heart. Four days later, Mr Dembovskis fled to Latvia.An Old Bailey jury heard how Mr Dembovskis, 43, had previous convictions, in 1990 and 1999, for raping two women at knifepoint in Latvia. Details of those offences were revealed by the prosecution to show that he had a "propensity" to sexually assault women.Prosecutor Jonathan Laidlaw told the court that Mr Dembovskis had spent the morning drinking before hiding in bushes, allowing him to watch the path to his victim's home."The manner in which she disappeared and the condition of her body after it was found point to her murder having occurred in the most horrific and brutal of circumstances," he told the court."The defendant had planned his attack with some care. He had chosen a quiet shortcut and took up a position that gave him a view both up and down the road. It also gave him access to heavy undergrowth ... No one saw her taken from the road, but from there she was led into the cleared area within the undergrowth. She was led into the clear area of the den."There the defendant removed some of her clothing before he strangled her. Jeshma was powerless to resist and she managed only to scratch the defendant before she lost consciousness."When she was unconscious but not dead, he raped Jeshma. When the sexual attack was over - it was plainly the reason for the abduction - the defendant stabbed Jeshma."Mr Dembovskis was extradited from Latvia to stand trial. He denies rape and murder.The trial continues.
