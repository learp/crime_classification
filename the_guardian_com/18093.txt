A police officer pleaded guilty to a misconduct charge today following an independent inquiry into the fatal stabbing of a mother of three.PC Charlotte Hall admitted breaching the police code of conduct by failing to perform her duties "diligently and conscientiously" when she was called to the home of Colette Lynch two days before she was killed by her estranged partner.PC Hall, 30, and PC Theresa Cottingham, who denies misconduct, are both appearing before a disciplinary hearing in Rugby, Warwickshire.Expected to last for up to five days, the hearing represents the first use by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) of powers allowing it to order forces to hold such hearings in public.The move follows an IPCC investigation last year which concluded that Ms Lynch, 24, a mother-of-three, was "grievously ill-served by a succession of officers, staff and their supervisors" who failed to ask questions, listen properly or follow policies in relation to domestic violence.In what the inquiry called a "tragedy unfolding in slow motion" Ms Lynch was stabbed to death by her estranged partner Percy Wright on February 3, 2005, two days after she reported an incident in which he had come to her home, smashed the front room window and threatened to cut her throat.The inquiry found that despite repeated calls to police from Ms Lynch and her family, police failed to record the initial incident as a crime and did not arrest Wright at that time.Wright, 35, from Rugby, was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and sent to a secure psychiatric unit under the Mental Health Act.In February John Crawley, the IPCC's commissioner, said there was compelling public interest in the case. He said: "The statutory purpose of holding a discipline hearing in public is to maintain confidence in the police complaints and conduct system.A spokesman for Warwickshire police said the force believed that the IPCC's decision was unnecessary.
