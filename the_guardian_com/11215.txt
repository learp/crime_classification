A judge rugby-tackled a sex offender to prevent him escaping from court, the Old Bailey has heard.Judge Douglas Marks Moore wrestled Paul Reid twice as he ran out of the judge's door at Woolwich crown court in August.Reid, 34, who had escaped from another court two years before, made for the door after giving evidence in his trial, jurors heard."One thing stood between Paul Reid and freedom – the judge trying his case," said Rupert Gregory, prosecuting.The main door of the court was locked for security reasons but the doors leading to the judge's corridor and the jury room were unlocked on safety grounds.It was about 4.15pm and Reid had been giving evidence from the witness box during his trial on undisclosed matters.Gregory said: "The jury were just leaving when the defendant jumped up and ran across the clerk's bench to get to the judge's door."As he went through the door, His Honour Judge Marks Moore grabbed him round the throat to try to bring him down."Together they went down three steps and then Reid broke free and ran down the judge's corridor."The judge gave chase. Just as Reid was about to open a push-handle fire door, Marks Moore rugby-tackled him around the throat and waist and brought him crashing to the ground, landing on top of him."He held him there, struggling and protesting, until the prison officers managed to catch up, secure him and return him to custody."Gregory added: "There is only one reason why a crown court judge would rugby-tackle a defendant to the ground – because he is trying to escape and the judge is the only person in any position to prevent that escape."The only thing preventing Paul Reid from pushing that fire door to the outside world was a judge in a wig and full robes."Reid, originally from south London, denies escaping from Inner London crown court and attempting to escape from Woolwich crown court.Gregory told the jury: "The defendant was on both occasions properly in custody."He had no right to leave. Nobody told him he was free to leave either courtroom through any exit other than the door to the dock."In December 2008, Reid had been given an indeterminate sentence for public protection with a minimum term of two years for indecent assault at Inner London crown court.He was taken to Brixton prison but returned to the same court 10 days later for an ancillary matter.After the hearing, he left the dock handcuffed to a security officer, but as they entered a corridor, Reid allegedly pinned the officer against a wall and elbowed him.He managed to slip the handcuff off his wrist and ran through a door into a courtroom, through another door and out of a fire escape, said Gregory.Three months later, he was interviewed by police and told them the judge had told him he could go home."Of course the judge did nothing of the sort. That's why he left the dock handcuffed to an officer, heading towards the cells, not the front door," said Gregory.The trial continues.
