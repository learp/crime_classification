A former prison officer who had a baby by an inmate has been jailed for 30 months after admitting misconduct in public office.Kelly-Anne McDade, 31, gave birth to a baby boy in February from the relationship with Nelson Delgado, described as a "dangerous offender", at Aylesbury young offenders institution in Buckinghamshire.McDade, of Aylesbury, tried to smuggle three mobile phones into the separate institution where 21-year-old Delgado was sent after their affair came to light.The judge, Christopher Tyrer, called her behaviour "disgraceful" as he passed sentence at Aylesbury crown court.McDade had been employed at the institution for three years when she started the sexual relationship with Delgado last year.Her resignation came after she was caught on CCTV opening his cell door on 10 August 2008 after all doors had been closed for the night.Nigel Ogborne, prosecuting, told the court that her pregnancy had already become obvious to other staff. "She was asked by the prison authorities about the pregnancy and she indicated that it was as a result of a relationship on a foreign holiday." When the prison governor found out Delgado was the father, he said the relationship "could have caused a massive breach of security", Ogborne said.Richard Germain, defending McDade, told the court: "There is no doubt it was an inappropriate relationship, but Ms McDade would say, 'You can't help who you fall in love with'."She fell in love with this serving prisoner, who was nearly 10 years her junior."He said the case was "unique". "At some point in the future, she and Mr Delgado hope to set up home together and bring up the child together."McDade tried sending three mobile telephones concealed in a stereo in March this year so she could contact Delgado at Swinfen Hall young offenders institution in Staffordshire after the birth.When her home was searched, police found a mobile phone with a message from Delgado, whom she visits regularly, reading: "I love you my wife."They discovered cannabis, which she admitted possessing.McDade was sentenced to 18 months in prison for trying to smuggle the phones, to be followed by another year for misconduct in public office. The judge imposed a concurrent one-month sentence for the drugs offence.
