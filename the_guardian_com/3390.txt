 A British man was held by Spanish police tonight after a four-year manhunt. James Tomkins, 61, was arrested in Marbella by officers working on behalf of the Metropolitan police. He is wanted in connection with the murder of 24-year-old Rocky Dawson in Hornchurch, Essex, in 2006. He is also wanted for possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.Tomkins disappeared after Dawson was murdered outside his parents' home in May 2006. The victim was putting his two children into his car when a gunman drove past and opened fire. He died in his mother's arms after staggering indoors.Tomkins is suspected of driving the stolen Land Rover used in the shooting and helping to destroy evidence. Contract killer Christopher Pearman, of Waltham Abbey, Essex, was jailed for life in January 2007 after pleading guilty to the murder of Dawson. Police could not provide a motive for the killing.A Metropolitan police spokesman said Tomkins will appear in a court in Madrid on Friday when extradition proceedings will begin.
