The gang behind the largest robbery ever carried out in Britain was motivated by greed "almost beyond the dreams of avarice", an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.It involved the kidnap of a family, armed death threats, an inside man and the skilful use of professional prosthetics that allowed a gang to escape with £53m taken from the Securitas depot in Tonbridge, Kent, in February last year, the court was told. More than £30m has yet to be recovered.The prosecuting counsel, Sir John Nutting QC, told the jury: "You may think that there are few things more terrifying than the invasion of home or workplace at the dead of night, by men dressed entirely in black, whose faces and heads are covered by masks with slits for eyes and mouths, brandishing deadly weapons and shouting that you will die if you do not do as you are told."Seven men and one woman appeared in the dock charged with offences including conspiracy to commit kidnap and robbery and the handling of stolen goods in connection with the theft.The court heard that five others, including two men in custody abroad, are expected to face a separate trial next year, and one man believed to have played a major part is still being sought.Although none of the 14 Securitas staff at the depot when the robbers arrived was seriously injured, "the mental scars and the psychological effects still persist" for many of them, the court was told.GunpointThe robbery began on the evening of February 21, 2006, when the manager of the depot, Colin Dixon, was stopped on the way to his Herne Bay home by two men dressed as police officers. He was taken at gunpoint to the isolated Elderden Farm in Staplehurst, which was owned by car salesman John Fowler, said Sir John.He was interrogated at gunpoint about the depot's security arrangements.Meanwhile, other men dressed as policemen arrived at the Dixon family home in Herne Bay, where they told Mrs Dixon her husband had been in a traffic accident and they would take her to hospital to see him. She was told to bring their child by those "whom she believed to be kindly policemen". Once in the car, however, one of the "policemen" produced a gun and she was taken to the same farm where her husband was being held."There is nothing courageous about kidnapping women and small children," said Sir John.The robbers had another weapon in their arsenal: an inside man in the shape of Ermir Hysenaj, a 28-year-old Albanian, who had recently started work at Securitas, the court heard.The final part of the plot was the application of the sort of prosthetics used in film and theatre to change someone's appearance. With the use of latex, silicone and false hair it was possible to make the kidnappers unrecognisable. Michelle Hogg, 32, a hairdresser, had trained in the application of prosthetics, the jury heard, and helped the men disguise themselves.At the depot, the Securitas staff were handcuffed at gunpoint and the money was driven off in a seven-tonne lorry.Sir John told the court the motive was "greed pure and simple; the lure of large sums of cash which would have permitted them to enjoy, for some time at least, if not for life, circumstances of luxury, ease and idleness". While some of the defendants were better off than others, all were "motivated by the prospect of dishonest gain almost beyond the dreams of avarice".The jury was shown photos of all the defendants on screens as their alleged roles were outlined: Lea Rusha, 35, a roofer, from nearby Tunbridge Wells, was at the heart of the conspiracies, said Sir John, and linked to two caches where a total of £10m of the money was recovered. Plans of the depot and weapons were recovered at his home, the jury heard.Stuart Royle, 48, a car salesman from Maidstone, allegedly helped provide vehicles. Jetmir Bucpapa, 26, an Albanian from Tonbridge, was the said to be the link to the "inside man", Emir Hysenaj, 28, from Crowborough, East Sussex. Bucpapa also allegedly helped with reconnaissance. Roger Coutts, 30, a garage owner from Welling, was allegedly linked to the plot. John Fowler, 59, from Staplehurst, allegedly allowed his farm to be used to hold the kidnap victims and as a "flop" where the spoils were divided up.Keith Borer, 53, a signwriter from Maidstone, charged only with handling stolen goods, is said to have helped with changing the identity of the van used in the kidnap of Mrs Dixon and her child.Michelle Hogg, 32, from Woolwich, admits applying the prosthetic masks but denies knowing what their intended use was, the court heard. The case, which is likely to last four months, continues.
