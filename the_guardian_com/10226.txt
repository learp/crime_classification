Sex offenders released from prison will be compelled to take lie detector tests as part of their probation conditions, the Ministry of Justice said yesterday.A three-year pilot project will start in the Midlands this week. Between 350 and 450 offenders are expected to be tested over the next three years; any who refuse face being sent back to jail.Professor Don Grubin, who will conduct the tests, said: "It is part of a package aimed at preventing new sex offences. Disclosures made during polygraph examinations, as well as conclusions drawn from passed or failed examinations, let probation officers and the police intervene to reduce risk."
