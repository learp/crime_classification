The home secretary, Jack Straw, today outlined legislation that will make it easier for the police to seize cash and goods acquired through criminal activity by putting in place a scheme for recovering that money through civil proceedings rather than the criminal courts.The "Proceeds of Crime" bill would establish a Criminal Assets Recovery Agency (CARA) which would have powers to investigate and remove assets such as cash and cars that it suspects have been acquired illegally. The proposals would give financial investigators greater powers than they have now, allowing them to take property at the start of a criminal investigation to avoid it being hidden or spent. Civil liberties campaigners have questioned the legislation, saying money and property should not be confiscated before someone has been proven guilty. Police chiefs have supplied the names of 39 alleged crime bosses who have assets of more than £200m between them and they want to follow the lead of the US, which raises millions of dollars every year by auctioning seized assets.Mr Straw said: "Criminals are motivated by money and profit, and the fact that in many cases they appear to be 'untouchable', damages public confidence in the criminal justice system. "Through a range of new measures, including civil recovery and taxation, we will target those individuals that benefit from crime, crippling their criminal enterprises and stripping them of the means to commit further offences. "By removing the assets offenders have accumulated through criminality, we will deter others from following suit and send out a clear message to the public that nobody is beyond the reach of the law."If the bill goes ahead, the director of CARA will also be able to carry out tax functions - for example income tax, capital gains, corporation and inheritance taxes - for individuals, companies and partnerships if he has reasonable grounds to suspect that the money was derived from crime. Mr Straw announced money for CARA last July, setting aside a total of £54m for the programme over the next three years. Part of that budget will pay for the training and accreditation of financial investigators inside law enforcement and government.Related articles 18.02.2001: £1bn in cash taken out of UK for drugs 09.02.2001: Police dig for Brink's-Mat gold after underworld tipoff Useful links Home Office Police federation Law society
