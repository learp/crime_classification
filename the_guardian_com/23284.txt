The mother of the Moors murder victim Keith Bennett has revealed she may have just months to find out where her son is buried because she has been diagnosed with cancer.Keith Bennett, 12, was snatched by Ian Brady and his accomplice Myra Hindley in 1964 as he was making his way to his grandmother's house in Longsight, near Manchester.Keith's mother Winnie Johnson, 77, has made a DVD appealing directly to Brady after cancer was found in her womb.In the appeal, shown on ITV1's Daybreak, she pleads with Brady to reveal the location of her son's body, saying this is her "last chance".In 1987 Brady and Hindley finally admitted killing Keith, as well as 16-year-old Pauline Reade.Both Moors murderers were taken back to Saddleworth moor that year to help police find the remains of the missing victims but only Pauline's body was found.A privately funded search for Keith's grave on Saddleworth moor was launched last year but his remains have yet to be discovered.Police abandoned the hunt in 2009 and the investigation is now classed as "dormant", with only a major scientific breakthrough or significant piece of fresh evidence able to prompt a new search.
