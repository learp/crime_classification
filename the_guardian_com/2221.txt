Closed circuit TV clips may hold the key to the unprovoked murder on a London bus of a young man who had lost a friend in the terror bombings of July 7.Detectives are studying images of stops along the route of the No 43 service between Upper Street, Islington, and Holloway Road, north London, where 28-year-old Richard Whelan collapsed with six stab wounds after trying to stop another passenger from throwing chips at his girlfriend.He died just three weeks after consoling the family of 22-year-old Ciaran Cassidy, a victim of the Russell Square tube bomb.Veronica Cassidy, Ciaran's mother, said: "Richard was here right from the moment Ciaran was missing and tried all he could for us - he was a real support and what has happened to him is tragic, especially after everything else."Detective Chief Inspector John Macdonald, leading the inquiry, said: "It was a totally unprovoked attack - the worst thing about it is that the couple could have been anyone, any one of us on a night out."Mr Whelan, who lived in Kentish Town, north London, initially ignored the man, in his 20s and wearing a hoodie, when he started throwing takeaway food at other passengers on the top deck. But, after most had moved downstairs, the man turned his attention to Mr Whelan's girlfriend. Mr Whelan stood up to protest and was stabbed.Mr Macdonald said: "There was another man on the upper deck who left during the course of the attack and we would like to speak to him urgently. We don't know if he fully appreciated the severity of the attack."The killer, who calmly walked off the bus as his victim tried to pursue him, had a three-inch Afro haircut and was just under 6ft tall, of medium build and was wearing a Puffa-style or leather jacket.Mr Macdonald said officers were also studying reports of a man acting suspiciously just off Holloway Road 40 minutes after the attack, which happened at around 10pm on Friday."There's a lot of CCTV footage that has been collected from before and after the incident," he said. "We are looking at all of that at the moment - everything that was on the bus and from the surrounding area."Mr Whelan's girlfriend, who has not been named, also tried to restrain the man. Mr Macdonald said: "She and Mr Whelan's family are devastated. They were all very close and all lived in London."
