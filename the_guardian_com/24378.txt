The two millionth DNA profile is about to be listed on the national crime database, David Blunkett announced yesterday - the 100th anniversary of the birth of George Orwell.The home secretary said the five-year-old database was well on the way to its target of holding 3m profiles of people charged with offences by 2004. In a speech on the importance of technology to 21st century policing, given to the Police Foundation in London last night, Mr Blunkett said forces also had 5.5m sets of fingerprints: "The DNA and fingerprint databases have become vital weapons in law enforcement, making our communities safer by helping to put thousands of repeat criminals behind bars."Every week our national DNA database matches over 1,000 DNA profiles taken from crime scenes with names on the database. Around 42% of those matches are turned into detections within an average of 14 days. That is a huge achievement."He added that new methods of scanning fingerprints electronically from hands or objects meant information could be checked against the database within minutes. He also defended the criminal justice bill's provisions to let police take DNA samples from anyone who is arrested. Liberty, the human rights group, said the government was trying to create a DNA database by stealth. Spokesman Gareth Crossman said: "It claims that only criminals will be listed, yet it is passing legislation through parliament so DNA samples will be retained indefinitely for anyone who is ever arrested, whether guilty or innocent. "We are led to believe that DNA evidence is foolproof, yet Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys [the DNA database inventor] has warned that it is unsafe to use it to secure a conviction." Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four warned of the dangers of a totalitarian surveillance state. Alan Travis
