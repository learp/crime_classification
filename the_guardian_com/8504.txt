For most of his 30-year police career, almost all of it spent with the Metropolitan police, Bob Quick was widely known as the sort of officer for whom the phrase "a safe pair of hands" could have been invented.But in a matter of months his reputation has been badly undermined by a pair of misjudgments, one seemingly brought on by anger and frustration, the other by sheer, casual carelessness.At the end of last year, already under severe pressure following the decision to arrest the Conservative immigration spokesman, Damien Green, for allegedly leaking government documents, Quick was seemingly caught off-guard by a Mail on Sunday story about a luxury car hire business run by his wife.The assistant commissioner angrily told a reporter the story put his family at risk and suggested the Conservatives might have played a role in the revelation, a claim he was swiftly, and humiliatingly, obliged to recant.Then yesterday, a photographer captured Quick carrying a sensitive briefing note, clearly marked "secret" and detailing a counterterrorism operation, into Downing Street. Others have been caught out before by the long lens trained on documents – last year papers carried by the housing minister, Caroline Flint, let slip a forecast of ever-lower house prices – but the repercussions here were particularly severe.Police had to hurriedly carry out a series of daylight raids around north-west England in connection with an alleged al-Qaida plot. A big investigation, the first led by Quick since he took over the top counterterrorism job in March last year, was over.Such a blunder would prove fatal for most police careers anyway, and Quick's position was further undermined by an impression that he had lost the support of the Met's leadership. With the Tories calling for his head, and the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, refusing to publicly support him, the head of Scotland Yard's specialist operation wing saw no option but to quit.A 49-year-old father of five, Quick joined the Met in 1978, becoming a detective in Brixton, south London, four years later. Rising through the ranks and holding a series of commands, he remained popular with fellow officers, with a reputation for decency and honesty, one reinforced when in 2000 he was picked to head the force's anti-corruption command.As a commander, in 2002 Quick led the police operation when a gunman barricaded himself and a hostage into a flat in Hackney, east London. He won praise for his patient approach in what became the city's longest such siege, lasting 15 days.Quick, who has an MBA from Exeter University and a criminology diploma from Cambridge, then spent five years with Surrey police, first as deputy chief constable and then, from November 2004, in the force's top job, which he left to become the Met's assistant commissioner for specialist operations, in charge of anti-terrorism.
