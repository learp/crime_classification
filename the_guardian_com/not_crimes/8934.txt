They said it was the most stolen image, more so than 007. Any other unusual accolades like that?  Guardian contributor TamzinOuthwaite 13 April 2016 2:00pmI used to be seeded number three in trampolining in Redbridge. And in all-girls doubles, tennis, me and my partner were seeded number two. Only for a year, mind, but it's still quite an accolade. I was told by the army advisors that we used on Red Cap that over the two year period it was shown, figures of women joining shot up. When it was on, I used to get lots of fan mail, people saying: you're the reason I joined the army.Updatedat 2.03pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.00pm BST14:00ID5279263 asks:Do you expect the work to dry up as you get older?

Guardian contributor TamzinOuthwaite 13 April 2016 1:57pmFrom working on Hotel Babylon I learned little things, like asking for an extra pillow means asking for a prostitute.

I distinctly remember wearing pedal pushers'HarperValleyPTA asks:You have performed a lot of challenging roles. How did you get your EastEnders role?  Guardian contributor TamzinOuthwaite 13 April 2016 1:53pmI went to a workshop at Elstree, which Julia Crampsie had invited me to, and there were 20 boys and 20 girls. I distinctly remember wearing pedal pushers. The boys were up for the character that Jack Ryder got, and the girls were up for Mel. I remember very clearly that I was a little late, and I have a phobia of being late. I rushed in, and thought, oh I've messed this up. We did a workshop for what felt like six hours, and a couple of days later I was at Tottenham Court Road station from an audition for something. It was in the days of the pager, and there were lots of payphones - my pager said "call your agent". The producer Matthew wanted to speak to me, he gave me the number to call. I got enough change in case it was a long call. I remember shaking, phoning him. It was a conference call, with Julie and Matthew, and he said where are you? Are you prepared for your life to change? That's what I remember.It was just a three month contract though; if they renewed it, great. And three months turned into three and a half years. Instead of getting a bus, I hailed a taxi - that was a sign of victory, as I could now afford it. I went straight round to my friend's house in Islington, and said: you're not going to believe it!Updatedat 1.56pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.53pm BST13:53HailsUK asks:Would you rather be in the same play for a year or do a different play every month?   Guardian contributor TamzinOuthwaite 13 April 2016 1:48pmThe idea of doing a different character every month is great - like in the old-school rep companies, where you'd cross over in different productions all the time: a musical, a comedy... it doesn't happen really any more. I worked at the Stephen Joseph theatre with Alan Ayckbourn, but that was luck with him recasting me, not being part of a rep company. Those companies kept you on your toes.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.51pm BST13:51  All Saints in concert, April 2016.

What’s your favourite song from the new album?  Guardian contributor TamzinOuthwaite 13 April 2016 1:47pmI am good friends with the band. I met Nicole in 1998, we've been friends ever since. I love their new album, I think it's probably up there with my favourites of theirs, and my favourite song is Who Hurt Who, One Strike, and Pieces. I was a massive fan before I met them, we all walked around in Maharishi pants and tried to dress like them. And then, I think Shaznay is an amazing writer, and all of them - they all write and sing brilliantly and they look amazing, what's not to like? Their songs are all really catchy - some are really down and dirty with heavy bass, and some are really good pop songs.Updatedat 1.52pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.50pm BST13:50Denloved asks:I thought that when you began in EastEnders you were a breath of fresh air to the cast.

After all, it’s in the blood, right?  Guardian contributor TamzinOuthwaite 13 April 2016 1:43pmAs far as I know, most Italians were in the ice-cream business. My friend Annalisa Rossi is from the Rossi ice-cream family; Daniela Nardini, I think they were an ice-cream family. Peter Capaldi, he's from an ice-cream family - although I might be wrong there. They all seem to be in catering and mainly ice-cream. There's always been a side of me that likes to cook and serve food - maybe I'll open up my own cafe with an ice-cream section.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.47pm BST13:4725aubrey asks:What and who gives you the biggest belly laughs? I just watched Young Frankenstein on DVD and it’s still hilarious after all these years.What movie tickles your funny bones?  Guardian contributor TamzinOuthwaite 13 April 2016 1:41pmThere are certain characters that will always tickle me. John Cleese in Fawlty Towers, Alan Partridge in absolutely everything. They're just iconic characters. David Brent might be in there for me. I could watch The Trip and The Thick of It on a loop. More mainstream, I love Modern Family, I think Phil is a classic character. It's the most complete sitcom we have in 30 minutes, so it's rounded off and is feelgood. I love Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton, the majority of stuff they do - Inside No 9, I've done an episode of it, and it was very hard to get through without laughing. They're so clever.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.40pm BST13:40'People come up with storylines for me: "I'm sure you owe Phil 30 grand for bail"!'  Tamzin Outhwaite in Red Cap. Photograph: Giles Keyte/BBCPaddy01 asks:I always enjoyed Redcap and would have liked another series. Perhaps you could make a guest appearance in the next series of Our Girl?I thought New Tricks could have continued though. I didn’t think a major cast change would work, but the new team realy gelled and I was realy enjoying the series again.  Guardian contributor TamzinOuthwaite 13 April 2016 1:38pmI loved making Red Cap. I did weapon training with the army and slept on a very crispy mattress for a week. So I often feel like my fighting, weapon, and army skills could be used in another program... I hate to think it's all gone to waste. I would love to see Red Cap on DVD, I have so many people asking about it, but it hasn't happened yet.We all feel like we could have continued New Tricks, but there's a lovely element to it that we leave people wanting more. Which is very similar to Red Cap, I just did two series of that of two series of New Tricks. I often think a New Tricks Christmas special would be a good idea. I do daydream of dormant storylines... what storyline could I go back to EastEnders on when there's no family members there? People come up with storylines for me - "go back with your teenage son to find Ian Beale", "I'm sure you own 30 grand to Phil for bail!"Updatedat 1.43pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.38pm BST13:38SackDacrenow asks:Is it true that Woody Allen gives actors very little direction? And if so, isn’t that disappointing for actors who get the chance to work with him?  Guardian contributor TamzinOuthwaite 13 April 2016 1:33pmI only worked for a few days with Woody Allen, and I was very much in awe of him. He would watch what we did, and then talk about the scene afterwards. There definitely wasn't an abundance of direction - but I loved his passion for food which he talked about quite a lot.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.37pm BST13:37Iain Sharp asks:Are you still scuba diving and where’s your best war /cold water dive sites?  Guardian contributor TamzinOuthwaite 13 April 2016 1:31pmI haven't scuba dived since my children were born, seven years ago. I specifically learned for the dolphin show with the BBC, but after I learned I chose my holiday destinations based on scuba diving - until my children came along and holidays changed for good. I'm keen to revist them asap, although I might need a refresher course... my favourite sites were the Indian Ocean - anywhere around the Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles, all have the most vibrant underwater life. The biggest disappointment was the Great Barrier Reef, where it seemed a lot of the coral has died, and visibility was poor. I had been spoiled in the Indian Ocean by then, though. But I do think it's one of the most peaceful places to be - it's making me want to go now!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.36pm BST13:36modhabobo asks:How often is the phrase “Oh Tamzin, I loved the song Sleeping Satellite!” said to you, and how do you tell them that you’re not Tasmin Archer?
