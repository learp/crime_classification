Why go now? This historic market town does the festive season well, particularly on the second Sunday in December, when it holds its Festival of Christmas (11 December, beverleyfestivalofchristmas.co.uk), now in its 21st year. Its Victorian market has 120 handicraft, gift and food stalls, stall-holders dress in period costume, and there are rides and entertainment in streets decked with holly and fairy lights.

A fun way to see the rest of the town, with its medieval gate and two marketplaces, is by following the Elwell Trail, 22 paintings of local life by artists Fred and Mary Elwell (nosivad.co.uk/painting-the-town). The bracing Westwood pastures offer good walking.

The less formal Potting Shed pub, new this summer, is rather barn-like but the pizzas and burgers are top-notch.

Most famous is the dark, rambling White Horse, known far and wide as Nellie’s, with benches probably as old as its gas lights. Real ale lovers rate the Chequers Micropub, and the revamped King’s Head has added a great cocktail station.Anywhere to stay under £100 a night?Cute spots like Number One Beverley and the Game Bird pub are sold out for the festival. The Tudor Rose (doubles from £85) is friendly, if in need of an update, and close to all the action.
