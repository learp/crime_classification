Traditionally the second-to-last episode of a Game of Thrones season is the one where something huge, tragic and unexpected happens. Episode nine saw Ned Stark’s beheading in season one, the Red Wedding in season three, and Daenerys riding off on her dragon in season five. In seasons two and four we had the Battle of Blackwater Bay and the Siege of the Wall – episodes entirely devoted to a battle. Based on those patterns and this week’s episode title “Battle of the Bastards” I would guess that the entire hour will be spent on Jon Snow and Sansa Stark’s foolish fight against Ramsay Bolton to take Winterfell.

Photograph: HBOSince people spend billions every year betting on fantasy sports, why shouldn’t we bet on a fantasy television show? Let’s take a look at who has the best chance of making it to season seven and who’s most likely to die.Knocking on death’s door      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Almost guaranteed to die? Ramsay Bolton. Photograph: HBOIt seems that Ramsay Bolton is almost guaranteed to die in the Battle of the Bastards because, hey, Jon Snow already died. If I had to guess, we’ll see Littlefinger and the Knights of the Vale swoop in and save the day just as Tywin Lannister’s troops did at Blackwater Bay and Stannis Baratheon’s did at The Wall. The biggest question is who is going to kill Ramsay, and how? Please let it be Sansa.Of course, some characters on the Stark side will bite it too, almost certainly someone we really like but who isn’t a central figure. My money is on Ser Davos Seaworth, Tormund or that giant. Melisandre isn’t a bad shout, but she’s been sidelined since resurrecting Jon Snow so her narrative usefulness may be at an end. And of course, Ramsay still has Rickon Stark in his dungeon; I have a sneaking suspicion he will suffer the same fate as his direwolf.Since we’re almost certain to spend episode nine in battle, we won’t even visit King’s Landing, so Cersei and Tommen probably won’t get a minute of screen time and certainly not their final farewell until episode 10. But in the finale, there is a good chance that both Tommen and Cersei will die. A popular fan theory has it that Cersei will blow up King’s Landing rather than face trial, now that her son has outlawed trial by combat. Most of this is based on prophecy.

Photograph: HBOFirst of all, Maggy the Frog told Cersei that all of her children would die before her, so Tommen seems doomed. In season two, Daenerys had a vision in which she walked through the throne room in the Red Keep after it appears to have been bombed, perhaps by Cersei. In episode five of this season, Bran Stark also had a vision of the Mad King’s wildfire stores under the city and King’s Landing being besieged by its green flame, so perhaps that is what will come to pass.If Cersei does blow up King’s Landing, look out for a whole host of casualties including the High Sparrow, Lancel Lannister and that mean lady who rings the shame bell.50:50 chance      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Is Sansa Stark a goner? Photograph: HBOWhile there have to be some losses on the Stark side, a shocking one would be Sansa, though it seems unfair for her to die after all she’s suffered. Also, if Jon hopes to keep the North he’ll need an official Stark heir at the head of the army.If and when Littlefinger shows up to the battle, his life could well be in danger. Once Sansa and Jon have his knights to help them win their war, there’s no need to keep him around – especially after the danger he put Sansa in. He’s angered so many people; this battle would be the perfect time to take him off the board. But Littlefinger is always crafty, so he could weasel his way out of it.Over in King’s Landing, it depends on how big Cersei’s bomb is and, indeed, whether or not it happens. It could take down Margaery Tyrell who is the queen, but I can also see her surviving so the Tyrell’s could try to seize the crown. Jaime Lannister, still at Riverrun when we last saw him, has a chance of getting caught up in it too. Some believe he’ll have to kill Cersei, just as he killed the Mad King to stop him from blowing up the city, and then will kill himself. With all the attention paid to Euron Greyjoy’s claim to the Salt Throne in the Iron Islands, we will inevitably see more of their story in the final episode. He may finally catch up to his niece and nephew Yara and Theon. If he does, they’re as good as dead – but I bet they make it to Meereen before he does and will be under Dany’s protection.Not a chance in the Seven Hells      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Is Daenerys Targaryen the safest person in the Seven Kingdoms? Photograph: HBOJon Snow is the safest person in all of Westeros. They wouldn’t have gone through all the drama of hiding his initial death just to kill him off a season later. Even if they did, who would believe it this time around?Arya Stark is also safe, since she’ll spend the final two episodes travelling back to Westeros. In fact, we might have seen the last of her until the beginning of next season, with her storyline at a natural end after leaving Braavos and little for her to accomplish until she returns home. I would love to see her come back to kill Walder Frey in the final episode though.Nothing will happen to Daenerys or Tyrion either. They both have a whole lot of story ahead of them as they make their way across the sea to conquer Westeros. Killing them now would be ludicrous. Then there are those who aren’t anywhere near the action: The Hound, Sam, Bronn and Olenna Tyrell. This could also include Brienne of Tarth and Podrick if they don’t make it back to Winterfell for the battle. But if there’s one really safe bet it’s on Jon Snow’s direwolf Ghost. They can’t possibly kill off another one of those pups.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  ‘A Song of Ice and Data’: students create death prediction software for Game of Thrones – video
