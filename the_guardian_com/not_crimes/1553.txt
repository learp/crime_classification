The heading of your review of the Globe Theatre’s Imogen, “Sex, drugs and gang war erupt…” (26 September), could just as well be a strapline for a number of Shakespeare’s plays, and while Cymbeline may not be a about a “drug-driven world”, many of his plots hinge on the use of drugs, potions and poisons. From the “love-in-idleness” (Viola tricolor) love potion in A Midsummer Night’s Dream to the “juice of cursed hebenon” (possibly henbane, active ingredient hyoscyamine) used to kill Hamlet’s father, to the aconite in the wolf’s bane with which Laertes tips his sword and the potassium cyanide administered to Claudius in his wine, to Friar Laurence’s catatonic potion (deadly nightshade or Atropa belladonna?) and the apothecary’s poison with which Romeo kills himself (potassium cyanide again?), to Cleopatra’s use of asp’s venom to induce respiratory failure to the weird sisters’ toxic brew of hemlock (Conium maculatum) compounded with slivers of Yew (Taxus baccata) capable of inducing cardiac arrest, while never drug-driven, Shakespeare’s violent world was never entirely drug-free.Austen LynchGarstang, Lancashire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
