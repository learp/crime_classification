Although hosted by the Academy, the institution responsible for the Oscars, the event itself more closely resembles the Golden Globes, despite the fact that the winners are pre-ordained.Emceed every year by two comedic actors (this year the duties fell to Jason Segel and Olivia Munn, who made for a spirited duo), the awards are doled out as honourees mingle over a boozy dinner in a Beverly Hills hotel large banquet hall. The key difference that separates it from the pack: this is the one event where talent gunning for Oscar glory get to take a night off.Of the awards, Segel and Munn had a ball honouring Michael John Keesling for the design and development of Image Shaker (an optical system that creates a replicable camera shake), by enacting the effect of the gadget by flailing around the stage.
