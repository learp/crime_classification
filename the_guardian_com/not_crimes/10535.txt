The first mission of the new Italian “Blue Helmet” force dedicated to defending cultural heritage was supposed to be in Palmyra, the ancient Syrian city whose monuments were destroyed by Islamic State.But when a 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck central Italy in August, killing 298 people and devastating the town of Amatrice, the 60 modern-day “monuments men” headed to the rubble, in territory far more familiar than what they were trained for.On Friday their work in Amatrice was completed. They leave having recovered 900 pieces of art such as altarpieces and other paintings from museums, chapels and shrines.Art experts fear serious earthquake damage to historic Italian buildings Fabrizio Parrulli, commander of the carabinieri cultural heritage protection department, said the pieces were being kept in Rieti, where they would be restored before returning home. Among the items recovered were a painting from 1700 depicting a local saint, San Giuseppe of Leonessa, rare reliquaries, a 19th-century silver-gilt tabernacle, terracotta stations of the cross and a wooden Madonna behind which locals would gather for processions. “My men are trained for all crisis situations. The people who have already lost everything, even in an earthquake, should not feel stripped of their memories, which often remain the only identifying elements of a community,” Parrulli told the Italian newspaper La Stampa.The “Blue Helmets of Culture” were established in February under a landmark agreement between Italy and the UN’s cultural organisation, Unesco, which created a rapid-response mechanism to deal with assaults on cultural heritage as part of the UN’s broader peacekeeping operations.Like the Monuments Men depicted in the George Clooney film who hunted for artworks looted by the Nazis during the second world war, the force comprises 30 civilian experts, – including historians, scholars, and restoration experts from Rome’s Central Institute of Restoration – and 30 members of the carabinieri art squad. According to Italian press reports, some of the team have previously served in areas devastated by war and natural disasters, including Afghanistan and Nepal.Among other duties, the Blue Helmets are being trained to transfer art and other pieces of cultural heritage to safe zones where possible, to prevent looting and illicit trafficking of stolen goods. The squad’s training centre was established in Turin.
