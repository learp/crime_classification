Here, for those of you who haven’t yet had your fill of weed jokes, sex jokes or the bountiful contours of Zac Efron’s chest, comes the trailer for a sequel, barrelling on to the internet and packed full of ribaldry. Neighbors 2 (titled Bad Neighbours 2 outside north America – for anyone confused by the continued absence of Karl Kennedy) is a reprise of the surprise hit of 2014. The original, written and directed by Nicholas Stoller, nabbed more than $150m at the box office by hiding a whip-smart script behind a cavalcade of behaviour that was gross and disreputable. Seth Rogen and Efron had a swordfight with dildos, Rose Byrne and Rogen had a great bit involving heavily swollen lactating breasts. That all sounds appalling in retrospect. It was funny at the time.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Watch the Bad Neighbours 2 trailerIn Bad Neighbours, Rogen and Byrne played Mac and Kelly, new parents battling the neighbouring frat house (lead by freewheeling party boy Teddy (Efron)). This time a sorority has moved in next door and is causing all kinds of ruckus. The law of sequels states that Mac, Kelly and Teddy must team up to tackle the new threat together. Chloë Grace Moretz and Selena Gomez lead the charge for the sorority sisters, while Dave Franco returns on the side of the dudes.The trailer drags up some old gags (the ejector-seat prank lost its spring a while back), but there’s some promise on show here, too. The spelling joke is strong and the prospect of Rogen beleaguered by bikini-clad teens while trying to maintain his dignity looks entertaining. Efron stand there and looks pretty. Neither film nor audience need ask of him anything more.
