Underwear scandals are common in SW19. Last year, it was the Canadian Eugenie Bouchard’s black bra strap; in 2014, retired men’s champion Pat Cash denounced pre-match underwear checks. And this year, it is Czech player Lucie Šafářová’s Nike tennis dress, which ballooned all game to expose her knickers.Few things unite Wimbledon crowds (sorry, Andy) like a perceived slight against the tournament’s strictures. But, more to the point: why did Nike design such an impractical dress for the female players it sponsors?This was, in fact, the second iteration of the £75 Premier Slam dress: Nike asked players to return it for alterations last week. Serena Williams and Sabine Lisicki have both reportedly refused to wear it. “I tried it on but didn’t feel comfortable showing that much,” Lisicki said. Poor 17-year old Katie Swan struggled with the dress during her defeat to Tímea Babos yesterday afternoon. Midway through, she tucked it into her shorts.“Nike probably has departments devoted to wearer trials,” says Sally Dixon, the founder of activewear brand Every Second Counts. “I’m very surprised.” She is sympathetic to Swan’s frustrated mid-match alteration. “Players don’t expect to have to redesign kit to make it fit for purpose.”Smash hit! Why tennis is having a fashion moment Notoriously, Wimbledon’s code is the most difficult on the grand slam circuit. Intimidating guidelines demand competitors “be dressed in suitable tennis attire that is almost entirely white” as soon as they “enter the court surround”. They are reminded that “white does not include off-white or cream”. In 2013, Roger Federer was scolded because his shoes had orange soles. Moreover, women must negotiate the dynamic between style, propriety and functionality: brands, keen to appeal to female consumers chasing the athleisure trend, are most interested in the first. And it is virtually mandated that women playing at the elite level wear (very) small skirts – although at least they permit movement. In the 1920s, the French champion Suzanne Lenglen wore a ballooning midiskirt to play at Wimbledon. Admittedly, she also drank Cognac on court.Wimbledon fashion through history - in pictures The obsession with outfits is surely a backhanded sexualisation of the women’s game. From Athena’s Tennis Girl poster to celebrated but undecorated pin-up Anna Kournikova, girls in tennis whites are fetishised, their bellowing grunts the subject of flip sexism. When commentators clocked Simona Halep’s breast reduction surgery, the British player Laura Robson was furious. ”You see what she can do with the ball,” she said at the time. “I don’t see how you can bring in boobs to the conversation.”Anyway, Nike’s “nightie” clearly won’t do. What should tennis kit look like? “Fitted, for an increased range of movement,” suggests Dixon. “It should be second skin. What you wear should be the last thing on your mind.” Never so at Wimbledon.
