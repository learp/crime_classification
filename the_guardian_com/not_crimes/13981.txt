Photograph: TwitterParker Bright protests in front of a work in New York’s Whitney Biennial, depicting murdered black teenager Emmett Till – the painting, by white artist Dan Schutz, has caused outrage. “Many in the black art community are upset by the work,” he said. “I wanted to confront people with a living, breathing black body.” Schutz countered: “I don’t know what it is like to be black in America, but I do know what it is like to be a mother. Emmett was Mamie Till’s only son.
