A decade ago, British civil servants were packed off on a training day about, in a then-fashionable phrase, future-proofing UK plc. The idea was to game the mid-century economy on a range of feasible assumptions, one of which concerned the oil price. There was an “expected case” for 2050 of $45 a barrel, a “best case” of $35 and a “worst case” of $55. So much for the bureaucratic imagination. Over the short years since, the price has twice been more than double the so-called worst case, and then twice also come skidding down by two-thirds.We are currently in the midst of a great oil collapse, with prices sinking to within touching distance of $30 on Tuesday afternoon, 73% down on 18 months ago. As with every climb up and every slip down the greasy price pole, analysts are scrambling around to figure out whether the change will endure. Nobody can know, but when financial sentiment swings, some always conclude that it will soon swing even harder. The RBS note for investors which this week unleashed a note of panic by advising them to “sell everything” mentioned the possibility of $16 a barrel, a number with little obvious basis apart from being half the current price.The Guardian view on the geopolitics of falling oil prices | Editorial But there are solid reasons why the world has now convinced itself that oil is worth much less than before. On one side of the ledger there is supply, not only of oil itself, but also of the other fossil fuels which can often substitute for it, notably gas, which is more abundant than anyone would have imagined a few years ago, courtesy of the fracking boom. On the demand side, things have been developing even more rapidly, with a serious slowdown in the resource-intensive emerging economies, above all debt-laden China. The fracking revolution will not be reversed, and it increasingly looks like the Chinese flu will be hard to shake. All of which suggests that low oil prices could be here for a while.So is this a good thing or not? The potentially profound geopolitical consequences are considered in today’s other editorial. Economically, the standard western assumption is that cheap oil is a boon. Certainly, price spikes have arrived shortly before recessions, as in 1973, 1979-80 and 1990. But cheap oil can be a consequence as well as a cause of economic weakness, as it was in 2008, when it became a mere symptom of the great recession. The best that can be said of cheap oil today is that the global slowdown would be sharper without it.What of the environmental effect? Here, although the story is complex, there is more reason for optimism. Start with the premise of the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign, that the only way to avoid catastrophic climate change is to leave the bulk of the world’s remaining fossil fuels where they are. Cheap oil encourages waste; worse, it discourages investment in a more efficient “energy infrastructure”. Renewables, as well as upgrades to clean up fossil fuel power stations, yield less return. Drivers feel less pressed to trade in their SUV for a G-Wiz, and car manufacturers are less inclined to concentrate R&D on fuel economy.But cheap oil also discourages investment in fossil fuel extraction. Already, this week has seen BP scale back its North Sea operation. Indeed, one reason why the Saudis are prepared to endure $30 a barrel is because they hope it will discourage American frackers from switching their focus from gas to oil, and making investments that – once the capital is sunk – become too costly to abandon. If “keeping it in the ground” is indeed the priority, this is the worst outcome of all; by discouraging it, cheap oil is a force to the good.Bargain-basement energy should also be the spur for far-sighted politicians to act on carbon pricing and other regulations and taxes that can’t be done when prices are high. In Paris last month, world leaders wrote post-dated cheques to the planet. Cheap oil is the opportunity to make a down payment.
