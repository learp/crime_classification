She said that the police had been called and were currently taking witness statements relating to an allegation of assault.Another protester, Eric Lai, condemned the guard’s actions. “We have been repeatedly told that the university supports our right to protest, but that couldn’t feel further from the truth.”“The university have posted dozens of guards to the doors, and have now taken to intimidation and violence to shut us up. It is hard to imagine a more inappropriate way to handle student protest.”The university told the Guardian that the security guard seen on the video was not a university employee, but had been “contracted in from a security group contracted to help manage and police the protest”. An Edinburgh University spokesperson said: “The university is aware of, and deeply regrets, the unfortunate incident that is currently being played on social media. The matter is now in the hands of the police.”“We continue to support the right of students to peacefully and lawfully demonstrate and theuniversity is using private security outside its buildings in Chambers Street in order to secure the safety of staff and students during the occupation.”Police Scotland confirmed that they had detained two men for questioning in relation to the incident.Climate change campaigners across the globe reacted with disappointment last week as Edinburgh University set out the unanimous decision by the court not to fully divest from fossil fuels.Insisting that the university remained committed to a change of investment policy, senior vice principal Prof Charlie Jeffery said: “Our commitment is to engage before divestment, but the expectation is that we will bring about change by engagement.”Outlining what is essentially a company-by-company approach, Jeffery said that the university would divest from companies involved in the extraction of coal and tar sands, only where feasible alternative sources of energy exist, and where companies do not invest in low carbon technologies.
