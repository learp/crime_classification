Before all the architecture types pile in with their encomia, I want to wish Nairn’s London a very happy 50th birthday. Written by Ian Nairn, the angry young man who in 1955 coined the word “subtopia” to describe Britain’s bland and badly planned suburbs, and who thereafter spent most of his all-too-brief career fighting its destructive sprawl (he died from cirrhosis in 1983 aged 52), this brilliantly concise book is still the best guide to the capital’s buildings that I know. Funny and poetic, highly subjective and slightly mad, Nairn’s great gift is for rendering the familiar unfamiliar. Read him on the Houses of Parliament (“stage scenery which takes itself seriously”) or Westminster Abbey (“delivered with the incisive acerbity which only civil servants can do really well”), and you’ll never think of either in the same way again. Funny and poetic, highly subjective and slightly mad, Nairn's gift is for rendering the familiar unfamiliar But there’s fun to be had, too, in looking up less well-known places. I love the entry for Milner Square in Islington, which isn’t far from where I live, and has always given me the shivers: it dates from 1841, and yet it feels like something Albert Speer might have designed. Nairn, who never uses 10 words when one will do, doesn’t hold back. “Not to be missed, in the sense that you ought to try Fernet Branca at least once,” he writes. “It is as near to expressing evil as a design can be.”Nairn’s London used to be hard to track down; people loved it too much to chuck it out, for which reason old copies were difficult to come by. Happily, though, in 2014 Penguin published what amounts to a facsimile of the 1966 edition, complete with a picture of its author at the wheel of a Routemaster bus on its cover. Buy it, and let him take you from Uxbridge to Dagenham, and all manner of strange and lovely places in between.Nairn’s London is published by Penguin (£9.99). Click here to buy it for £6.99
