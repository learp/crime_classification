Avry Zaltana has the power to heal the the sick and wounded, but her kind is feared for being different and labelled as magicians. They are hunted, so she runs after she aids and heals people, receiving no thanks. When Avry and the remaining healers are accused of spreading the plague, healers are killed. Avry gets caught by a town patrol and is sentenced to death, but when she is broken out of jail by a band of rogues, she is practically abducted. However she learns that the rogues value her gift and demand to strike a deal to heal their beloved lost King Rhine.I loved the character of Avry Zaltana because she likes aiding the weak, but is also one of her own intriguing personality. Avry is stubborn and is also fierce. All skills that the characters possess are believable, like knife-throwing and lock-picking. The story immersed me and lulled me into its depths. It is definitely one of my favourite series filled with fantasy and love. The characters and plot are absolutely mesmerising. Avryâ€™s character development is extraordinary, because at first she is an innocent child, almost, but then she blooms into a brave and courage a heroin. The relationships that Avry gains with her travelling companions is carefree and natural, the group antics and jokes are hilarious , also loving which makes you come to adore the characters individually an as a group. This book is very easy and reads smoothly; a definite must read!Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop
