Harper Lee’s classic novel To Kill a Mockingbird is heading to Broadway in a new adaptation written by Aaron Sorkin.Producer Scott Rudin said the play will be staged during the 2017-18 season under the direction of Tony award winner Bartlett Sher, who is represented on Broadway now with revivals of The King and I and Fiddler on the Roof. No casting was revealed.Sorkin’s plays include A Few Good Men and The Farnsworth Invention. He won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for his screenplay for The Social Network, which Rudin produced, along with Sorkin’s other films Steve Jobs and Moneyball.The book has been staged before, including a 1991 adaptation by Christopher Sergel which premiered at New Jersey’s Paper Mill Playhouse. There was a production in 2013 that had a run in London with Robert Sean Leonard in the role of Finch, the noble widower and lawyer called upon to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman in Depression-era Alabama. This new version will mark the story’s Broadway debut.To Kill a Mockingbird, published in 1960, introduced Finch, Scout, Boo Radley and other beloved literary characters. The book was adapted into an Oscar-winning film starring Gregory Peck as Atticus and has worldwide sales topping 40 million copies .Winner of the Pulitzer prize in 1961, and widely praised as a sensitive portrait of racial tension as seen through the eyes of a child in 1930s Alabama, it has been criticised as sentimental and paternalistic.Last year saw the publication of Lee’s recently discovered manuscript, Go Set a Watchman, described as a first draft of the story that evolved into To Kill a Mockingbird. Critics and readers were startled to find the heroic Atticus disparaging black people and condemning the supreme court’s decision to outlaw segregation in public schools.
