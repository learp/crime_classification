Adolescents – Kids of the Black Hole My wife once told me that before she met me she had seen the Adolescents performing at this club. I knew they hadn’t played there, and it turns out she had seen the Descendents instead. I love these guys, even if my wife confuses them with my band.

The Buzzcocks – progenitors of pop-punk, or maybe it’s more like second-generation powerpop. Whatever. Singles Going Steady was the soundtrack of my teen years, and definitely made it OK to write punk songs about girls.

Great guitar fills, great production.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Hear Homicide by 999 here.Pears – Victim to Be I can’t wait to see these guys! Quirky melodic hardcore from Louisiana, they remind me of My Name crossed with A Wilhelm Scream.

But I’m choosing this one for the lyrics, which always blow me away, especially with Dez spitting them out. Dez is god.
