A painting by the Italian artist Parmigianino could be lost overseas unless a British buyer can match the £24.5m price tag.The government has placed a temporary export bar on the 16th-century work to allow time for a UK-based buyer to come forward.The Virgin and Child with Saint Mary Magdalen and the Infant Saint John the Baptist was described as “ravishingly beautiful” by experts who recommended trying to keep it in the country.The painting has been in the UK for nearly 250 years and was one of the first Parmigianino works to be bought by a British collector.The decision to defer the export licence comes after a recommendation by the reviewing committee on the export of works of art and objects of cultural interest (RCEWA).The committee made its recommendation on the grounds of the painting’s aesthetic importance and outstanding significance to the study of Parmigianino’s work.RCEWA member Aidan Weston-Lewis said: “I can’t think of a more ravishingly beautiful Italian old master painting remaining in any private collection in the United Kingdom.“It is in pristine condition, has a very distinguished ownership history and, unusually for the period, has the additional fascination of being painted on paper, which opens up new avenues for scholarly research and technical investigation.“Its permanent export overseas would be a major loss.”The work is a rare example of a religious easel painting from the last decade of Parmigianino’s career. The artist, who died in 1540, is recognised as one of the pioneers of mannerism.
