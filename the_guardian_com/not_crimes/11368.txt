A small tortoiseshell butterfly, late season, fresh-hatched, settled on the inside wall of the ruined keep of Clun castle. There was a slight breeze which lifted the skirts of the butterfly's wings and it settled facing downwards, letting the breeze barge against the wall's warmth and spring back to catch on a tall black poplar, down on the river bend, whose leaves hissed like a bonfire. When the butterfly settled it must have tripped a web wire, because a spider scuttled from a crevice as if to pounce but backed off into the darkness like a vaudeville villain. This happened several times: the butterfly would flick its wings and the spider would appear, then disappear. After absorbing electromagnetic waves from the stone, the butterfly flew through a window hole in the keep, out across the castle mound to vanish into the blue-green sweep of the Clun valley. Did the butterfly know how close it was to death? Did its beautiful amber and black-glyph wings deter the spider from killing it?Beauty could not protect the cock pheasant, strutting on the road up Corve Dale. His white neck-ring, his iridescent copper and green feathers, were poor talismans against being struck by the car. The bird and all his fighting spirit burst like a down pillow. The breeze picked up the wreck of the pheasant's plumage and his pride and carried them along Wenlock Edge. There, where Edge Wood leaned against the open fields, a red admiral butterfly powered under the headwind across freshly cultivated soil; instead of the rich creamy poultice it should've been, the earth was arid dust.Soon afterwards a fire started, high on the Wrekin to the north and, at night, lights of firefighters blazed on the dark hillside. When rain came it may have doused the embers, but not the deep throaty growls of rutting fallow deer bucks in the woods.
