Become a Guardian children’s books family reviewer and review the best picture books you are reading with your child right now. Why not take a photo of the cover – or even a child’s drawing inspired by the book – and click the blue button to upload it to this assignment, along with a short(ish) review. We’ll include the best submissions in a gallery on the Guardian children’s books site, just like this one from March.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? If your child is aged 7 and under, and you want to join our family reviewers team – where every month we send you a newsletter with all the latest news and opportunities coming up, from free books to author interviews – email childrens.books@theguardian.com.GuardianWitness is the home of user-generated content on the Guardian. Contribute your video, pictures and stories, and browse news, reviews and creations submitted by others. Posts will be reviewed prior to publication on GuardianWitness, and the best pieces will feature on the Guardian site.
