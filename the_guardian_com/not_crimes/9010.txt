Born in Surrey, Ray Mears, 52, founded Woodlore, the school of wilderness bushcraft, in 1983. A wildlife photographer by profession, he first appeared on television in 1994 and has since made many documentary series, including Extreme Survival. He has trained elite troops for the British army and in 2010 was helped track the killer Raoul Moat. His new book, Out On The Land, is published next week. He lives in Sussex with his wife.When were you happiest?Right now. I live in the present.What is your greatest fear?That humanity won’t realise we need to work together to live on this planet long term. We’re living beyond our means as a species and damage so many other things along the way.What is your earliest memory?When I was one and my parents lived abroad. My father was a manager for a security printing company called De la Rue – they print money, legally. My earliest memories are of being with him in Lagos, Nigeria.Which living person do you most admire, and why?My wife, Ruth, because she holds the fort, making it possible for me to do what I do.What is your most treasured possession?My old British army mug. It’s stainless steel and big enough to bail out a canoe.Who would play you in the film of your life?Viggo Mortensen.If you could bring something extinct back to life, what would you choose?The Tasmanian tiger. People felt that it was hunting their animals, but there’s no evidence of that.What is your favourite word?Yes.What is your favourite smell?Honeysuckle in the hedgerow in the evening. It’s moth-pollinated, so you can smell it only if you’re outside at that time.Which book changed your life?The Forest People by Colin Turnbull. I found it in the library at school and missed a lesson because I couldn’t stop reading.Who would you invite to your dream dinner party?The tiger hunter Jim Corbett, the game hunter Frederick Selous, Grey Owl (a leading light in beaver conservation), Robert Baden-Powell, who founded the Scout movement, and Gerald Durrell, my favourite TV naturalist. They’re all dead, so they might be a bit smelly.If you could go back in time, where would you go?I would love to see the first time people made fire by friction.When did you last cry, and why?While tracking wolves in Idaho, we came across a wolf carcass. It was likely the pack had been poisoned in a deliberate act. I am a hunter, but I respect wildlife and I also respect predators.Lleyton Hewitt: ‘Most embarrassing moment? A streaker at my Wimbledon final’ What is the closest you’ve come to death?In a helicopter crash in Wyoming in 2005. My cameraman broke his back and both legs; the pilot broke his back. The helicopter didn’t catch fire, so I’m still here today.What keeps you awake at night?The sound of nightingales, but it is the most lovely sound. If someone said it was an elf playing a flute, I would believe them.How would you like to be remembered?For being genuine.Where would you most like to be right now?Sitting in a canoe in the Canadian boreal forest.
