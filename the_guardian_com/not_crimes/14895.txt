He wanted to get out and escape into that explosion of music that was in Manchester around that time. It was exhilarating, and everyone was trying to find their place.”Titled after the singer’s first name, the biopic was announced in 2014 with writer-director Mark Gill, who was nominated for an Oscar in 2014 for his short film The Voorman Problem, taking charge. The film’s producer, Orian Williams, previously worked on Control, Anton Corbijn’s acclaimed biopic on the life of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis.Morrissey: what we learned about him from List of the Lost “It’s as much a film for non-Morrissey fans as it is for die hard devotees,” he said in 2014. “But I can’t deny that this is a love letter to Steven Patrick Morrissey and the dark satanic mills of Manchester.”Gill, who grew up near where Morrissey was raised in Urmston, Manchester, will start shooting the film in April, reports say. So far, no other details have been announced. It is not clear whether Steven will feature actors playing the other members of the Smiths, but it has been described by production company Honlodge Productions as “a portrait of Morrissey’s early life prior to forming a legendary songwriting partnership with Johnny Marr”.
