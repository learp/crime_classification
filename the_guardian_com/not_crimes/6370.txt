Pastel-hued blossoms covered the trees, the hills smelt of wild garlic, and summer was undeniably on its way. On that walk, with my face turned towards the sun, it was good to feel that winter had retreated. I have written often of my love for the cold, the grey skies, the endless sartorial options. But, as Virginia Woolf said about spring: “I enjoy the spring more than the autumn now. One does, I think, as one gets older.” I feel, this year, as though this may be true. I have welcomed the brighter days and warmer weather with more enthusiasm than before. I realise that it’s early days, but I’m excited about the months to come.Food in books: raspberry cordial from Anne of Green Gables This summer, my as-yet-unpublished book will be spending time in the darkness, in boxes, as it makes its slow way back across the sea to England. Unable to tinker with it any further, I have taken on catering commissions, supper clubs, and writing new things. I’m also going to picnic – I spent far too much of last summer indoors; this summer, I am going to soak up the sun while I can.Over the Easter holidays, as a nanny I’ve been spending my days supervising maths projects, gymnastics routines, epic games of Hide & Seek, and mocktail experiments. This calls for effortless cooking; like a roasting dish placed in a low oven as the breakfast pancakes are being flipped, the contents gently pulled at with forks hours later, before being served for lunch. This is the way I like to eat in the summer: a board with little jars of pickles, a wedge of cheese, a twisted parcel of rich, salty butter. These are all perfect partners for rich, full-flavoured beef. I’ll be making this recipe again, many times, in the months to come.

Preheat the oven to 150C. Line the tin and lay the beef in a single layer over it. Pull the thyme leaves from the stalks and crush the mustard seeds. Sprinkle them over the beef, then add the whole anchovies and the garlic, and season with pepper.2. Cut the butter into thin slices, and cover the beef with it. Tightly seal the top of the roasting dish with foil, and place in the oven.3. Roast for at least four hours, checking occasionally to ensure the beef is not drying out. Add a splash of water, wine or stock if it is browning on top at any point. Continue cooking until the meat pulls apart with gentle pressure from a fork.4. Allow the beef to cool a little, then place the pieces in a bowl and pull apart. Lubricate the meat with a little of the buttery, anchovy-rich liquid from the roasting tray, and squash the meat into a jar. If you’re going to eat on a picnic within the next day, you can store it like this. Alternatively, it will keep for a few days in the fridge, with a layer of clarified butter on top.
