Your obituary of Rabbi Lionel Blue (20 December), referring to his Thought for the Day broadcasts, says “His thoughts were seldom profound”. In fact one of his great gifts was to express profound truths in simple and accessible ways. Generations of rabbis, myself included, saw him as a great teacher who opened up a world of deep spirituality with a light touch, and without taking himself seriously.Rabbi Dr Margaret JacobiBirmingham• My first thought was also that they are only books (I found out that my in-laws had thrown out my treasured books, 21 December).
