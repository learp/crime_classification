In Boys Don’t Cry by Malorie Blackman, Dante, a 17-year-old student who has just taken his A Levels early, is visited by his ex-girlfriend Melanie who has their baby. She hadn’t told him she was pregnant and they had split up before the baby was born. Now Melanie can’t cope and leaves Dante with Emma, who is only 11 months old.I really enjoyed Boys Don’t Cry; I was dreading reading it after seeing girls in my primary school reading Malorie Blackman’s books when I was in year 5, and I didn’t expect it to be as good as it eventually was. The funny descriptions of Emma as she reacted to the panoply of new things she was experiencing combined with the very real events in Dante’s life as he struggles to cope with raising a child at 17 and with his brother nearly dying on multiple occasions made for a gripping read.5 out of 5, definitely.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
