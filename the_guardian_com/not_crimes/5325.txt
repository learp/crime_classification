The Chinese artist’s series is a means of confronting the death of her father when she was a child. She explains: “During my creative process, I would call the girl out on my own initiative and release my emotions, then find peace. This process is not easy for me. Sometimes even dangerous. But I will continue in this subject, where I extract my memories, one piece at a time, to allow the little girl to grow up, to allow myself to find my father.”What we learned this weekMarina Abramović’s ex-partner Ulay has won €250,000 in his case against the performance artistWilliam Kentridge’s first London exhibition for 15 years is a mindblowing five-star trip through Bolshevism and relativityThe blockbuster Abstract Expressionism exhibition opened at the Royal Academy – and it’s a very blokey affairNicholas Serota thinks that residents of flats being overlooked by Tate Modern should just close the curtainsCarl Andre’s Equivalent VIII is still causing a stir – even though it’s very boring indeedJared Leto is going to play Andy Warhol in a new movieDavid Bowie’s art collection has gone on show in Los AngelesThe Thames estuary hosted Raga Dawn, a vocal performance surrounded by dock cranesReality is definitely more powerful than art – because scienceGustavo Aceves’s epic horse sculptures have galloped into RomeLondon’s Wellcome Collection is hosting an exhibition of art made by asylum patientsStefan Kalmár is the new director of the ICAOur most popular gallery this week was Katherine Fawsett’s pictures inside houseboats on the ThamesGet involvedL is for London: share your artwork nowGood thinking: your art on the theme of knowledgeDon’t forgetTo follow us on Twitter @GdnArtandDesign
