But the script has a scale the TV show couldn't – and I couldn't resist the opportunity to be stupid with the knights of the realmabatha26 asks:Really looking forward to seeing Dad’s Army, what were your first thoughts when you read the script? Were you apprehensive about filling the shoes of Arthur Lowe?Off topic, you were brilliant in Marvelous!!  Guardian contributor TobyJones1 27 January 2016 6:21pmI was extremely apprehensive about playing Captain Mainwaring. I was extremely sceptical about the project as a whole. When I saw the script, I was really impressed with how the 25-minute format of the TV series had been adapted and extended, into 100 minutes. The script has a scale that the TV series doesn't have time to explore and... women. I was really excited to work with Michael Gambon, Tom Courtenay, the two Bills, Danny and Blake, as well as Catherine. I felt I stood a chance if I watched what they were doing. In the end, it was a selfish decision - the opportunity to be stupid with knights of the realm.Updatedat 6.24pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.21pm GMT18:21OzMogwai asks:Would you ever consider going to Hollywood and doing a big budget film? Something in the Marvel universe perhaps?  Guardian contributor TobyJones1 27 January 2016 6:17pmI already have a visa into the Marvel universe: Arnim Zola will return to do battle with Captain America.

When Marvellous was offered to me, I couldn't believe the coincidence25aubrey asks:Congratulations on the most heart-warming and gently comic performance in Marvellous – such a wonderful television treat, you must be welcomed with open arms at Stoke City FC if you happen to go back, have you been back since and is Stoke your team now?  Guardian contributor TobyJones1 27 January 2016 6:16pmThank you Aubrey, for giving me an opportunity to lament our exit from last night's Carling Cup semifinal. I think you'll agree, we were robbed. Charles Churchill above is correct - I've always been a Potters fan. My father grew up in the potteries, and he watched Stanley Matthews play for them. When Marvellous was offered to me, I couldn't believe the coincidence. Of course meeting Neil is an event, and as the film shows, it tends to have long-term consequences. I now get approached regularly by members of Keele University's Neil Baldwin XI alumni. Both Gemma and I loved having Neil on the set, applauding the various scenes from his life, and his mother's death. Gemma's an extraordinary actress, but you know that.Updatedat 6.27pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.15pm GMT18:15spaknapak asks:Has working with Andrew Kötting and Iain Sinclair led to you looking at your surroundings differently when you are walking?  Guardian contributor TobyJones1 27 January 2016 6:12pmI'd always loved reading and listening to Iain Sinclair, so it was a fantastic opportunity to work with him. Ken Campbell was a hero of mine, and like Ian, he alerted me to the unobserved stories that lurk all around us. I'm just about to play William Blake in a radio play that combines contemporary action in and around Lambeth, with Blake's life in the early 19th century. Something I think will appeal to Iain.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.13pm GMT18:13Will Papa Lazarou Spence asks:I loved Marvellous & Detectorists, & over the past few years you’ve become one of my favourite actors & a big inspiration to me in amateur dramatics at university to try to find the driving force behind each character (however minor) & create a distinct personality for each and every one.My question is whether stage acting is something you plan to return to in the near future, or are you planning on focusing on TV and film for the foreseeable future?  Guardian contributor TobyJones1 27 January 2016 6:10pmThank you very much Will. There isn't really a plan. It's been a couple of years since I did a play and I'm very keen to do it again. I suppose I'm looking for a play that has to be done in a theatre, that is an event in and of itself, rather than just another play.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.12pm GMT18:12For Berberian Sound System, we didn't have anything to watch, or even an audio track. Oddly I enjoyed the challenge of imagining what I was hearingJeevan Rai asks:When shooting Berberian Sound Studio, were you actually given anything to watch while your character works on the unseen film-within-a-film? Or was it just an audio track? Or were you improvising your ‘reactions’ to it without stimulus?  Guardian contributor TobyJones1 27 January 2016 6:08pmNo, we weren't given anything to watch. We weren't even given an audio track. Oddly I enjoyed the challenge of imagining what I was hearing. When I saw the film, I realised how much worse what I'd imagined was. Thanks for reminding me Jeevan.Updatedat 6.14pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.10pm GMT18:10Mackenzie was worried stiff every time I got into the TR7.

Guardian contributor TobyJones1 27 January 2016 6:06pmI can't speak about the X19, but Mackenzie was worried stiff every time I got into the TR7. He bought it cheap for the art department, and had it done up. I often struggle with the gearbox, which felt clunkier than it looked. The original would have been painted mimosa, you know. Interesting.Updatedat 6.17pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.08pm GMT18:08Liam Quane asks:Can I ask: What is the best thing a director can do for you on set?  Guardian contributor TobyJones1 27 January 2016 6:04pmHi Liam. The best thing a director can do is tell you what he's seen, and what he takes it to mean. It sounds simple but it isn't.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.07pm GMT18:07Liam Quane asks:What was it like working with Tomas Alfredson?   Guardian contributor TobyJones1 27 January 2016 6:03pmI adored working with Tomas Alfredson. I hope I'm about to work with him again. He is one of the clearest directors I've ever worked with. He reports back to the actor exactly what he's seen and what he takes from what he's seen, and then he suggests how this might be adjusted to create an alternative impression. If that sounds dry, it isn't, he's just very clear and concrete, and reassuringly simple. And he's funny.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.04pm GMT18:04snipsnip asks:Your go at Owen Meany brought vividly to life a character that’s inhabited my head for years. Thanks! What do you like about radio drama, whether listening or performing, and do you think you’ll keep doing it?  Guardian contributor TobyJones1 27 January 2016 6:01pmThanks, I loved playing Owen Meany. In a way, it was similar to playing Dobby - I understood how loved the character was in the imagination of the reader. So I felt a special kind of responsibility to voicing it. I've loved radio drama since I was a kid - I know it's a cliche to say it's a very visual medium, but it's true, that learning to pitch your voice in the right way does teach you a lot about space.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.03pm GMT18:03Ben Broadribb asks:I saw you in Andrew Kötting’s By Our Selves last year, and I’m looking forward to watching you in Dad’s Army next month. These two films look about as far away from each other on the cinematic spectrum as can be. How does the process differ when working on such varied films, and which do you prefer making: surreal art house films or more straightforward mainstream releases?   Guardian contributor TobyJones1 27 January 2016 5:59pmHi Ben. I'm desperately trying to link Dad's Army with By Our Selves, and I can't. I think the best part about my job is also the scariest: not knowing what's coming next. I'm lucky enough to have played very contrasting roles, and that is what I love. Sometimes big budget movies, I should say astronomical budget movies, feel like a different job. You can shoot the same scene three different ways over several months, whereas By Our Selves has almost no budget at all. The trick is to understand the world of the film you're in, and find a way to respect both processes. That reads like a Captain Mainwaring pompous answer!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.01pm GMT18:01I loved the Detectorists script: it's rooted in character rather than jokes, so it felt like doing a drama. Research was learning how to operate a metal detectorILoveTonyBlair asks:Prior to playing the role of Lance, did you have any interest in Archaeology etc … ?What preparation did you undertake for the role - time with a Detectorist club, for example, or was Crook’s fantastic script and directing more than enough?What did you have to do for the audition for the role.  Guardian contributor TobyJones1 27 January 2016 5:55pmMackenzie and I have been in several films together but never in the same scene. Then we were cast as museum attendants in the last Muppet movie and spent a morning together. Apologetically, Mackenzie told me he'd written a part for me, and would I read what he'd written. It was a comedy. I dreaded having to tell him that I didn't like it - truth is, it was laugh out loud funny. I think because it's rooted in character rather than jokes, it didn't feel like we were doing a comedy but rather a drama. Research? He showed me how to operate a metal detector.Updatedat 6.06pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
