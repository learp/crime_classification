Carpool Karaoke, which sees celebrities sing along to a range of music from the passenger seats of a car being driven by Corden, has amassed more than 1.2bn views on YouTube.Corden, whose breakthrough came with his role in the movie of Alan Bennett’s The History Boys, and whose household name status was cemented in the UK with his performance as Smithy in the sitcom Gavin and Stacey, said he and his team “never thought we’d hit the ground running as fast as we have”.“It’s taken us all by surprise, the success, especially of that particular segment,” he told the magazine.Corden told the publication he had no plans to mark the two-year anniversary of The Late Late Show.“But we do have some stuff planned this year – which might involve being in the UK,” he added.“We’re talking about it now, really. We don’t know if we’ll be able to get it together but it’s certainly something I’d love to do, for sure.”The Nightly Show, which has bumped ITV’s flagship News at Ten bulletin back by 30 minutes for the next eight weeks, was presented in its first week by David Walliams. John Bishop, Davina McCall, Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc are lined up for future slots. Reviews variously called it “awkward”, “unfunny” and “as flat as a Shrove Tuesday pancake”.The show’s ratings more than halved from the first to the second episode, from 2.8 million viewers on the Monday to 1.2 million on Tuesday.
