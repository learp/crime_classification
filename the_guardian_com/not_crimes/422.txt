I thought that this book would be very interesting when I saw that it was set in Paris and Versailles, two places I had recently visited. The story is also set at the time of the French Revolution which I was keen to learn more about.The narrator of this story is Celie, an older French peasant girl, who at the start of the book is living on the streets of Paris. She makes a living by stealing from the wealthy with her partner in crime – a teenage boy called Algernon. We are told that Celie is an orphan, whose mother and brother starved to death after her father was killed by the King’s brother, The Comte d’Artois, for poaching on his land. Celie and Algernon both hold personal grudges against the royals and dream of rebellion but doubt that it will ever take place.Not far into the story Celie is caught stealing from The Comte d’Artois himself, who orders her to be imprisoned. Luckily for her, Madame Tussaud comes to her rescue and discovers that she has a unique talent for drawing. Faced with either imprisonment or servitude to Madame Tussaud, Celie chooses the latter. As the folds of wealth envelop her and Celie travels to the court of Versailles, Celie has to decide whether she will side with the rebels, or remain loyal to Madame Tussaud who has shown her love and kindness.I thought that the plot of this book was unusual and interesting. However, it was let down by the fact that Celie’s voice was not quite authentic, for example when Celie first sees the gardens at Versailles she describes in great detail a gold fountain in terms of the Greek gods represented by the statues. But the book describes her as being unable to read, so how would she know the details of Greek mythology? I also found the narrative a bit monotonous at times and I think that the book would have been much more enjoyable if the author had really managed to capture the voice of a historical female character, in the same way as authors such as Emma Carroll or Katherine Rundell have. Overall I would rate this book 3 stars out of 5 because it had a great plot but did not quite deliver on character.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
