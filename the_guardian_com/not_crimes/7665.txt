It looks like Andrea Leadsom is unconcerned that her children’s children may never see a butterfly unless they climb a mountain (Leadsom’s views make her surprise choice for new role, 15 July), which she sees as a sensible approach to environment planning. Could Patrick Barkham (Wet summer is last straw in disastrous year for butterflies, 15 July) perhaps persuade the family to take part in the big butterfly count?Helen EsplinColeford, Gloucestershire• Perhaps I’m paranoiac, but I rather resented the implication that because I enjoy AE Housman, I must be a xenophobic Brexiteer (Housman Country: Into The Heart Of England by Peter Parker, reviewed by Blake Morrison, Review, 16 July).

But Keith Flett is alive and presumably writing to you as I type this.Brian SmithBerlin, Germany• Your article (I gave up race when Decker fell, Zola Budd reveals, 19 July) highlights the forthcoming documentary, The Fall, about the ill-fated 1984 Olympics women’s 3,000m race. The accompanying picture shows athlete “175” and some mention should be made that this is of course Wendy Sly (née Smith), who in her first Olympics won the silver medal in that race.Cathy CrossLondon• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
