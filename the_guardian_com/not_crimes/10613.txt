3.01pm GMT15:01That's all for today!Many thanks to everyone who posted questions, and to Joan for her time and her generous answers. Until next time!   Guardian contributor JoanBakewell 02 February 2016 2:49pmTime to go. I've enjoyed the challenge of talking to you all... and each one of you. Goodbye.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.00pm GMT15:00'Marriage vows are between two people, and the concern of those two people only'SirIsaac asks:Do marriage vows mean anything?  Guardian contributor JoanBakewell 02 February 2016 2:48pmVows matter to those who believe in them. I think we all accept that to take an oath in a court of law binds us absolutely to tell the truth. And indeed there is a punishment if we are found not to be doing so. Marriage vows are between two people, and the concern of those two people only. If the vows are meaningful, then both parties will struggle to sustain them, even when the going gets rough. But we live at a time when society agrees that people should not be forced to go on living unhappy lives. At which point, marriage vows, however serious for those involved, will get broken. All of this is painful, but if vows are to have meaning, then it should be painful.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.47pm GMT14:47'I am concerned when I see universities appearing to close down on open-minded discussion. Censorship is now coming from the student body'JustinPhillips asks:Do you have any regrets about Taboo? Do you have any plans to bring it back?  Guardian contributor JoanBakewell 02 February 2016 2:44pmI have absolutely no regrets about Taboo. What is interesting is how the parameters have shifted, and how words and attitudes that were acceptable even in the early noughties are unacceptable now. As president of Birkbeck, I am concerned when I see universities appearing to close down on open-minded discussion. Censorship is now coming from the student body, rather than from the grownups who used to dictate what was allowed. Students are now demanding restrictions on who speaks and what can be said. The current row about Cecil Rhodes is a case in point. Nobody bothered with his statue ten years ago; now people are finding it offensive and want it pulled down. I sympathise with their point of view, but think personally there are much more important issues to feel anger about.Updatedat 2.48pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.46pm GMT14:46Sidfishes asks:If the you that is now could go back in time and give one piece of advice to the you who was 18 – what would it be?  Guardian contributor JoanBakewell 02 February 2016 2:40pmI think I would say: be less fearful of failure. As a young person I was well aware that if I failed exams, or failed my degree, I would lose the chance to shape my life as I wanted. I now know that's not true, that you can shape your life without toeing the line in a world shaped by the adults. So more courage and independence!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.46pm GMT14:46furiouspurpose asks:Which brand of “Bakewell” tart would you recommend and why?  Guardian contributor JoanBakewell 02 February 2016 2:39pmBakewell tart comes from Bakewell, obviously. There is a shop that sells something called Bakewell pudding, which claims to be the original, and is very tasty. A good Bakewell tart with plenty of almond and raspberry jam is hard to beat. The ready made varieties are not as good as those made with love in a home kitchen.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.39pm GMT14:39Sidfishes asks:When you are dreaming and you find yourself talking in that dream, do you talk in your original Lancashire accent? [Actually, just realised – Stockport is in Cheshire!]  Guardian contributor JoanBakewell 02 February 2016 2:38pmStockport is on the border between Lancashire and Cheshire, that border being the Mersey river which runs straight through it. I'm not conscious of having much to say in my dreams. I'm usually too busy enjoying the landscape, or more commonly, escaping the catastrophes of nature and events that seem to pursue. I had a terrible dream the other day of capsizing from a boat. I think the immigration crisis had reached my subconscious.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.36pm GMT14:36furiouspurpose asks:Do you think that, in retrospect, it was distasteful to complain about a potential mansion tax, when so many young people in London face poor standard, overpriced accommodation?  Guardian contributor JoanBakewell 02 February 2016 2:36pmI never complained about the mansion tax. What I did complain about was the phrase mansion tax was too forbidding for people to take on board. Even today, I am in favour of what I would call a windfall tax to be made on properties which enjoy a particularly steep rise in value. I did nothing to add to the value of my house - it's value is simply the result of the housing bubble. So I don't see why I shouldn't be liable to pay tax on what is a historical accident.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.36pm GMT14:36septredom asks:Do you still enjoy living in Primrose Hill?  Guardian contributor JoanBakewell 02 February 2016 2:32pmYes, I do. I moved into my present house over fifty years ago. The area was very run down, but we chose a place which had, under the soot, the merits of high ceilings and tall windows. The ceilings and windows are still the same but the soot has gone. It has been interesting to live through a lifetime within the same community, to see the shopkeepers grow old and the trendier boutiques arrive. Once there were grocers and butchers, now there are restaurants and cafes. I've been able to observe social change without leaving my house. What can I expect of the next few years? Heaven knows. We are still a community that comes together to save its library, plant bulbs in the shared garden, and run our own film show.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.32pm GMT14:32ChrisIsAmazing asks:Do you want to be in my band?  Guardian contributor JoanBakewell 02 February 2016 2:28pmRobert Plant is a neighbour of mine, and so it follows that I am a great enthusiast of Led Zeppelin. I like heavy rock, but also The Beatles, Dylan... but my knowledge stops there. I can't see myself letting my hair down enough to be part of any such enterprise, though in my fantasies, it would figure highly. The chance to be both talented and uninhibited did not come the way of my generation. I envy the young for their freedom and joy in music.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.31pm GMT14:31'My heart sank when I saw the Vanity Fair cover: it was both beautiful, glamorous, and deluding'PollyCurtis asks:Hello, I’m fascinated by the Vanity Fair cover out today. What do you think about the place of older women in Hollywood? Thanks!  Guardian contributor JoanBakewell 02 February 2016 2:27pmMy heart sank when I saw the Vanity Fair cover: it was both beautiful, glamorous, and deluding. Each of these women is outstanding in her own right, and I felt that to parade them together diminished them. But there's no denying the high style of the photograph. Older women in Hollywood, well, how about the title role of the lead in a romcom, the heroic figure who solves the mystery, the crusading champion who wins the day? Any or all of those parts could be played by the likes of Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, Charlotte Rampling, Helen Mirren, Lily Tomlin.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.26pm GMT14:26RaoulChateaubriand asks:Dear Joan, you’ve always struck me as someone singularly good at staying true to yourself. Might I ask, what is your secret and do you have any advice for young people still wondering what to do with their lives?  Guardian contributor JoanBakewell 02 February 2016 2:24pmI have several grandchildren growing to maturity, and they don't always want my advice. But they still get it. I try to encourage them to seek out what it is that would make them happy. Not tickets to a pop concert, or the latest in tattoos and piercings. But some genuine way of expressing their lives in work with colleagues on some enterprise they would find rewarding. The problem is young people are surrounded by so many options, they can be deluded by what seems trendy and flamboyant. I would encourage them to think quietly and in private about what they think their lives might be about. It's not easy, but you grow to like yourself and to accept your place in the world.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.26pm GMT14:26amsams asks:Always been someone I’ve liked. Was going to ask what she thought of Corbyn? Possibly however, it won’t be permitted, therefore I won’t ask.  Guardian contributor JoanBakewell 02 February 2016 2:21pmI don't know Jeremy Corbyn and have never met him. Whenever I read whatever he himself says, it seems enormously sensible. I try not to get my impression of him filtered through the Tory press, so it's quite hard to know how to evaluate his impact in politics today with any clear sense of what is true. I stand aside from what I'm told are the inner struggles of the Labour party because I hold fast to their founding beliefs in social justice and equality. And that's enough for me. The right direction? Forward! I'm proud of the fact that in the Lords we have defeeated this government on ten occasions, each one a matter of personal concern for individual citizens. We forced a rethink on tax credits, and recently voted against the Department of Work and Pensions' plans to cut the living allowance for the disabled. Could anything be more mean-spirited and niggardly? That's where the Labour peers are able to put a break on this government's brutality.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
