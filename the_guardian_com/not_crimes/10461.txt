Madonna has described her feelings of “heartbreak” and “betrayal” in the wake of Donald Trump’s US election win, claiming: “It feels like women betrayed us.”During her interview with Billboard, which has crowned her Woman of the Year, the pop star compared her despair regarding the results – particularly the significant number of women who voted for Trump – to mourning.Why did women vote for Trump? Because misogyny is not a male-only attribute “I feel that way every morning; I wake up and say, ‘Oh, wait, Donald Trump is still the president,’ and it wasn’t a bad dream that I had. It feels like women betrayed us. The percentage of women who voted for Trump was insanely high,” she says. When asked why she thought so many women – according to CNN 53% of white women voted for Trump – Madonna replied: Women hate women. That’s what I think it is. Women’s nature is not to support other women. It’s really sad. Men protect each other, and women protect their men and children. Women turn inward and men are more external. A lot of it has do with jealousy and some sort of tribal inability to accept that one of their kind could lead a nation. Other people just didn’t bother to vote because they didn’t like either candidate, or they didn’t think Trump had a chance in the world. They took their hands off the wheel and then the car crashed.Earlier this week, Madonna criticised Trump and said she was ashamed to be an American during a performance and auction that raised more than $7.5m (£5.9m) for her Malawi foundation.Images of the president-elect appeared behind her as she sang the lyrics to Britney Spears’s Toxic. The singer also revealed that she had previously been photographed in Trump’s bed – for a magazine shoot when he was not at home. She made jokes about his “cheap sheets”, saying: “They won’t be Egyptian cotton because we all know how he feels about Muslims, don’t we?”
