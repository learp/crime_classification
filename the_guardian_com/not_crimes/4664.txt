I love Christmas drinks. I’m not talking about swirling aged brandy around a big, old glass or having a champagne tipple on Christmas Day; I’m talking about the Starbucks red cups, the Costa range in their Christmassy cosies and the heavenly, lethally sickly McDonald’s spiced-cookie latte.On my radar: Ruby Tandoh’s cultural highlights Given the runaway popularity of these seasonal drinks, you wouldn’t think that was a contentious statement. Well, it is in the world of Food – that’s official, with-a-capital-F food. In this world, perky seasonal drinks just don’t fly. It’s all farmer’s markets and “bowl food” and rich, white people buying books by other rich, white people about the best way to cook Indian food. Here, everyone is a “foodie”, which basically means that you talk about food a lot more than you enjoy it. Here are a few things that are applauded in foodie circles: sourdough breads with crusts that make your jaw ache; £17 plates of pasta; tenderly massaged leaves of kale; nut milk coaxed from a muslin sack of pureed almonds.Things like sweet, soothing, Christmas-themed drinks, however, are “silly”, a sickly, girly, self-indulgent kind of comfort. The serious food world is quick to wrinkle its nose at the nostalgic, peppy cuteness of Christmas drinks in special cups. But I think they’re missing out.Probably the best known festive receptacles are the Starbucks red cups, launched every November to fanfare and heralded by the fansite countdowntoredcups.com, which exemplifies the hyperbolic, hashtag-ready viral enthusiasm that surrounds their release. This excitement snowballs on social media, respawning the popular Twitter hashtag #RedCup (which this year trended above the highly anticipated John Lewis Christmas ad for a while) and prompting many people to post photos of their coffees in cute, hazily filtered Instagram shots. In one fell swoop, this infuriates food snobs and Instagram sceptics, making it a smartly subversive way to parade your #basic tastes for the world to see while weeding out the most joyless among your social media followers.The cups are, of course, just one part of the story. As much as the big brands try to dress up their seasonal offerings in photogenic outfits – from the Costa cups designed in the style of woolly Christmas jumpers to the 13 red Starbucks designs – no amount of festive cladding should distract us from the controversy surrounding the wasteful disposal of these cups, the vast majority of which – about 2.5bn a year in the UK alone – end up in landfills, not recycling plants. The cups are a sweetly sentimental sheen on a looming environmental disaster.If you’re concerned, though, you needn’t buy into the packaging. Bring your own mug or invest in a vacuum flask. It is, to happily lapse into misty-eyed cliche, what is inside that counts. Starbucks offers an eggnog latte that is velvety and rich, the nutmeg-scented sweetness fading at the end of a mouthful to leave the richer, darker taste of coffee. Better still is the fudge hot chocolate, which is essentially a molten Cadbury’s Fudge bar with a hat of golden-sprinkle-strewn cream. Costa’s gingerbread latte comes topped with whipped cream and a tiny gingerbread man. Yes, they’re silly and sometimes over-sweet. Yes, they’re the product of aggressively cute, sweetly cynical advertising campaigns. But they’re comforting and warm, and sometimes – especially in this godforsaken year – that’s all that matters. Let the purists rage.The red cups, and their festive brothers and sisters, feel archetypal of the ways in which the things that we buy and love the most (Greggs sausage rolls, sliced white bread, sweet chili chicken wraps) get sidelined by a self-conscious foodie press. Life is too short for that kind of special snowflake mentality, though. So what if loving the red cups makes you as basic as every other punter? Leave the earnest food bros to their dubious civet coffee and get yourself something that brings you genuine joy. Feel their patronising words wash over you while you sip on your latte and enjoy some sweet self-care. You’re not the one drinking cat-shit coffee, after all.
