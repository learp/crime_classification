Going upIce-cream sandwiches Squidgy cookie, ice-cream, squidgy cookie: remind us what the point of ice-cream cones is again? Drizzle with caramel and roll in sprinkles.Multitasking US supermarkets are trying to lure back online shoppers with free childcare, spa treatments, even yoga. In the UK, grooming and eating in the same place is becoming a thing. Because who wouldn’t want a wax followed immediately by lunch? (Although wine – yes, please.)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Anyone for cricket? Photograph: Getty ImagesBugs Fancy nibbling on cumin mealworms with your Aperol spritz? Paprika crickets with craft beer? French brand Jimini’s spiced insects are intended to replace wasabi peas as the bar snack du jour, and are a hit in France and Belgium.Mac’n’cheese We’re buying 550% more oozy, cheesy deliciousness than five years ago. Expect it spiked with jalapeños, studded with lobster or inside a (practically calorie-free) fried cheese and pasta sandwich.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Brad McDonald’s jambalaya.

Get Brad McDonald’s new book, Deep South, and make your own gumbo or hush puppies.Lambrusco Forget the fizzy, sweet Italian red that flare-wearers quaffed in the 1970s. Good-quality modern lambrusco is juicy, often dry or off-dry, and gently frothy. Try Monte delle Vigne Selezione 2014, from Laithwaites (£14.49), or Marks & Spencer’s Lambrusco Reggiano Secco (£9).

Will its couriers beat Deliveroo’s black-and-turquoise riders? Maybe not: Deliveroo has 5,000 bikes on the road in the UK and is growing 25% month on month.Tree water Beyoncé’s favourite maple water is out; birch, bamboo and aloe sap waters are in. Good if you like electrolytes, vitamins, minerals and the taste of wet tree.Going down      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Seaweed is 2016’s kale. Photograph: Getty ImagesKale 2016’s wonder green is officially seaweed, not least as Waitrose has started stocking it. And not just for Asian broths and seafood dishes: use it in bread, instead of pasta, in butters and salads, and as a salt substitute. Buy it ready-to-eat, wet or dried, from Just Seaweed in Scotland or the Cornish Seaweed Company.Pumpkin latte It’s all about turmeric latte, or “golden milk”, now (though you have to make it with nut milk: the clean-eating mob won’t go anywhere near real dairy). True hipsters will already be soaking their chia and hemp seed oats in this stuff overnight.Beef and lamb Goat is lean, sustainable, relatively humane and easy to find online and through Ocado. The Ethicurean near Bristol, plus Jeremy Lee and Fergus Henderson in London, use it and want the rest of us do the same.  You’ve got 10 minutes before your coffee in a cone starts dripping down your armCoffee cups Ice-cream in a cone may be passé (see Going Up), but lining one with chocolate and filling it with coffee is not. Baristas in South Africa nearly broke Instagram when they started posting #CoffeeInACone pictures. You’ve got 10 minutes before the chocolate melts and espresso dribbles down your arm.The pint glass “Built by thirsty boffins” is the tagline for Cobra’s reinvented beer glass. It’s got a swirly pattern on the inside, designed by scientists to create the perfect head of foam.Red and white wine Spanish vintners Gik are so bored with grape-coloured wine that they’ve dyed theirs blue. Electric blue, like a slushie, or those sticking plasters chefs use. Yes, that blue.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Poke is the new sushi. Photograph: Getty ImagesSushi Move over maki. Poke (pronounced po-kay) is the only raw fish dish we’re eating now, served as it is in Hawaii, in a bowl with sesame oil, black rice and pickles. President Obama is a fan.Limoncello Nancy Dell’Olio is launching Limonbello, a sugar-free limoncello that she says is made to a family recipe. That’s the death knell for us.
