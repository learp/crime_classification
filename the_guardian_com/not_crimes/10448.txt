Why do school photos always look so bad? No matter how much you try to and look good, fate always seems to intervene on picture day – with a break-out or bad hair day bang on cue.But, having a horrible school photo is like a rite of passage and when you look back as a adult at your awkward teenage self it can be a marker for how far you’ve come.That’s why the Guardian’s Stuart Heritage says that he would not alter his school photo, following news that a firm now offers to airbrush away imperfections and blemishes. He writes: “When you look at a school photo, you shouldn’t be able to believe that you actually looked like that. We all have photos like this, but only a functioning sociopath would ever be pleased about how they turned out. And this is precisely why they should be left alone.”So, do you wish you could have PhotoShopped your school photo? We want to see the pictures that lay treasured on your parents’ mantelshelf.
