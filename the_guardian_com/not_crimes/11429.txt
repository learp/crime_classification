This is England ’90 and The Last Panthers writer Jack Thorne is to adapt Philip Pullman’s Dark Materials trilogy for the BBC.The novelist was closely involved in picking Thorne, who is nominated for three Bafta awards for his work on the two shows and BBC3’s Don’t Take My Baby.Pullman said: “I’m delighted to welcome Jack Thorne as writer on the TV dramatisation of His Dark Materials. Jack is a writer of formidable energy and range, and I’ve greatly enjoyed talking to him and learning about his plans for bringing His Dark Materials to the screen. BBC's His Dark Materials series to 'sound every note' in Philip Pullman’s novels “I’m certain he’ll do a superb job, and I look forward to seeing the whole project develop as he shapes the story.”His Dark Materials centres on a girl called Lyra living in a parallel version of Oxford. It is loosely based on Milton’s Paradise Lost, but flips the story by casting original sin in a positive light and including a corrupt and decaying creator figure.Casting and production are due to start this year, but there is no set date for the series to air.The series is the first commission from Bad Wolf, the Welsh production company set up by long-serving TV executives Jane Tranter and Julie Gardner, both of whom were involved in reviving Doctor Who for the BBC.Thorne said: “It is such an honour and a privilege to be given this opportunity to delve into Philip Pullman’s world. What I always loved about Bad Wolf’s intentions with this project was the notion of sounding every note.”The His Dark Materials trilogy are vast and glorious books full of beautiful characters and I’m going to work as hard as I can to try and do justice to them.”
