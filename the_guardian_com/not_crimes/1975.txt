As a child, Suzan-Lori Parks gained an unusual education in American history when her father, a US army officer who reached the rank of colonel, was stationed in Germany. She saw the TV drama Roots, a key moment in raising consciousness about slavery, in a German-dubbed version: “I remember that scene of the slaves on the ship and they are all shouting ‘Freiheit!’ [Freedom!] Often, I was the only black kid in the class and, when they mentioned the civil war or slavery, everyone would turn and look at me. I was like, ‘Look, I wasn’t there!’”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘The army was the only place a black man could get a fair shake’ … Father Comes Home from the Wars. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the GuardianParks’s own American history epic, Father Comes Home from the Wars, is currently receiving its UK premiere at the Royal Court in London. The trilogy of short plays – performed in one evening – is set during the American civil war, whose architect, Abraham Lincoln, is a central figure in two of her earlier dramas, The America Play and Topdog/Underdog. The latter, featuring two black brothers named after Lincoln and his assassin John Wilkes Booth (played in the Royal Court’s 2003 production by Jeffrey Wright and Mos Def), won her the Pulitzer prize for drama.Father Comes Home from the Wars features songs written by Parks – she has been playing guitar to accompany rehearsals for the Court production – and in the original American production she took the role of a character called the Musician. “Then it was like: I can’t do this every night for the whole run! But it’s kinda fun to get to do it in rehearsals.” Her performing streak now finds expression on the lecture circuit and, during our interview, in frequent vocal impressions, big gestures and whooping laughter. The title of her trilogy refers to childhood memories of waiting for her dad to come home from either military conflicts or exercises which, in an ironic overlap with her own profession, were called “rehearsals”. When y’all had Brexit we were like, ‘Whaay! We’re not the only stupid ones!’  “My dad joined the military not because he was a gung-ho patriot,” she recalls, “but because at that time the army had just been integrated in the States. And it was one of the few industries that offered black people the possibility of advancement if you did a good job. Most industries didn’t have that then: you were the last hired and the first fired. He was in Vietnam and we were sitting waiting, and we were luckier than some because he was able to come home and live a pretty good life.” Colonel Parks became a university professor and is buried with military honours in Arlington National Cemetery. His decision to join an army into which most soldiers had to be drafted is reflected in the protagonist of Father Comes Back from the Wars, a slave called Hero, who chooses to accompany his Master to fight in the pro-slavery Confederate army. Hero is promised his freedom in exchange, but there is a possibility that he is being duped. This strand has contemporary resonance for the writer: “In America, the promise made to the military has been continually reneged upon. Service people have generally fought the wars and then come back and been forgotten.”  She was four when her dad fought in Vietnam, but even later as a student never became politicised about the conflict. “I always understood that my dad joined the army because it was the only place a black man could get a fair shake. The fact that the government was fucked up wasn’t his problem. The government has been fucked up since day one. And my dad never gloried in war or his military service.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Steve Toussaint and Tom Bateman in Father Comes Home from the Wars.

Parks grimaces: “This is difficult. All I can say is that after Emancipation, when the slaves were freed, there was Reconstruction, which was essentially a lot of blowback. So, after Obama’s eight years, there’s serious blowback. People in America are often encouraged not to think. The basis of politics is to heighten their fears and make them buy something. But, you know, y’all just had Brexit. We were like ‘Whaay! We’re not the only stupid ones!’”She says she will vote for Hillary Clinton, albeit grudgingly: “Hillary’s not perfect but I always say: don’t let perfect get in the way of good.”Father Comes Home from the Wars review – gripping African-American epic The day before we meet, Parks delivered to Amazon Prime a drama about the slaves kept by the American president Thomas Jefferson, and she is next heading to New York for an attempt to perform, in a continuous loop, 365 Days/365 Plays, her 2005 project in which she wrote a dialogue or monologue every day for a year. Nobody is sure how long the work will take to perform. (“Bring some pillows, some snacks!”) She is aware, from actors in the Royal Court production, of the perception that the UK remains behind the US in opportunities for non-white actors, and remembers the frustration of feeling unrepresented: “Black people have had to become great at seeing ourselves where we are not present because that’s where we grew up. I see myself in Downton Abbey. Even before they introduced the black character, I was right there. Some weeks I was upstairs, some weeks I was downstairs! But it is different when you have a character who looks like you, so I’m glad to have plugged that gap a little bit.”Father Comes Home from the Wars is at the Royal Court, London, until 22 October.
