I made two light, aromatic broths this week. The first was a pot of stock, warm with sherry and black pepper: an amber pool in which to cook a whole silver-skinned fish for two. A couple of days later, when the fishmonger received his net bags of mussels and clams, I made another, golden and smoky, with sweet onions and cured back bacon. Surf and turf at its simplest.The cooking liquor for the whole fish – a home-made dashi, really – required a little specialist shopping. Ginger and dried shiitake are hardly strangers to my kitchen, but I wanted to add bonito flakes (katsuobushi) and some kombu – the pieces of dark green seaweed that feel so right for cooking something whose home was in the sea. A local wholefood shop had both. (Sadly, an online search of one major supermarket for kombu brought only a suggestion to try Caneston Combi instead.) The online shop at japancentre.com is an excellent countrywide source.The liquor for the shellfish soup was a simpler affair: just the mussel and clam juices given sweetness and depth by letting diced onions, thyme sprigs and smoked bacon cook until they leave a thin, sticky goo – a golden shadow of caramelised sugars and smoky juices – on the base of the pan.Clams and mussels with bacon and thymeClams require much the same vigilance as mussels – checking that the shells are tightly closed. Discard any with chopped or cracked shells. with a firm tug, pull away any wisps of “beard” that may be trapped between the closed shells. Leave the aromatics in place, with just the occasional stir, giving them time to turn sweet and golden before you add the stock.Serves 4 onion 1, largeolive oil 2 tbspback bacon 200gthyme 3 or 4 sprigsblack peppercorns 8vegetable or fish stock 1 litre, hotmussels 250gclams 250gFor the toasts:peas 200gbutter 50gtarragon 10gbaguette 4-8 slicesPeel and roughly chop the onion. Warm the olive oil in a deep saucepan, then stir in the onion and let it cook over a moderate heat until it is soft and golden. Cut the bacon into pieces, about the size of a small postage stamp, then stir them into the softening onion, together with the whole sprigs of thyme and the very lightly crushed peppercorns.When the bacon is lightly coloured, pour in the hot stock, stirring and scraping at any toasty, sticky bits on the base of the pan to dissolve them into the stock, and leave, at a gentle simmer, for 10 minutes. The onions, thyme and bacon cook leave a golden shadow of caramelised sugars and smoky juices on the pan Meanwhile, cook the peas in boiling water for 3 or 4 minutes then drain them. Tip the peas into a blender jug or food processor, add the butter and the tarragon leaves and process to a smooth, vivid green paste. Toast the slices of baguette.Add the mussels and clams to the stock, cover tightly with a lid and let them cook in their own steam for 3 or 4 minutes, until their shells have opened.Spread the toasted baguette thickly with the pea purée. Spoon the clams and mussels into bowls then ladle the soup over them. Offer the pea toasts at the table.Poached sea bass with shiitake and ginger      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Go fish: Nigel Slater’s poached sea bass with shiitake and ginger recipe. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the ObserverA home-made dashi broth is simplicity itself once you have tracked down the shiitake, kombu and bonito flakes, but a ready-prepared dashi stock powder available at wholefood shops and somemajor supermarkets is a perfectly fine substitute. My addition of ponzu, the citrus soy sauce normally reserved for dipping at the end, brings depth and a pleasing salty-sourness.Serves 2sea bass 1, medium sizedwater 500mldried shiitake mushrooms 15gdried kombu 8gdried bonito flakes 8gsmall shallots 4ginger 35gblack peppercorns 8dry sherry 120mllemongrass 3 stalkssesame oil 3 tspponzu sauce 2 tsplimes juice of 2To make the stock, pour the water into a saucepan, add the dried shiitake mushrooms and the piece of kombu, then bring to the boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat, then add the dried bonito flakes and set aside for 30 minutes.Rinse the sea bass, then place it in a roasting tin or a large baking dish. Set the oven at 200C/gas 6. Peel the shallots and halve them lengthways. Finely slice the ginger – there is no need to peel it.Drain the stock through a sieve, reserving the shiitake. Return the shiitake to the stock, then add the shallots, ginger, peppercorns and sherry. Bash the stalks of lemongrass with a heavy weight (I use a rolling pin) to splinter them, add them to the stock, then bring it to the boil and ladle it over the fish.Cover the tin with kitchen foil and bake for 30-35 minutes, until the fish is just tender. Remove the foil then lift the fish on to a serving dish (a large fish slice and a palette knife are invaluable here). Remove the strips of lemongrass, as they have done their job.Stir the sesame oil and the ponzu into the stock, check and correct the seasoning with salt and lime juice to taste, then spoon it over the fish.Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
