Andrew Garrad (Letters, 25 November) says that economists could learn from engineers that there is no “right answer”. There are, however, wrong answers. Historically, engineering has learned from its wrong answers, be they collapsed bridges or crashed aeroplanes; if engineering behaved like mainstream economics, it would look at the wreckage of an aeroplane, deny that any crash had occurred and announce that scheduled flights will continue.Michael CarleyDepartment of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bath• Having read and loved all of Alex Wheatle’s books, I found his interview fascinating (Report, 19 November). Undoubtedly, the assumption that black writers writing in patois is effortless is an erroneous and careless judgment. Yet this might be more careless than “a form of white privilege”. Were I, a white girl from the Midlands, to live and work in Jamaica and write a book featuring Cockney rhyming slang, would anyone recognise the effort? Cultural difference is not the same as prejudice.Anna JordanDerby• “Corgi registered” (Letters, 23 November) is as much an anachronism as the monarchy and shovelling “housing benefit” to Buckingham Palace. Since 2009 competent plumbers will have had to be “gas safe”.Paul McGeeStockton on Tees• Isn’t gemütlichkeit the most appropriate translation of hygge?
