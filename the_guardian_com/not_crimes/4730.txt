No doubt, unless it was a coded message to his own four children, David Mowat, the junior health minister, meant well last week when he floated a proposal that “we start thinking as a society about how we deal with the care of our own parents”.Around six months into the job, it has occurred to the primary care minister, he told the communities and local government committee, that a less formal set-up might work wonders. “One thing that has always struck me as I have been doing this role,” he said, “is that nobody ever questions the fact that we look after our children. That is obvious and nobody ever says that is a caring responsibility; it is just what you do.”Perhaps he has yet to learn about the work, not only of social services and family courts, but of the often unfairly maligned Child Support Agency, created precisely because of the hundreds of thousands of parents, from all kinds of backgrounds, who reject their obligations. In those cases, the state can prove, dismaying though this is to accept, more responsible than an absent parent.In fact, as cheering as it must be to see the condition of British parenting through Mr Mowat’s eyes, he might do worse than pause, before extrapolating his own inclinations into a new strategy for social care, than study – to pick one of many compelling literary accounts of intergenerational dysfunction – Edward St Aubyn’s Melrose novels. It would be tricky for anyone familiar with the monstrous father in Never Mind, who sexually abuses his five-year-old son, and with the mother who neglects the child, to argue, as Mowat does, the obvious “fact” of unquestioning parental obligation as indicating a matching, filial version.“I think some of that logic and some of the way that we think about that,” Mowat told the committee, “in terms of the volume of numbers that we are seeing coming down the track, will impinge on the way that we start thinking about how we look after our parents. In a way, it is a similar responsibility in terms of our life cycle.”It is only fair to record that Mowat’s life cycle theory was eagerly received in some quarters, nowhere more so than in the Daily Mail, which responded with a front-page headline, alongside a photograph of the columnist Sarah Vine, who is also Mrs Michael Gove: “Why we, not the state, should look after our elderly parents.” Around the country, middle-aged children rushed to assure blameless octogenarians that, however bad the life cycle gets, a conclusion in the Vine-Gove Retirement Village, prop J Harmsworth, does not await them.As is traditional, when a return to the golden age of intergenerational tenderness is advanced in response to catastrophic failures in social care, there was much enthusiasm for Italian and Greek arrangements. However rubbish the European Union is in every other respect, the custom, in its southernmost regions, of household care for delightful grandparents who have been rendered virtually immortal on a diet of homemade tomato sauce, regularly strikes Conservative ministers as the perfect alternative to an adequately funded British system.Assuming, of course, that the younger carers also recognise their duty to reproduce, thus avoiding the fate of so many Anita Brookner heroines: that of devotion to undeserving parents, without any self-generated singleton trained up for similar sacrifice. Responding to Mowat’s solution, a group of age-related charities noted that “by 2030 there will be two million over 65-year-olds without children”.But Jeremy Hunt has also spoken longingly of private, Italian-style arrangements, in contrast to funded, social care. “Family planning must be as much about care for older generations as planning for younger ones,” he told local government officials. “A wholesale repairing of the social contract so that children see their parents giving wonderful care to grandparents – and recognise that in time, that will be their responsibility, too.”Indeed, you would never guess from Hunt’s vision that, while southern Europe came up with the House of Atraeus, even in the chilly, atomised UK, the single most important source of informal help for widowed, disabled older people is still, according to a Foresight report in 2015, their children. Of these, daughters continue to be the most important source of support.So, whether it’s addressed to those of us blessed with fantastic parents, or to people with no children, or no nearby children, or to families where intergenerational hostility is entirely explicable, (or geographically inevitable), the family guidance is as redundant as it is witless.What’s the plan? For a kind of elderly support agency, extracting funds from thankless children? For care projections based only on the number of old people likely to be childless, independent, disagreeable or foolish enough, not having seen King Lear, to have trusted their transparently malevolent daughters? Opponents of assisted dying, one recalls, are dreadfully anxious about the coercion risk allegedly posed to the vulnerable by the very relations now sought as carers by health ministers.With the number of people aged 80 and over predicted to double by the middle of the century, the number of informal carers will need to increase, accordingly, at a time when more of these carers must keep on working to secure their own pensions. In The Generation Strain report, the Institute For Public Policy Research (IPPR)was clear that “adult children will not be able to provide care for all those who need it”. Supposing the government did, as is sometimes discussed, ensure that carers were helped with flexible hours and leave, there would still be a care gap.Even if the number of adult children who cared for parents for more than 20 hours a week rose by 20%, the IPPR said, that would not keep pace with a 60% increase in demand. “By 2030,” it continued, “we estimate that 230,000 older people who need intense care of more than 20 hours a week could be left to cope alone.”That report came before warnings, following further cuts, of a social care “tipping point” (the Care Quality Commission), then of a “breaking point” (by cross-party MPs), featuring unmet needs, the closure of residential homes and withdrawal of providers, accompanied by a further threat, courtesy of Brexit, to the supply of cheap labour. Two weeks ago, 45 former directors of social services explained why the government must intervene: “Thousands upon thousands of people are suffering and sometimes dying in misery.”Even if a gradual shifting of responsibility were not an abject response to an acute care crisis, Mowat’s idea, acknowledging numbers “coming down the track”, wilfully overlooks, along with single people, non-compliant seniors, just how it would, within the family, be delegated.The constant in informal care – as step-families have proliferated and mothers rejoined the workforce – is that it largely, still, supplied by women. If, as Hunt once rhapsodised, “an elderly person at home is like a living golden treasure”, it’s all too clear who is expected to look after it.• Comments will be opened later
