David Bowie: The Last Five Years9pm, BBC2A year ago this week David Bowie died, and the world immediately seemed to come undone. In this intimate look back, friends and collaborators such as Tony Visconti, Gail Ann Dorsey and Michael C Hall explore his final flowering, through albums The Next Day and Blackstar, and the musical Lazarus. It’s followed on Friday on BBC4 by Bowie At The BBC, a beautiful, funny, charming collage of interviews and performances. Ali CatterallLet It Shine 7pm, BBC1A quick recap: Gary Barlow used to be a judge on ITV’s The X Factor back in those pre-Honey G halcyon days. Now, ITV has poached The Voice from the BBC, and The X Factor is on ice. And so, Gaz is going head to head with the first ITV-hosted series of The Voice with his new BBC show, Let It Shine – which is a bit like those old Andrew Lloyd Webber competitions – as he aims to find five young chaps to star in a musical featuring the music of Take That. Clear? Good. The search begins tonight. Ben ArnoldBritain’s Favourite TV Detectives7.30pm, Channel 4We all love a good crime-cracker, but who are the most beloved nemeses of ne’er-do-wells? From the cosy confines of Dock Green to the gritty likes of Luther, this case file contains many contenders, so it’s time to assemble the prime suspects and pick out the greatest gumshoes of all. Contributors including Dennis Waterman, David Soul and Anthony Horowitz examine our favourites and nominate their own. Mark Gibbings-JonesThe Voice UK 8pm, ITV A switch of channels and a change of coaching lineup sees The Voice warble its way on to ITV. Tom Jones is back, along with Will.i.am, and they’re now joined by American Idol winner/all-round ball of fabulousness Jennifer Hudson and the ex-Mr Gwen Stefani Gavin Rossdale (official job title: “Bush rocker”). Emma Willis is in charge as the blind auditions kick off, so expect spinning chairs and a period of settling in as the new coaches try to make their mark. Hannah VerdierTaboo 9.15pm, BBC1Tom Hardy reunites with Peaky Blinders writer Steven Knight for a febrile period romp. London, 1814: shamanic bounty hunter James Delaney returns from Africa (where his enemies hoped he’d perished) to claim his inheritance. By refusing to sell land to the omnipotent East India Company, he casts his die in a deadly game. Hardy’s Daniel Day-Lewis-ish character immersion powers an opening episode in which Delaney tells everyone to do one, in increasingly florid ways. Jack SealeDiscovering: Ingrid Bergman5pm, Sky ArtsA winner of three Oscars, Ingrid Bergman began her career in Sweden but was adored in the US, where she was a classic Hollywood heroine. However, her career highs were shadowed by a pragmatic association with Nazi Germany and the moralistic outcry that greeted her affair with the director Roberto Rossellini. A repeat airing of a story that reminds you that becoming an icon isn’t something that simply happens. John RobinsonWallander 9pm, Drama These Henning Mankell adaptations were influential in Britain’s ongoing infatuation with chilly Scandi crime drama. This iteration stars Kenneth Branagh as the melancholy titular detective; recently estranged from his wife and investigating three apparently motiveless murders. Sublimely downbeat fare and well worth revisiting, this story boasts an extra layer of intrigue in the shape of an understated, pre-stardom Tom Hiddleston. Phil Harrison Film choice      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   An eerie rites-of-passage story … Walkabout. Photograph: Everett/REX/ShutterstockThe Pledge(Sean Penn, 2001), 9pm, TCMOn the day of his retirement, detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) promises the parents of a little girl murdered in a snow-covered and remote area of Nevada that he will find her killer. His quest becomes an obsession that overshadows his life, and his newfound love for Lori (Robin Wright Penn). This is a crime thriller based on one of Friedrich Dürrenmatt’s hefty tales that becomes a haunting portrait of a soul in torment, and Nicholson has rarely been better. Paul HowletttSex Tape(Jake Kasdan, 2014), 10pm, Channel 5Annie (Cameron Diaz) and Jay (Jason Segel) are happily married, but a little bit bored in the bedroom department, so they make a sex film on their iPad. And guess what? It accidentally gets shared with their friends and colleagues, leaving them scurrying around one panicky night trying to destroy the evidence. A sweet-natured romcom, but it’s all too coy, given the subject matter. Paul HowlettWalkabout(Nicolas Roeg, 1971), 12.45am, BBC2A brother and sister are abandoned in the outback in Roeg’s eerie rites-of-passage story when their father kills himself, and on the long, hot walk back to civilisation they encounter the mystic aboriginal world. Jenny Agutter is the very English rose who takes the Aussie sun in her stride; Lucien John her brother. It lacks the ley-lined menace of Peter Weir’s Picnic At Hanging Rock, but is vividly photographed by Roeg.
