Well, it’s finally happening. Forty-one seasons and 145 cast members later, something truly magical will take place on 1 October when Saturday Night Live welcomes Melissa Villaseñor, the show’s first Latina cast member.Villaseñor is one of three new performers joining the cast, as Mikey Day and Alex Moffat make up the trio replacing Taran Killam, Jay Pharoah, and Jon Rudnitsky, whose contracts were not renewed after a recent shakeup earlier this summer. I wouldn’t necessarily call her a newcomer, however, as Villaseñor – who is best known for reaching the finals in season six of America’s Got Talent – has been working for more than 10 years as a standup comedian across the country.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Despite the fact that this is less about show boss Lorne Michaels’s rebellious ingenuity and more about an inevitable decision to diversify, the hiring of Villaseñor is cause for celebration for the Hispanic community, because it opens a door which was once presumed locked. It’s difficult to comprehend the value of diversity when you’re not directly affected by it, but the issue is particularly acute in entertainment. Despite a slight upswing this year, Hispanics are the least represented speaking roles in film and television. Earlier this year, meanwhile, a study by Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative noted that out of more than 11,000 speaking characters in film and TV, a mere 5.8% were Hispanic.Villaseñor’s introduction to the late-night schedule might not answer everything, but SNL’s huge influence on today’s millennial and digital culture is a platform that can help her (consciously or not) inspire other young Latinas who are struggling just to get in the door. After auditioning for the show in 2009 without success, Villaseñor was determined to work on her craft, knowing that – given another opportunity – she will return. “SNL is one of the main reasons why I started comedy at 15 and I pray to be there someday when I am ready and have even more to offer,” she said seven years ago. “I am very thankful for that experience and will always keep working at new impressions as well as my standup comedy.”Michaels, for his part, gave her and other Hispanic comedians a chance to prove their worth when SNL’s Broadway Video – along with NBC Universal Telemundo – launched Más Mejor, a studio and comedy network aimed at discovering and cultivating Latino talent earlier this year. Villaseñor was a major player in the channel and used it in order to strengthen her skills – if you don’t believe me, watch her in Daily Itineraries, where she performs video diaries as different celebrities (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Lopez are exquisite.)   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest As a viewer my interest in SNL had faded through the years as the lack of diversity (both on stage and in the writer’s room) had become a turn-off and I don’t think they did themselves any favors by not rehiring the multi-talented Pharoah. But now, given the relatively recent additions of African American female talent, including the unstoppable Leslie Jones, seeing a Latina perform at Studio 8H for the very first time means SNL has won me back.And wouldn’t you know it, the new season premieres right in the middle of Hispanic heritage month.
