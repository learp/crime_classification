Afterlight tells the story of Sophie Teague, who after her parent’s death has started being haunted by a ghost, which she calls Eve. Since starting at a new school, for a fresh start, these have become more often. Eve sends her visions of a task which she must complete. These tasks are leading to something that Eve wants Sophie to solve. At her school Sophie comes across Jordan, who unbeknown to her shares her ability and will be the one to help her solve the mystery.Sophie is a great, realistic character, who is understandably flawed and is just like any other teenager, trying to fit in at school. This makes the story a lot more relatable and understandable. Eve is also an interesting and intriguing character. She isn’t really given a voice in the novel, which I think makes her character much more effective. She speaks through her visions and I think it gives the plot quite a unique quality. I was a little disappointed when the story started as I felt it was really rushed and didn’t explain things very well. But towards the end it got much better and more action packed and engaging. There were parts of the novel that I thought needed a little extra information and others that didn’t really need to be mentioned. But the ending definitely made up for this. It did take me a while to get past the fast pace and for me it ruined the novel, especially as it seemed to have a lot of potential. I may try to read it again, now that I’ve got a little used to Rebecca’s style of writing and hopefully I’ll enjoy it a lot more.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
