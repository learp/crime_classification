The search for an easy red lip is an enduring quest. This summer, the answer is to lean towards a fresh ripe cherry, as seen at Oscar de la Renta, or Vivienne Westwood. Easy, youthful, bright. Whether it’s matte and careful, super glossy like an ice-cream topping, or a sheer balm, the aim is to appear as though you didn’t spend hours poring over blogs and magazines, as though your hand is not striped with a rainbow of reds, as though this lipstick just… found you.Get the lookVice in 69 £15 urbandecay.co.ukTom Ford in Lost Cherry £33 tomford.comHot Lips in Electric Poppy £23 charlottetilbury.co.ukChantecaille in Wild Poppy £30 spacenk.comRimmel in Idol Red £6.49 superdrug.comSuqqu Colour Balm Crayon £22 selfridges.comMax Factor in Ruby Tuesday £7.99 boots.comMAC in Abundant £17.50 maccosmetics.co.uk
