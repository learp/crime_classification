The BBC and the government have traded blows over what makes programmes distinctive as the corporation attacked an independent report on the issue.At the Oxford Media Convention on Wednesday morning, the culture secretary, John Whittingdale, called for the BBC to be more distinctive in its output, and questioned “whether or not Strictly or Bake Off or other programmes are too removed or absolutely distinctive”.Rona Fairhead: government must protect BBC independence in charter He told the convention that he believed distinctiveness should be a key goal for the BBC, but it would be up to an external regulator to define how content was judged against it.However, speaking later at the same event, the BBC Trust chairwoman, Rona Fairhead, said shows such as The Great British Bake Off and the natural history programme The Great Barrier Reef showed the BBC was already producing distinctive popular programming. “If ever there was proof that public service can be popular yet distinctive, you see it in these shows.”Asked about Whittingdale’s comments, Fairhead said: “I know you want to make this a big war but it’s not. We both think distinctiveness matters.” Asked whether government evidence on distinctiveness was wrong she said: “I don’t know what his evidence is.”The debate followed the publication on Tuesday of the government-commissioned report that claimed the rest of the broadcasting industry could gain up to £115m a year in additional revenue if the BBC changed the way it commissioned and scheduled content.'Making BBC1, R1 and R2 less populist could benefit BBC's rivals by £115m' However, the BBC’s head of policy, James Heath, disputed the claims, saying the corporation’s most popular channel, BBC1, had become more distinctive. He claimed it offered a broader range of genres in peak time, including almost half on news and current affairs compared with 30% on ITV1, and ITV1 dedicated 45% of its peak hours to entertainment, compared with 25% on the BBC. He also said that arguments the BBC should put greater focus on new shows and formats could mean cutting popular series such as Silent Witness, Countryfile, Casualty, Masterchef and Have I Got News For You, and replacing them would be impossible given the budget cuts the BBC is facing over the next five years.He said: “We don’t believe in reconfiguring the BBC to maximise commercial profits rather than asking how can the BBC be improved to best meet audience needs. This report proposes a BBC designed for the convenience of its competitors, not the enjoyment of audiences, to the long-term detriment of both.”
