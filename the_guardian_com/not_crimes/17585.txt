Unmissable show?Ray Donovan. I became an addict overnight. I’d turn up to work with black bags under my eyes because I couldn’t stop watching. It’s phenomenal, watching this Boston family thrown into the maelstrom that is LA. It’s multifaceted and the performances are fantastic.Earliest TV memory?Adam West in Batman. I was about three years old and my father [Jon Pertwee] was doing A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum in New York. When he got back from the theatre at nights we used to have dinner on his bed and watch Batman. It’s fitting, given that I’m currently in Gotham!Bring back…Worzel Gummidge. It was my dad’s passion his entire life. He always wanted to do something with Barbara Euphan Todd’s books. It’s something that’s sadly missing now on television: true family entertainment. It was a way for families to sit together. And it featured a myriad of actors: people used to ring the house on Sunday night, including Billy Connolly, asking my father for a part on the show. It got to that stature.Pitch us a TV show…There’s a fantastic British pulp writer called Christopher Fowler, who wrote The Bureau Of Lost Souls. It’s 12 short stories about the underbelly of London. We want to make a TV version. We’ve written one episode, about a cat that kills its owner. I’d like to see standalone, well-executed Tales Of The Unexpected-style television again on a Sunday night.Mastermind specialist subject?Eighties and 90s hip-hop. I spent a lot of time in the 80s in New York and met a lot of the rap artists of the time: A Tribe Called Quest, Leaders Of The New School, which was Busta Rhymes’s group, a couple of the Wu. It’s a true art form. I was lucky enough to meet Kool Herc at a party. He went: “Yo, Alfred!” He’s a fan of the show! It was one of the most extraordinary experiences of my life: meeting the founder of hip-hop.Gotham: Rise Of The Villains, Monday, 10pm, Channel 5
