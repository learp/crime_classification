I was an only child. I weighed about 11lb – a whopper. My mother said: “Never again!” I had lovely parents: they taught me that the most precious thing you can give a child is your time.My father always had time to play in the park with me. I would wait for him to have his supper and then he would come straight out with me. Lots of fathers might not want to do that these days. I think my dad was exceptionally nice and thoughtful. You can’t fake that kind of enthusiasm. Children always know.Mother was a voracious reader – she came back from the Boots the Chemist library every week with half a dozen books, and she would devour them. She taught me the value of books and reading. In many ways, my parents were my best teachers.My grandfather lived quite nearby and he thought the light shone out of me, for some reason. I used to sit at the window waiting for him, and as soon as I saw him, I’d run all the way down the road to greet him. He used to say to me: “You can do anything you like in the world, if you really want to, but you’ve got to stick at it.” I followed his advice. I used to love staying with Auntie Em, too. She was probably what modern parents would call a great multitasker – she could give me a bath and have a fag at the same time.My childhood was pretty idyllic. We went on bucket-and-spade holidays to the Isle of Wight, staying in a strict guesthouse where you had to be out all day. My father, always a stickler for the right way to do things, would wear his hat in the sea – much like Paddington.I didn’t enjoy school and left at 14. Mother decided to send me to a boys’ Catholic school, mainly because she liked the purple blazer. To get there, I had to go past the local state school: they would throw things at me, on account of the awful blazer. In a good summer, it would bleach out to a pale pink, which didn’t help. At school, there was a lot of bullying among the boys, and the brothers all had rustling black gowns and carried black straps.We took in two evacuees during the war, when my father was in the Home Guard. It was difficult because they were so sad, and they didn’t get on with each other. One would sit by the fireplace crying and the other was extremely bossy. I was still a child myself, but mature enough to realise that what they were going through was awful.My daughter Karen was born the same year that the first Paddington story was published, so they have grown up together – like siblings. She had a dislocated hip at a time when not much was known about it. She went through a bad time of it as a child – so many operations. I’ve got four grandchildren: Karen has three older children, and my son Anthony has one little lad. I have never pressed my books on any of them, but they have always been interested.I wish I had treated my mother and father better. I think I went through a stage when I thought it was more important to make a good living. We spent time together as they grew older. We’d go out for drives in one of my fast cars, but they weren’t that keen on it. Mother usually had her eyes closed going down a hill, so she would miss the view.When she died, Father came to live with us. I’d make him a boiled egg for breakfast every morning, and every morning he’d tell me it was great. I sometimes used to yearn for him to tell me it was a fucking awful one – I’d have loved that. But he never would have, he was far too well-mannered.• Love From Paddington (HarperCollins, £5.99) is out in paperback on 7 April
