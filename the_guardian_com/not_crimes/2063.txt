The situation with mackerel stocks in the north east Atlantic is a farce rapidly becoming a tragedy. It's one of the best examples of human greed in fishing on the planet. When we started the mac bap campaign two and a half years ago, mackerel was certified as sustainable and part of a well managed fishery. The supply was robust enough to support our campaign to get more mackerel on the menus of our restaurants and fish shops.Now politics and greed are getting in the way of common sense. The feud over mackerel quotas between the EU and Norway on the one hand, and Iceland and the Faroes on the other has hit stalemate. But if the countries involved could only agree sensible catch limits this could still be a certified sustainable fishery. The issue could be resolved at a stroke, and we could all go back to eating mackerel again with a clear conscience.Despite the political problems with the mackerel fishery, I believe we can and should still eat mackerel occasionally. MCS are advising that handline-caught mackerel from inshore boats is the best choice to make when eating mackerel. So at our River Cottage cookery school and canteens we will continue to serve south west handline caught mackerel on an occasional basis.This may seem contradictory to some, and it is a difficult decision to make, but we do not wish to withdraw our support from small scale local fishermen who are catching mackerel in the most sustainable way possible. I don't believe they should be penalised for a problem which is being caused at the level of international politics. The politicians on the other hand should be aware that they are in danger of putting sustainable fishermen – and indeed a massive, sustainable fishery – out of business.
