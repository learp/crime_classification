There has always been a concern that companies that are not in the public eye are failing to embed sustainability into their operations.Now we have some hard evidence with the release of a report by NGO WWF which shows that while many retailers across Europe are heeding the call to move to the responsible sourcing of soy, companies operating behind the scenes in the animal feed, meat and egg sectors are largely failing to act.The survey of 88 major companies from the UK, Denmark, France, Sweden and the Netherlands, lauds consumer facing companies such as Marks & Spencer and Waitrose for being on track to source all their soy from certified sources by 2015.However, it claims that even some household names in the UK, such as Bernard Matthews, Iceland, Nando's and Findus failed to respond to queries, and major European corporations such as France's Danone have yet to take meaningful action.Highlighting the scandal that half of the certified soy that is already being produced is failing to find buyers, WWF says there is little interest being shown by companies which tend to evade pressure from civil society."With around three quarters of soy globally going into animal and fish feed, WWF is pleased to bring some transparency to a supply chain characterised by unfamiliar companies relatively insulated from consumer concerns about what soy production might be doing to forests, communities or the global climate," says Sandra Mulder, leader of WWF's global soy programme."If we are to reduce the negative impacts of soy production, these are the companies that are going to have to lift their game, while the retailers and consumer product suppliers need to make sure that they do."Around half the feed, meat and egg companies surveyed failed to provide the information WWF requested. In the UK, these included meat and egg companies Moy Park and Noble Foods, and animal feed manufacturer BOCM Pauls.The report, released to coincide with the annual meeting of the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS), says the cost of credits is only marginally higher than non-certified soy and Mulder says there is therefore "no excuse for companies not to calculate their soy use and begin to cover it by RTRS credits now."Taking into account current prices for soy, the additional costs for RTRS credits are negligible, less than half a per cent."Referring to the lack of action by some consumer facing businesses in the UK, Duncan Williamson, food policy manager at WWF, said that companies must take responsibility for reducing deforestation, environmental degradation and social conflict in Latin America, where soya is mainly coming from."It's hugely disappointing, given the scale of threats posed to tropical forests and savannahs from soy plantations, that companies like Bernard Matthews, Iceland, Findus, Dairy Crest and Nando's as well as animal feed and soy producers more widely are showing little sign of doing this," he said."It is perfectly possible, as UK companies like Marks & Spencer and Waitrose can clearly demonstrate."WWF identified those companies that "have started the journey", including ASDA, the Co-operative group, Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury's.The report shows a wide variation of performance between European countries. Dutch and Swedish companies routinely scored at the top of their sectors, which WWF says can be mostly attributed to the power of their national industry commitments.In the UK, while individual retail companies are ahead of the curve, WWF says their commitments have not always translated into the purchase of responsible soy.In France, WWF says there is still no company filling the "leader position" and the Danish market, despite having one of the largest animal products production industries in Europe, has not progressed as far as other countries.One of the positive results of the report was that companies had more knowledge and awareness of the soy supply chain than expected. Many businesses have started to calculate the amount of soy they use, which is a vital first step to setting targets. By making commitments public, WWF says companies can send a signal to soy farmers that demand will rise for responsible sourced produce.In response to WWF's criticism, a Nando's spokesperson said sustainable soy is on their agenda and that the company is "in very early stages of investigating methods of how we can achieve this. We work with several suppliers who use soy and were not able to gather the answers to the WWF Soy Report Card within the requested deadline. We are currently in the process of re-contacting our suppliers and once we have this information, we would be very happy to meet with WWF to discuss this."Moy Park responded saying all the soy they source for broiler feed comes from certified suppliers, while Iceland said they do not directly buy soya for use as an ingredient or for animal feed. Other companies contacted by the Guardian were unavailable for comment.The supply chain hub is funded by the Fairtrade Foundation.
