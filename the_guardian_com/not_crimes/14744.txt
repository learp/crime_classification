This morning the heavy leaves of chestnut and sycamore are showering down, falling straight through the still air; the cork has formed between them and the twigs, they have ceased to function as lungs, the tree needs them no more, and so they are thrown away. The trees are preparing to rest, as also are many insects. The curtains were taken down to be washed, and in the upper folds of one we found a large slumbering wasp. Her legs were cuddled together, her sensitive antennae laid back; she was resting until the spring should recall her to maternal duties. When touched she slowly moved her limbs, but only to clutch the fabric more securely; she moved deliberately and stupidly, more like nectar-fuddled bumble-bee than the smart, active wasp. Curtain-folds are favoured vespan hibernacula, but their selection often leads to the undoing of the would-be slumberer.A letter received to-day has bearing on two of my recent notes. An observer passing Hatchmere about five o'clock was struck by the immense gathering of starlings which were preparing to roost in the reeds, and by the combined "sizzling" of their evening clamour. When he repassed at 11p.m. the birds were still twittering on their unstable perches. Hatchmere is one of the nightly roosts of myriads of starlings. In one flock he noticed a pure white starling, by no means a common freak. I well remember one which we watched nightly when the flocks were indulging in their evening flight before dropping into the reed-bed at Maelog Lake, in Anglesey. Not only did it show up wonderfully, its spotless dress contrasted with those of its darker companions, but when, as it wheeled or changed direction smartly, its plumage caught the last rays of the setting sun, it seemed to flash like burnished silver.
