Jullien Gaer (Letters, 12 November) displays ignorance; the sari is the normal dress of Indian women of all ranks and stations in life. It was not at all inappropriate for Theresa May to wear a sari to a reception in Bengaluru. It would have been regarded as a courteous affirmation of Indian customs and is no more incongruous than an Indian politician wearing evening dress at a similar event in the UK.Dr Mike ParsonsGloucester• It’s not just films and theatre that need to be “more human” in these politically prejudiced and uncertain times (G2, 15 November). The “fine” art world is in hock to the international art market. Instead of providing us all with emotionally nourishing and mentally enriching experiences, it gives us over-intellectualised, detached , cold and frequently pretentious, baffling exhibitions.Judy LiebertNottingham• Please explain to those of us who are not millennials the meaning of “meme” (Shortcuts, G2, 15 November) and “trope”?  Neither are in my Concise Oxford Dictionary but appear routinely in the Guardian. Are these terms used by writers, perhaps the wrong side of 40, wishing to “get down with the kids”?Les FarrisSouth Petherton, Somerset• A masterclass in letter-writing sounds a bit overblown (Letters, 15 November). Letters should be short, to the point, one issue at a time and, in the age of Trump and Farage, perhaps a little appropriate humour won’t go amiss either.Keith FlettLondon• It was flattering, but I’m not sure the Guardian would approve my participation in a masterclass with the legendary Keith Flett, judging by the non-publication of my letters over the last 10 weeks. Letter-writing, no. Resilience, maybe?Bernie EvansLiverpool• A 67-year-old woman in jeans (Letters, 14 November). What else would I wear with Dr Martens?Ruth RhodenKidderminster• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
