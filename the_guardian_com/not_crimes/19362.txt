Photograph: Bleddyn ButcherInterviewed for our My Best Shot feature this week, Bleddyn Butcher told us about his lost weekend in Berlin with Nick Cave in 1985. “Back then, no one thought his career would last so long. The Birthday Party were viewed as a goth band: just tight pants and doomy music. That’s not what I heard in it, though, and I felt frustrated. I wanted to show there was more to Cave than a tough guy with incredible hair.”What we learned this weekNewly discovered Van Gogh drawings aren’t by Van Gogh at all, says official museum …… and the news has ushered in the post-truth phase of the art worldHelen Marten won the inaugural Hepworth prize for sculptureThe Design Museum’s inaugural exhibition features Grindr, Ikea and George Osborne’s wallpaperA new performance art show explores touch – from tender to predatoryJon McNaughton is summing up Trump’s America with his oil paintingsThe new Gilbert Galleries at the V&A remind us of the divine – and profane – power of gold in the age of TrumpAdrian Searle had a relentlessly odd experience at Tino Sehgal’s show at the Palais de Tokyo in ParisAn ingenious folding bike helmet won the James Dyson design award Claudio Rasano won the Taylor Wessing prize for portrait photography…..… and we rounded up a few of the highlights from the exhibition his winning shot is featured inPsychologist Darian Leader put artist Gavin Turk on the couchThe Turner prize should give up its age limitAlbanian prime minister Edi Rama is also a jobbing artist – with a new exhibition in New YorkNimrud was recaptured from Isis – here’s hoping their barbarism is consigned to historyGet involvedBook now for two Guardian members’ events: Night at the Museum, at Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery on 29 November, and Insider’s View of Intrigue: James Ensor by Luc Tuymans, at London’s Royal Academy on 20 January.Our A-Z of Art series continues – share your art with the theme N for North SeaAnd check out the entries we selected for the theme M for majestyDon’t forgetTo follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign
