Prince’s sister has said the superstar musician had no known will and that she has filed paperwork asking a Minneapolis court appoint a special administrator to oversee his estate.Tyka Nelson filed the paperwork on Tuesday in Carver County probate court. Prince died at age 57 on Thursday at his estate in suburban Minneapolis. No cause of death has yet been released. Nelson is his only surviving full sibling. Nelson says in her filing that an emergency exists because immediate action is necessary to manage Prince’s business interests. She’s asked that Bremer Trust, a corporate trust company, be named administrator. With some $27m in property and an outpouring of nostalgia over the pop star’s death, Prince’s heirs could stand to inherit a small fortune. The size of the fortune is not clear, and recent disputes suggest money was tight.
