The 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death is being marked by numerous screen and stage productions, but perhaps the most original so far is a play that isn’t by Shakespeare and in which he doesn’t appear. Peter Whelan’s The Herbal Bed, premiered by the RSC in 1996, has been revived by the Royal & Derngate Northampton and English Touring Theatre.Play to explore alleged romance between Shakespeare and Earl of Southampton  The play belongs to English drama’s very small group of significant Shakespearean bio-dramas, having been preceded by Edward Bond’s Bingo (1973) and followed by the stage version of Shakespeare in Love (2014), adapted by Lee Hall from the Oscar-winning script of the movie, credited to Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman. Otherwise, I know only of George Bernard Shaw’s short puppet play, Shakes versus Shav (1949), Ian Wild’s Mrs Shakespeare (2014), in which the dramatist is reincarnated as a modern woman, and Roy Chatfield’s The Other Shakespeare (2014), a monologue for Anne Hathaway. There is also a musical comedy, No Bed for Bacon (1959), adapted by Ned Sherrin and Caryl Brahms from the latter’s comic novel written with SJ Simon. My encyclopaedic colleague, Michael Billington, directed me to Will Shakespeare: An Invention in Four Acts, premiered in London in 1921 under the name of Clemence Dane, a nom de plume used by the writer Winifred Ashton. The play has vanished from the professional repertoire, but is freely available online.

Photograph: Mark Douet The main reasons that playwrights have been so wary of dramatising Shakespeare are the likelihood of comparative failure – writing a play about him being akin to a keen amateur golfer offering to play a round with Rory McIlroy – and the lack of information about the central character.The Herbal Bed review – sex, lies and Shakespeare's daughter  It’s striking, for example, that both The Herbal Bed and Bingo are based on court cases from towards the end of Shakespeare’s life. Whelan draws on the record of one of the author’s daughters, Susanna Hall, defending herself against a charge of adultery in a church court, while Bond’s starting point is a legal dispute in Warwickshire in which Shakespeare sided with other landowners in an effort to protect his rents.  An oddity of Shakespearean biography is that a majority of what is known about the author comes from the paper trail of these court cases and the last will and testament in which he famously left his second-best bed to Anne Hathaway. And a bestselling book by Charles Nicholl, The Lodger (2008), re-created a 1612 property case in London in which Shakespeare gave evidence. So, if the man and his family had not been so prone to becoming involved in litigation, there would be almost no trace of him at all.

Clemence Dane made the easy – but dramatically fatal – mistake of imagining that the Shakespeares spoke blank verse at home. “What! Do you make our bond our barrier now?” demands Anne Hathaway during a marital spat. When she questions her young husband’s belief that he can make his living as a writer, he defends his plays as “a dream, a bubble, Anne, and yet a world”. Shaw also imposes iambic rhythm on the dialogue, although over a more forgivable four pages rather than Dane’s four acts. “I, William Shakes, was born in Stratford town / Where every year a festival is held,” his puppet Bard soliloquises. Bond, in Bingo, finds the most convincing voice for Shakespeare. Speaking a recognisable modern English in contrast to the phonetically presented Warwickshire dialect of the locals, the dying writer is given bleak, Lear-like prose, as when snowfall makes him reflect: “How perfect, but it only lasts one night. When I was young, I’d have written on it with a stick. A song.” Perhaps the biggest surprise, in a country where “bardolatry” has been identified as an artistic sin, is how lacking in sycophancy the plays mainly are. Will Shakespeare, No Bed for Bacon and Shakespeare in Love all employ a comic contrast between the baffled scrabbling of the writer’s private life and his sublime poetic creativity. The scripts by Dane, Sherrin-Brahms-Simon and Hall-Stoppard-Norman also all share a subplot in which a young woman in love with the dramatist disguises herself as a boy to take a part in Romeo and Juliet. At this distance, and with the first four writers dead, it is now impossible to unravel the patterns of influence or simultaneous inspiration that led to this overlap.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian Bond’s characterisation is the most daring, his Shakespeare being a hypocrite whose death results from an acceptance of the gap between the radicalism of his plays and the exploitative values of his life. The fierceness of this critique is in line with Bond’s seemingly competitive relationship with the English national poet, having responded to Shakespeare’s greatest tragedy in both Lear (1971) and, more obliquely, The Fool (1974), his bio-drama about the poet John Clare. Bond, however, is respectful to his profession’s leader in comparison with Shaw, who himself rewrote one of the tragedies as Caesar and Cleopatra and leaves little doubt about the implied victor in the title bout billed in Shakes Versus Shav, where the younger playwright claims his own Heartbreak House to be a perfecting of King Lear.Shakespeare 400: what to see and where to go  Reading Will Shakespeare: An Invention in Four Acts did nothing to convince me that Dane’s play should be revived in this year of Shakespeare celebrations, or indeed at any other time. Sadly, there also seems unlikely to be a quatercentenary staging of Bingo. But Whelan’s The Herbal Bed seems a minor classic in James Dacre’s current production, which moves between poignant domestic scenes and terrifying ecclesiastical intrigue. While Shakespeare is not among the cast, Whelan makes him a vivid and tantalising off-stage presence, which is perhaps the canniest solution to the dramatic challenge of characterising the creator of Hamlet and King Lear.The Herbal Bed is on tour until 7 May
