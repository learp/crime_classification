This hilarious book is about... yes, a talking raven called Croakbag, who tells the story of his owner Perilus and the crazy adventures he goes on. Croakbag is really funny because he tells lots of jokes and he likes biscuits (specifically, digestives). He is a talking Raven with an attitude and he lives in ancient Rome. Croakbag thinks he is clever but really he is not.His owner Perilus supports his friend, Scorcher, who is a charioteer with no chariot. There is a really nasty man who lives over the road with his wife, who is nasty too. They put Scorcher in jail on the day of his big race, so Perilus decides to take his place. On the day of the big race Perilus manages to get a chariot… Can he win Scorcher his place in the green team?
