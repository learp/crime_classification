 The system isn’t going to change things for us because for the system, things are working. Exxon don’t need a revolution. The systems are set up to prevent genuine true change happening. The good news as far as all of us are concerned is that change ultimately comes about through the will of the people.”This was the call by Russell Brand to more than 1,000 people who came together in London on Saturday to “break down silos and join up diverse struggles, by showing the links between climate and social justice.” Most of those who attended came from social and environmental groups across the UK and Europe.The event was called This Changes Everything in a nod to the book by Naomi Klein, who spoke via Skype. Other speakers who attended were Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party, journalist Paul Mason and the poet and environmental activist Nnimmo Bassey.Comedian and author Francesca Martinez shared the personal story of her political awakening: I went through a period of feeling very abnormal. The world made me feel I was faulty; a freak. One day I woke up and realised I had never met a normal person – and it was a profoundly political awakening. My insecurities had everything to do with living in a culture that breeds dissatisfaction. These disgusting ideals are a clear ploy to depoliticise people because the first step to creating a better world is to believe in one and if you’re too busy worrying about your thigh gap or that you’re balding you’re not going to put that energy into things that matter.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Francesca Martinez : ‘If we are going to build a mass movement, we need to reconnect with ourselves’Asad Rehman, who leads the international climate campaign at Friends of the Earth, said: People power defeated apartheid – only people power can stop the climate crisis. This Changes Everything is a clarion call for a set of demands that unite the social, economic and climate justice movements. People’s demands on energy, food, housing and justice that speak to the needs of ordinary people and provide a positive vision of a cleaner, safer and more just society.
