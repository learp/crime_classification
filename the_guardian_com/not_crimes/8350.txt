The financial backers of the McDonald’s biopic The Founder have launched legal action against the film’s US distributors the Weinstein Company, claiming the latter breached an agreement not to release it too closely to similar films.Speedee Distribution, a subsidiary of entertainment-industry giant FilmNation that reportedly put up most of The Founder’s $25m budget, says that the seven-day gap between the film’s release and that of another Weinstein Co product, the Matthew McConaughey adventure film Gold, was too small, and therefore broke a blackout agreement the companies had signed when the distribution rights were purchased in March 2015.

At all relevant times, the two films have been marketed to potential moviegoers in the same way ... conveying an effective binary choice to the viewer: to see one movie or the other.” The suit cites as evidence advertisements for the two films that appeared opposite each other in the New York Times on 27 January, with similar critical endorsements.The suit focuses on the release dates of the two films: The Founder was given a limited released based around a premiere event at the ArcLight Hollywood movie theatre on 7 December (which qualified it for Oscar submission) but was then given a much wider release (on more than 1,000 screens) on 20 January. Gold had a similar pattern, a limited play on 30 December, followed by a release on 2,000-plus screens on 27 January.Speedee is asking for a $15m payment which it claims it is owed if the distribution agreement is breached.Lawyers for the Weinstein Co said: “The Weinstein Company did not breach its contract and it will defend itself vigorously in court.”
