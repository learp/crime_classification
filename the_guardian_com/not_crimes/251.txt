Almost half of Londoners think hundreds of new towers planned for the capital will have a negative effect on the city’s skyline, a poll suggests.Polling for the government’s heritage body, Historic England, found that 48% felt this way, compared with 34% who thought the tall buildings would have a positive effect on the skyline.Heritage experts are calling for a London-wide approach to buildings that affect views of the city after a recent assessment showed 436 towers of 20 or more storeys are in the pipeline for the capital.Historic England has said limits on who is consulted on tall building proposals need to be reviewed and that a pan-London approach to the skyline is also needed. Currently is normally only people in the immediate area who are consulted.Its suggestions appear to be backed by the poll of 1,011 adults by YouGov, which found 60% of those questioned believed people across the city should have a say if a tall building was proposed for an area of historical importance.All planning applications are open to comment but more than half of the Londoners polled (58%) said they did not know how to do so.The number of towers going up or planned for the capital is revealed in the London Tall Buildings Survey. Published last month by the independent New London Architecture forum, it found that of the 436 towers under construction, approved or in the planning process, one in seven were 40 storeys or more and that eight were 60 storeys or higher.The majority of the tall buildings are clustered in certain areas, in particular Tower Hamlets and Greenwich, the study found. Concerns have previously been raised about the impact of a slew of new towers affecting the Unseco world heritage site around the Houses of Parliament, with the UN body choosing not to put it on the at-risk list, but continuing to monitor the situation.Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: “Londoners know how special their city is, and they know that the future of our capital hangs in the balance. Tall buildings can make an excellent contribution to city life if they are well-placed and well-designed. But in the wrong places, they can do serious harm.“It matters when tall buildings spring up in the wrong places, overshadowing our crescents and squares, our playgrounds and palaces, canals and cathedrals.“Today, Londoners have shown that they want to have more of a say over how London’s future skyline is developed. The millions of people who live and work in the city need to be better informed and more involved in the changes that are gathering pace.”Historic England is calling for wider public involvement in the way the city develops in the run-up to the next version of the London plan, a development strategy for the Greater London Area to be drawn up by the new mayor after mayoral elections in May.
