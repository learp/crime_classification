Beyoncé is slowly unveiling her latest mysterious artwork – a special event titled Lemonade that will air on HBO at 9pm on Saturday.Fans are currently trying to work out what exactly the “world premiere event” will be – is it a film, a new album, a series of video clips? – with the one-minute trailer for the HBO show resembling nothing so much as a horror film.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Beyoncé’s blonde braids and a fur coat cover her face, before split-second flashes of dark images – a single light in an abandoned room, an empty car park, looming storm clouds and an empty cornfield – mixed in with dancers and Beyoncé herself.“The past and the present emerge to meet us here,” Beyoncé announces. Canadian model Winnie Harlow, who has vitiligo, appears briefly wearing a crown of thorns. Alarms hiss and buzz and Beyoncé swings a baseball bat in front of a shop that explodes into flames.Mystery is part of Beyoncé’s appeal. She famously released her last album Beyoncé in December 2013 with no prior announcement, and did the same this year with the premiere of the single Formation before her controversial February Super Bowl performance.A new album has been rumored for months, with fans circulating supposed leaked album tracklists showing apparent collaborations with Adele, Frank Ocean, FKA Twigs, Kendrick Lamar and Mariah Carey on Twitter – although none have been verified. Her Formation World Tour begins in Miami on 27 April.Beyoncé has given only one interview in the last two and a half years, a recent chat with Elle magazine to help launch her new athleisure line Ivy Park, a collaboration with Top Shop that launched last week.But Beyoncé did at least hint on upcoming themes in her art, when asked by Elle about the next stage of her career.“I hope I can create art that helps people heal. Art that makes people feel proud of their struggle,” she said. “Everyone experiences pain, but sometimes you need to be uncomfortable to transform. Pain is not pretty, but I wasn’t able to hold my daughter in my arms until I experienced the pain of childbirth.”
