Paul Feig’s next project will be Supermodel Snowpocalypse, a comedy based on the true story of a group of models who got snowed in during a ski resort photoshoot.Feig isn’t directing, but will produce the film for Paramount, according to Variety. It will be based on an Elle magazine article that purports to reveal “fashion’s best-kept secret”. In 1977, a group of male and female models, including up-and-coming star Jerry Hall, left New York for Chile, where they were to pose for a catalogue – The Fabulous Furs of Neiman Marcus – on top of a mountain two hours northeast of Santiago. The weather turned after they arrived at their hotel, stranding the models with little more than their furs, some disco music and – thanks to some enterprising locals – drift-fuls of cocaine.

Feig’s Ghostbusters reboot has performed fairly well at the US box office after a flurry of fury from sexists furious that the property was being relaunched with an all-female principal cast. It’s currently fourth in the US box office chart, having opened with $46m, below expectations. With a production budget of $144m, studio Sony was hoping to make the shortfall at the global box office, but has been hampered by China banning the film. Chinese censors do not allow films that “promote cults or superstition”.
