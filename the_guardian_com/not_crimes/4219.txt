Re the death of Dag Hammarskjöld (Letters, 28 August): I spent some time in Palestine in 2000 with a Rhodesian nurse who had been present when the crashed aircraft was searched. She told me she had seen Hammarskjöld’s body before it was taken away, and there were no marks on it that would confirm the plane had been hit by a missile, as is occasionally suggested. She died a few years ago.George RoussopoulosHindhead, Surrey• I note that in your autumn arts preview (G2, 29 August) upcoming events are located as follows: London, 26; Liverpool, 2; St Leonards on Sea, 1; Bristol, 1; Newcastle upon Tyne, 1; Washington (DC, not Tyne and Wear), 1; Birmingham, 0; Manchester, 0; Leeds, 0; Nottingham, 0; Leicester, 0; York, 0; All of Wales, 0; All of Scotland, 0; Everywhere else, 0.
