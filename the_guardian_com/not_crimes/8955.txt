This graphic novel, as you may have guessed, is based on Northern Lights. For me this was great as I bought Northern Lights a while back and found it much to complicated to read. This graphic novel sets out, easily, the story of Lyra Belacqua and her little daemon.I found the illustrations easy, simple and concise with words that worked with them. As you can see this is only part 1 of Northern Lights so there is more to come. I think this plot is basically the same as the first third of the novel: Lyra Belacqua is a child in a school (Jordan College) far to old for her where she runs free with her daemon. When her uncle arrives, everything changes.She is taken away to a mysterious lady’s house and escapes, going on the run and hiding from the Gobblers – people who kidnap children. In the streets of a city, she is in trouble until she meets the gypsies, a travelling bunch on boats with a kind heart.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Sailing far away to the Fens, the kingdom of the gypsies, Lyra is desperate for some action. Will her wish be granted when the gypsies, with their valiant leader John Farr, set off to rescue children captured by the Gobblers? (Well I don’t know either but I’ll do another review when part 2 comes out!)This easy, readable book really allowed me to get the hang of the story. The clear illustrations made it so easy to understand. The words gave a simple explanation of what happened whilst keeping me glued to my seat. One thing that could be improved is saying the time and place of each scene; if they had included that it would have made it even easier to process. Overall it was a brilliant graphic novel which I would recommend to over 9s and budding YA lovers. Even those who have already read Northern Lights should still have a look.
