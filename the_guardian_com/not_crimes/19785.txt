This book is about Daisy and Jack. Daisy is a normal girl who hates most boys, especially Jack. Jack is a normal boy who hates most girls, especially Daisy. Daisy and Jack go to the same class in school.This story is set out like a diary and the reader knows who is telling the story because there are different types of writing for Daisy and Jack. They mostly describe the same events but Daisy tells the story from her point of view and Jack tells the story from his point of view. They both usually get into trouble for the same sort of naughtiness. Can they put up with each other and can they think of good enough ways to get revenge on each other?I like this book because it is very funny and I could not stop reading it once I started.

If you are a boy and you ever wondered what girls think or you are a girl and ever wondered what boys think then this is a book for you.Want to tell the world about a book youâ€™ve read?
