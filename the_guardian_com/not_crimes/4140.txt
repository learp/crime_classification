While he made albums virtually by himself, like an introvert, his concerts were in the grand extroverted tradition of rhythm-and-blues showmen like James Brown. His music pulled together rock and funk, gospel and jazz, pop ballads and 12-bar blues. His most distinctive rhythm – a choppy, keyboard-driven funk – has permeated pop, hip-hop and dance music, while his ballad style echoes in hits like TLC’s Waterfalls. ...“He’s one of the greatest ones,” says George Clinton, himself an architect of modern funk. “He’s a hell of a musician; he has really studied everything. And he’s working all the time. Even when he’s jamming he’s recording that. He gets to party; he listens to everything on the radio; he goes out to clubs, and then he goes to the studio and stays up the rest of the night working. He has more stuff recorded than anybody gets to hear.“Sometimes I think he puts too much effort into trying to take what’s out now and put his own thing on it. To me, ain’t none of the pop stuff happening that’s half as good as what he can do.”FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.12am BST03:12Minneapolis mourns its Prince – in pictures  KMOJ host of afternoon drive time show Walter Q Bear Banks (left) and Shed G embraced each other as they talked about the death of Prince.

Yes, I worried at the time that Purple Rain might be too adult for a child, but this was Prince, dammit! And I wanted him to hear this music on the big movie speakers and share this joy with me. As a concession to appropriateness, I'd whip out my hand whenever anything too sexy appeared on screen.Today my son is as big a music lover as I am and perhaps an even bigger Prince fan. He remembered my taking him to that film (and also Stop Making Sense), and today we mourned the death of this incredible musician. I may not have tons of money, but I know I enriched my son's life with my love of books, all kinds of music, film, and people. You just can't go wrong in life with a good music library and the best speaker system you can buy. #RIPPrinceFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.50am BST02:50Prince fans mourn the loss of music legend outside his Paisley Park homeRyan FeltonAs hundreds of Prince fans gathered outside his Paisley Park home on Thursday to mourn the loss of the music icon, local resident Julie Reid recalled her surprise sighting of the superstar just this week.Reid, 48, was quietly getting a haircut on Sunday when a receptionist came back and exclaimed: “Oh my gosh, Prince is outside riding his bike.”“I loved him – oh, I loved him when I was growing up. So I ran out there – with foils in my hair.”Outside, Prince politely waved at her, Reid said, but when she held up her camera he firmly wagged his finger back, a testament to his penchant for privacy. Still, she snapped a quick photo, which revealed a short figure appearing to be Prince, casually riding his bike along the road.Prince fans mourn the loss of music legend outside his Paisley Park home FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.47am BST02:47Spike Lee's Prince dance party in BrooklynSpike Lee’s public celebration of Prince, publicised on Instagram, is underway in Brooklyn.The party is at the headquarters for Lee’s film production company, 40 Acres and a Mule, in Fort Greene.

A world tour followed 11 years later in 2003. Welcome 2 Australia came about in 2012 and, earlier this year, he performed intimate shows as part of A Piano and a Microphone.Beat.com.au remembers Prince’s after-party performance at Bennett’s Lane in 2003 as “one of Melbourne’s most spectacular secret performances, where fans paid a mere $20 to witness Prince in the tiny jazz club.”He had two number-one singles in Australia (When Doves Cry in 1984 and The Most Beautiful Girl in the World in 1994) and three number-one albums (Purple Rain in 1984, Diamonds and Pearls in 1991, Love Symbol in 1992).1999 (1983), Let’s Go Crazy (1984), Kiss (1986), Batdance (1989), Gett Off (1991), Cream (1991), Sexy MF (1992) and My Name Is Prince (1992) all made the top 10.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.04am BST02:04My heart goes out to this teacher.✨ diamond ✨ (@shvrdae)When my teacher found out Prince died pic.twitter.com/biNapKWJBUApril 21, 2016FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.04am BST02:04Why you can't listen to Prince's music onlineAs office workers attempting to mourn Prince discreetly with headphones on will be finding today, it’s no easy feat to listen to his music online. He has no official station on YouTube or Vevo, and his catalogue on Spotify and Apple Music is sparse.Last summer, Prince withdrew his music from all streaming services except Jay-Z’s initiative Tidal, in what the Daily Beast describes as “his final middle finger to an exploitative record industry and last act of badassery in a career devoted to championing artists’ rights”.He’d also expressed support for Taylor Swift’s stand against Apple Music when the service was not paying artists for streams during its three-month free trial period.Prince (@prince)"Spotify is co-owned by record labels, who hold 20 percent of the company’s stocks." - The Daily Beast http://t.co/qQtZ02OOZrJune 25, 2015His interview with Dorian Lynskey for the Guardian in 2011 revealed the extent of his distaste for the internet (though his subsequent embrace of Twitter and Instagram suggests he might’ve come round a bit in more recent years). “The industry changed,” he says. “We made money [online] before piracy was real crazy. Nobody’s making money now except phone companies, Apple and Google. I’m supposed to go to the White House to talk about copyright protection. It’s like the gold rush out there. Or a carjacking. There’s no boundaries. I’ve been in meetings and they’ll tell you, Prince, you don’t understand, it’s dog-eat-dog out there. So I’ll just hold off on recording.”His management’s pre-interview list of guidelines insisted, “Please do not discuss his views on the internet,” but perhaps Prince hasn’t read them. “I personally can’t stand digital music,” he says. “You’re getting sound in bits. It affects a different place in your brain. When you play it back, you can’t feel anything. We’re analogue people, not digital.” He’s warming to his theme. “Ringtones!” he exclaims. “Have you ever been in a room where there’s 17 ringtones going off at once?”Does he have a ringtone?“No,” he says, looking as offended as if I’d asked him if he drove a clown car. “I don’t have a phone.”The Current – the public radio station for Minneapolis, the city near Prince’s residence in Minnesota – is live-streaming his music here today without interruptions.
