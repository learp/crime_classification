Carey Davies’s image of a dry stone waller most certainly needs modifying (Rugged men build rugged walls in rugged landscapes, Country Diary, 7 November). Here in Dorset the local branch of the Dry Stone Walling Association boasts a number of highly skilled and highly respected women members (sadly I am not one of them) who are often to be found in the rugged, windswept locations that are the natural home of dry stone walls. They may, or may not, consider themselves to be rugged, but their dedication to high standards and their stamina in all weathers are testament to their passion for the craft.Jill HearingDorchester, Dorset• I see that Roy Boffy (Letters, 8 November) has moved to Sutton Coldfield. What a shame. I used to be very proud that someone from Walsall’s letters were regularly published. Andrew SteedWalsall, West Midlands• As a severe migraine sufferer, I was advised to give up chocolate, cheese and coffee more than 60 years ago (Letters, 9 November). The migraines continued for another 20 years but I did lose weight and I can still fit into my “age-inappropriate” M&S jeans (also Letters, 9 November).Betty ClarkeMalvern, Worcestershire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
