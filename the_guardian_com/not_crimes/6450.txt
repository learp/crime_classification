The recipeBring a pan of water to the boil then salt it lightly. Wash and thickly slice 450g of small to medium-sized potatoes. Lower the sliced potatoes into the boiling water then leave to cook for about 10-12 minutes until you can effortlessly pierce them with a skewer. Drain them carefully and set aside.Finely chop 100g of stoned green olives, then put them into a small bowl with 2 tbsp of olive oil, the juice of half a small lemon (about 2 tbsp), a pinch of dried chilli flakes and 2 tsp of capers. Roughly chop a handful of flat-leafed parsley and stir into the olives. If you prefer, skip the boiling and put the sliced, raw potatoes directly into the oil Cut up a handful of chard: the leaves into large pieces, and the stems into short, manageable lengths. Warm 3 tbsp of olive oil in a shallow pan, then introduce the potatoes, leaving them to cook and crisp lightly, turning them over every now and again so they colour evenly.Just as the potatoes are crisping, tuck the pieces of chard in amongst them to warm for a minute or so. Thickly slice 250g of soft cheese such as Tunworth, camembert, brie or other, similar cheese and place it over the potatoes. Scatter the olive and parsley mixture over the surface, leave for a moment or two for the cheese to melt then divide between two plates. Serve with bread, something crisp and white. Enough for 2.The trickI believe the best saut√©ed potatoes are those you have boiled first, drained and dried before the texture of the potatoes can harden when they are fried from raw. But if you prefer, skip the boiling, putting the sliced, raw potatoes directly into the oil. Keep the heat low, so they cook right through to the centre, turning it a little higher towards the end to crisp the outsides.The twistThe chard can be replaced by other vegetables such as cavolo nero or brussels sprouts or celery. Cut the cavolo nero, stems and all, into short lengths, steaming them first for a really tender result. Cut the sprouts in half; the celery into pieces the length of a wine cork. A favourite version of mine is with celery and gorgonzola.Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlaterThis recipe was amended on 1 February to include cooking instructions for the chard.
