Stranger Things: Netflix boss says it would be 'dumb' not to do season two Nine episodes have been commissioned, with creators Matt and Ross Duffer returning. Stranger Things stars Winona Ryder as a distraught mother searching for her missing son, David Harbour as a smalltown police chief and a cast of relative unknowns as a group of Dungeons & Dragons-playing schoolkids, and a strange girl with unusual powers named Eleven. The show played on nostalgia for the films of the 80s watched by the Duffer brothers, who were born in 1984. No casting details have been announced for the new series. However, the Duffer brothers have said it will take place a year after the first, in 1984, in part to accommodate the fact its young cast have grown.
