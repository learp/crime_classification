Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor will once again collaborate with Atticus Ross on the soundtrack for a film about the Boston Marathon bombings. Patriots Day, directed by Peter Berg, follows the narrative of Ed Davis, the Boston Police commissioner who led the manhunt to find the bombers in 2013. It will also use real footage from US current affairs show 60 Minutes.“I couldn’t be more honored than to be working with these two straight up genius artists,” Peter Berg, Battleship and Lone Survivor director, posted on Instagram. “Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.
