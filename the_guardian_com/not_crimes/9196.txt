Ronnie Corbett’s first claim to comic fame was as part of a trio, representing the top, middle and bottom of the British class system in a sketch with Ronnie Barker and John Cleese for The Frost Report in 1968. Apart from dramatising the social caste system (the source of much British comedy), the sketch benefitted hugely from the visual contrast of the beanpole Cleese, the broad Barker and the tiny Corbett.Comedy duos have traditionally been physically contrasted, and Frost and his producers saw a fruitful pairing in Barker and Corbett. This was helped by their having the same first name, although, despite becoming The Two Ronnies in the BBC1 show that ran from 1971, the two always referred to each other privately as “Ron”. While Corbett always sat screen-left during their newsreader spoofs (a position recently revealed to designate the senior talent in the grammar of TV), it was his partner who was more perceived by audiences and critics to have the right stuff.Ronnie Corbett, 'true great' of British TV comedy, dies aged 85  Barker, between series with Corbett, starred in two of the most successful sitcoms of the era, Porridge and Open All Hours. He was also courted by the leading Shakespearean director, Sir Peter Hall, to give his Bottom or Falstaff, and wrote some of the most successful sketches for The Two Ronnies, although for much of the time Corbett was unaware of this, as Barker submitted scripts under pseudonyms like Gerald Wiley. Barker seems to have been conscious of the risk of imbalance, though. The jokey sign-off to their shows involved Corbett saying, “It’s good night from me”, followed by Barker’s conclusive, “And it’s good night from him!” This shtick had the self-deprecating effect of excluding Barker from the pay-off, and the show’s structure was designed to be inclusive of Corbett. To balance out the tongue-twister monologues G Wiley often wrote for Barker, his co-star was given a weekly solo segment, In the Chair, in which he delivered a meandering monologue while perched on the edge of a high-back seat seemingly designed to make him look even smaller. While Corbett was skilled at delivering scripts as if ad-libbed, they were tightly written, as events supposedly remembered by the performer. The comedian’s performing voice always remained audibly Scottish, and especially so in these speeches, where he employed such High Scots pronunciations as “goaf” for golf.One effect of the chair stories was to give the audience the sense that they were seeing and hearing the real Ronnie Corbett. Whereas Barker preferred always to be seen in some sort of costume or disguise, Corbett, in the chair, presented a persona which came to be seen by the public as his character: kindly, giggly, modest.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  The Two Ronnies was often cited by puritanical newspapers as the epitome of family entertainment, and is frequently called in evidence these days by moralists lamenting the decline of clean TV. In fact, Barker and Corbett’s material was frequently smutty, at least in the manner of the saucy seaside postcards that Ronnie B collected, full of men who came from Little Hampton, mispronunciations and Spoonerisms that kept flirting with taboo words. That the duo was able to get away with so much of this stuff was largely due to Corbett’s air of friendly innocence. Corbett frequently found that his measurements dictated his professional destiny. He claimed that Stanley Kubrick had sounded him out about playing an alien in 2001: A Space Odyssey, and a pair of The Two Ronnies writers, Ian Davidson and Peter Vincent, were also inspired by his height to create Sorry!, a solo sitcom for Corbett that ran from 1981-87. In that, he played Timothy Lumsden, a middle-aged man kept by his mother in the clothes and manners of a schoolboy. The implications of the subject-matter often seemed more suited to one of Freud’s darker case studies than a peak-time comedy, but Corbett’s gentleness and warmth belied the creepiness, and the series gave him a useful independent presence around the time The Two Ronnies ended in 1987.Ronnie Corbett – a life in pictures  Ernie Wise had often seemed lost, professionally and psychologically, in the years by which he out-lived Morecambe & Wise. There was clearly the same risk for Corbett, especially as, while the other double act had forcibly been ended by death, The Two Ronnies was suspended only because Barker, fearing for his health after the early deaths of showbiz colleagues Leonard Rossiter and Richard Beckinsale, chose early retirement.Corbett’s reputation as an anecdotalist greatly helped his post-Barker career – he was in high demand as an after-dinner speaker, compere and chat-show guest. His reputation as a pleasant presence on sets also led to work offers from his old Frost Report co-star John Cleese, including a part in the movie Fierce Creatures, and from younger comedians such as Steve Coogan, who had grown up watching The Two Ronnies. It is not unknown for comic couples to end up speaking only through lawyers, but the two Rons remained on warm terms until Barker’s death in 2005. Barker was already unwell when they reunited to record links for a BBC compilation show, The Two Ronnies Sketchbook, earlier that year, and those who worked on the shows spoke of the tender way Corbett helped his partner through the recordings. Barker’s memorial service, attended by 2,000 people in Westminster Abbey in 2006, featured a final joint appearance. After a recording was played of Ronnie B delivering his verbally inventive “church sermon in Cockney rhyming slang”, Ronnie C delivered a eulogy, as relaxed, anecdotal and funny from the pulpit as he had been in his chair. In the semi-retirement of his final years, he delighted in golf and grandchildren, and was a likable and liked figure on the showbiz and charity circuits. It was a tribute to the respect and affection in which he was held that, to mark his 80th birthday in 2010, a latter-day double-act, Matt Lucas and David Walliams, produced The One Ronnie, a series of sketches in which Corbett was paired with young admirers including James Corden, Miranda Hart and Jocelyn Jee Esien. Nobody who was part of another TV duo in the era of Morecambe & Wise can be remembered as the very best of their profession. But Barker and Corbett ran their rivals very close as a pair and, individually, outstripped them. And that, as Ronnie Corbett was happy to acknowledge towards the end of his life, marked a career and a life well-lived.
