Neil Young – Rockin’ in the Free WorldI could have picked an endless number of Neil Young songs. When the Freedom album was released it featured two versions of Rockin’ in the Free World, one acoustic and one with a full band. One recorded live, the other in the studio. One with full-on bombast, the other radiating from the heart of a troubadour, the guts of the song laid bare. I loved both while noticing that great songs can be performed in various formats. Different but still excellent. I had no preference, no need to compare. I accepted both just as they were. In fact, I was delighted to have different versions of a song that I instantly loved – because of its directness, because of its utter simplicity. The words, the melody, the soul of Neil Young was evident regardless. That is what I care about in songs. As with life, as with anything, it is what goes on at the core that really counts. With the election taking place today in America, a country we love, Rockin’ in the Free World is as poignant now as when it was released in 1989.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Bruce Springsteen – YoungstownI could have picked so many of Bruce’s epics, but I particularly relate to “grainy” songs that depict the hardship of many American blue-collar workers. This song also strikes a chord with many in Scotland who remember the devastation that occurred through the closure of Ravenscraig steelworks in 1992. It signalled the end of large-scale steelmaking in Scotland, leading automatically to the direct loss of 770 jobs, and another 10,000 jobs linked to the plant.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The Dubliners – Rocky Road to DublinGrowing up in the south side of Glasgow in the 60s meant I was exposed to almost as much Irish culture as my natural Scots. I came to identify with both and do so to this day. Frankly, I love both. Most of the songs I learned as a kid belonged to the Irish. Those were the ones that I heard most and was most familiar with. Along with many American country artists, the Dubliners featured heavily in my dad’s record collection. And, although by the time I had become a teenager I had turned my back on all that “Irish stuff”, many of the songs were the beginning of my appreciation of how melody and words could create powerful and beautiful emotions. I love Rocky Road to Dublin particularly. I know the words to every verse – which may seem strange when I can barely recall most of my own lyrics. The song is ingrained deep in me. It also means something more because my great grandfather was himself a Dubliner. That stuff matters more to you when you get older.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Lou Reed – Dirty BlvdSimple Minds took their name from a Bowie tune. However, it was Lou Reed who made it possible for us and so many others to dare think that we could start our own band. I clearly recall Charlie Burchill and me desperately trying to scrape money together for tickets to see him when he performed in Glasgow in 74. I also recall over a decade later both Charlie and me in heaven as we stood stageside in Madrid, watching Lou Reed perform as our opening guest during our Street Fighting Years tour. Having Lou sing on our track This Is Your Land will always be a career highlight, and the story of how the rest of the night panned out after that recording session in Paris is still one that merits disbelief. One day I will get round to telling it.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Chrissie Hynde – I Go to SleepI knew of Chrissie before she made records. She was one of the original mouthy journalists at NME in the mid 70s. Word got out that she (of all people) was putting a band together. I clearly recall the reaction from many to that news was: “This should be a laugh.” After all, not many women were in successful rock’n’roll bands in those days. Well, few were laughing after they’d heard the Pretenders’ first album. Most were mesmerised. I was one of them – and remain so.
