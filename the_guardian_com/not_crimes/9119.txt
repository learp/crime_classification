The government faces a new legal challenge to force it to speed up and improve measures to tackle air pollution in British cities.Environmental law group ClientEarth has asked the high court to urgently review the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (Defra) latest plans to meet EU targets on the toxic gas NO2 which is emitted from vehicles and industry and is thought to kill about 25,000 people in the UK a year.The challenge could force the government to rewrite its latest plan to reduce pollution, said Alan Andrews, a lawyer at ClientEarth. “The plan they came up with [in December 2015] was just not good enough. It was a plan for a plan. These are classic delaying tactics. Meanwhile thousands of people are dying,” he said.“Government has been delaying for years. This challenge will force a full legal examination of Defra’s plans.” The move follows ClientEarth’s victory over the government in the supreme court against secretary of state for the environment, Liz Truss, in April 2015. The UK’s highest court ordered Defra to produce new air quality plans to bring pollution down to legal levels in the “shortest possible time”.  ClientEarth and other air pollution campaigners including Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the Healthy Air campaign dismissed the resulting plan as inadequate. The plan will see ‘clean air zones’ in Birmingham, Leeds, Nottingham, Derby and Southampton by 2020, but they do not cover private cars. London already has a separate plan in train for 2020, dubbed the Ultra Low Emissions Zone, that will cover the dirtiest cars.The truth about London's air pollution “As the government can’t be trusted to deal with toxic air pollution, we are now asking the court to intervene and make sure it is taking action. It is a disgrace that we have had to take further legal action to force the government to protect our health,” said Andrews. “The government’s plans were an insult to those being made sick and dying from air pollution and failed to consider strong measures to get the worst-polluting diesel vehicles out of our town and city centres.”ClientEarth on Friday lodged papers with the high court and said it would be serving UK government lawyers with the claim. Scottish and Welsh ministers, the mayor of London and the Department for Transport will also be served with papers.Jenny Bates, air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s astonishing that ministers have done so little to tackle the UK’s killer air pollution crisis and are now facing court action again. Hopefully they will now be forced to come up with an effective plan to clean up their act, and our air.”“It’s a public health emergency; the government must act now, not wait to be dragged through the courts… again,” said Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation.The UK’s air pollution problem came to the fore this week with Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, asking David Cameron at prime minister’s questions what he was going to do to stop half a million people dying from air pollution in the next 10 years. On Thursday the former Labour leader, Ed Miliband branded the government’s clean-up plan as “useless” and said people should march for action.A Defra spokesman said: “Our plans clearly set out how we will improve the UK’s air quality through a new programme of clean air zones, which alongside national action and continued investment in clean technologies will create cleaner, healthier air for all.”
