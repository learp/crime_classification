An authorised biopic based on the life and career of recently deceased country legend Merle Haggard is in development. Merle Haggard: the maverick musician and his ‘defiantly contrarian journey’ According to Deadline, the musician, who died of pneumonia on 6 April 2016, had approved the film before his death. His friend, Carl Cooper, is said to be working on the concept with GMH Productions.Named Done It All – after his 1971 track I’ve Done It All – it is said to be based on a script written by Cliff Hollingsworth, who co-wrote Cinderella Man, the Russell Crowe film about 1930s boxer James Braddock.While its creators have yet to announce its cast, Done It All will follow Haggard’s life from poverty-stricken childhood, to crime and eventual big break with the help of country star Wynn Stewart, who gave Haggard the track Sing A Sad Song that launched his career in 1963.

Who ever thought that something great could come out of Bakersfield? It made me feel a whole lot better about living in a place called National City,” Waits told Rolling Stone.He adds: “‘Haggard songs are lived-in, broke-in and filled with longing – his last name will always be an adjective.”
