The Australian comedian and actor Rebel Wilson has issued a warning to her female fans to be “super careful” of what they drink, after her own drink was spiked on a night out last week, she claims.Wilson, who has said in the past that she doesn’t take drugs and rarely drinks alcohol, says she only made it through a third of her drink at a trendy club before realising something was amiss; she managed to get home in time “before it really hit me”.“I felt super tired and disoriented,” she tweeted on Friday to her 2.45 million followers. “I got home safely but woke up this morning feeling like I’d been hit by a truck. “I never thought that would happen to me, but if it does [happen to you] please act as soon as you feel something strange and get yourself to safety.”Rebel Wilson (@RebelWilson)Hey guys, but especially to all the girls out there, please be super careful about what you drink when out at clubs and bars at night XMarch 10, 2016Rebel Wilson (@RebelWilson)I had one drink last night at a trendy club which I believe may have been spiked with something.

The crime itself is widely misunderstood; although many people assume illegal “date rape” drugs like Rohypnol and GHB are used to spike drinks, it is widely believed that alcohol itself is the most common drug used.Wilson is currently based in Los Angeles, where Pitch Perfect 3 will begin shooting this year before a 2017 release. On Sunday night, Nickelodeon AU/NZ awarded the actor the Honorary Big Kid award at the Kid’s Choice awards. In true Nickelodeon fashion, the actor celebrated the win by being covered in green slime.Rebel Wilson (@RebelWilson)Thanks you so much kids of Australia/NZ for making me win the first eva Honorary Big Kid Award! @Nickelodeon_AU #KCA pic.twitter.com/ldO4tAhv20March 13, 2016
