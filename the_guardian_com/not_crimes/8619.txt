 A complaint from the bodyHow do you live up there, arrogant rebel,On the decorative brow of your great life like a howdah?Don’t bother giving me your inspired answersTo all the obvious questions no one has asked,You who simply ignored me for ages, takingWhatever it was you decided you needed but neverBothering to discover where it all came from,Whether you deserved it, or at what cost.Down here I’ve no notion of behaviour. My only story is an over-familiar processOr a timetable it’s a challenge to maintain. Even to describe it is a luxury I can’t afford.You have sent me your folders of generalizations,Your systemized orders and pleading inquisitions,But as you know, I shall have nothing to do with you,With your ambitions, your suffering, your futile hopes.• From Gravel in My Shoe (Chatto, £9.99) by John Fuller.
