Many cities have well-loved rivers, from Paris’ picturesque Seine to the newly revitalised Chicago River. But for every celebrated city river there are others which are unloved or underused. Much of LA’s river runs along an abandoned concrete channel surrounded by electricity pylons and decorated with graffiti – which has in itself become an iconic scene of the city – though the water flow is often so limited it barely feels like a river at all. But now, an 11-mile stretch is planned to be restored, spearheaded by the “kayaking mayor” Eric Garcetti and with the help of superstar architect Frank Gehry. Is there a forgotten, unloved or underappreciated river in your city that you feel needs more attention? How do you think it could be transformed or used better to benefit the city? Does it need to be cleaned up and made more accessible or could it provide better transport infrastructure for residents?
