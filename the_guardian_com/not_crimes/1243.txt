An old friend of mine, who spends his leisure in the study of nature, writes about the growing scarcity near Manchester of one of our hedgerow ornaments, the white or common bryony. It is still sought for by herbalists, under the impression that it is the "mandrake"; its "fat, dropsical-looking roots" are not unlike those of the true Mandragora, and find ready sale amongst the credulous. Myth and superstition are harder to uproot than bryony; Buxton, who wrote the "Manchester Botanical Guide" in the middle of the last century, refers to it, and the late Leo Grindon called attention to the survival of the belief. At the end of the sixteenth century Gerarde, the Nantwich botanist, wrote about it. The true mandrake is a low-growing plant, related to the deadly nightshade, but the bryony is nearer to the succulent cucumber. From its narcotic properties and the occasional superficial resemblance of the root to the human form magical and other powers have for ages been attributed to the mandrake, and these have been transferred to the plant which in form of root alone resembles it. So many plants do possess medicinal properties that it is perhaps not surprising that the ancient belief of the herbalists still survives; to them plant was provided as a special cure for some ill that flesh was heir to. Fortunately many of these plants are innocent, so that when faith or nature works a cure their spurious reputation is maintained, but it is a risky game to trust in "old wives' fables."
