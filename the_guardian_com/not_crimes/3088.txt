A New Zealand-wide secret Santa in which complete strangers send each other gifts in the post has had a bumper season, processing more than 2,000 presents in its Auckland hub.The game was launched in 2010 by Hamilton man Sam Elton-Walters, who matched strangers on Twitter to send secret Santa gifts to each other in time for Christmas. Participants would drop hints of their interests and hobbies via tweets – or, more directly, write lists of gifts they would like to receive.Micaela (@MicaelaWessels)#nzsecretsanta5 Random things I like1.

Please don't get me another earthquake. Thanks. @nzsecretsantaNovember 27, 2016When the endeavour became too big for Elton-Walters to manage, he handed the torch in 2013 to New Zealand Post, which assigned a team of 10 “elves” to orchestrate the game.“We’ve never declined a gift for being too big or too small,” said NZ Post’s social media specialist, Libby Greatnews.“It is great if the gifts are well-researched and show a lot of time and care has gone into their selection to make them personal.”Emma Jane (@Emmzza)My favourite #nzsecretsanta memory is when somebody got me a book with a piece of card in the front that said 'Your tweets are really weird'November 25, 2016The twitter users involved in the #nzsecretsanta game are mostly in the 18-44 age bracket, and 60% are women, said Greatnews. Over the last four years, about 8% of senders involved in the game had been identified as “bad Santas”, who sign up to receive a gift but don’t send one out in return.You've got meth: NZ residents urged to check letterboxes for drug shipments NZ Post would not release figures on how many bad Santas had been uncovered during the game’s history. It also does not check or veto gifts before they are sent out, though Greatnews said she was sure the “the majority” of gifts were in good taste.The most popular presents exchanged between Kiwi strangers include chocolate, coffee, novelty gift mugs and adult colouring books. Brand new laptops and cellphones had also been gifted, as well as “a 3D-printed silhouette of a player, face to face with Harry Styles from One Direction”, said Goodnews.NZ Post currently has no plans to broaden the game beyond its Twitter platform. In the last decade the number of letters sent in New Zealand has almost halved in volume, and in the last financial year fell by 5.7% to 578 million. However in the same period parcel volumes rose by 6.4%.
