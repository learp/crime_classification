I want you to look #FlashDog in the eyes. This is no dog. This is the inevitable Frankenstein’s pet formed of every “hilarious” viral singing animal ever CGI’d into existence for the X Factor halftime slot. #FlashDog is the fault of every executive who ever said: “Make me something like the Shetland pony Three had.”We should pity #FlashDog, really. His bewildering existence, padding around the laboratory-clean environs of his home, unaware he is little more than an animated piece of shareable content on four legs.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Completely unaware of the mammoth bonus the creative who said: “Flash? Isn’t that the name of a Queen song?” is going to get this Christmas. For yes, #FlashDog doesn’t know “where all the mud has gone”, that much is true, but there is far more #FlashDog doesn’t know. #FlashDog doesn’t know why he is singing Queen. #FlashDog doesn’t know why he has a hashtag in his name. #FlashDog doesn’t know why he has the voice of a 32-year-old session musician. #FlashDog doesn’t know why he only gets a treat whenever someone writes “Legendary!” underneath his YouTube video. #FlashDog doesn’t know why he always smells of bleach.
