It is generally considered bad luck to toast someone with a soft drink, but in the case of legendary golfer Arnold Palmer, who has died at the age of 87, it might just about be acceptable.

Then add plenty of ice, and combine with iced tea to taste – Palmer preferred three parts tea to one part lemonade. He was also partial enough to Ketel One vodka to endorse it – which should serve as a hint as to your final ingredient.
