Hawa Jande Golakai is, by some standards, an unlikely literary sensation. A Liberian clinical immunologist turned crime writer, she says she’s usually annoyed by the genre.“So often the detective is a man and the woman is his lovely wife who the detective goes home to. We are just the background noise,” she says as her debut novel, The Lazarus Effect, is published outside of Africa for the first time.On the continent, her book has been a surprise hit, nominated for the prestigious Wole Soyinka African fiction award and South Africa’s Sunday Times prize.It tells the story of Vee Johnson, an investigative journalist working in Cape Town who becomes obsessed by the disappearance of a young woman. Her search leads her into a world haunted by hallucinations, forcing her to relive the traumas she experienced during the Liberian civil war.

After her family fled the war, Golakai spent a few years “bouncing around”, before she settled in Cape Town, where she first pursued a career in medicine after a self-confessed “grotesque fascination with bodies and death”.But it turned out that this forensic fascination made her just as suited to crime writing, and when she soon became dissatisfied working in immunology, Golakai started writing, completing The Lazarus Effect alongside her clinical caseload. “Science can be challenging but literature and art, that’s like home to me. I used to live in bookstores,” she says. “It never occurred to me in my mind as an African I could actually get published and be on the shelves like those people.”Inspired by writers such as Edgar Allen Poe and Terry Pratchett, Golakai says she was interested in exploring mysticism and fantasy in the context of crime fiction.

Bai T More, the late Liberian crime fiction author and playwright has also been an inspiration, Golakai says. “His seminal work, Murder in a Cassava Patch, was something I read very deeply and [it] took time to sink it in. I thought a lot about my writing when reading it, deciding the kind of crime fiction writer I wanted to be.”Just launched in the UK, The Lazarus effect is published by Cassava Republic, a new outfit set up to give African literature an international platform. “In all the books that Cassava is promoting, they can see that this is not ‘Africa’ with elephants and drums in the background but peoples’ lives,” Golakai says. “A lot of people want to categorise you when you’re writing crime fiction [as an African] – ‘Which part of Africa are you writing about?’ But that’s not what I’m doing. “I’m trying to showcase that when people write from anywhere in the world they’re telling stories that they can relate to,” she says.'I am a Liberian, not a virus': west Africans hit back against Ebola stigma In the case of Liberia, a fraught history of successive civil wars, coups and counter-coups – and more recently the recent devastating Ebola epidemic – has informed hard-to-shift stereotypes. When asked how these frustrate her, she is unequivocal. “It more than frustrates me, it pisses me off! That is not the narrative of my country in total. Whenever news comes out of there it dwarfs the country itself: it’ll be Charles Taylor in the Hague, or Ebola and thousands dead, but the positive stories don’t leak out further than the region,” Golakai says. Now living in Liberia after almost 10 years in South Africa, Golakai is committed to changing international perceptions of writers from her home country.“It matters a lot to me that I’m Liberian,” she says. “I can do something positive that can prompt people to say: ‘Oh, so this is a Liberian author.”
