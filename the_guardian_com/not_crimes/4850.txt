Book OneLines 1-21Wrath – sing, goddess, of the ruinous wrath of Peleus’ son Achilles,that inflicted woes without number upon the Achaeans,hurled forth to Hades many strong souls of warriorsand rendered their bodies prey for the dogs,for all birds, and the will of Zeus was accomplished;sing from when they two first stood in conflict –Atreus’ son, lord of men, and godlike Achilles.Which of the gods, then, set these two together in conflict, to fight?Apollo, son of Leto and Zeus; who in his rage at the kingraised a virulent plague through the army; the men were dyingbecause the son of Atreus dishonoured the priest Chryses.For he came to the Achaeans’ swift shipsbearing countless gifts of ransom to set free his daughter,holding in his hands on a golden staff the wreaths of Apollowho strikes from afar, and beseeched all the Achaeans—but mostly the two sons of Atreus, marshallers of men:“Sons of Atreus and you other strong-greaved Achaeans,may the gods who have homes on Olympus grant youto plunder Priam’s city, and reach your home safely;release to me my beloved daughter, take instead the ransom, revering Zeus’s son who strikes from afar – Apollo.”Can Homer's Iliad speak across the centuries? Book VILines 390-493The housekeeper spoke, and Hector ran from the house back the same way through the well-built streets.When he arrived at the Scaean gates, having crossed the great city,there where he intended to pass through to the plain,there his worthy wife came to meet him, running,Andromache, daughter of great-hearted Eëtion –Eëtion, who once lived below wooded Plakos,in Thebes below Mt Plakos, ruling the Cilician men;his daughter was held as wife by bronze-armoured Hector.She met him then, and her attendant came with herthe child held against her breast, tender-minded, just a baby, the cherished only child of Hector, beautiful like a star,whom Hector used to call Scamandrios, but all othersAstyanax, lord of the city; for his father alone protected Ilion.And looking at his child in silence, he smiled,but Andromache came and stood close to him shedding tearsand clung to him with her hand and spoke to him and said his name:“Inhuman one, your strength will destroy you, and you take no pityon the child and young one, or on me who have no future, who will soon bebereft of you; the Achaeans will soon kill you,the whole of them rushing in attack. And for me it would be better with you lost to go down beneath the earth; for no othercomfort will there be hereafter, when you meet your fate,but grief. I have no father or lady mother;it was godlike Achilles who slew my father,when he sacked the well-established town of the Cilicians,high-gated Thebes, and killed Eëtion;yet he did not strip his body, for in his heart he thought it shameful,but he cremated him with his decorated war-gear,and heaped a burial mound over. And around it elms were grownby nymphs of the mountains, daughters of Zeus of the stormy aegis. And they who were my seven brothers in our halls,they all on a single day entered the house of Hades;all of them swift-footed godlike Achilles slewas they watched over their shambling cattle and white sheep.And my mother, who was queen under wooded Plakos,when he led her here with the rest of his plunder,he set her free again, accepting untold ransom;and, in the hall of her father, Artemis who showers arrows struck her down.Hector, so you are father to me, and honoured mother,and my brother, and you are my strong young husband. So have pity now and stay here by the ramparts,do not make your child fatherless, your wife a widow.Station your men by the wild fig-tree, where the city iseasiest to scale and the walls can be overrun.Three times they came there and tested it, the best menwith the two Aiantes and illustrious Idomeneus,and with the sons of Atreus and Tydeus’ daring son;perhaps some seer, well skilled, told them of it,or it was their own spirit that urged and compelled them.”And great Hector of the shimmering helm answered her; “Surely, all these things concern me too, my wife; but greatlyI would dread what they would think, the Trojans and the Trojan womenwith their trailing robes,if like a coward I should shirk away from fighting.My spirit does not allow me, for I have learned to be bravealways and to fight amongst the front rank of Trojans,winning great glory for my father, and for me.But I know this well in my mind and in my heart;there will some time be a day when holy Ilion is destroyed,and Priam and the people of Priam of the fine ash-spear;But it is not the coming suffering of the Trojans that so much distresses me, nor of Hecuba herself, nor of lord Priam,nor of my many and brave brothers whowill fall in dust at the hands of enemy men,so much as distress for you, when some bronze-armoured Achaeanleads you off in tears, taking away your day of freedom.And in Argos you will work the loom for another woman,and carry water from the spring of Messeis or Hypereiatime and again under compulsion, and necessity will lie harsh upon you.And one day someone seeing you shedding tears may say:‘This is the wife of Hector, who used to be best of the horse-breaking Trojans in waging battle, at that time when men fought around Ilion.’So one day someone may speak; and for you the pain will be new again,bereft of such a husband to ward off the day of slavery.But may the heaped earth cover me over dead,before I ever hear your cry as you are dragged away.”So speaking shining Hector reached out for his son;but the child turned away, back to the breast of his fair-belted nurse,crying, frightened at the sight of his own father,struck with terror seeing the bronze helmet and crest of horse-hair,nodding dreadfully, as he thought, from the topmost of the helmet. They burst out laughing, his dear father and lady mother.At once shining Hector lifted the helmet from his head,and placed it, gleaming, on the earth;then he rocked his beloved son in his arms and kissed him,and prayed aloud to Zeus and to the other gods;“Zeus, and you other gods, grant now that this child too,my son, will become, even as I am, conspicuous among Trojans,likewise skilled in courage, and rule Ilion in strength.And one day may someone say of him, ‘this man is far better than his father’as he returns from war, and may he bear back blood-stained spoils of armour,having killed an enemy man, and his mother’s heart rejoice.” So speaking he placed in the hands of his beloved wifehis son; and she took him to her perfumed breast,laughing as she cried. And her husband took pity, watching,and with his hand he caressed her and spoke to her and said her name;“Foolish one, do not, I beg you, distress your heart too much.No man against fate will hurl me to Hades;for no man, I think, escapes destiny,not the cowardly, nor the brave, once he is born.But go to the house and tend to your work, to your loom and distaff, and direct your handmaidsto ply their work; war is the concern of men,all men, and me most of all, who live in Ilion.”Caroline Alexander’s translation of the Iliad is published by Vintage, priced £25.
