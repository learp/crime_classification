For all those times when the Donald Trump news cycle becomes too much, let us all give thanks for both the genius of Bill Watterson, and the redditors who have dreamed up perhaps the best way yet of dealing with it.Behold the Donald and Hobbes subreddit, which superimposes Trump’s face on our beloved Calvin, and drops in text inspired by the Republican presidential candidate, bringing a little bit of humour to dark times.I particularly like this one:Although this is pretty good too:Thanks to Comic Book Resources for pointing us in its direction: I know what I’m doing with my afternoon.The subreddit was launched in December but has grown hugely since then to produce little slices of genius like this:The joy of the thing is that Calvin’s dialogue is only edited slightly, or not at all, leaving something that really does sound scarily Trump-ish. Calvin is way more tyrannical than I remember. But this is part of the fun: the rules on the subreddit state that “the strip you paste Trump’s head over has to contain dialogue that Trump might actually say. You can edit dialogue so Calvin’s name is missing or certain words (perhaps too intelligent for Donald) are gone. But just putting Trump’s head on Calvin acting like a kid is missing the point.”Ink different: Donald Trump gets drawn and quartered for Comic-Con They add: “Have fun and try not to think worse of Calvin. He’s only six. Trump’s going on 70 and still hasn’t grown up.” If only there was a Hobbes to temper him.
