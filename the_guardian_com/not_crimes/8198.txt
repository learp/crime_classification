I so agree with Fay Schopen (Grief affects us all, prince and pauper alike, 26 July). My husband of 40 years died suddenly seven months ago. To my surprise, I almost immediately started writing Facebook posts about how I felt, how I was coping, and how others have reacted. On our wedding anniversary I wrote about what our marriage was like. Not only have people expressed great appreciation for the posts, but I have been helped enormously by exploring my emotions. Writing is a good medium because the tears don’t get in the way.Lesley BarnesGreenford, Middlesex• My wife was 21 and working at Bletchley Park when her father died of a brain tumour in hospital. They had had a very close relationship, but she did not see him to say goodbye. Over 20 years later while doing a PGCE she was asked to write a life history which would not be graded. When she reached this point, she was unable to continue and submitted it unfinished. Subsequently she was desperately hurt and upset when it was in fact marked down. Ninety-five and it is still a tearful memory.David BuckinghamLeamington Spa• Clearly Ivor Morgan (Letters, 25 July), who writes from Lincoln, has never volunteered at the Bath food bank, nor served as a governor of a boys’ comprehensive school where more than 20% of pupils had statements and 30% were entitled to free school meals. Perhaps his perception of Bath as a city for the middle classes might have been revised if he had.Mary FinchDitteridge (just outside Bath)• Tuesday’s quick crossword (G2, 23 July) had the word “blue” as the clue nine times, which must be some sort of record. Who set the crossword? Picasso?Mike PenderCardiff• You report (Post abolished, 26 July) that the new immigration minister is Mr Goodwill. So that’s all right then!Robin WendtChester• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
