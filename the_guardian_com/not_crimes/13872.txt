In October we are lulled to sleep by tawny owls. Their soporific calls, those wavering "oo-oo"s, are plentiful while the young males are establishing new territories. They are noisiest as dark settles over the garden, before the silence of a night spent hunting. The sharper "keewick" cries are the female's contact calls. Days are spent in the branches of the nearby spruce wood, from where they lazily call as if half asleep. I have walked among the trees and turned to see a woken owl glide without a sound across the dimly lit ride.This morning there's a neat parcel of fur on the garden path just below the sycamore branch that is a favourite night-time perch. An owl pellet, it's the regurgitated and inedible parts of the tawny's latest meals. I can't detect any smell but my cat sniffs it and leaps backwards as if a bee has stung him. WhileÂ it is still moist I get tweezers and cocktail sticks to dissect it, the only way of knowing what the owl has been catching. A couple of inches long, the pellet is felted in dark fur that I delicately tease apart. I become totally absorbed as the sticks tap against tiny ivory bones that I pick out and lay on a sheet of card. Individual ribs are slender as nail pairings. The dislocated bones of a skull are semi-transparent, as fine as fish scales. There are minute vertebrae, incisor teeth, whole jawbones, forearms and thighbones. A sparkle of blue green is the wing case of a beetle.Laid out on the card, the rows of bones look like archaeological finds. It seems this owl has eaten at least two field voles, a house mouse and a beetle. It will cough up maybe two of these pellets in 24 hours, a help to a gardener who is trying to grow bulbs in a garden full of voles. As the owls call back and forth across the valley I think of Dylan Thomas in his poem Fern Hill: "As I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away."
