Photograph: National GalleryThe Lower Falls of the Labrofoss, 1827, by Johan Christian DahlThe dark trees, purple rocks and eerie distant luminosity of a landscape near Oslo give a melancholy dreaminess to this archetypal Romantic painting. Dahl was Norway’s answer to Turner and famous enough in the early 19th century for this to have been commissioned by a British fan. Created decades before Edvard Munch came along, it establishes the spooky magic of the north as a new territory for art.• National Gallery, London.Image of the week      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Corby Carnival Queens Go Bowling, 1.
