Nick Grimshaw is to leave the X Factor after just one season on the judging panel, as Simon Cowell seeks to boost ratings on the ITV show.A spokesman for the BBC Radio 1 DJ said that it was his decision to leave the show.“After careful consideration, Nick’s decided to rule himself out as a judge on this year’s X Factor,” he said. “He loved working on last year’s series alongside Rita, Cheryl and Simon but it was very much a once-in-a-lifetime experience. He remains a massive fan of the show and is looking forward to watching it this year.”Grimshaw was unveiled as a judge last June, alongside Rita Ora who defected from the BBC’s The Voice, to replace Louis Walsh and former Spice Girls star, Mel B. However, the new-look panel failed to boost the show with the 2015 final the second-lowest rating in its 11-year history.One Direction star Louis Tomlinson is said to be in the running to replace Grimshaw, as is former judge Louis Walsh.“Nick was a great mentor on last year’s series,” said an The X Factor spokesman. “He did a fantastic job with the boys’ category and we’d like to thank him for all his hard work. We are sad to see him go but wish him all the best.”According to the Sun, Caroline Flack, who co-hosted the The X Factor alongside Olly Murs for the first time last year, is also leaving the show.The show’s spokesman refused to comment on the report.“Details for the new series of The X Factor are still being discussed and will be announced in due course,” he said.
