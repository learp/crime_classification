The winner #1: SingIllumination Entertainment’s Sing stormed to the top of the UK box office, taking £10.48m including previews of £4.20m. For context, the biggest-grossing animations last year were Pixar’s Finding Dory and Illumination’s own The Secret Life of Pets. Finding Dory opened with a stunning £8.12m on its way to a total of £42.9m (the fifth biggest movie of 2016), while Pets began with £9.58m, ending up with £36.3m (10th biggest film of 2016).If sequels – and spinoffs such as Minions – are ignored, you’d struggle to find many animated films that have opened bigger in the UK than Sing. Pixar’s Inside Out (2015) kicked off with £7.38m, which is bigger than Sing’s number if its previews are ignored. Up began with £6.41m, which is marginally ahead of the Sing three-day-weekend number. Frozen, the biggest hitter ever from Disney Animation, started out with a modest £4.70m. Warners’ The Lego Movie debuted with £8.05m including previews of £2.16m – smaller than Sing, whichever way you look at it.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The winner #2: T2 TrainspottingWhile T2 Trainspotting was unlucky enough to be releasing in the same week as a major animation, its debut of £5.15m would typically be more than enough to top the UK box office. It’s hard to point to a sequel that has similarly scored with audiences after so long (almost 21 years). George Lucas’s first Star Wars prequel being the obvious flag bearer, although it was only 16 years between Return of the Jedi (1983) and The Phantom Menace (1999). And it’s rare that an 18-certificate film opens north of £5m. Ignoring previews, only three such titles have done so: Fifty Shades of Grey, Bruno and Hannibal.T2 did particularly well in Scotland, earning 26% of its total gross there. (Last year, Scotland delivered 7.8% of the total UK and Ireland box office.) T2’s top 16 highest grossing cinemas were all in Scotland.

Eventual total was £12.4m. At that time (1996), the highest-grossing 18-certificate film was The Silence of the Lambs (1991), with £17.1m. Seven, released a few months after Trainspotting, reached £19.5m. Today, the top 18-certificate film is Fifty Shades of Grey, with £35.1m.Given the huge anticipation for T2 Trainspotting, with nostalgic audiences rushing out to see it on opening weekend, steady box office erosion looks likely. On the other hand, an IMDb user rating of 8.1/10 suggests that audience word is currently very positive.The Oscar contendersWith a relatively slim 29% decline from the previous session, La La Land has added another £3.11m to its tally, for a £20.95m total after 18 days. Among this year’s best picture Oscar nominees, its closest competitor is Arrival with £9.38m. La La Land should soon overtake the lifetime total of The Revenant (£23.4m), which was the big commercial winner in last year’s awards season.The question now remains whether La La Land can match the monster totals of the top-performing best picture Oscar winners from the last decade. In January 2009, Slumdog Millionaire began with a modest £1.83m, rising 44% in its second weekend of play, and another 5% in its third. At that point, after three weekends, it had reached £14.22m, and it went on to achieve £31.66m. On the one hand, La La Land is far ahead of Slumdog after three weekends; on the other, it’s posted successive declines (23% and 29%), so does not look on course to match Slumdog’s incredible momentum.

Again, that number is behind La La Land’s tally, but The King’s Speech was showing stronger early momentum, and went on to a spectacular £45.7m. Few would expect La La Land to get to King’s Speech heights, but it shouldn’t break a sweat passing £30m and matching Slumdog’s tally. Another best picture nominee, Lion, fell just 13% at the weekend, suggesting strong word of mouth for this inspiring tearjerker. Gross after 10 days is a rosy £3.31m. Hacksaw Ridge, another nominee, began with a strong £1.49m, including £219,000 in previews. Jackie, which has three Oscar nominations including best actress, fell just 16%, boosted by an expansion from 197 to 274 cinemas. Total after 10 days is £1.77m. Manchester by the Sea is now beginning to fade, but has reached £2.30m – by far Kenneth Lonergan’s biggest UK total as director.The overall marketThanks to the arrival of Sing and T2 Trainspotting, plus healthy returns for La La Land and Split, and deep strength in the market, UK box office is up 92% up on the previous frame, and 112% up on the equivalent session from 2016, when The Revenant topped the chart ahead of new entrant Dirty Grandpa. Moreover, the market is showing the highest total gross of any weekend from the last year.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Split trailer: James McAvoy plays 23 characters in one in psychological thrillerThe overall strength can be measured by the fact that the 10th-placed film at the weekend – Rogue One: A Star Wars Story – grossed more than £500,000. The UK weekend chart’s 10th-placed title cleared £500,000 on only two occasions in 2016.The sensational result puts January on course to post an admissions rise on the same month in January 2016. Cinema owners are confident about the product on offer this year, at least relative to 2016, with new entries coming in the Star Wars, Transformers, Pirates of the Caribbean, Guardians of the Galaxy, Fast & Furious and Despicable Me franchises. ComScore’s senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian has dubbed 2017 “the 100-year flood of movies”. The industry was surprised that 2016 held up so well, given films on offer, and total admissions for the UK were 168.3m – down marginally from 171.5m in 2015 (a strong year for blockbusters) and healthily up on 2014’s 157.5m.The futureIn the wake of Sing and T2 Trainspotting, cinemas are pausing for breath, with franchise revival Rings and sequel Resident Evil: The Final Chapter among the multiplex-skewed offerings. Also in the mix is true tale Loving, which picked up an Oscar nomination for Ruth Negga, and Gold, starring Matthew McConaughey. German comedy Toni Erdmann, one of the most enthusiastically reviewed films ever at the Cannes film festival and a best foreign language picture Oscar nominee, also joins the fray. All are likely to be outgrossed by a film that’s not officially on release: The Lego Batman Movie plays previews on Saturday and Sunday.
