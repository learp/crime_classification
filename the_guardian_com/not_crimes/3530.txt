As a child New Zealander Dot Smith dreamed of living in a castle.Growing up on an isolated farm in the 1960s entertainment was scarce - so Dot read, and planned her escape.“We grew up with no money, nothing. It was boring. We read all the time. All we had were our imaginations.” said Smith.Five decades later, after working seven days a week and living in a simple cottage, Dot is on the cusp of achieving that childhood fantasy.What is it really like to live in New Zealand? After six years of toil employing one builder and one apprentice, her castle, located 20 minutes north of the South Island town of Oamaru – is nearly complete.“I’m an ordinary person who has done something extraordinary, and I think that gives people hope that they don’t have to give up on what they wanted as a child - they don’t have to grow up,” said Smith.

Photograph: Eleanor Ainge Roy for the GuardianRiverstone Castle - crafted from Oamaru stone and locally felled macrocarpa - has a moat (though no drawbridge), an underground passageway and a dungeon - which is concealed down a flight of stairs in a secret library, accessed through a hidden panel in a bedroom.Riverstone is designed and built to last centuries.“The castle is forever. It’s not temporary, it’s not quick, and it’s not cheap. It will stand a long time after I am gone. I have worked my whole life to achieve this - it wasn’t going to be a knock-up job.” I’m an ordinary person who has done something extraordinary, that gives people hopeDot Smith The television show Grand Designs New Zealand has called Smith four times. She has refused to be involved.Her castle is an idiosyncratic endeavour (carved tuatara lizards and dairy cattle decorate the exterior) but Smith says everyone is welcome.“The castle will be full of laughter and music. It’s not elitist, it’s not intimidating. We’re dairy farmers. We’ve been frugal our whole lives. We’ve worked seven days a week, for forty years to make this possible.”As a 19-year-old Smith was employed as a nanny for two years in Kent, England.She visited Hever Castle often (Anne Boleyn’s family home). It was an inspiration - as was Versailles. But the real push came from children’s literature; particularly Enid Blyton’s Famous Five Novels.Riverstone Castle lies outside Oamaru, New Zealand.Stories of secret passageways, concealed caves and mysteries to solve - a fantasy existence world’s away from the muck and grime of a Kiwi dairy farm. “This is what makes life interesting isn’t it? Mysteries,” said Smith. “Exploring secret passageways. It’s those stories that kept me up at night, turning the pages of a book under the covers, torch in hand. I don’t think you should have to give up on those dreams.”Smith won’t reveal the cost of the castle. It’s the work – and price – of a lifetime.
