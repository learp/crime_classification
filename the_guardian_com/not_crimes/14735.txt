Donald Trump may have finally met his match.On Sunday night, John Oliver spent 22 minutes of his weekly HBO show, Last Week Tonight, attempting to convince the American public once and for all that Trump is simply a “litigious serial liar” who “always seems to be in the same mood: smug yet gassy”.John Oliver: 'David Cameron can't attack a hotdog' “Donald Trump is America’s back mole,” Oliver said. “It may have seemed harmless a year ago, but now that it’s gotten frighteningly bigger, it’s gotten hard to ignore it.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Click the image to watch the John Oliver video – #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgainThe late-night host presented various arguments against the Republican candidate, many which have been made before, including: his tendency to lie, his inability to take criticism, his failed business ventures of the past, his inconsistent policies, and his initial refusal to disavow former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke.But his most original argument came at the end of the segment, when he campaigned for those hoping to overthrow Trump to begin referring to him as Drumpf.Kallstadt, Germany: on the trail of 'the Donald' in the Trump ancestral home “The very name Trump is the cornerstone of his brand,” Oliver said. “If only there were a way to uncouple that magical word from the man he really is.”According to biographer Gwenda Blair, who wrote the book The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a Presidential Candidate, the Trump family originally went by Drumpf, before “the family changed the spelling of its name”. Drumpf does not hold the same power as a name like Trump, according to Oliver. While Trump is the sound “produced when a mouthy servant is slapped across the face with a wad of thousand dollar bills”, Oliver said, Drumpf resembles “the sound produced when a morbidly obese pigeon flies into the window of a foreclosed Old Navy”.Oliver urged the public to make use of this new name and proposed the hashtag #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain. But he didn’t stop there. He also announced a new website, DonaldJDrumpf.com, which is selling hats emblazoned with “Make Donald Drumpf Again” and also offers a “Drumpfinator” Google chrome extension that will replace the name Trump with Drumpf in web browsers.
