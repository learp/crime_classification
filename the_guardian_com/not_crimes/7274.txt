In October last year, hip-hop veterans Blackalicious made their return after a 10-year absence. Imani, Vol. 1, an album which coincided with Gift of Gab’s kidney failure and his continuing dialysis treatment while searching for a kidney donor, also saw the Californian duo using their music to instigate awareness of social injustice.“Our audience seems to be people who see music and art as essential parts of life, and not just disposable accessories,” Chief Xcel said of the album. “That’s who we make music for – people who need it in their life. I’m one of those people. Imani is Swahili for faith, and that’s really where we’re at at this juncture. We’re so rooted in our purpose that we don’t have to second-guess, we just know. There’s no fear of the unknown, there’s just the fire to move forward and get to wherever the journey takes us.”One of the most pertinent examples of the record’s ethos is the retro-soul stylings of On Fire Tonight, a bold, confident track that has been give a rousing new video. What sounds like an optimistic, empowering anthem is jarred by footage of protests, Black Panthers and police brutality: it is designed to shock, to enrage, to inspire.Take a look at the video below.
