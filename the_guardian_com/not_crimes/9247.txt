The shadow justice minister, Jo Stevens, and shadow foreign minister, Diana Johnson, have written to parliament’s joint committee on human rights, urging action on the prosecution of women in Northern Ireland for having abortions.The letter is an attempt to trigger a response in Westminster to the sentencing earlier this month of a Northern Ireland woman who took abortion pills to terminate a pregnancy when she was 19. The woman, who has not been named, was given a three-month prison sentence, suspended over 12 months.Although both justice and health are devolved to Northern Ireland, making it complicated for Westminster politicians to comment on the prosecutions, the letter points out that human rights are not a devolved issue.The letter, which is signed by a handful of Labour MPs, states: “We believe that there are few more egregious breaches of human rights than the denial of vital healthcare, yet this is the situation for hundreds of thousands of women in Northern Ireland. These women have the right to expect their human rights to be recognised and protected by the UK parliament and therefore we ask that you make this situation a priority for your committee.”The 1967 Abortion Act was never extended to Northern Ireland, where abortion is available only if there is “a risk of a real and serious adverse effect on a woman’s long-term physical or mental health”.Several thousand women every year travel to England and Wales for terminations, which they are obliged to pay for privately; only those women with at least £1,000 to spare are able to afford the trip. Now that safe, reliable and cheap abortion pills can be bought online and posted to Northern Ireland, it has become easier for women to induce abortions at home.A second prosecution connected to the use of abortion pills is scheduled in Belfast later this month. Northern Ireland has the harshest criminal penalty for abortion anywhere in Europe, with a theoretical maximum sentence of life imprisonment for both the woman who has an unlawful abortion and anyone who assists her.“These prosecutions are continuing despite a ruling of the high court that Northern Ireland’s abortion laws are incompatible with the UK’s Human Rights Act,” the letter to Harriet Harman, which is also signed by Karin Smyth, Roberta Blackman-Woods and Sharon Hodgson, continues.“Elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and in nearly every other country in Europe, the woman who was recently convicted would have been able to obtain a medical abortion in a safe and legal way, as well as receiving the support of healthcare professionals to support her during what was clearly an extremely difficult time. We appreciate that abortion is a devolved issue. However, human rights are not a devolved issue.”There is no blanket obligation on governments to make abortion services available in all circumstances under international human rights standards, according to Amnesty International, but there is an obligation, if there is a threat to the woman’s life, if she has been raped or if there is a fatal foetal abnormality, which will mean the foetus is unlikely to survive.Last November, a high court judge in Belfast ruled that Northern Ireland’s almost outright ban on abortion breached the human rights of women who were pregnant because they had been raped, or who were pregnant with foetuses with abnormalities so extreme that they were not expected to survive. Northern Ireland’s attorney general, John Larkin, has lodged an appeal against the ruling.Diana Johnson also requested a debate on the issue last week during business questions, stating it was the responsibility of MPs in Westminster to “uphold the human rights of women in Northern Ireland”. Chris Grayling, leader of the House, declined the request, saying: “I am not personally in favour of women who seek an abortion being punished for doing so, but, of course, this is a devolved matter.”Theresa Villiers, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, was unavailable for comment, but a spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Office said Villiers was “on record as supporting the laws which apply in Great Britain”, adding: “It is for the people of Northern Ireland and their elected representatives in Stormont to decide whether change will take place. ”Pro-choice protesters in Northern Ireland have voiced dismay at the “radio silence” from Westminster on the prosecution of the woman who used pills to induce an abortion, and have called on campaigners to write to Villiers to urge her to take action. Legislative change is not expected since abortion is one of the few issues that unites Catholic and Protestant politicians in Northern Ireland.Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland programme director, said the law in Northern Ireland violated the UK’s international human rights obligations, because of the refusal to make abortion available in the case of rape or fatal foetal abnormality. “If the Northern Ireland assembly continues to show itself as incapable or unwilling to provide access to abortion services in compliance with the UK’s international human rights obligations, then the Westminster government – as the state party to various international human rights conventions – must intervene,” he said.
