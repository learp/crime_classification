What were you doing when you were 12? Getting quite good at Guitar Hero? Clumsily finding your way around a real instrument? Maybe even attempting a jam session with some of your mates? Let’s face it, you weren’t going on tour through South America with a Grammy award-winning, platinum-selling metal band, were you? Not unless you’re Tye Trujillo, who has just signed up to play for Korn while their bassist Reginald “Fieldy” Arvizu is unable to tour with them. It helps, of course, that he’s well-connected – Tye is the son of Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo – but there’s no denying he can play. You can check out his skills, including some impressive headbanging action, for his other band the Helmets, in the clip below.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Korn’s tour will visit Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Peru. In a statement on Facebook, they said: “We are bummed Fieldy can’t join us on this run but excited to do a few gigs with a young player like Tye. We look forward to welcoming our brother Fieldy back when we return to the States in May.”
