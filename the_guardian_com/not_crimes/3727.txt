Congratulations on your editorial finesse. Page 4 of last Friday’s Guardian had photos of two Greens. One was a knighted establishment figure who sold a high street chain store after taking out millions of pounds in dividends, leaving a massive pensions hole in a firm that has now collapsed, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. The other is an elected member of parliament. Only one of these Greens has been spied on by the police. Is this what is meant by a democratic deficit?Dr Robert KeatsShorwell, Isle of Wight• If the junior doctors’ strike is today’s miners’ strike (Report, 26 April) then lessons can be learned from the past. The miners lost thanks to lack of support from the trade unions; this must not be allowed to happen again. The unions must now fully get behind the junior doctors and threaten industrial action on a mass scale. The Tories view the NHS and its staff as commodities to be sold off. If the junior doctors lose, we’ll be one step further to losing our NHS for good.Bev TrounceHove• I saw nine tautologies in your article (Has M&S gone too far with its pre-cut avocado?, G2, 27 April). Every time I read “pre-peeled” or “pre-diced” I shuddered, and by the sixth paragraph a nervous tic had developed. A “pre-peeled banana” is a peeled banana. A “pre-sliced avocado” is a sliced avocado. “Prepared sandwich” would be bad enough; it’s obviously been prepared, as it exists. To go one stage further and call it a “pre-prepared sandwich” is just pre-preposterous.David SawyerWoking, Surrey• “My family values: Jane Fonda, Actress” (Family, 30 April). Wow. When was the last time the word “actress” slipped past the Guardian style guide police?Ben Staveley-TaylorOxford• What a consummate politician Nicola Sturgeon is. In the photo used with your article (Opinion, 29 April), the baby is kissing her and she doesn’t have to kiss it.Helen HaranSt Albans, Hertfordshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
