It was voted the best TV moment of 2015 but Aidan Turner’s topless scything in Poldark failed to cut it with the Royal Television Society which ignored the BBC1 drama in the nominations for its 2016 awards.Another shock was Wolf Hall star Mark Rylance, who won an Oscar this week for his role in Steven Spielberg’s Bridge of Spies but failed to earn a nod for the BBC2 drama in the nominations announced on Thursday.Wolf Hall was nominated twice - for best drama serial and another of its stars Claire Foy for best female actor. But there was nothing for Poldark, one of the most talked about dramas of last year.Sci-fi drama Humans and Paul Abbott’s No Offence, both on Channel 4, will compete with BBC2’s The Last Kingdom for best drama series.Wolf Hall will go head to head with ITV’s The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies and Channel 4’s This Is England ’90 for best drama serial.Foy will do battler with Suranne Jones, star of BBC’1’s Doctor Foster, and Claire Rushbrook from ITV’s Home Fires in the female actor category. Two giants of stage and screen will compete for the male actor prize - Anthony Hopkins for his role in BBC2’s The Dresser and Tom Courtenay, star of ITV’s Unforgotten. They are joined by Adam Long from BBC3’s Don’t Take My Baby.There was a hat-trick of nominations for Peter Kay’s BBC comedy, Car Share, which premiered on the BBC’s iPlayer before airing on BBC1.Channel 4 had by far the most nominations with 23, with a further three for E4 and another for Welsh language channel, S4C.ITV had 11, ahead of BBC1 with eight (rising to 11 if Car Share is included).BBC2 had nine nominations, with BBC3 five and three for BBC4. Sky had a total of five nominations.Awards chair Alex Mahon said the make-up of the juries which decided the nominations had been made more diverse with more women and black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) representatives to better reflect audiences.“I am delighted as the new chairman to share the news that we have substantially changed the make-up of the judging chairs and the juries to a pattern that I feel is now more representative of Britain and of our viewers,” said Mahon.“This year, of the 200 or so jurors, we moved to 52% female and 27% BAME. Talking to the chairs it was clear that the tone of the conversations in the jury rooms changed for the better too. Making this change was relatively simple because the high quality talent we need was easy to find and in plentiful supply.”Royal Television Society awards - nominations in full Actor – FemaleClaire Foy – Wolf Hall A Company Pictures and Playground Entertainment Production for BBC2Claire Rushbrook – Home Fires A co-production of ITV Studios and Masterpiece for ITVSuranne Jones – Doctor Foster Drama Republic for BBC1Actor – MaleAdam Long – Don’t Take My Baby BBC Documentaries Production for BBC3Anthony Hopkins – The Dresser Playground Entertainment for BBC2Tom Courtenay – Unforgotten Mainstreet Pictures for ITVArtsGrayson Perry’s Dream House Swan Films for Channel 4Handmade BBC Scotland Arts Production for BBC4Hockney A Blakeway and Fly Film Production for BBC2BreakthroughMichaela Coel – Chewing Gum Retort Television for E4Richard Bentley – The Stranger on the Bridge Postcard Productions for Channel 4Sian Gibson – Peter Kay’s Car Share Goodnight Vienna Productions for BBC iPlayerChildren’s ProgrammeLily’s Driftwood Bay – Goodbye Seabird Sixteen South for Nick JuniorMy Life: I Am Leo Nine Lives Media for CBBCThe Dumping Ground CBBC ProductionsComedy PerformanceMichaela Coel – Chewing Gum Retort Television for E4Nick Helm – Uncle Baby Cow Productions for BBC3Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney – Catastrophe Avalon Television for Channel 4Daytime ProgrammeJudge Rinder ITV Studios for ITVPosh Pawnbrokers Boomerang for Channel 4This Morning ITV Studios for ITVDocumentary SeriesReggie Yates’ Extreme Russia Sundog Pictures for BBC3The Detectives Minnow Films for BBC2The Romanians Are Coming Keo Films for Channel 4Drama SerialThe Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies Carnival Films for ITVThis Is England ‘90 Warp Films for Channel 4Wolf Hall A Company Pictures and Playground Entertainment Production for BBC2Drama SeriesHumans Kudos Film & TV for Channel 4No Offence Abbott Vision for Channel 4The Last Kingdom Carnival Films for BBC2EntertainmentRelease the Hounds Gogglebox Entertainment for ITV2The Graham Norton Show So Television for BBC1The Last Leg Open Mike Productions for Channel 4Entertainment PerformanceAdam Hills – The Last Leg Open Mike Productions for Channel 4Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly – I’m A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!/ Britain’s Got Talent/Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway ITV Studios/Thames and Syco/ITV Studios and Mitre Television for ITVJack Whitehall – A League Of Their Own CPL Productions for Sky 1HistoryBritain’s Forgotten Slave Owners BBC History Production for BBC2Dagrau o Waed: Rhyfel Corea Awen Media/JTV for S4CHolocaust: Night Will Fall Spring Films for Channel 4Live EventAlternative General Election with Jeremy Paxman Zeppotron/ITN for Channel 4BRIT Awards 2015 BRITs TV for ITVVE Day 70: The Nation Remembers BBC Events Production for BBC1Popular, Factual and FeaturesDIY SOS: Homes For Veterans BBC Features Production for BBC1First Dates Twenty Twenty for Channel 4SAS: Who Dares Wins Minnow Films for Channel 4PresenterDavid Olusoga – Britain’s Forgotten Slave Owners BBC History Production for BBC2Grayson Perry – Grayson Perry’s Dream House Swan Films for Channel 4Reggie Yates – Reggie Yates’ Extreme Russia Sundog Pictures for BBC3Science and Natural HistoryBig Blue Live BBC Natural History Production for BBC1Japan: Earth’s Enchanted Islands BBC Natural History Production for BBC2Oak Tree: Nature’s Greatest Survivor Furnace TV for BBC4Scripted ComedyCatastrophe Avalon Television for Channel 4People Just Do Nothing Roughcut TV for BBC3Peter Kay’s Car Share Goodnight Vienna Productions for BBC iPlayerSingle DocumentaryGoing Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief Jigsaw Productions for Sky AtlanticMy Son The Jihadi True Vision Productions for Channel 4Storyville: India’s Daughter Assassin Films for BBC4Single DramaBlack Mirror: White Christmas Zeppotron for Channel 4Coalition Cuba Pictures for Channel 4Cyberbully Raw Television for Channel 4Soap and Continuing DramaCoronation Street ITV Studios for ITVEastEnders BBC Drama Production London for BBC1Emmerdale ITV Studios for ITVSports Presenter, Commentator or PunditAlan Shearer BBC Sport for BBC1David Coulthard BBC Sport for BBC1Gary Neville – Monday Night Football Sky SportsSports ProgrammeChampions League Goals Show BT SportMonday Night Football Sky SportsThe Ashes Sky SportsWriter – ComedyMichaela Coel – Chewing Gum Retort Television for E4Peter Kay, Sian Gibson, Paul Coleman & Tim Reid – Peter Kay’s Car Share Goodnight Vienna Productions for BBC iPlayerRob Delaney and Sharon Horgan – Catastrophe Avalon Television for Channel 4Writer – DramaRussell T.
