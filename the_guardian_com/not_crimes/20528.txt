Appearance: Angelic.Is that the sweet little Welsh boy who charmed everyone in the 1980s by singing that Snowman song and probably other things I’ve forgotten? That’s him.Age: 45.Pity. I know. You may have noticed that he’s a TV and radio presenter these days. But don’t despair! He’s about to release a brand new album sung in the same treble that stole everybody’s heart.What, a middle-aged man doing a whole album in pretend-child falsetto? Isn’t that a bit creepy and weird? It would be, but no. This is a real boy soprano.Dear God! You mean he’s castrated himself? Castration prevents the voice box and vocal cords from growing during puberty. I don’t think they will come back afterwards. And anyway, no, I’m pretty sure he hasn’t done that. This is just a secret album recorded a long time ago but never heard in public.A bit like that one the Wu-Tang Clan did? Um, kind of. Except this is a collection of folk songs that Jones sang as a child. His record company decided not to release it when his voice broke soon afterwards.That’s a bit mean. That’s showbiz. Jones had forgotten all about it until his mum reminded him. “When she asked my dad where it was, he said that the tape of recordings was in the airing cupboard, to keep it dry, sandwiched in between my old pants and socks,” he says.Were these special pants and socks? Why were his parents keeping them? He doesn’t say. Anyway, Jones listened to the music and liked it, which gave him the idea of releasing it now – but with an innovative new twist.Oh no. What is it? He’s duetting with himself.Eh? The present-day, baritone Jones will accompany his former, treble, self.The Highs and Lows of Aled Jones! Very good, but no. It’s actually called One Voice, and it includes famous tunes such as All Through the Night and Danny Boy.You just can’t hear Danny Boy too often, can you? That’s one opinion.Do say: “How about a duet between the child Aled Jones and the child Charlotte Church?”Don’t say: “How about him and Method Man?”
