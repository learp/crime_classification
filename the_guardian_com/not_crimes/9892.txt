Citrus fruit makes the heart sing, it brightens, refreshes and uplifts: a thick, bittersweet orange curd; a salad of bitter leaves and pink grapefruit made piquant with tiny capers; a light, cooling ceviche of sea bass and blood orange, or cold-weather main dish of Italian boiling sausage, slow-cooked potatoes and lemons. There is no better time for those clean, vivid citrus flavours than now – frost on the hedges, the scent of lemon zest in the air.Puntarelle, grapefruit and capers Some great things going on in this simple salad. Crisp, slightly bitter leaves, such as chicory or the long, jagged-toothed shoots of puntarelle, work well when dressed with something mild and buttery, like this dressing of citrus juice, capers and butter. The simplicity has something of a catch to it here, the dressing being easy to get wrong. I sometimes need more than one go at it. The butter needs to be lightly browned before you add the clementine juice. This needs a careful eye if it isn’t to burn. You need the toasty, nutty notes of the browned butter.Serves 4puntarelle or other bitter leaf 500ggrapefruit 1small orange 1 smallclementines 2butter 50gcapers 2 tsp, drainedTrim the puntarelle, removing any dark leaves, then put the pale tubular stalks into iced water. Leave for at least 2 hours.Slice the ends from the grapefruit, sit it flat on a chopping board then slice away the peel and white pith with a knife. Be vigilant about removing the pith, as its bitterness can spoil the salad. Cut the grapefruit in half, then cut each half into thin slices. Do the same with the orange.Drain the puntarelle and pat it dry with kitchen paper or spin briefly in a salad spinner. Toss the puntarelle with the grapefruit and orange. Halve the clementines and squeeze the juice, then set aside.Make the dressing: melt the butter in a small, shallow pan, then, watching it carefully, leave it for three or four minutes until it starts to smell nutty. The butter should darken slightly in colour. As soon as the butter smells nutty, pour in the juice of the clementines, stir in the drained capers, then remove from the heat immediately.Divide the salad between four plates, then spoon over the butter, caper and clementine dressing.Ceviche of sea bass and blood orange      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Ceviche of sea bass and blood orange. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer The texture of the marinated sea bass will mostly depend on the length of time it spends in the dressing. Two hours is just long enough for the sea bass to be tender and toothsome. Any longer and it may become too soft and woolly.Serves 4red onions 2radishes 10jalapeños 2sea bass 4 fillets (about 550g total weight)limes 3blood oranges 2sherry vinegar 2 tbspPeel the onions, then slice them into rounds no thicker than 1cm and put them in large glass bowl. Thinly slice the radishes and the jalapeños, then add them to the onions.Slice the sea bass finely into strips about 1cm in thickness, then put them in with the radishes and onions.Squeeze the limes and blood oranges – you need about 250ml – then season with the sherry vinegar, and a little salt and black pepper. Pour the juice over the fish and vegetables, cover and set aside, in the fridge, for about two hours. Serve on chilled plates.Cotechino with potatoes and lemon      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Cotechino with potatoes and lemon. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer The marriage of pork and lemon has long been a favourite of mine. This time, potatoes are roasted with lemon, olive and bay then tossed with pieces of juicy Italian sausage. Cotechino, the plump, sticky, boiling sausage, can be found in Italian grocers. It comes in a sachet, which you slip into cold water and bring to the boil. Beware the hot juices when you slip the hot sausage from its foil.Serves 3small, waxy potatoes 750glemon juice of 1garlic 4 clovesolive oil 4 tbspthyme 10 small sprigsrosemary 4 sprigsbay leaves 3cotechino sausage 500gSet the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Wash the potatoes, then cut them in half lengthways and put them in a roasting tin. Squeeze in the lemon juice then add the empty lemon shells. Add the peeled garlic cloves, olive oil, thyme and rosemary, and a little salt and black pepper, then toss gently to coat the potatoes. Place in the preheated oven and roast for about 30 minutes till the potatoes are golden.Put the cotechino, still in its sachet, into a deep pan of cold water and bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a simmer, cover with a lid and follow the timing instructions on the packet. (The cooking time will probably be about 20 minutes.)Remove the cotechino from the water, open the pouch, carefully remove the sausage then cut into six thick slices. Tuck the slices among the potatoes and return to the oven for 10 minutes before serving.Fig and orange shortbreads      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Fig and orange shortbreads.

Place a piece of baking parchment on a baking sheet.Remove and discard the hard stems from the figs, then put the figs into a food processor, add the golden sultanas and process to a coarse paste. Set aside.Put the butter, cut into small pieces, into the bowl of a food mixer, add the icing sugar and beat, with a flat paddle beater, to a pale, soft cream. Pour in the vanilla extract, and blend in the ground almonds and flour. Roughly chop the pistachios and fold them in, together with the orange zest.Lightly flour a chopping board. Take a tablespoon of the fig paste and roll it into a ball. Scoop up two tablespoons of the almond shortbread dough, roil it into a ball then press a deep hollow in the centre. Place the ball of fig paste in the hollow and draw the almond shortbread around it to completely enclose it. Flatten the balls lightly with a fork, then place on the lined baking sheet, with a little space between them.Bake for 20-25 minutes until pale biscuit coloured, then remove from the oven and allow to cool. Sift icing sugar over the biscuits and, if you wish, scatter with dried rose petals.Seville orange curd      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Seville orange curd.
