The books have proved controversial, topping the American Library Association’s list of “most frequently challenged” publications between 1990 and 1999. “Violence” and “unsuited for age group” were cited as reasons.At present, del Toro is listed as one of the project’s producers, but according to the Hollywood Reporter he “may potentially direct” the film, which has been picked up by CBS Films. If so, it is unlikely to be his next directorial effort, which looks to be the sequel to his 2013 giant-robot thriller Pacific Rim.
