A silly, heartwarming and cute book that reminds me of friendship and my ginger cat, Fluffy.Miss Petitfour is put into many silly and sometimes frightful adventures which she and her clever cats must overcome. Yes the story is VERY detailed and teaches young children amazing new words. Why would you not want to fly off with sixteen cats, flying in the wind and above everyone else? When I read this book it sometimes made me laugh, cry, feel excited and very hungry. It was like I was experiencing all the adventures myself!Yes it has all these amazing qualities that I believe a book should have. But another thing I would like to mention is the artwork alone, it’s totally beautiful! The illustrations definitely add to the quirky, almost twee atmosphere of the adventures. This story will truly warm your heart. I really enjoy dystopian novels but when I read this book I realised that maybe I am a fan of adventure books too. I loved the fact that her cats were all unique to one another and the introduction of the cats made you understand each and everyone’s personalty. How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? I would recommend this book to everyone who loves adventures, cats and food! Especially cakes! Ages- 6 and above.
