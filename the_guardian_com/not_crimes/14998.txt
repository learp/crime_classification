PodcastYou Must Remember ThisKarina Longworth’s podcast about the secret history of Hollywood has been essential listening for cinephiles for some time now, tackling everything from the life and times of Joan Crawford to the Manson murders. It returns on Tuesday 31 January for a new series.youmustrememberthispodcast.comMusicSamphaOne of 2017’s biggest new music hopes, honey-tonsilled soul pianist Sampha has actually been around for a while (he was duetting with Jessie Ware in 2011). After a bit of a break and working with the biggest names in US hip-hop and R&B – Kanye West and Solange Knowles – he’s back and about to release his gorgeous debut album, Process.Process is released on Young Turks on Friday 3 FebTheatreUs/ThemPowerful, remarkable and harrowing are just some of the ways this brave and, impressively, family-geared show about the pupils, parents and teachers who were taken hostage in 2004 at a school in Beslan has been described in recent reviews. Far from a gruelling account, the play is seen through the school kids’ eyes, with balloons doubling as bombs, to try to explore the ways that children cope with trauma.At National Theatre: Dorfman to Saturday 18 FebFilmGold      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Matthew McConaughey and Edgar Ramírez in Gold.

Gold, his next film, loosely charts a 1993 gold mining scandal: his businessman teams up with Edgar Ramírez’s geologist to explore the Borneo jungle. On general release from Friday 3 FebTVFortitudeFortitude’s first series started out as standard Scandicrime, but turned into something else altogether: part Twin Peaks-style black comedy, part supernatural body horror (anyone who witnessed the Sofie Gråbøl-starring drama’s notorious “fork” scene is unlikely to forget it any time soon). The opening episode of the show’s second run aired last week, offering up decapitations, dread and Dennis Quaid. For those who were intrigued by the first instalment, the full series is available now. On Sky Go and Now TVCaseWell, what do you know, another must-see Nordic crime noir, this time from Iceland and the director of Trapped.
