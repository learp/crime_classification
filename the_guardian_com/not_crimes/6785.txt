We are all used to the amazing story that is Twilight; whether you are a Twi-hard or not, there’s no way you haven’t heard about the epic romance between Bella and Edward.Life and Death was released for Twilight’s tenth anniversary and changes the story around a bit. Instead of Bella and Edward, get ready to go on a journey with Beau and Edith – I know, Stephanie Meyer chose some interesting names.Anyway, the fantastic story line is the same but with a switched point of view from the characters we already know and love. Most of the events that take place in the book are also the same.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest All of the other characters in the novel had a gender switch as well; except Charlie and Renee, but Stephanie explains that just before the book begins.So if you love Twilight you’ll love this; and even if you don’t – give it a try anyway. This is especially for all the guys out there as this book shows what it would be like dating a vampire, from a guy’s perspective. Personally, I loved this book; the whole idea of a switched perspective is amazing.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
