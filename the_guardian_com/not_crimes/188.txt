Dozens of people in one of the world’s most wired nations have taken part in South Korea’s “space out” competition aimed at promoting a life free from stress and information overload.About 60 contestants spent 90 minutes sitting in a public park in Seoul without talking, sleeping, eating or using any electronic devices during the event – under the slogan of Relax Your Brain. The “space out” competition was launched by local artists in 2014 as an art installation event. Sunday’s contest – supported by Seoul city council – drew more than 1,500 online applicants for the available places in the competition.“Let our brain – never free from information overload from a smartphone, TV or computer – relax!” the council said in a statement. “Let’s enjoy just thinking nothing!” Blank-faced contestants – including a mother and a young child and middle-aged men in suits – sat or lay still in temperatures of over 30C (86F). Many held parasols to protect themselves from the sun.Participants are also not allowed to look at their watches or move around too much. The person measured as having the most stable heart rate is judged the winner. On Sunday, the honours went to a well-known local rapper. “I was so exhausted physically and mentally while preparing an album, so I just wanted to relax for a while,” said Shin Hyo-Seob, aka Crush. “This event is highly recommended for those who have migraines or complicated thoughts,” the 28-year-old said, holding his glass trophy.More than 80% of South Korea’s 50 million people have smartphones, with a growing fixation on everything digital seen as a serious problem. The country’s smartphone users spend an average of four hours a day tweeting, chatting or playing games, with about 15% showing symptoms of addiction, according to state data.This article was amended on 23 May 2016 to clarify that the event was launched and continues to be organised by artists, not activists, with the support of the city council this year, and is intended as an art installation.
