Your report on using the canal network for freight (2 January) was timely and something the Commercial Boat Operators Association supports. Yet we (and the Freight Transport Association) do not advocate the large-scale return of freight-carrying boats to the historic narrow canal system, but the greater use and development of the UK's large-scale commercial waterways â€“ those radiating from the estuaries. These include the Manchester ship canal, the river Weaver, the Aire and Calder and South Yorkshire navigations, the rivers Ouse, Trent, Thames and Severn, and the Caledonian Canal in Scotland, which already carry about 4.5m tonnes of freight internally annually (1.5m tonnes on the British Waterways network) but, as you suggest, could carry much more. The CBOA is optimistic about transfer of the British Waterways network to the Canal and River Trust and confident its trustees will press for sufficient funding to reduce arrears of maintenance.David LoweSecretary, CBOA
