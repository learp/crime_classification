I’m not very good at running, even though I do it a lot. For the last three months, I’ve been training to run a marathon under four hours. I have no idea of I can do it, I’ve tried several times before. But that doesn’t stop me from dragging my 35-year-old, 140-pound body up and out the door six mornings a week to try.Running has been described as a compulsion, and perhaps it is. But aside from lost toenails, chafing in delicate spots, blisters and an at times unseemly appetite, I don’t think it’s a bad one. I’m not alone either. According to Running USA, 18,750,000 people completed races in 2014. That’s not just a leap but a rocket launch from 1990, when that number was under five million.But why? Why is this activity, where you hurl yourself forward and set anything not strapped or compressed down jiggling, so popular? On its most basic level, running is practical and cheap. It’s a simple, compact exercise that you can take almost anywhere, one that burns a lot of calories, and only really requires a good pair of shoes to be done right. But it’s more than that. It’s mental windshield wiping – an activity where, if you run long enough, far enough and hard enough, clears the decks and lets you forget what’s been bothering you. In 2008, a lot of people needed to clear their minds. At the height of the recession, running’s popularity exploded. Philadelphia’s Broad Street 10-mile run, now the sixth largest race in the country, saw a 3,000-person registration jump between 2007 and 2008. Between 2008 and 2013, the race grew 67%. The race director speculated that financial distress combined with the desire to have control over one thing – anything – led people to sign up in droves. That same anxiety is once again in the air, thanks to election campaign season. I’ve had cigarette butts thrown at me, vulgar comments too – and a woman pushing a stroller once gave me the finger Running is a community too, a worldwide one speaking the same language. In the last 10 years, I’ve worked through grief, the near-collapse of my business and the demise of a relationship I thought would end in marriage by running. In those deepest, darkest times, I could run, and I could talk with other runners about running – anything other than what was really bothering me – even if those runs felt more like walking through sludge, feet sticking to the floor.Running is not a perfect sport. It’s rarely pretty, tidy or even safe: I’ve had cigarette butts thrown at me, vulgar comments too – and a woman pushing a stroller once gave me the finger. I’m often dodging cars, bikes, dogs, potholes and untethered toddlers. I’ve run in weather so hot that sweat rolled down my legs into my shoes, which then squished with each step, and so cold it brought my fingers to the brink of frostbite. I’ve had races break my spirit, nearly break my foot, and – in the case of the 2014 New York City Marathon – left me on the edge of vomiting for 48 hours after.But still, I step outside and I run.Olympic marathoner Shalane Flanagan talks of the Church of the Sunday Long Run. I’m not so much a lapsed Catholic as someone who was flung out of her pew by homilies on the dangers of birth control and gay marriage, delivered by representatives of an institution still playing dumb about its abominable deeds. Still, I’d missed that time of mental quiet, of reflection, and found it again by being a part of this community that doesn’t judge and only cheers on, whether it’s liking another runner’s Facebook post about a hard workout, or at finish lines where the achievements of the last are celebrated as much as those of the first. And so, I run six days a week, run until my shirt clings to my body with sweat and legs quiver. But I also make sure to say hello to the other runners along the way.I don’t know if I’ll hit my marathon goal. I’m sticking to my training, but an errant pothole or hot weather race day can end that dream before it really starts. In a lot of ways, it’s won’t matter. I’ve gained so much more in the work and solace it’s taken me to get there. Jen A Miller is author of Running: A Love Story.
