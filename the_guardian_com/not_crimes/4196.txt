It’s that time of year again, when schools in the UK have broken up for the summer holidays and the weather responds accordingly. We’re certain the start of September will be just lovely, but for now, enjoy the rain, the wind, and the endless banks of cloud. We know from past assignments that our readers are pretty stoic about bad weather hitting their holiday plans, and we’re keen to see what you’re up to even if the skies are leaden and the attractions you are visiting don’t quite match up to your expectations. If you’re on holiday in Britain this week, we want to see your photographs - the more underwhelming the better. From soggy campsites to broken tourist attractions, all we ask is for you to take care, be safe, and send us images dripping with disappointment. We’ll put together a gallery of the best / worst pictures, to make those of us stuck at work feel slightly better about our fate. Looking for inspiration? Be like JKLEIN96, who managed to go to Land’s End during a heatwave in London.Lands End AKA DismalandCame down to Cornwall from London for a week away. Get to Lands End and can't see further than 10 metres in front of us. Strange visitor centre/amusement area, not quite sure what the aim was (plus a Shaun the Sheep experience for a small fee). Anyway, turns out it's 27 degrees in London.Sent via Guardian Witness By JKLEIN96  21 August 2015, 18:14 How to contributeShare your work by clicking on the blue “Contribute” button on this article.
