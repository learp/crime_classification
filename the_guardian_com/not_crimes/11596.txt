There are more than 4,000 items of litter on every kilometreof Northern Ireland's beaches and shores, a new survey has revealed.A report by Tidy Northern Ireland for the Department of the Environment has found that 14 beaches and shorelines were strewn with rubbish included sheep carcasses and the chassis of an abandoned truck.Nearly three-quarters of the litter was plastic, including cigarette lighters and bottles (290 for each km) while there were also crisp packets and pieces of rope and string (462 pieces a km).Overall, there were 4,033 pieces of litter ranging from black agricultural sheeting to live distress flares left on each kilometre of coastline.Of 262 metal items found for each km, 148 were drinks cans and there were 276 sanitary items such as cotton buds, wet wipes and nappies, which Northern Ireland Water stresses should not be flushed down the toilet.The survey forms part of the D of E marine division's response to the marine strategy framework directive, which requires Northern Ireland to achieve "good environmental status" by 2020.It uses an internationally recognised method to record the amount and type of litter on 14 reference beaches every three months from Limavady via Rathlin Island to Warrenpoint. Northern Ireland has pledged to achieve an overall reduction in the number of visible litter items within specific categories on coastlines.The survey which analysed the beach litter between September 2012 and April 2013 concluded that the good weather in early summer had also led to an increase in rubbish being scattered on local beaches.Mark Durkan, Northern Ireland's new environment minister in the devolved government at Stormont, said raising public awareness was the only guaranteed way of reducing marine litter."A combination of education, provision of adequate waste reception facilities and enforcement of legislation is needed to tackle beach litter."Beach cleans are an excellent public participation exercise, focusing the public's attention on the issue of marine litter and creating a sense of environmental responsibility," he said.
