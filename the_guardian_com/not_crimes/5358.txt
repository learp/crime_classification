Crime Investigations: Fact And Fiction, LondonAlthough the true crime genre has been rebooted of late by twisty, turny hits such as Serial and Making A Murderer, the Crime + Investigation channel has long provided UK viewers with their own slightly more low-rent fix via grisly US homicides and real-life Midsomer Murders. Branching out from hammy docudramas, it has partnered with the Museum Of London and its police paraphernalia showcase Crime Museum Uncovered for this talk, which will explore what it means to be a detective today. Dermot Murnaghan – who hosts of one of its more credible series, Crimes That Shook Britain – chairs a panel of experts to explore modern policing and the stories behind some of the never-before-seen items on show, which include personal objects and weapons, as well as case files connected to the crimes of the Krays, Dr Crippen and the great train robbers. However, more than the exhibition itself, the focus will be on contemporary crimes that are still fresh in the mind and the process of modern investigation.Museum Of London, EC2, TueHDStewart Lee In Conversation, OxfordThere can’t have been many comedians who have parsed the mechanics of their own trade with the relentless precision of Stewart Lee. This almost surgical approach to the conventions of stand-up could make his performances a desperately dry and self-indulgent business. And it’s fair to say that Lee is a polarising figure, with as many fierce detractors as fervent admirers. However, anyone who’s read his joke-unravelling memoir How I Escaped My Certain Fate will know that this rigour lends itself to further layers of comedy and makes his digressive deconstructions as entertaining as the shows themselves. This talk will see him exploring the workings of comedy performance and the unique requirements of writing for TV, radio and theatre, with professor Simon Kövesi asking Lee questions supplied by attendees. Expect belly laughs and brain food in equal measure from this admirably singular and uncompromising figure.Oxford Brookes University, WedPHAn Evening With Floyd Mayweather Jr, Cardiff & LondonWhat does a boxer do once the gloves have been hung up? It must be a question niggling at the brains of any pugilist in the gloaming of their career. Some move into coaching, others to punditry, a select few to showbiz, panto or lucrative public appearances. With the embers of his career still warm, Floyd Mayweather is taking to the talks circuit for a series of appearances to discuss the remarkable career he chose to end on the nice round number of 49 victories (an unbelievable 26 by knockout) and no defeats; multi-million-dollar wins against Ricky Hatton, Saúl Alvarez and Oscar De La Hoya cementing his place as one of the greatest fighters of all time. He’ll discuss his personal and professional life with Sky Sports’ Johnny Nelson in Cardiff and Jonathan Ross in London, though prices for the latter are concussively steep: £525 for a standard ticket, with a “platinum package” (including a meet and greet) retailing for a whopping £1,050. Despite being billed as a “charity fundraising event”, it should still keep Mayweather out of Aladdin at the Sunderland Empire for the time being.St David’s Hall, Cardiff, Mon; London Hilton On Park Lane, W1, Thu; touring to 14 FebLH
