 We live in a city but have a garden and I’d like to encourage my children to look more closely at nature. Can you recommmend books that might help them take an interest and find out more?At this time of year it is easy to engage children in looking at the world around them. Whether you are in a city or the country it is so obvious that everything is changing. The trees are getting greener, birds are singing and carrying twigs for nest-building and, in the countryside at least, every patch of water is full of frog and toad spawn. The first step is to get your children to start looking for themselves and encouraging them to notice the changes and to record what they are seeing. With everyday getting longer and warmer, nothing stays the same for long!There are some good books for introducing the basic principles of how nature works. Eric Carle’s The Tiny Seed is a beautifully simple introduction to the life cycle of a seed for any age group. It’s the story of one seed, and describes all the dangers that surround it, from people stepping on it to birds eating it. It also shows how important the right weather is for making the seed grow strong and how, when the seed grows, it produces a new plant which, in turn, produces more seeds. In Lucy Cousins’s Maisy Grows a Garden lovely flowers and vegetables can be made to grow just by pulling tabs and lifting flaps! But there is a lot of information packed in too as it is one of Maisy’s First Science series.In A Little Guide to Trees Charlotte Voake looks at growing on a bigger scale. Her delicate illustrations provide a useful way to identify different trees, including oaks, hollies and beech trees which may be found in cities as well as in the country. The book also includes a tree scrap book for readers to fill in and keep.Just looking may not be enough; many children will love getting more closely involved and growing their own plants will be the ideal way of helping them understand nature better. Ley Honor Roberts’s My First Flower Garden is an excellent practical introduction to growing beautiful flowers. Sowing seeds, planting out seedlings, dealing with garden pests such as slugs which might damage the flowers – all is simply explained with easy to follow instructions. Suggested first flowers to grow include sunflowers which can shoot up so impressively tall and sweet peas which always smell so nice. Sarah Garland’s Eddie’s Garden: And How to Make Things Grow is a wonderful story about a small boy and the garden he creates. But it is also more than just a story as it is full of facts about all the things that have helped to make Eddie’s garden grow. A guide to spring - in pictures Gardens are not just about growing plants. Mike Dilger’s Wildlife in Your Garden is an excellent introduction to all the wildlife that can be found in a garden. Follow the cheeky hedgehog in the pictures to find out all about the butterflies, wasps and bees, foxes, rabbits, frogs and beetles that might be living in any garden. And there is a special focus on the very many kinds of birds which visit gardens as winter visitors as well as the ones who are around all year round, providing an invaluable guide to bird spotting near to home. Sarah Horne’s vivid illustrations help to bring the photographic backgrounds of this fact-packed book to life.Don’t miss Nicola Davies’ gorgeous, poetic, scrapbook style First Book of Nature, with beautiful illustrations by Mark Hearld. It really is a treat.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Emily Gravett’s little badger Pete embarks on a disastrous tidying spree inTidy. Photograph: PRFor a brilliant and completely different way of looking at nature – and one that will make readers of any age stop and think – Emily Gravett’s Tidy is the book to try. A wittily told conservation story, it tells of a badger called Pete who likes everything neat. Pete lives in the forest and spends all of his time tidying up. First he picks up all the leaves then, to stop more falling, he cuts down all the trees. When that creates a flood and a lot of mud, Pete concretes everything over. But how will he ever get back to his home underground? Luckily, Pete understands what a disaster his tidying has been. He soon puts everything back and learns to love his forest home for what it is. Children who are beginning to take an interest in nature will be delighted by this brilliant picture book and will be influenced by its powerful and wittily conveyed message.Share your favourite books on nature with us.
