I am inclined to repeat a question asked by a Keswick correspondent: “Is there anything funny about the owls just now?” We can hardly imagine that they object to lighting orders, but certainly they appear to have taken a fancy for daylight hunting. The Keswick correspondent reports two different barn owls out in the morning and afternoon several times during the last two mouths, and also that a Sussex friend tells him that tawny owls “are out hunting all over the place by three in the afternoon.” On the same date that he wrote me, another correspondent reported that he saw a barn owl a few days ago in search of food near Nantwich a little before noon. Short-eared owls frequently hunt in the daytime, but barn and tawny owls are habitually crepuscular, and, at most seasons of the year, only fly in the daytime when accidentally disturbed. When, however, barn owls have hungry families demanding constant attention they will sometimes strive to provide for them in broad daylight: only under these circumstances have I seen barn owls seeking prey by day. Although owls are early breeders we can hardly imagine that so many birds and in such widely separated places have already got young, and the conclusion is that there is something funny about them. The war, so far as one can guess, has not made the capture of mice or slumbering sparrows more difficult.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Manchester Guardian, 25 February 1916.
