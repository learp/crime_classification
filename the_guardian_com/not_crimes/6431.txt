While I sympathise with Dave Morris (Letters, 15 April) – and even might agree with him – I should point out it is wrong to include libraries in his list of non-statutory services. I am constantly irritated that it is not made clear – often by the media – that public libraries in this country are a statutory service. Local authorities are obliged by statute (the Public Libraries and Museums Act of 1964) to provide a “comprehensive and efficient” public library service, even though this would seem to be being ignored at present.Barry SmithIlkley, West Yorkshire• When a minute’s silence was announced on the TV showing the Liverpool v Dortmund game in memory of the Hillsborough victims (Sport, 15 April), the very full and noisy crowd in Chester’s Bear and Billet pub fell silent. Totally, not a whisper, and very moving. Who said that it’s just a game?Bob LambChester• It’s no wonder the airport detector dogs find cheese better than they sniff out cocaine (Report, 15 April). Lines of cocaine so often lead to soggy dialogue, whereas a strong cheese can strain canine leads with its doggy sialagogue.Alec MitchellManchester• I’m not sure how Lord Adonis defines “fast” (Report, 13 April), but Crossrail will take 102 minutes to cover about 60 miles between Reading and Shenfield. With no toilets.Adam SowanReading• Your letters about train delays (15 April) remind me of the good old pre-privatisation days. On the Cambridge-Liverpool Street line, in a strong Norfolk accent: “Mother nature 2, British Rail 1.”Kelvin AppletonBeverley, East Yorkshire• Some time back, I asked the ticket collector at Cooden station (Sussex) why my train was cancelled. His reply was: “If I told you, you wouldn’t understand.” Charming.Christina NaylorPlancoët, Brittany, France• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
