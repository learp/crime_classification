Last Friday, about 100 members of the Los Angeles dance music community congregated in the early afternoon on a rooftop in West Hollywood. Sunglasses protected them from a cloud-shrouded sun as they fortified themselves with bottles of Negroni and glasses of white wine. DJ Paul Oakenfold mingled amiably in a tight long-sleeve T-shirt with Hollywhat across his chest. They were all gathered for a live three-hour broadcast of Pete Tong’s weekly show on BBC Radio 1. With a few minutes until airtime, Tong took the stage to officially welcome the crowd and ask that they please turn off their cellphones so they wouldn’t disrupt the signal. As if.For more than 25 years Tong has been a crucial part of dance music’s global growth through his work as a DJ, radio host, recording artist, label worker and tastemaker. Once dance music became culturally absorbed, as well as thoroughly monetised, in his native UK, he was ready for a change. In 2013, Tong relocated to Los Angeles, arguably the centre of the United States’ still expanding marketplace for EDM.In the 1990s, Tong was the first BBC DJ to broadcast live from Ibiza, and in 2016 he plans to do four shows from cities around the US, with Los Angeles first on the list. These events will also offer him the chance to do the programme live, which is now a rarity given the eight-hour time difference between his new city and London. During a phone interview earlier in the week, Tong explained it was crucial that he create a setting to prove everything was happening in real time. “There are all the conspiracy theories that Neil Armstrong was in a studio in Hollywood and he never landed on the moon, and radio technology is so amazing that you can always fake anything,” he said. “So I thought, ‘How am I going to do a show in LA and prove it? What can I do in a three-dimensional world?’”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Techno meets house: Richie Hawtin, left, and Pete Tong.

He eventually chose EP & LP, an Asian fusion restaurant with a rooftop bar, whose investors include Axwell – the DJ and producer who was once part of the Swedish House Mafia. A whirl of cameramen hired for additional online video content would be able to capture the show’s performers against a backdrop of the luxe hotels that line the Sunset Strip and the mansions that stud the Hollywood Hills. The show began with a soulful mix from Detroit house music veteran MK, dressed in a thin black hoodie. Marc Kinchen first made a name for himself in dance music during the 90s with his own singles, plus remixes for artists including Nightcrawlers and Celine Dion. He left that world to move to LA, eventually immersing himself in pop production work and collaborations with Will Smith. Around the start of this decade he got back into dance music because a new generation of artists had taken his original sound and brought it back in vogue.

Jesse Rose comes from London, but has been running his Made to Play label from the city for several years. Eats Everything and Patrick Topping, a pair of Brits who manned the decks together, were performing in town later that night at Sound, a pricey bottle service club. Eric Prydz is a big-name progressive house act from Sweden who now lives in a house below the famous Hollywood sign. The show even featured an interview with Junkie XL, a Dutch musician who came up in the big beat scene of the 90s (his remix of Elvis Presley’s A Little Less Conversation was a No 1 hit in the UK), but has abandoned recording new albums in favor of a celebrated career composing scores for blockbusters like Mad Max: Fury Road and the forthcoming Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Still, when reflecting on the city earlier, Tong sounded more like a native in his appreciation of it, hardly mentioning his industry at all. “LA is a bewildering place for people when they first arrive because it looks so massive out the plane window. You can’t get a hang of the scale of it,” he said. “Now, in many ways, I think LA is a series of little villages. They’re things in LA that have disappeared in other parts of the world, certainly in the UK, like the hardware store that has been there for 30 years. You’ve got a real sense of community in LA once you get down on the streets.” Asked if he’d considered moving to Las Vegas – home of the casino affiliated giganta-clubs and the current base of EDM stars like Steve Aoki and Diplo who once lived in Los Angeles – Tong didn’t hesitate: “Definitely not.”
