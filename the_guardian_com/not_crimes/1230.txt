When making a drink at home, you want it to be quick, easy and delicious. This twist on a classic sour, named after the Tate & Lyle Sugars refinery over the Thames from Craft, is a showstopper. Serves one.40ml gin (we use Beefeater)1 egg white (20ml)15ml golden syrup15ml lemon juice10ml raspberry vinegar (Womersley make a good one) Put everything in a shaker and shake vigorously. Add ice, shake again to cool, then strain into a coupette.â€¢ Adam Wyatt-Jones, Craft London
