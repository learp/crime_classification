The Conservative MP Tim Yeo, who is facing allegations of offering to advise energy companies for cash, has agreed to step aside temporarily as chairman of the energy and climate change select committee.Yeo made his decision after it became clear that Labour members of the committee were losing confidence in him and wanted him to step aside.He said on Monday that he needed time to concentrate on clearing his name with the parliamentary commissioner for standards, to whom he has referred his case.Yeo was elected to the select committee chairmanship and it is not clear if a fresh election will be held, or a temporary substitute will be appointed.The chairmanship is held by the Tory party as part of a wider distribution of select committee chairmanships between the political parties. The most senior Tory on the committee is Peter Lilley, a climate change sceptic in contrast with Yeo, who is a strong advocate of renewable energy.The Sunday Times recorded Yeo on tape saying that he had coached John Smith, the managing director of GB Rail Freight, on what to say in front of his committee. The reporters were pretending to act on behalf of a fictitious South Korean solar energy company.Yeo has denied the claims and said he did not ask questions at the relevant select committee hearing due to his declared financial interests, including being a director of GB Railfreight's parent company Eurotunnel. He also claims he only offered to represent companies, but do nothing in public.The shadow cabinet office minister, Gareth Thomas, had piled pressure on Yeo in advance of his announcement, saying: "David Cameron has revealed how weak he is. He has failed to show leadership over serious allegations that Tim Yeo coached a witness to the energy and climate change committee, and used his position to further the interests of his clients."Tim Yeo has the right to defend himself but it is difficult to see how he can continue as chair of the select committee pending investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner. If David Cameron won't act then Tim Yeo should take it upon himself to stand down from his post."In a statement issued on Sunday, Yeo said: "I did not 'coach' John Smith on this or any other occasion. He is not a 'paying client' as the Sunday Times alleges, but a business colleague. Like many business executives giving evidence to select committees he sought advice from the public affairs company retained for the purpose by GB Rail Freight."Yeo said that at no point had he agreed to work for the reporters' fictitious company. "The whole recording would show the context of the conversation and demonstrate clearly that at no stage did I agree or offer to work for the fictitious company these undercover reporters claimed to be representing, still less did I commit to doing so for a day a month as the article claims."
