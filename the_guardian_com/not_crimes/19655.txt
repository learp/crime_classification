TVC 15 is David Bowie at his buoyant best. Reportedly based on an Iggy Pop hallucination in which the proto-punk star believed the television set was swallowing his girlfriend, the boogie-woogie pop romp was Bowie’s second single from Station to Station in the UK.My favourite album: Station to Station by David Bowie A 2010 mix of the track, by the album’s original producer, Harry Maslin, is being made available for the first time on the Who Can I Be Now? box set, which celebrates Bowie’s career from 1974 to 1976. It was reported at the time of Station to Station’s release that Bowie wasn’t satisfied with the original mix; this updated version was an attempt to achieve the drier sound they’d been aiming for while recording it in 1975.This version of the song, premiered below, has never been available before digitally or on CD or vinyl. Take a listen and let us know what you think. Who Can I Be Now? (1974-1976) out on 23 September.
