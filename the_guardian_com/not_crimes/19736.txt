Kwamé Ryan conducts three of the pieces, all with typically evocative titles: The Deserted Churchyards, The Weeping White Room and Minnelieder – Zweites Minnewater.Royal Festival Hall, SE1, 6 April; The Anvil, Basingstoke, 7 AprilMartland MemorialThe composer Steve Martland died suddenly in 2013, at the age of 58.
