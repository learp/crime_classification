Just in time for Valentine’s Day, Yotam Ottolenghi has provided us with a delightful menu (The food of love, Weekend, 11 February) that is both romantic (pink sorbet!) and ironical (Aperol!). It makes for a perfectly postmodern celebration of love. But what about readers who have alternative plans for 14 February?Yotam Ottolenghi’s recipes for Valentine’s Day Perhaps they will enjoy the great cookery writer MFK Fisher’s un-seduction menu. It starts with several martinis, followed by prosciutto, marinated shrimps and anchovy-stuffed olives. Next comes a ragout of venison, or perhaps squabs stuffed with mushrooms and wild rice, accompanied by plenty of red wine. “I would waste no time on a salad,” she advises, “unless perhaps a freakish rich one treacherously containing truffles and new potatoes”. This should be followed by chilled figs in kirsch with double cream, and a sly bottle of sauternes. By this stage your dinner companion, she guarantees, will be reduced to a “slumberous lump of masculine inactivity”, and your virtue will “to put it mildly, rest inviolate”.Rebecca EarleLeamington Spa• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
