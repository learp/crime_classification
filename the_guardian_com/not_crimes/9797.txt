Britons who weren't English were taffs and jocks and micks. Very recently, within my lifetime, these distinctions have been eroded and there is, instead, a series of divisions around colour, race and culture that are far from settled. Britishness is, and always has been, fluid and changeable. Its goalposts shift over time and the British identity or sense of belonging can never be guaranteed. At times, like now, it is fragile and subject to many competing political claims. In fact, it's the fragility that is most worrying since it can be used to achieve all kinds of divisive ends. A less fragile sense of britishness might go some way to ameliorating the anxieties and myths around sovereignty and duty in an interconnected world.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.39pm GMT15:39The 10-a-day diet tested: 'I feel like a sentient composter'Stuart HeritageIf anything, I’m even less optimistic about hitting 10 portions of fruit and veg a day than I was when I wrote this piece. Speaking to nutritionists, and hearing from Felicity Cloake, has just made everything so much more complicated. Really, “10 a day” is too simplistic a name for this. Really, it should be called “10 a day, but not too much fruit, and only a certain sort of vegetable, and absolutely no duplicates whatsoever”. Making people feel guilty for not eating enough fruit and veg is one thing, but making them feel guilty for eating the wrong sort of fruit and veg just seems unnecessarily churlish. This whole thing just seems like a way to make people feel bad about themselves, which is why I’ve given up. Pizza tonight. Pizza forever.

And it is these subjects which my long read addressed. I was humbled and moved by the reaction from Guardian readers. I got tweets, emails and Facebook messages with their reactions and most important to me, their own stories and experiences, and how this related to where they are. Maryyum Mehmood (@marymood)If you read anything today, make sure it's this. Profound, personal piece by @IsmailEinashe on identity, belonging and Britishness today https://t.co/itbuTJzRUCMarch 2, 2017The most interesting reactions were the outrage many felt about how the UK government can strip British citizens of their rights. And the way this has been presented to us as a short-cut to fighting terrorism, when in reality this masks the true purpose of such laws which is to embolden the state, at the expense of ordinary people. Many sent me moving emails about their own struggles to become British. I worked on this long read for several months, so it was heartening to get emails and Tweets from many readers expressing their “thanks”, because my words made them feel visible. I want to hear from people about their own experiences, journeys and stories of moving borders and becoming a citizen somewhere else.

They try on any trendy clothes, music, hobbies, careers, and even political ideas, just to try and seem like they are on the cutting edge when the stark reality is they have no idea what they really believe in or what makes them who they are because they never wear it long enough to sink in. Being a hipster, in my view, is someone attempting to put other's ideas onto their self in a conscious effort, rather than developing their own identity or simply being comfortable in their own skin. It usually happens when people are desperately seeking popularity, don't have much personality, or haven't found success through traditional paths and therefore want to distinguish themselves as 'not like the mainstream' in order to appear interesting.   ID6175823 03 March 2017 2:06pmHipster originates in Berlin. When the wall came down old and new organically came together to create a style influenced by nostalgia and technology. Which has progressed into Instagram for example. However where a cultural youth movement like punk had few influences, hipster is a global phenomenon that took shape with the birth of the internet, so no one can really put their liberal finger on it. Especially as it grew in a period where we've never had more information about our diet and world. If a happening starts on a housing project like Hip-Hop, its easy to define.Finally on this topic, for now:   HeeeresJohnny 03 March 2017 1:48pmThe hipster is the celebration of uniform individuality.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.36pm GMT14:36This, in reference to Martin Belam (see 14.25) is actually a point raised by many readers before – we’ll ask around and see if we can get someone from the obits desk to write about their process.

And it ended quite unlike any other I’ve experienced.harriet (@harrietgibsone)The @guardianfilm have been awake forever - here's everything you need to know about the 2017 Oscars https://t.co/ygodsuB1XkFebruary 27, 2017For something like the Oscars, where there are a limited number of expected outcomes, we pre-write articles so they are ready to be published the instant the news breaks. So you can hit ‘go’ on “Emma Stone wins best actress” the second her name is read out, and then gradually add in to the article what she has said, the right photo of her accepting the award and so on, as events continue to unfold.Which is how we ended up publishing that La La Land had won best picture, then unpublishing it, and publishing that Moonlight won in the space of a couple of minutes.As I left the office in the morning, I saw a lot of reaction along the lines of “So they read out the wrong name, big deal, what’s the fuss” but unless you watched it in real-time it’s difficult to convey just how jaw-dropped an experienced newsroom was by it all. In the space of thirty seconds my mind went from “Oh La La Land has won” to “Oh the producers of La La Land are doing a nice gesture to share the limelight with Moonlight” to “Seriously, are you actually kidding me! Delete! Delete! Delete!”Did the media focus too much on the mistake, and allow that to detract from Moonlight’s achievement? Very probably. It was an irresistible story though - the human drama etched on those faces on stage as the mix-up unfolded made a compelling set of images. I think the right film won in the end. My favourite theory I’ve heard this week though is that with the rise of the global fascist right, the state of the environment, and the impending collapse of civilisation, we’ve slipped into an alternate universe or timeline where all the bad stuff is happening. The Oscars mix-up allowed us a brief glimpse of the true timeline trying to re-assert itself – where a movie like Moonlight wins awards instead of La La Land.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.08pm GMT14:08And here’s a piece where readers told us who should have won the Oscars ...

It was the final twist in the Oscar’s final scene. As a result two accountants, who were responsible for the mistake, have been sacked (a more detailed explanation of why can be found here).What did you make of events?

They're not the property developers buying the land or the estate agents setting the rent prices on the inevtiable upmarket flats. If you're looking for the true cause of gentrification how about asking why outward expansion of London is constricted by an out of date Green Belt policy.Realistically, it's limited supply of land with high demand which is driving gentrification, not some bloke opening an organic coffee shop in Peckham and only playing 70's records.Updatedat 1.07pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.45pm GMT12:45Another definition of hipsters from a reader below ...

Didgebaba 03 March 2017 12:36pmI would take dandy over hipster any day. The hipster of today wears experience like a badge, gathered from the shelves of a ‘vintage’ shop and set up somewhere obvious but not loud on your carefully maintained body. Hipsters are, in the words of one recent critic, grounded in irony and the distance that provides in relation to ‘bad things’ happening and the drive toappropriating stuff. "Everything, to be precise. Your grandfather’s facial hair, 70s albums, and remote neighborhoods that are still close to downtown. Whether it’s in music, style, or actual land — stealing, reclaiming, re-using, settling, gentrifying, or whatever else you want to call it is at the core of hipstering. You must find something that already existed, that is completely uncool, and then you must announce that it’s cool and then all your friends must come there and set up shop, and then you must walk around it like you own it. And then you’ve gotta find something else that was already there. And repeat."https://medium.com/@JimBarrett/hipster-versus-dandy-6ef3c9c1dfea#.dhigvq4p5But apart from him, is this true?   JonPurrtree 03 March 2017 12:35pm30 minutes in, on a friday lunchtime. It appears that nobody want to talk about hipsters.Updatedat 12.40pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.12pm GMT12:12What makes a food a "hipster food"?Tony Naylor“It is exhausting. It is exciting.” Was how I described the ever-accelerating churn of new ideas in food in the intro to this week’s Ultimate Hipster-Food Glossary. That tone of affection and ambivalence is, for me, the only suitable one for a scene as creative as it is ludicrous. For every worthwhile idea in modern food, nine more will leave you open-mouthed – and not in a good way (see unicorn food).That ambiguity, however, seems to irritate many of those motivated enough to post BTL. It is all good fun and, when I have the time, I happily join in these conversations. But to be accused within a few posts of being a killjoy (“Let people enjoy whatever they want, it’s not hurting anybody,” argued Kate), and a harbinger of the end of civilisation (“That article genuinely made me reconsider my humanity,” said SisterXyl), is bewildering. Online encourages iron dogmatism about frivolous topics, but why do people feel a need to strike a dramatic pose? Is being conciliatory online seen as boring?It’s poké, man: the ultimate hipster-food glossary Luckily, the conversation soon widened and got into some deep detail. Between the insults, food threads can be surprisingly educational and thought-provoking. This one took in why jackfruit and durian are not the same thing; dissections of different horchata; issues of cultural appropriation around global foods; and the glories of Georgian cuisine. Which led to this magnificent exchange:   euromec23 01 March 2017 10:57pmSorry, it has been a while since I was in Tbilisi.   ID3664341 01 March 2017 11:16pmSorry, it has been a while since I was in Tbilisi.This is the most glamorous sentence I've read all day. :)Meanwhile, the rest of the discussion was, but of course, a bunfight about my use of the word “hipster”. For me, it has become so diluted it is uncontentious. It can be used, as I intended, as a tongue-in-cheek summation of our collective thirst for new things, on a spectrum from dysfunctional, trend-setting obsessiveness to a healthy, worldly curiosity. Other people, however, clearly see “hipsters” (whoever they may be) as a significant, serious social malaise. Really? Even at its most excessive, is hipsterdom anything other than an attempt to live outside mainstream culture? Confused as that may be, it is surely admirable? But then I would say that, sat here with my turbo G&T and khachapuri. Which just leaves space for a few amusing comments which made which made me spray “dank” IPA all over my screen:   fanazipan 01 March 2017 9:46pmAll a hipster is, I want a shag, I'll get a beard.That's not a movement.And this exchange:    jimbojones100 01 March 2017 6:51pmI thought hipsters were a style of trouser?   Quackersyard 02 March 2017 8:48amThat's correct - hipsterism is passed on through the jeans.That such humour persists BTL, amid the rancour, restores my faith in humanity.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose10.06am GMT10:06WelcomeSarah MarshHello everyone, it’s Friday!
