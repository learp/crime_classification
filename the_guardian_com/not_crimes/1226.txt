The US has the bald eagle, India the peacock, Israel the hoopoe, Luxembourg the tiny goldcrest and Bermuda – somewhat predictably – the Bermuda petrel. Every country, it seems, has its national bird – there is even a whole book on the subject.Although the robin is often referred to as Britain’s national bird, that title is a purely unofficial one, deriving from a survey in the Times in the 1960s. But that is all set to change. From Monday until the day of the general election, Thursday 7 May, we all have the chance to vote for a new national bird.The poll is the brainchild of David Lindo – AKA the Urban Birder – who has long been puzzled as to why we (along with Canada) are one of the very few countries not to have an official national bird. Lindo, whose parents came to Britain in the late 1950s from Jamaica (their national bird, incidentally, is the red-billed streamertail hummingbird, known colloquially as the “doctor bird”), has always been passionate about engaging the public in the joys of birding. He is evangelical about urban wildlife, starting with his home city of London, in particular on his local patch at Wormwood Scrubs, embodied in his exhortation to city-dwellers all around the world to simply “look up” and see the birds.Lindo says: “With this year signifying the Queen’s entry into the record books as the world’s longest reigning monarch, it would be fitting to mark the occasion with the announcement of Britain’s first official national bird – especially if it’s the swan.”So which species is likely to top the poll? The top 10 – already whittled down from a longlist of 60 by more than 70,000 members of the public – includes all the usual suspects: wren, blue tit, blackbird and the hot favourite, the robin.  The charismatic puffin is also in the running.

This elegant raptor is currently the subject of a heated debate between conservationists and the owners of grouse moors and their gamekeepers, many of whom continue to flout the law by killing these majestic birds of prey.So can the hen harrier steal up on the outside and beat the robin? We’ll find out soon after the vote closes on 7 May – possibly sooner, in fact, than we’ll know the name of the next prime minister.• Vote for Britain’s national bird at votenationalbird.com and at selected nature reserves around the UK.
