The decision to move a valuable photography collection from Bradford’s National Media Museum to London was “the right professional thing to do”, the director of the museum has insisted during a grilling by a committee of the city’s councillors.Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new “international photography resource centre” at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding.The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of “cultural vandalism” from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people. The artist David Hockney, film director Mike Leigh and photographer Don McCullin were among more than 80 leading cultural figures calling for the reversal of the decision.What’s happening at the National Media Museum isn’t vandalism. It’s a fresh start | Mary Archer Quinton-Tulloch said the decision was not about London or Bradford, but was about making the collection more accessible to people generally. Budget restraints had encouraged the museum to refine its focus to the science of photography and film rather than art photography, she said, and the collection would therefore be better looked after at the V&A.The museum’s director, who was head of exhibitions at the science museum in London before moving to head up the Bradford museum in 2012, said that a focus on science would leave the institution better able to attract the funding it needed.The Royal Photographic Society (RPS) collection, dating from 1827 to 2016, has been based in the museum since 2003. Among the items moving to the V&A are works by the British photography pioneers William Henry Fox Talbot, who invented the negative/positive process for producing photographs, and Julia Margaret Cameron, known for her pre-Raphaelite-inspired portrait photography.“Some of [the National Media Museum’s] collections without a doubt support our new vision,” said Quinton-Tulloch. “But there’s a body of material, and the RPS collection falls absolutely in this, which is more art photography and that is not an area that we are going to curate anymore, and we don’t have the resource to make it actively available.” “We could leave it within the stores in Bradford, but that would not be the right professional thing to do as a national institution,” she said, adding that the museum had failed to communicate its plans effectively to MPs, the local council and the public at large.Confidential documents released to the Guardian showed that only Tate Modern in London and the V&A were given the opportunity to bid for Bradford’s RPS collection and members of the public attending the meeting on Tuesday complained that the decision had been made by a “southern elite” who made no effort to keep the collection in the north of England.What’s in a name? Just ask Bradford’s National Media Museum why the crowds dried up | Eamonn McCabe The Royal Photographic Society revealed earlier this month that it was not consulted about the decision to move its collection, saying in a statement that it would prefer that the collection remained in Bradford provided the museum remained a well-staffed centre for photography.Despite claims that the RPS photography collection would be more accessible to the public in London, a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian revealed that an exhibition of more than 200 photographs from the collection had 8,000 more visitors in Bradford than it did in London. According to information gathered by door counters, exit surveys and ticket sales, Drawn by Light was seen by 29,000 people when on display in the north for free, while 21,260 paid £8 for adults and £5 for children to see the show in the Science Museum in London.
