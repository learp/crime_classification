The sky is overcast and the air smells softly of smoke in the still, snow-muffled high reaches of Annandale above Moffat. From within a dark stand of conifers comes a chirping as soft as grasshoppers. The source is a band of coal tits, their subtle winter-coloured plumage a match for the surrounding environment.These birds are biologically distinct in part because of their adaptations to life in coniferous woodland, with a more slender beak than blue or great tits. Tiny tufts of snow sit precariously on the sprigs of the branches but somehow stay in place as the birds rummage within the needles for insect food, so delicate is their fidgety but precise work.In the otherwise motionless valley, these small spirits kindle the life of the land.The day before, on a plane returning from Kerala, I had looked down from the stratosphere as the frozen Kurdistan and Armenian highlands rolled underneath, a thousand miles of meringue-white mountains and stratovolcanoes passed over in a couple of hours. As the plane slowed on its approach to Edinburgh, the landscape of southern Scotland rose up, blanketed in snow and bell-clear in the sun, as gleaming and sterile as a laboratory compared with the torrid tropics I had left a hermetic few hours ago. Solid black conifer plantations were strewn over smooth white contours like offcuts of carpet, so different to the vast Eurasian conifer forests in which coal tits would have evolved.Remote, abandoned and hidden in plain sight Now, peering closely into the depths of a similar border country plantation was a comforting return to earth. I imagined Iâ€™d undergone a miraculous act of shrinking, exchanging a serenely omnipotent perspective for that of a tiny creature so I could scrutinise the earth up close.But while I had been enjoying a sojourn in the baking heat of a south Indian winter, these coal tits were roaming through dark, snow-dusted stands of spruce and pine, restless in the search for sustenance. We inhabit the same earth but live in different worlds. I can fly at liberty around mine but cannot hope to enter theirs. Looking at their lives is like peering down at a country where I cannot land.
