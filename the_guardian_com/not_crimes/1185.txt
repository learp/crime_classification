If the truth be told, I'd stopped to rest and regain my breath, not to admire the view. It had been a long plod up theÂ steep bridleway.When we turned to look back, the panorama that had opened up since we left the valley bottom was breathtaking. While our side of the valley was flooded with sunshine, the northern slopes were dissolving from view as clouds trailing long grey beards of hail swept across the high pastures. Behind us the fell summit still carried pockets of snow in shady hollows. Under our feet on the moorland edge there was just the merest hint of new grass growth, but the sounds of Pennine spring were all around: curlews' bubbling trills; mournful whistles of golden plover; squeaky cries of lapwings engaged in aerobatic courtship.Then, as we turned to resume the climb, a hare appeared from behind a hummock, just 20 metres away. It hadn't seen us and the wind had carried away our scent. It ambled forward then sat on its haunches. I raised my camera and clicked the shutter.Now it had seen us. Its yellow-eyed gaze met ours and its long ears swivelled to focus on the exact spot where we stood, not daring to move. I expected it to turn and race away. Instead it loped straight towards us, stopped to sniff the rush tussocks as if searching for the scent of other hares, then jumped on to the top of the wall and down on to the track where we stood. Ignoring us, it nibbled the grassy verge before leaping with effortless grace on to the far wall and dropping down into the next pasture. The encounter may have lasted 20 seconds. I realised that I had been holding my breath throughout, and at last dared to exhale. We looked at each other and laughed: a moment of pure joy. When we crossed the track and peered over the wall, the hare had vanished among the rushes.
