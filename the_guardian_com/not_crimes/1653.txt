The number of applications to build new shops fell by 9% in the past year, according to a report on Monday, marking the seventh decline in a row.There were 6,700 applications for new retail developments in 2015, down from 7,360, according to commercial law firm EMW. They are down by nearly a half from the pre-recession peak of 11,900 in 2008.The fall shows the continuing pressures on shopkeepers as consumers desert the high street in favour of online shopping with e-commerce companies. EMW said that despite traditional retailers increasingly focusing on and expanding their online services, many are often failing to compete effectively with online-only retailers, such as Asos and Boohoo.It said the recent failures of traditional retailers BHS, Austin Reed, and convenience store chain My Local were partly caused by the continued success of online-only brands.Retailers would face additional problems if the Brexit vote has an adverse effect on the UK economy, the firm added.Aimee Barrable at EMW said: “With online retailers continuing to win market share, high street firms have less of an appetite to open new shops, instead opting to develop online services or squeeze extra profits from existing space by changing the shopping experience or repurposing stores to act more as showrooms or collection points.“Recent high-profile closures will lead to more retail space becoming available on the market. Those retailers still looking to expand their high street presence might look to acquire some of these recently vacated stores instead of applying for any new retail developments.”She added: “Also, it may be that many retailers wait before committing to any new shop developments until they have a clearer picture of the economy in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.”Last week, official statistics showed the volume of retail sales decreased by 0.9% between May and June, worse than the 0.6% fall expected by economists. Although the declines were partly due to the inclement weather during the period, the figures included the first indications of the effect of the the run-up and immediate aftermath of the referendum vote.
