Once again the commuters came just as I was picking up my brush. A finger-numbing painting job had taken me outside at pinkish first light on three successive days, and each morning they arrived on cue, as if they had simply flown off the 07.39 from Peterborough and were hurrying to their final destination. I paused with brush in hand to watch and listen to the traffic.All of these starlings were southbound, pointy-winged and pointy-beaked, wave after wave, shooting past in fives and sixes.They may well have been part of a great murmuration more than 1,000 strong, which had taken this winter to dropping every evening into a marsh eight miles to the north.Much is made of the pre-dusk accumulations, the swirling flocks in the sky: nothing much is said about their dispersal at dawn from the roost. Perhaps these little parties had been reed buddies, hanging out together on neighbouring stems through the winter nights.Like rush-hour travellers on autopilot, they seemed to follow set routines. They used the crowns of trees as staging posts, but only landed in certain trees, the ones they had used before. They always shunned the limes and most often made for one of the roadside willows and the nearest sycamore tree.Half a dozen birds descended into the sycamore’s upper branches. The starlings chattered incessantly, giving parroty squawks and saucy whistles. It was an exotic-sounding babble, a reminder in the still, freezing air that these birds’ ancestors came from the tropics and that their high calls and chirrups originated in steamy rainforests.On the first day, the starlings sat beaks to the south. Today, they were up for a good gossip, fidgeting on their perches, turning towards the bird on the next perch, turning away again, raising a wing, lifting a leg, cocking an eye.But I felt there must have been proper communication too, as if one had said: “Due south at the count of 10.” For, in a split second, the chatter ceased and the birds rose as one and flew southward in a tight flock with some purpose.
