How much do you think the prime minister should get paid? Half a million a year? A hundred thousand? Perhaps they should do it for free? After all, what with the eventual book deal, the consultancy fees and the speaking engagements, the job is clearly a springboard to fabulous riches.The prime minister’s salary is currently £143,462 a year. That feels a bit on the low side, frankly. I shan’t be sending in my CV. Given the responsibilities, the pressure, the long working hours, the intrusion into your private life and the limits on your freedom, I would expect a bigger package than that.But what would the people’s verdict be on the idea that the PM needs a pay rise? Probably unprintable. It is unthinkable. Sorry, Theresa, but I wouldn’t go mad with the plastic just yet. Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins proved this week that it is not always necessary, or right, to switch sides The PM’s salary is, I submit, a terrible benchmark for anything. It has clearly been held down for a long time, mainly for PR reasons. So why is this £150,000-a-year threshold being used as a kind of taxpayers’ punishment beating on the BBC? It makes very little sense.We are in a mess about pay. A few people at the top of business, sport, media and entertainment collect vast sums. Millions of others are underpaid. Wages for most people in this country have been pretty flat for the best part of a decade. And of course £150,000 a year is a fantastic salary, putting you comfortably (in every sense) in the top 1% of earners.The instinct to demand greater transparency on pay is understandable, and in some places absolutely necessary. Reforms introduced by Vince Cable during the coalition government allowed us for the first time to get a clearer sense of what FTSE 100 CEOs were really being paid. Few people would argue that more secrecy on top pay is what we need.But of course transparency has to be used carefully. And there could be unintended consequences to opening up the books. Adrian Furnham, professor of psychology at University College London, has suggested that greater transparency can boost the “ratchet effect”, whereby ambitious executives compare their pay with others and demand more. “I had no idea. If that useless bastard is on £3m a year, I must be worth £4m.” Or words to that effect.The other confusion in this latest unwarranted assault on Auntie is between the public and private sectors, between public service and commercial competition. We really have to stop comparing public and private sector pay too closely, and be extra careful when public and private collide.Yes, university vice-chancellors, NHS trust chief executives and local authority leaders are doing big and important jobs, being responsible for multimillion-pound operations. But no, their jobs are not really comparable to those of for-profit business leaders.BBC presenters' salaries over £150,000 to be made public The for-profit sector exists to give us what we want; the public sector is there to give us the things we need. People are free to work in the private sector to earn what they can. But we should not be using private sector salaries, or the for-profit ethos, to influence decisions on what public sector leaders get paid. We don’t want people to go into the public sector “for the money”. We want them to do it as a public service. That is one reason why, even if the PM’s salary is too low – and it is – we shouldn’t raise it too much higher either.Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins proved this week that it is not always necessary, or right, to switch sides in expectation of a bigger payday. They showed loyalty to the BBC and the idea of public service broadcasting. This is another reason why it seems excessive, and unfair, to demand the disclosure of the salaries of all those employees earning over £150,000 a year. Many of them could earn more working for other media organisations. They stay, presumably, because they like the way the BBC goes about its work. It has an ethos that is worth preserving, and which is not for sale.We get motivation all wrong. Being badly paid is demotivating. But in the end, most people work well when they care about what they are doing. Good employers think about the whole deal they are offering their staff – not just the cash. Pay is still too low for too many, but so too is the quality of working life. And if you want people to do a good job, as another psychologist, Frederick Herzberg, observed, give them a good job to do.
