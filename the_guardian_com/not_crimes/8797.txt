The beard comes and goes, depending on the part I’m playing. If I am with beard, then I use a beard oil and I am particularly enamoured with Ricki Hall’s Booze & Baccy, by Captain Fawcett. It’s got an incredibly manly smell; apparently Ricki based it on the way his dad smelled after he got back from the pub on a Saturday night. I apply it relatively sparingly then comb it through. It keeps the beard soft so, should I find myself kissing anybody, they reap the benefit, too.If I am growing my moustache long and want a curly one, the only way I can get it right is to blow-dry it when I get out of the shower and apply moustache wax.For the hair on my head, I am a recent convert to the wonders of coconut oil. I worked with the actor Robert Sheehan on The Wars Of The Roses and he swore by it – he’s got hair like springs.By and large, if I am trying to look really snazzy then I just walk into Vivienne Westwood and say: “Please take all of the money that I’ve ever earned in my life and sell me things that make me feel jazzy.” There’s a tweed jacket with an inbuilt waistcoat that I bought from there about four years ago; I’ve worn it on pretty much every television appearance that I’ve made since. The waistcoat has a bit of stretch, so if you are a rounder gentleman, it’s very slimming.How I get ready: Dermot O’Leary I do worry about my weight but do almost nothing about it. When I’m at my most motivated I will run, but anything outside that seems more effort than it’s worth.• Rufus Hound appears in a new RSC production of Don Quixote at the Swan Theatre, Stratford, from 25 February; rsc.org.uk.
