A few days ago, a human being who many people have heard of was paddleboarding naked with someone he trusts. Someone else took a picture of him doing that, perhaps without his knowledge or his consent, and posted it online. Then, the many people who had heard of that human being shared that picture of him across social media, or quickly sought it out once they’d heard it was available to look at. Probably, everyone giggled a lot. I don’t know.The media then swiftly cleared column inches for penis-pixellated versions of this paddleboarding body; screaming “NAKED” (The Mirror and Daily Mail); detailing the “furious search” for the full shots (The Independent); and going over the “hilarious reactions” (the Sun). All during a time in history when all any of us need to do to see a picture of a genuine, real-life penis is grab a smartphone, go to Google, and tap in “P-E-N-I-S + Enter”.This is the hysteria over Orlando Bloom’s genitals. I wish I could say “hysteria over Orlando Bloom’s genitals” is a sequence of words I never thought I would write, but that wouldn’t be entirely truthful.What does it mean? There are so many possibilities. The revelation of a celebrity penis being gasped at by millions must mean something. This is a world post-The Fappening/Celebgate, of course; we should probably be jaded about a celebrity’s naked form by now, no matter how big their box-office gross. But then, 2015’s hacking and release of nude photos mostly involved female stars. In contrast, instances of male celebrity nudity are so significant because of their rarity; it just doesn’t happen that often. When it does, it is grasped at and openly treasured, like a glittering gem in a grey/blue/black sea of publicity-trail appropriate Gucci or Tom Ford suits. Every modern A/B-list penis sighting is treated as very, very precious The vague promise of seeing a female actor’s private parts is always hanging there in the realm of the possible; be it via paparazzi, a gross invasion of privacy or performance-wise. On film, it can be brave, beautiful, attention-grabbing. It can be nothing. But full-frontal male celebrity nudity is mostly unattainable (unless it’s “yes, penis is a possibility” Hollywood club members Harvey Keitel, Viggo Mortensen, Ewan McGregor, and new addition Michael Fassbender), because that’s a level of reveal not automatically expected of high-profile male actors. It’s marvelled at and appreciated when a male performer does it. Every modern A/B-list penis sighting is treated as very, very precious because of this.Relive the feeding frenzy around Ben Affleck’s showing in Gone Girl during interview rounds: “Was that really your penis? Why did you decide to show your penis? How did you feel about showing your penis; were you nervous about it at all?” Recall the online image-swapping when paparazzi caught Heath Ledger filming the cliff-jumping skinny-dip scene for Brokeback Mountain. The “where were you when … ” feeling at the time of the Colin Farrell sex tape leak. And it’s not just down to lechery – even, say, someone who opted out of dating the be-penised around 10 years ago looked at all of these things – you bet I looked. I even devoted intricate craft project time to some of it.These images have transactional value beyond lust – I’d wager most reacting with binocular-raising gifs and “that shadow tho” on Twitter weren’t going into #OrlandoBloom looking to drool. If female sexuality is a “dark continent” (thanks, Freud), and their physical body a blank canvas for meaning to be written upon (thanks, GCSE History of Art reading list), then the high-profile and high-powered male genital area is the darkest, blankest space of all. “What could be down there?” we wonder. A smooth Ken or Paul-like mound? A swirling black hole of nothingness? An absence?The knowing of the frequently unknowable, and the power of that, is what’s so special. It’s access, vulnerability, humanity. Maybe this reaction is simply gratitude, a joyful “you have something there, too?!” rather than a nasty “HA! We saw your Business, when you didn’t want us to see your Business.” I think so.So, thank you for your naked paddleboarding, Orlando. Thank you, Ben. And Harvey, and Ewan, and all those that came before you. Maybe you’re all just trying to live your life without people tweeting pictures of your penis. But you’re also striking a blow for equality, or something. Probably.
