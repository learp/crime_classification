I’m not sure why, but I’ve always wanted to do the Kingston Breakfast Run. I think it might be the presence of a meal in the title. So yesterday I finally managed to get around to ticking it off my bucket list. Having been ill most of last week, I decided to be sensible on the day and downgrade from the original 20 mile distance I’d planned, when I was still doing London Marathon, to the 8.2 (there’s also a 16.2 mile option). And what a great race it was too: everything you could ask for, including seamless organisation, sunshine, and a splendid goodie bag full - and I really do mean full - of edibles from Lidl. What a contrast from six days earlier, when I was wading through a storm a few miles away, on another stretch of the Thames. Whether you just fancy a spring race, or a pre-marathon test, I highly recommend this one - and want to send a special shout out to my Windmilers teammate and friend Julia who brilliantly won the 20 mile race. Meanwhile, over in Berlin, a certain BTL regular not only run a truly splendid Berlin half marathon, but I think even got the Strava course record (and who can dream of greater sporting glory that that, eh?) - I think there were a few regulars running there, so do report on it below please. And of course all other races, runs, highs and lows and twitchy marathon taperers - come and chat as alwaysThe Guardian running club on Strava
