I feel constrained to respond to Jonathan Jones’s suggestion that “Palmyra must never rise again” (11 April, theguardian.com). Passing over the flagrant ethnocentrism of this view – obviously no one would have seriously suggested that London should not have been rebuilt after the second world war because, to use Jones’s words, the blitz is “part of [London’s] history now” – the comment embodies a dangerous take on the concept of censorship. In free societies, there is broad agreement that no one – not even governments – should have the power to exclude or expunge material from the marketplace of ideas.Monuments, as embodiments of history, religion, art and science, are significant and complex repositories of cultural narratives. No one should consider for one second giving terrorists the power to delete such objects from our collective cultural record. When history is erased in this fashion, it must be promptly (and, of course, thoughtfully) restored. Such reconstructions, at least in the context of terrorist acts, vindicate an infinitely more important value than any misguided obsession with the romance of ruins.Roger MichelExecutive director, Institute for Digital Archaeology, Oxford• Jonathan Jones shows a very 18th-century Romantic view of history when he argues that Palmyra must not “rise again”. Ever since Wordsworth and Ruskin championed a new aesthetic, the UK has been “freezing” its historical monuments as picturesque ruins rather than living entities. But there are countervailing philosophies, for example in Japan. These put less emphasis on the original components – the very stones shaped by ancient builders – and more on the overall design that these builders were following. The Unesco world heritage convention recognises the cultural and historical importance of places like Angkor Wat and the bridge over the river in Mostar, Herzegovina, which have been extensively restored or rebuilt after catastrophic damage. New materials have indeed been used, lovingly, by skilled craftspeople. The mass of fallen buildings in the historical sites in the Kathmandu Valley will eventually be restored, as they have been several times before. Clearly such restoration needs to be done exceptionally sensitively. But the idea that we should simply stand by and see our heritage crumble seems overly defeatist.Nigel DudleyBristol• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
