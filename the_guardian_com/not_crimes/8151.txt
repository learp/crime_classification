Spain must act urgently to stop illegal water extraction from a protected national park or risk the wildlife-rich wetlands being placed on a list of world heritage sites in danger, a UN agency has warned.Doñana national park in Andalusia is threatened by huge demand for water, fuelled by a strawberry industry which supplies British supermarkets.Some producers in the area are accused of using illegal boreholes to draw water from underground aquifers, which the fragile ecosystem is dependent on to support a wide range of species.The Spanish government must introduce measures to regulate water usage in an effort to prevent further damage to the park, Unesco delegates said at a recent World Heritage Committee meeting held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The Spanish authorities have been asked to submit an updated report on the state of conservation in the park by 1 February 2014.  An Iberian lynx in Villafranca de Cordoba, southern Spain.

But regional government officials admit that while a so-called 'participatory process' is underway, an official plan is yet to be approved.The delay is blamed in part on a change in responsibility for the control of ground water around Doñana, which was handed over from Andalusia's regional government to Madrid.Other threats to the park discussed by the Unesco committee included the proposed dredging of the nearby Guadalquivir estuary and the potential impacts from fossil fuel projects in the vicinity of the park.
