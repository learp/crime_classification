Undercover9pm, BBC1As new head of public prosecutions, Maya tells her staff at the Crown Prosecution Service that they’re going after whoever was responsible for the death of Michael Antwi in 1996. Handily, a witness comes forward who could break the case wide open but Maya is distracted by events in the US, as a new date is set for the execution of Rudy. The appearance of the witness leaves Nick facing an impossible decision: to either expose himself or protect his family. Ben ArnoldJim Carter: Lonnie Donegan And Me10.20pm, ITVActor Jim Carter presents a personal appreciation of the skiffle pioneer. Unknown to many today save for his novelty hits, Donegan was a feral strummer whose unhinged trio repurposed US folk-blues numbers into thrilling high-speed chases. Yes, that does make him sound like Jack White, and White is one of the heavyweight interviewees, along with Sir Paul and Ringo, who both remember how Donegan enlivened the 1950s. John RobinsonThe Durrells8pm, ITV With the more likely candidates for a male role model otherwise engaged with wanderlust, romanticism and writer’s block, Gerry needs to cast his net a little wider to find a guiding hand as this adaptation continues. So far he doesn’t appear to have been doing a great job, choosing to fraternise with Kosti, a convict on weekend release. The pair’s fast friendship seems likely to flounder when Louisa discovers the truth behind Kosti’s incarceration. Mark Gibbings-JonesHorizon: Should We Close Our Zoos?9pm, BBC2Liz Bonnin’s film ponders the titular question: the drawbacks of zoos as environments for animals versus their benefits as centres of research and education. A subsidiary problem is the swiftness with which all discussion becomes overwhelmingly emotional; Bonnin visits Copenhagen Zoo, whose transparency earned it an online monstering. This film, however, is exemplary in its calmness and coherence. Andrew MuellerIndian Summers9pm, Channel 4The times they are a changing. Or, to put that another way, as Shimla’s expats gather to mark “King-Emperor” George’s jubilee, the indigenous great and good are reluctant to join the celebrations. Wisely, as it happens, because nationalist Naresh Banerjee has hatched a plan. The period drama continues with an episode that also explores the friendship – if that’s the correct word – between two men who, in their different ways, are frauds: Ralph and Aafrin. Jonathan WrightEurope’s Great Wilderness6pm, Nat Geo Wild From the craggy Cairngorms to the tundra of Svalbard, there are certain parts of Europe that are inhospitably cold. This episode of Nat Geo Wild’s far-flung nature documentary strand spotlights animals that have adapted to survive in sub-zero conditions, from the golden eagle of Scotland to the “blizzard-proof” musk ox of Norway. Particularly impressive are the randy mountain goats of the Alps, butting heads to coax the lady goats into some ibex and chill. Graeme Virtue11.22.639pm, FOXThe JFK pretext is on the back-burner for most of this week’s episode of the time travel drama. Jake (James Franco) is preoccupied with doing a Lee Harvey Oswald on the brutish Frank Dunning, but he’s about to discover how hard history resists any attempt to alter its course. This pacing can feel sluggish and the series hasn’t yet balanced its central themes with its weekly storylines. But it’s still very likable thanks to Franco’s strong central performance.
