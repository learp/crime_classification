One of the easiest ways of measuring your personality is simply to ask which kinds of TV, films, and books and magazines do you enjoy. Do you prefer:a) Daytime talk shows, romance, cooking and religionb) Arts and humanities, classics, foreign films and poetryc) Horror, cult films and erotic novelsd) Action and adventure, thrillers, sci-fi films and spy storiese) News, documentaries and nonfictionYour answer reveals which of the five personality types you are. If you tended to prefer a) you are communal; b) aesthetic; c) dark; d) thrilling; or e) cerebralA recent study of more than 3,000 people, conducted by psychologists at the University of Texas, found numerous correlations between these preferences and measures of personality and education.Communal types tend to have received less education and are poor at abstract reasoning, but are tender, warm and understanding. Fans of “aesthetic” and “dark” entertainment are both well-educated and good at abstract reasoning. But while the former are calm and introspective, the latter are provocative, outgoing and incautious.Cerebral types tend to be well organised, enterprising and selfassured (to the point that they dislike co-operation). But “thrilling” types of personality are a law unto themselves, showing no consistent characteristics (other than being male) – an inconsistency that is perhaps thrilling in its own right.A fully referenced version of this article is available at benambridge.com.
