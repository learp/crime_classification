And thank you so much for following Orange, keeping up with The Maids - come see us at Trafalgar Studios! And for your support. I really do appreciate it, it's never missed. I love the Facebook posts, and the Instagram comments, and the posts on Twitter. This was fun!

Guardian contributor UzoAduba 07 March 2016 2:03pmI do write, and would very much like to direct. I write plays, screenplays, short stories. I find an absence in the writing form of my stories: first generation stories, not necessarily the immigrant story, but the people who are once-removed from that. The stories of the people from whom I come, they have had so many stories it sounds unbelievable.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.05pm GMT14:05Minttu Lehtometsä asks:What do you love most about Suzanne? And who is your favourite OITNB character if you can’t pick Suzanne?  Guardian contributor UzoAduba 07 March 2016 2:02pmI don't have another favourite - I love them all. What I love about one is different from another. What I love about Gloria is different from what I love about Flora, or V, or Alex.  Guardian contributor UzoAduba 07 March 2016 2:06pmI love her honesty. She's entirely herself. And how in love she is with love, despite the fact she's never won at it.Updatedat 2.09pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.05pm GMT14:05NickyMesham asks:What separates OITNB from other projects you have worked on?  Guardian contributor UzoAduba 07 March 2016 2:01pmIt's the only project I've ever been a part of a company of actors where there are so many different representatives from a different representative group, all on one show. And it work seamlessly, and not seem like that was its purpose. Its purpose was just to tell a good story.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.04pm GMT14:04Trailermouse asks:Is “I threw my pie for you” one of the 21st-century’s greatest lines ever?

Guardian contributor UzoAduba 07 March 2016 1:59pmI just read Redefining Rumours by Janet Mock, I encourage everyone to read it. The heart and the spirit running through that book was unmatched. I'm reading three books right now: Twelve Tribes of Hattie by Ayana Mathis, Oprah's What I Know For Sure, and The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot.

Do you think such roles help combat the racial oppression depicted in these dramas? Do you think America is healthier than Britain in this respect?  Guardian contributor UzoAduba 07 March 2016 1:56pmThe comparison I can make most between Suzanne and Solange is that they're both very passionate people. And they live their life passionately. That's the primary comparison. And when they're reached their height of passion, there really is no stopping them. As two people who are physically trapped - but Suzanne seems much more free than Solange does, even though she's in prison. She's not as broken as Solange. I don't see them as being much alike at all beyond that - they have such different life experiences.Their very presence, that someone as brilliant as Jenji has opted to write a character like Suzanne, is exciting, as well as Sophia, Taystee, Dayanara all alongside a Piper, that changes the way characters can be portrayed. Through a racial lens, or the way women are portrayed, period. And in the Maids, no adjustments have been made for me, Zawe and Laura, it's just how they are on the page. It's exciting how Jamie Lloyd's company has opened the story up to tell it through our lenses.I don't know enough about Britain's health versus the US, but I know we're all better served when we tell more inclusive and honest stories.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.54pm GMT13:54'The best advice I've received is from my mother. She said, I've never heard of nothing coming from hard work'ID2342467 asks:Many of the top-rated TV shows on mainstream channels in the US (How to Get Away With Murder, Scandal) feature black female leads. Do you find there are more “ethnically neutral” female roles now than there have been before? And what did you take from your Nigerian parents that helped your career?  Guardian contributor UzoAduba 07 March 2016 1:49pmFirst question: I definitely think there are more. If we look at the landscape even four years ago, it was different sort to how it is today, particularly when it comes to leads. But because of Jenji, Shonda Rhimes, Lena Dunham even and how she created an atmosphere for the new female love interest, there are more. There can stand to be even more, but there are more.The best piece of advice came from my mother, hands down. And it relates to my work. She dropped me off to come to New York to pursue this dream. She turned off the car, and said: Uzo, just work hard. I don't need you to do anything other than work hard. And then she said: I've never heard of nothing coming from hard work. I don't know what will come, but something will come if you work hard. She had said that to us our entire life, but for some reason on that particular day, I really heard her. And that has been the greatest piece of advice I've ever been given in my life, hands down.It's funny, because I can also remember a conversation with my mum when I wanted to go into the arts. For one day, I wanted to be a director. I came to her, during high school, and said I want to be a director. She was like, OK. The next day I was like, no, that's not what I want to do. But I wanted to go do music. She said no. I said it again the next day. No. I came back the third day, she was like: OK. Why are you ok with it now? She said: I wanted to make sure you were serious. She seemed fine with it, and was very supportive of it, on my best days and worst days. She has believed in me - belief is a very important tool to carry with you in this bag of life. Someone needs to be carrying it, as you're walking, even if it isn't you.Updatedat 1.56pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.51pm GMT13:51'Suzanne on OITNB is not crazy to me – she's not far gone'Discursivereading asks:What helps you get in to character on OITNB? How challenging is it to play someone like Suzanne, who is mentally unstable?  Guardian contributor UzoAduba 07 March 2016 1:44pmI love music. Music really helps me to get into character, it helps me tune out some of the things that have no relevance to what's going on. Jazz, Jay, B, musical theatre, NWA, Ri, Common, Mary, Queen, Roots, Sade, Stevie Wondier is my all time favourite - anything. I love classical music. Something that drowns out the noise. It centres me, it calms me. For Suzanne, and I might start doing it with Solange in The Maids, I walk a lot. It's a part I have to walk into. For Solange, I do a lot of stretching, warming up my body because it's a super physical show, warming up my voice - hence the tea I'm drinking now. As for mental stability of Suzanne, I don't play at that, it becomes a commentary on someone's state. She's not crazy to me - she has a point. I'm always in defence of her! She has a clear point - I don't know why you don't get it... She's not far gone. She can be very clear, people do understand exactly what's she saying and where she's coming from.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.48pm GMT13:48FSMB asks:By using so-called “authentic” mannerisms and cultural markers, such as the “ghetto black woman” or the “Asian tiger mom”, are film directors exploiting stereotypes in a way which fetishises anyone from a different culture?How should directors approach roles for black and ethnic minority actors? By utilising “stereotypical” norms, some of which can be seen as an authentic way of portraying a character, or by ignoring them? In the first case, they tend to be called out for being racist and predictable and in the second they may be seen as trying to “whiten” different cultures.I particularly enjoy OITNB’s uses of women of different colour from all walks of life. How do you see this method being applied to mainstream Hollywood films?  Guardian contributor UzoAduba 07 March 2016 1:39pmI think it's less interesting to necessarily try to write towards one towards one specific thing. What's interesting is if a writer writes an honest story. We're all just people. The Maids was written in 1940s France, and our characters are American southern-born and have been able to infuse into that play what our experience might be. But it starts with an honest story, and the actor needs to find who the person is. If you tell a story filled with humanity, the actors alongside their director will find the realism in that person.There's nothing worse when you're reading something and you can hear the writer say to themselves: this would be a really good idea. You can hear the cool factor in their head. There's nothing worse. And you can hear it in the writing. It was an idea that sounded cooler in your head than has been executed.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.44pm GMT13:44Numberwanpurened asks:Is Africa a country?

Guardian contributor UzoAduba 07 March 2016 1:35pmI wouldn't say either is more or less challenging - they have their own challenges. First of all, they both require me to defend who they are, which is true for any role I play, and that is always challenging. Suzanne's challenge for me is trying to make clear to others her point - because she does have one. And to fight for it. That she deserves to be loved, that she deserves respect, that her action, though misunderstood at points, are justified. And that she's not a dangerous threat from her line of sight. In the case of Solange in the Maids, she's challenging from an endurance required. The physical needs of the person, talking for somewhere around 90 minutes straight is challenging vocally, keeping that energy up. And again, it's standing in defence of what someone on the outside might see as indefensible. But knowing that she has her reasons: she's not saying that she's right, but she does believe it's necessary.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.38pm GMT13:38'Every scene is emotional.

I can’t see this happening to a white interviewee. Do you welcome the opportunity to discuss racial issues, or find such a plethora of questions a hindrance to discussing your life and work, your loves and hates? It might seem like a dig to fellow contributors but not meant to be. Genuine question!  Guardian contributor UzoAduba 07 March 2016 1:29pmI have no problem discussing race, or anything around that subject. It's through discussion and conversation that we're able to reach the heart of the matter, and hopefully through honest conversation we're able to find some real solutions and truths.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
