Georgie knows that her marriage is in trouble, and it has been for a very long time. In between late nights and working all day, Georgie barely gets any time to spend at home with her husband Neal and her two little girls (Alice and Noomi), and when she tells Neal that she can’t make it to his parents for Christmas because of a work deadline, he takes off with the girls.But when she gets the chance to fix her marriage, will she take the chance or will she change her entire future?Refreshingly honest and interesting, this book does not only focus on teenagers but adults too. It is a much more realistic piece of fiction than books in a similar genre – it shows what marriage and your relationships with people can actually be like. It helps to separate from the classic idea that all YA fiction (simply because it is aimed at young adults) must be about young people (specifically young love). Because this book is YA but about adults (though in part they are younger), it helps to show the people who are reading that YA fiction is much broader than it is said to be, and in part helps broaden their minds as is shows them that other kinds of books are also interesting, and will help them venture into different territories when it comes to genre.If I had to fault anything, it would be that one person would, all of a sudden, be able to fix a relationship that had been struggling for so long so easily. It seems a bit far-fetched that after all of the hardship the relationship went through, it would all be fine in the end.I give the book a 3.5 out of 5 because though there is an obvious mistake in the storyline, it was interesting and enjoyable to read.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
