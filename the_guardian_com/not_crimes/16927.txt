Bullet in the Bible, Milton Keynes Bowl (biggest gig), Dookie in full and the promise to move here if Trump won the election are all instances of your love for this little rock. What’s the deal with that?  Guardian contributor GreenDayWebchat 11 November 2016 6:04pmB: I love the festivals in the UK. The sing-alongs are so much louder than America.

Given the numerous examples of her corruption and cronyism in the leaked emails from the DNC and John Podesta, her support for US military intervention in foreign conflicts, her being funded by huge corporations, global bankers and her chop-and-change view on gay marriage. She seems like the anti-candidate for Green Day, and I can’t see why you didn’t support a third party or independent candidate that would at least try to do good by the American people.  Guardian contributor GreenDayWebchat 11 November 2016 5:59pmB: I voted for Bernie first. Hillary Clinton is not the president of the US, she has to own that. The bigger problem is Trump, and how you deal with fascism. Emails are obsolete. I've had a fascist president for three days - I don't know how to deal with it yet.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.03pm GMT18:03mitch3996 asks:Are there any specific achievements you still hope to reach as a band?

Do you think that the next album you make will also be self-produced?  Guardian contributor GreenDayWebchat 11 November 2016 5:55pmB: Our intention was to play music for the rest of our lives.

Period'ArketyHodge asks:I recently watched a documentary about Pansy Division and was really impressed by your support and promotion of a queercore band on that 1994 tour. Twenty two years on, do you think homophobia is still an issue in punk/rock or the music world in general? How do you think LGBT rights [in the US] will fare under the Trump administration?  Guardian contributor GreenDayWebchat 11 November 2016 5:51pmBillie: We accept anyone who feels marginalised at any Green Day event. Period. Especially if you're gay or trans, black, white, brown, or of any nationality. Period. Green Day is a safe place for you to be. I think it's a problem that we have to face every day, and we have to do whatever we can to fix it.Updatedat 6.04pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.59pm GMT17:59DarrenAnthonyClark asks:Hello, chaps.
