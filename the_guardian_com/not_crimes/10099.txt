The departure of Ed Balls from Strictly Come Dancing after weeks of defying rock-bottom scores from the show’s judges attracted one of the programme’s biggest audiences of the year.The results show on Sunday saw 10.6 million tune in to see Balls’s ultimately unsuccessful dance-off against Judge Rinder, with a peak audience of 11.4 million. The former shadow chancellor tweeted after the show:The Strictly judges placed Balls at the bottom of the leaderboard for all but one episode of the BBC1 show’s 14th series, but each week phone-in votes from the public saved him from the dance-off. His outrageous performances helped propel Strictly to huge audiences, with last Saturday’s Blackpool special attracting a peak audience of 11.9 million and the previous week’s episode, featuring Ball’s take on internet sensation Gangnam Style, the biggest average audience at 10.8 million.
