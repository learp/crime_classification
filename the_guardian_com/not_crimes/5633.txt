Sri Lanka is where I would want to be, says Jasmine (represented by the left pic). I spent two weeks out there with Nick, my boyfriend, and it’s been on top of our list of places to go back to. Breathing in the fresh mountain air, surfing in Weligama bay, eating king coconuts and fragrant curries … we loved it all.It would be just off-season, not too hot, not too crowded. I’d want a light breeze, a makeshift bed on the sand (I love snoozing outdoors), and a cocktail.The meal would be a smorgasboard of Sri Lankan flavours. Sini sambol (chopped onions, tomatoes and chillies with caramelised aubergine), ambul thiyal (tuna marinated in a sour fruit called gorek, with lots of pepper, then slow-cooked to perfection in a clay pot), red millet rotis, creamy yellow dahl and gotukola sambol.Swap carbs for veg in your favourite pasta dishes | Cook residency I’d probably also want oysters. They would be followed by a ribeye steak, medium rare, but with perfectly rendered fat on the side, all washed down with a glass of red wine. And I’d finish off the meal with a scoop of green tea ice-cream.As well as Nick, I’d want my dog, Julie, and my mum with me. I love to share a good meal with them and I always feel sad if I eat something amazing and my mum’s not there to taste it!I would hire a cute little open-roof car, says Melissa (right), with my boyfriend Henry, then meander down the Amalfi coast. I’ve never been, but would absolutely love to: to my mind it’s the ultimate road trip, especially as I don’t drive, so I could have wine with lunch …It’d be early September, a balmy evening after a long day in the sunshine. I’d love to visit Marisa Cuomo’s Gran Furor Divina Costiera winery, pick some local lemons, have peaches and apricots on the beach and cocktails at sunset. I’d obviously speak fluent Italian in my dream world too ...Dinner would involve generous antipasti with lots of anchovies, fior di latte Agerolese cheese, juicy tomatoes, seafood and steak (rare). Then more cheese. A scoop of chocolate gelato for dessert and lots of local wine.It’d just be Henry and I, with a gentle bit of opera or the soundtrack from Malèna – one of my favourite films. Monica Bellucci is a goddess!Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley are food bloggers and writers and authors of The Art of Eating Well and Good and Simple both out now. @hemsleyhemsley
