No matter what happens, Warren Ellis is never without his sense of humour. “You remember that bit in the last series of The Thick of It, when Malcolm Tucker orchestrates a political coup and says: ‘Thank God, I’ve been so fucking bored for the last three years?’” he says. “I have to consider the possibility that I’m just a horrible sociopath, because I’ve been so fucking bored for the last few years and now everything is insane and I’m loving it.”Despite a dauntingly long list of more recent projects – his New York Times-bestselling novel Gun Machine, writing several TV shows including Netflix’s upcoming Castlevania, and the Hollywood adaptations of his comics Iron Man: Extremis (which became the film Iron Man 3) and Red (which became the eponymous comedy starring Helen Mirren) among them – it is one of Ellis’s older works that has rocketed back into relevance. His comic Transmetropolitan, which ran from 1997 to 2002, follows journalist Spider Jerusalem, who wages war with a crooked US president, Gary “The Smile” Callahan. Equal parts sci-fi and sociopolitical commentary, Transmetropolitan is known as one of Ellis’s funniest titles – and, starting with Jerusalem’s literal descent from a mountain to try to talk revolution into an apathetic population, it is freshly topical.Not that Ellis is worried about a Transmetropolitan-esque future. “Do bear in mind that I’m fast closing on 50 and I come from poisoned East End stock wherein the men in my family don’t survive past 60,” he says, “so you should understand that I won’t live to see the awful nightmare world to come.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Spider Jerusalem from Transmetropolitan. Photograph: DC EntertainmentEssex-born Ellis’s sense of comedy not only shapes his worldview, but is a trademark of his writing. He calls himself a “constantly disappointed optimist”. He has retained a sense of wonder at the universe, good and bad; even his darkest work contains glimmers of hope – which one can easily miss. When I suggest that one of his short stories, Dead Pig Collector, is a little on the grim side, he disagrees: “It’s a love story. It’s about the most effective way to dispose of a dead body, yes. But it’s still a romance.”Ellis is not shy about his influences: he loves detective stories, particularly Sherlock Holmes, and he likes Nietzsche. “I’ll steal from anywhere,” Ellis says, and it’s true; his work is rife with pop culture references ranging from other 19th-century classics to 20th century film – but Nietzsche lingers in them all. His most recent novel, Normal, even has futurists recovering in a mental-health facility from “abyss gaze”. “Nietzsche was very good at these resonant concepts,” he says. “It’s what makes his aphorisms so sharp and poetic.”Transmetropolitan and his much-loved comic Planetary, which he created between 1999 and 2009 with John Cassaday, are thoughtful explorations of politics and genre. But they are significantly different to his more recent comics, such as Injection, a series created with Declan Shalvey and Jordie Bellaire about five eccentric geniuses trying to contain a virus they have unleashed; and Trees, a series that he created with Jason Howard. “More mature” might sound damning to some, but in Ellis’s case, it feels right: Injection and Trees are obviously written by a much more experienced man who’s willing to have you along on the journey – but who also doesn’t much care if you enjoy it. These days, Ellis’s work unfurls at its own pace: what a younger writer might force into one chapter, he’ll build over several. He doesn’t just want you to scoff this down like a regular, punch-filled comic – he wants you to chew.He’s not surprised that this way of writing works. “Traditional storytelling structures aren’t especially necessary in comics – it’s what’s kept people with genuinely avant garde leanings working in commercial comics for so long,” he says. “Even in what we call the ‘mainstream’ end of the field, where the superheroes live, the medium remains remarkably plastic.”The current, stratospheric popularity of superheroes has been attributed by some to a hunger for real-life heroes. Ellis, to say the least, doesn’t have much interest in superheroes, despite having written Iron Man, X-Men and Fantastic Four. Instead, he finds detective stories reassuring: “They are the promise that everything is going to make sense in the end,” he says, “which I find an oddly powerful thing.”These days, now a veteran in the industry, Ellis can write what he wants. “Once you’ve conned a publisher or two into paying for your crap, you have an avenue to tell all the stories you’ve been waiting to tell,” he says. “And, if you’re very lucky, you get to tell most of them. It’s like emptying a bottle, sometimes, and you find yourself looking around and deciding what to do or say next.• Injection and Trees are published by Image Comics.
