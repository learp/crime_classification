I spent much of my childhood on one farm or another. There was the daily walk after school to get a box of eggs, or to pick up bacon for breakfast or a pot of jam for tea. There were summer afternoons spent picking runner beans or peas (On cold winter days I would be given a knife and told to go into the fields and cut my own cabbage or stem of Brussels sprouts). And then there were scary ventures into dim farm sheds and dark fumbles into deep hessian sacks for potatoes to cook around the Sunday roast.Root vegetables and cauliflowers were picked up daily from farm gates and paid for by dropping money into the accompanying honesty box, while summer holidays were spent picking blackcurrants on the local fruit farms, most of which went off for jamming or, rumour had it, to the Ribena factory.The hardness of the farming life was apparent even to that small boy. Did the farmer and his wife ever sleep? They never seemed to be out, or on holiday. Just always there, and always, always working. I remember coming home and asking my dad why farmers were always so grumpy and getting a lecture about early mornings, small profit margins and the impossibility of leaving farm animals to go on a fortnightâ€™s holiday.The great British pig farmer has other problems now. Not just with the supermarkets whose mission it is to sell food as cheaply as possible, but with foreign competition, international embargoes and the complexity of the bigger picture. In a special report Jay Rayner asks what the future holds for the British pig farmer.We also have recipes galore, from Shanghai breakfast dumplings to caramelised pine kernel ice cream, and insights from some of our favourite cooks on the meals that kickstarted their careers.
