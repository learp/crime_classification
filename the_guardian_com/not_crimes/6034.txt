A growing number of individuals and organisations are questioning an economy based on limitless growth. There are two broad reasons, they argue, why such an economy is doomed to fail: firstly it exploits the people and depletes the resources it relies on to survive; secondly it is accompanied by unacceptable – even unworkable – levels of inequality, financial instability and social unrest.From China’s stumbling stock markets to European austerity, global disruptions are leading to the emergence of new economic movements. The rise of anti-austerity parties such as Podemos in Spain and Syriza in Greece is just one example.While particular communities, political groups and businesses may have adopted economic models that prioritise people, the environment and greater social justice, a key issue is how these models might be scaled up.Our panel:Chair - Marc Gunther, editor at large, Guardian Sustainable Business USSaskia Sassen, Robert S.
