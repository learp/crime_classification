Years ago, I picked up a habit of writing down every book I read in a calendar year, as a way of motivating myself to read more widely. But the tally soon became a stick to beat myself with: “too few!” was the lament in my head at year end. I stopped, and instead I write down the books that turn me inside out and leave me in knots of either pleasure or pain. And then I evangelise about those books until people are sick of me. This week it’s The Underground Railroad, written by Colson Whitehead. It has invaded both my sleeping and waking thoughts.I remember hearing Whitehead’s name when I was at university (he was awarded the MacArthur “genius” grant back in 2002) and adding him to my mental “to read” pile. I caught up with that list in 2011, when I borrowed his 2009 novel, Sag Harbor, from the library. The story was one I can never read enough of but of which there are still too few: a humorous coming-of-age narrative with (middle-class) black protagonists. Whitehead switched genres with Zone One (2011), a zombie novel, and I gobbled that up, too.With his latest book, Whitehead explores the dark American chapter of slavery, writing a story that reverberates down generations with the clipped tones of unstinting factual rage. It makes for a hard read that he leavens only occasionally with flashes of grim humour. Each character feels alive with a singular humanity.Whitehead is on a roll: the reviews have been sublime, President Obama included the Underground Railroad on his summer reading list and Oprah selected it for her book club. He has a permanent spot on my list.
