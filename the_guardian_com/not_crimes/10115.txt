BBC Radio 1 faces investigation over swearing in Flume song Emeli Sandé was the last straw. When Britain’s least offensive singer returned this autumn with an “explicit” sticker slapped on comeback single Hurts, one thing was clear: profanity has finally conquered pop. If this bastion of primetime decorum has succumbed to singing a “shit”, no one’s immune. We’ve seen unlikely fallers in Ellie Goulding, Bastille and Beyoncé, who’ve all hit the nuclear F button in recent years, but Sandé is the tipping point, the harbinger of Swearageddon. As Don Henley sang in 1989, with impeccably clean language, this is the end of the innocence.The grumpy Eagle made a timely point. His paean to lost youth was all over the airwaves just as NWA were shocking moral arbiters with their no-holds-barred take on hip-hop’s default plain-speaking. Up to then, the history of the rude word in pop was little more than a pamphlet, a dowager gathering her skirts at an F-bomb on the Who’s Who Are You. As late as 1987, the mere mention of sex on George Michael’s I Want Your, er, Sex scandalised radio. Hip-hop’s real talk was a shot in the arm that reverberated through pop’s bloodstream.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Mike Posner’s I Took A Pill In Ibiza: the best of this week’s new music Flattened barriers meant people felt freer to get the swears out there. It led to gleefully eff-ective cursing on Super Furry Animals’ The Man Don’t Give A Fuck and later, CeeLo Green’s Fuck You and Azealia Banks’s 212, but – like NWA and Michael – these had context, or fury, or an artistic effect. For the most recent glut of pottymouthed pop, however, fruity language has become predictable shorthand for cred. Swearing is so ubiquitous now that a quarter of 2016’s top 40 singles are marked as explicit on iTunes (albums are even higher at 35%). These are big pop hits – DNCE’s Cake By The Ocean, Tinie Tempah’s Girls Like, Mike Posner’s I Took A Pill In Ibiza (that title alone requires some tricky explaining) – nothing niche.Pop is supposed to be universal, a gateway to so much more for kids. But modern chart hits such as these have become an obstacle course for any parent. My daughters love Chvrches but they think the middle eight of The Mother We Share is supposed to be a cavalcade of exaggerated coughing. Any time you play the 1975, you’ll be riding that volume knob like Adam Buxton censoring Fuck Tha Police.Why not download a clean version? After all, there are plenty. But albums don’t come clean; frustrating considering a third of former Nickelodeon star Ariana Grande’s Dangerous Woman is post-watershed. On Spotify, too, pop stars could risk missing their prospective audience if an expletive-veto button requested by some cuss-conscious users gets the go ahead.The solution? Cut it out, pop stars. While there’s no hope for Sandé, who’s just followed Hurts with another red E all over Garden, we can save the rest. Enough of this shiz.
