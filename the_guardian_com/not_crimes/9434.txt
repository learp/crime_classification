Fox said she was questioned over her visa, despite having travelled to America 116 times before without incident. She was eventually granted access to the country. After lodging a complaint over her treatment with the Australian embassy in Washington and the US embassy in Canberra, Fox received an emailed apology from US officials.Fox said she was shocked by her treatment and “couldn’t imagine” returning to the US.Fox has written more than 30 children’s books, including the hits Where is the Green Sheep? and Time for Bed. Possum Magic has sold more than three million copies and is the bestselling picture book in Australian history. This story was corrected on 27 February to clarify that Mem Fox was not questioned for two hours.
