A French minister has described the choice of a song in English as the official anthem for French supporters at Euro 2016 as “incomprehensible”.Andre Vallini, the secretary of state for Francophony, said the French Football Federation’s decision to choose a cover of I Was Made for Lovin’ You, performed by French group Skip the Use, was “very concerning”.The song, originally performed by American rock veterans Kiss, has been renamed I Was Made for Lovin’ You (My Team) for the tournament.

It is therefore incomprehensible that the anthem of the French national team should be in English,” Vallini said.Skip the Use’s lead singer, Mat Bastard, said the group was asked to record the song ahead of others by French singers Charles Trenet and Jean-Jacques Goldman “because it was the song which meant the most to us”.Vallini also bemoaned the fact that France’s entry in this year’s Eurovision song contest, J’ai Cherché by Amir, features a chorus largely in English.
