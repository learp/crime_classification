Wallace and Gromit fans will be treated to a grand day out in Melbourne next year as Aardman – the studio responsible for some of the world’s most successful animated films – brings a major collection of sets, props and design materials from their award-winning films to the Australian Centre for Moving Image.Wallace Gromit and Friends: The Magic of Aardman, which premiered in Paris last year at Art Ludique – Le Musée, will feature 350 original artworks and more than 50 set pieces from the studio responsible for Wallace and Gromit, Shaun the Sheep and Chicken Run. Sketchbooks, concept drawings and storyboards will be on show, as well as handmade puppets. The flying machine from Chicken Run will be on display, and a whole section of the exhibition is focused on Wallace’s inventions.

The pair came to public attention in 1989 with the premiere of the short film A Grand Day Out. Only 24 minutes long, it was followed up in 1993 and 1995 with The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave respectively, both of which won Oscars. Aardman has since released a number of feature films using this stop-motion technique, including Chicken Run in 2000, and Wallace and Gromit’s fourth outing, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, in 2005, for which they won an Academy Award and a Bafta.
