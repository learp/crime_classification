The Bluest Eye is not only a story but an awe-inspiring poem that confronts beauty itself and the consequences of beauty standards on individuals that do not meet them. Beauty is an obsession that has been present throughout history, which is why this novel, set in the 1940s, continues to awe readers today.The title is taken from the protagonist’s desire to have blue eyes. “Whiteness” is the beauty standard that Pecola Breedlove cannot fit in with, and from this her obsession with having blue eyes stems. Throughout the book, it is highlighted that there is no part of her that is ugly, she just doesn’t fit social standards. This keeps the reader wondering “what is ugly?” and whether a person can truly be ugly as there is no explanation. At the end, Pecola has forced herself into insanity just to believe she has blue eyes, and doesn’t even realise her own pregnancy. Her character is never developed.Part of the story is written in Geraldine’s point of view. She believes that she is somewhat more civilised than other black person, and chooses to call herself “colored” instead. She doesn’t allow her son to play with other “black” children. Geraldine is not her own character, but a type of black woman. This shows the reader the extent to which people would abandon who they are if it isn’t socially desirable.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? Toni Morrison really makes the reader question beauty, the pressure put on people to fit in with untrue ideas. This novel will not leave the reader without making them evaluate the dangers of social standards and changing the way you look at how society works.Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read?Join the site and send us your review!
