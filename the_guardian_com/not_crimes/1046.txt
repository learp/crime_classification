David Cameron has said he is very sorry for the suffering caused by the extreme weather afflicting large swaths of the country, as he promised to do "whatever it takes" to help those affected.The prime minister was speaking as communities across Britain braced themselves for a battering by heavy wind, rain, and even snow as Valentine's Day storms wreak havoc.Forecasters said the appalling conditions that have ravaged communities showed no signs of abating, with heavy rain expected on Friday and Saturday.The Met Office has warned that wind, rain and snow are expected to strike in a "multi-pronged attack" with up to 40mm (1.6in) of rain set to fall in just six hours while gusts of up to 80mph blast through parts of the country.Paul Davies, the Met Office's chief forecaster, told the BBC Today programme: "It's a terrible day today on the weather front." But he said some respite was likely next week, with bigger gaps between the weather systems hitting the UK. "We will see some rain coming through but not the same intensity.," he added.The Environment Agency (EA) has 17 severe flood warnings – which mean a risk to life – in place in the Thames valley, Somerset and Gloucestershire, as well as 131 flood warnings across England and Wales and 246 flood alerts.As well as surface water problems, the rain could alsoaffect already full-to-bursting rivers while coastal areas may be at risk from large waves.Visiting Blackpool in Lancashire to view relief efforts, Cameron told ITV1's Daybreak: "People need to be reassured that we will do whatever it takes to help people during this very difficult time."Asked whether he would repeat the apology by the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, for the government's early response to the crisis, Cameron said: "Of course I am very sorry for any way that people have suffered. What we have tried to do is stand up the emergency response arrangements as quickly as we could."Cameron said the government's Cobra emergency committee had met before Christmas to deal with the impact of the tidal surge on the east coast and soon after Christmas as the Somerset Levels were flooded."Obviously, we are facing a very difficult time because we have got the wettest start to the year for 250 years and these are extraordinary weather events, but we are fighting on every front to help people," he said."We have deployed the military. We have got thousands of sandbags being put around people's houses. Over 300,000 people had their electricity reconnected last night. If you look at the state of our flood defences, over 1.3m homes have been protected by the flood defences that are in place."We are making sure that today, before the next rise in the level of the Thames over the weekend, we do everything we can to protect more homes and protect more communities."Writing in the Guardian, Lord Stern, the author of a 2006 report on the economics of climate change, said the flooding and storm damage was a clear indication of the dangers of climate change and demonstrated the need for Britain and the rest of the world to continue to implement low-carbon policies to reduce the probability of greater tragedies in the future.He said delay was dangerous: "Inaction could be justified only if we could have great confidence that the risks posed by climate change are small. But that is not what 200 years of climate science is telling us. The risks are huge."
