The Scottish government has been criticised by the advertising watchdog for misleading the public over the cost of bringing two giant pandas from China to Edinburgh zoo.Tian Tian and Yuan Guang, who hit the headlines recently after failing to mate in the few days the female is fertile each year, arrived in Scotland in December to huge fanfare and some controversy.Edinburgh zoo built a £250,000 enclosure and pre-booked more than 10,000 tickets to see its new star attractions, with the pair expected to bring in £2m a year in revenue.However, animal rights campaigners criticised the Scottish government for what they claimed was a £43,000 "welcome party" for the pandas.A "lease" deal with China was brokered by the Scottish government, which secured the pandas for 10 years.In November and December last year the government ran a Scottish press ad, which said it was sponsored by Natural Scotland, "celebrating" the arrival of the pandas. The press ad said the pandas had been "gifted" to live in Scotland at Edinburgh zoo and the deal was part of a "strengthening" of an alliance with China.The Advertising Standards Authority received two complaints, from Animal Concern and Scotland for Animals, that the ad was misleading as the pandas had been leased to the charity that owned Edinburgh zoo at "substantial cost".In its response to the ASA the Scottish government said it was not paying a penny to China but admitted that there was in fact an "annual sum" that would be paid to the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Association.However, the government said this payment was not for the two pandas but instead a "contribution to global efforts to ensure the survival of one of the world's most endangered species".The ASA disagreed and said members of the public assume the word "gift" to mean "given without payment".Although the ASA accepted that the Scottish government did not pay directly, consumers would consider that the charity behind the Edinburgh zoo made a "commercial arrangement"."In the absence of text stating that the 'gift' was in exchange for a substantial payment, we considered that the claim 'in a symbolic gesture of friendship between the countries' in conjunction with the terms 'gift' and 'gifting', implied that the pandas were provided by China for free," said the ASA. "Because that was not the case, we concluded that the ad was misleading."The ASA banned the ad and told the Scottish government not to imply in future that the pandas were provided without payment.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
