Next week, Elbow’s Guy Garvey curates the 23rd Meltdown festival in London. Having extended invites to the likes of Robert Plant, Femi Kuti, Laura Marling, the Staves, Connan Mockasin and the Texan band Lift to Experience, who reformed especially for the event, the Southbank Centre plays host to nine days of entertainment across the arts, with each item carefully selected by the Manchester musician. Below, Garvey picks a selection of his favourite tracks from artists performing at his event, including the premiere of his new track, Open the Door – taken from his first recording sessions since the release of his debut solo album, Courting the Squall. Femi Kuti – Truth Don’t Die“I saw him play Glastonbury and it was literally the best gig I have ever seen; pure, unbridled energy. His wife, who is one of his dancers, is doing a dance workshop at Meltdown, and his son is in the brass section of his band as well. It’s a family affair.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Connan Mockasin – Faking Jazz Together“If you doubt this man’s artistry and originality, watch this beautiful eerie video for this beautiful, eerie song. I’m amazed we got him.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Lift to Experience – These Are the Days“I never thought I would see the best rock three-piece I have ever seen play together again. To have them reform for my Meltdown after 20 years apart is a total honour.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Laura Marling – Strange“Laura is an old friend and one of our best songwriters. She supported Elbow in 2008 on the back of her first album and I said then she would be around for a long time. She was my first call.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Jesca Hoop – Hospital“Of course Jesca’s going to be here. The busiest woman in music returns from her tour of the US specifically to play this show. As always, I’m honoured by her presence.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest
