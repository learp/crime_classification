Loughborough football alumni group has a photo that I love featuring not only Barry Hines, Bob Wilson and Dario Gradi but also Ted Powell (who helped shape the England U19 careers of the Nevilles, Butt, Scholes, Campbell etc), Keith Blunt (coached at Malmö), Alan Bradshaw (played at Crewe); the team was coached by Allen Wade and Charlie Hughes. Also, it was my father Dave Crane (pictured alongside Robbie Brightwell in another Loughborough photo), his roommate and fellow Yorkshireman, who gave him Animal Farm to read, and helped inspire Barry’s love of literature (Hines gave us a portrait of the forgotten game, 26 March).Tim CraneLead member, Loughborough football alumni group      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Loughborough Colleges 4 x 110 yards relay team, 1960.

When John Graham died and we no longer had Araucaria’s specials to look forward to, I thought bank holidays would inevitably be duller and greyer, but Maskarade’s latest is a real tour de force – totally engaging and absorbing.Hilary OwenNottingham• I assume that by popular demand the Met office will name the next storm Windy McWindface (Boaty McBoatface has tickled many of us – but does everything need a name?, 26 March).Marion SelfRomford, Essex• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
