Contrary to the subheading on your story (Rock climbing on course to secure Olympic foothold, 16 July), indoor bouldering is not an “adventure sport”; it’s a branch of gymnastics. Britain is somewhat unique in having stuck to a purist ethic of leader/second (or trad) climbing on our varied types of UK rock, where climbers are required to route-find and use the natural weaknesses of the rock to place running protection against falls. That is why this comparatively non-mountainous island has produced so many excellent international climbers over the years. Also, I seem to remember that Brendan Foster and cable TV tried to popularise indoor climbing some years ago, and it ran out of steam after some initial wonder. This might be because, as climbers say, you can’t appreciate watching someone else climb a route unless you’ve been nose to nose with it yourself.David RedshawGravesend, Kent• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
