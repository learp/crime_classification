The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with African Head Charge: Crocodile Hand Luggage   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Depends on the time, but this sounds great on on a system. I saw them once at Brixton Academy, amazing music.The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor Claudette & Ti Pierre: Zanmi Camarade    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It’s a swirling synth masterpiece by the Haitian duo. Not so well known but people seem to like dancing to it.The track that currently gets the most rewinds Minor Science: Glamour   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest No idea how to do rewinds, but I have played this a few times across a set. I love the rumbling bass, the clave pattern and strange voices that dissolve in and out of the hiss. Spooky and very danceable.The track I think has been unfairly slept on this year Untold: Doff    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I don’t really think about music in that way, but this made a big impression on me last year. It’s brilliant, in its own galaxy, I imagine it’s how bits of [Talking Heads’] Remain In Light could have sounded 35 years on.The track I wish i’d never played Cresa Watson: Dead   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest An amazing song, and people recognise the samples, but it’s just too maudlin.The best track by my favourite new artist Tessela: Bottom Out   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Tessela is a very established artist, but last year’s Bottom Out is very inventive. Stripped-down acid bassline with stark dub effects, I love this record.The track I’d play in Ibiza DJ Sprinkles & Mark Fell: Fresh   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’ve never been to Ibiza but I’d like to see how this would sound there.The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding Dinah Washington: I Could Write A Book   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’m a rubbish wedding DJ, but I think Dinah Washington’s version of this song is very romantic.The track that should have been a crossover hit Gwen Guthrie: Padlock (Larry Levan Mix)   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I guess Ain’t Nothin’ Goin’ On But The Rent was Gwen Guthrie’s true crossover hit but for me this is the one. I love every single moment of this record. The combination of talents that produced all that Compass Point stuff is incredible.The track I’d play at my funeral Garnet Mimms: As Long As I Have You   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Wouldn’t want anything downbeat, so it would have to be this; it’s soul at its most life-affirming.Beatrice Dillon plays Bloc, E3, Friday 29 January
