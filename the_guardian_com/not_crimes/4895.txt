There is a strange, unwritten rule among theatre directors. Don’t talk about your day job.As all actors know, holding down a day job isn’t easy when you might have to disappear for three or four weeks to rehearse a show. I was fired from a job for asking to have another three weeks off for the second time in six months. (They had also detected that my heart wasn’t really in property management software sales, but you get my point.) On the Honest Actor’s Podcast, Jonathan Harden interviews successful actors who reveal how precarious their careers are. Directors just don’t talk about this.Perhaps those privileged directors with no need for a day job have created a culture where it isn’t discussed. Perhaps we worry that to reveal to another director that you have to do another job to be able to live would suggest that you’re not successful enough. And professional jealousy is such that you must never allow another director to believe that you are not successful. You must always give the impression that you float around, with no visible means of support. Half of theatre directors in Britain earning less than £5,000 a year A director friend and I had an illicit chat about our day jobs, and she told me that her partner (also a director – it goes that way sometimes) one day had struggled to find the energy to go to his day job. He cited me: “I bet he doesn’t need to go to a day job.”I was shocked. I was working in a call centre at the time. The hours were flexible, it paid OK and I taught myself web design so I could leave it. Of course, I still called myself a director. I have been directing since 2004, and in that time my longest run of not having to get another job was nine months, when I had an assisting job on a long-running show. But though I tweeted about it whenever I got a show, I’d never tweet about my day job. So my friend’s partner thought I had no day job.What do you need in a day job? One that uses the skills and experience you’ve gained from your arts career? Flexibility? Just an understanding boss? At 22, picking up a McJob to pay the rent was relatively easy. Past 30, it’s hard to explain those gaps in your CV in an interview with the manager of sales, without looking as if you’re just incapable of holding on to a job for longer than six months. You don’t mention your theatre work. Understandably, when they realise you’ll be off the moment a theatre job comes along, they lose interest in you.  But, even when you get a break, you can’t quit the day job. Stage Directors UK did some research, and made some alarming discoveries. It found that a director working on four productions at major theatres (a very successful year) is unlikely to earn more than £25,000. The mean average annual wage for a stage director in 2013-14 was £10,759 a year, and the median was only £5,000 a year. A box-office manager can earn £29,500. Which isn’t to say box-office managers don’t work hard and deserve to be paid well, but when you’re a director, you know that you will probably earn less from theatre than most of the people permanently employed by the theatre. And, unless you have some other kind of support, you’re going to need another job to earn a living wage.How to help rising directors put down roots in regional theatre As well as four to five weeks’ full-time rehearsals and previews, directors will also be doing weeks and weeks of auditions, planning, research, plus meetings with designers and theatre staff. This prep time is usually not factored into fees, and is difficult to fit around day jobs. And, as a freelancer, there is no holiday or sick pay.I’ve got a child, who insists on continually growing out of clothes, so I know I will need to find other work around the shows I’m directing. And I’m not alone. A well-respected and successful director told me that most of their income actually comes from work outside theatre. Away from the more secure associate and artistic director jobs, most freelance theatre directors are semi-professional, but we just don’t talk about it. And we all feel like liars when people ask us what we do and we say, “I’m a theatre director” when we haven’t been inside a rehearsal room in six months, and it’s the audio typing or the telesales or the web design that’s paying the bills.  Things are starting to change, with some theatres now including extra fees for prep time and being flexible about rehearsals. Directors know there aren’t enough jobs to go round, and theatres aren’t sitting on piles of cash (quite the reverse). But until fees improve, most directors will be balancing day jobs and theatre careers. And when directors start asking themselves if they should really take that directing job and risk losing the job that pays the rent – that’s when theatre directing ends up being a job only for those who can afford to do it.Derek Bond is directing Stig of the Dump at Grosvenor Park Open Air Theatre, Chester.
