What’s the opposite of Fomo? We are indebted to Lily Allen for attending Evgeny Lebedev’s garden party on Sunday and tweeting photos for us NFIs.Among the eclectic gathering at the Stud House, Lebedev’s mansion in the parklands of Hampton Court, were Rupert Murdoch (“Voldemort”) and Nigel Farage (“Fromage”), pictured here in a slightly awkward East Molesey Bilderberg huddle.Allen’s wish not be seated next to them (“I might be sick”) was granted. She later videoed them “breaking bread” with Tory leadership hopeful and ex-defence minister Liam Fox at an adjacent table in the marquee.Murdoch is dressed in the anonymous style of a global billionaire. His host, at his shoulder like an attentive valet, has opted for the Made In Chelsea yacht look that says breakfast in St Tropez, afternoon drinks in London. Farage’s shoes are the scene-stealer, but what else is going on here?1. They could be Lanvin. They certainly look comfy and are the least troubling footwear in this shot.2. He’s taking back control. Or something. Perhaps he could take these back to Jeffery West if they’re the £295 Brilleaux Albion Oxfords. “Unfortunately, the footwear trade is full of plagiarism. Who knows whose they are?” said a spokesman.3. The striped blazer is classic Man from Del Monte/Mr Kipling at the Rotary Club summer drinks.4. Risky to wear a white jacket at a drinks do. People might think you’re staff. The normcore jeans and navy T give the off-duty signal.5. £485 Gucci Jordaan houndstooth loafers, with “romantic floral embroidery and gold thread-embroidered bee”. 6. Looks like a straw stuck in a lump of mango or pineapple, which would be cool. But disappointingly, even the super-rich use glasses.7. The 18th century Grade I-listed Stud House, restored over two years at a cost of millions. Contains artworks by Tracey Emin, the Chapman brothers and Antony Gormley. “I wanted it to be the most beautiful country house in London again,” said Lebedev.
