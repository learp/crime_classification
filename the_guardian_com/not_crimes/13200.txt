Ticket resale sites such as Viagogo and StubHub are facing a crackdown, after the prime minister said they cause problems for genuine fans and vowed to fix markets that do not work for consumers.Theresa May said the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) would shortly address secondary ticketing firms, which have been accused of flouting consumer laws and inflating ticket prices for fans.Her intervention at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday came in response to Conservative MP Nigel Adams, who asked what the government would do about controversial website Viagogo reselling tickets for a cancer charity gig by Ed Sheeran and charging theatregoers up to £5,000 to see the popular musical Hamilton.He said Viagogo’s actions, both revealed by the Guardian, were “unfair and not indicative of a market that works for everyone”, asking the prime minister to “ensure genuine fans are not fleeced by ticket touts and rogues”.May said: “He [Adams] is absolutely right to identify circumstances where websites are acting in that way and causing those problems for people who genuinely believe that they are able to buy tickets for what they wish to attend.”She added: “As a government we are looking at where markets are not working in the interests of consumers.”The government has yet to respond to a review by Prof Michael Waterson, who recommended that a public body such as National Trading Standards carry out an investigation into the ticket resale industry’s compliance with the law. The prime minister said the DCMS was now preparing a response to the Waterson review.FanFair Alliance, a music industry group which campaigns for reform of ticketing, said: “Prof Michael Waterson’s recommendations on secondary ticketing were published over nine months ago, so it is heartening to hear from the prime minister that a DCMS response is now imminent – as well as a resolve to fix markets that are not working in favour of consumers.“This is clearly the case with ticket resale, where audiences continue to be manipulated and fleeced on an industrial scale.” At least one MP has demanded an explanation from Viagogo’s founder, Eric Baker, over a separate incident in which dozens of fans were overcharged by hundreds of pounds because of what the company called a “glitch”.Antoinette Sandbach, Conservative MP for Eddisbury, said she had written to Baker and would share the reply with members of the Facebook Victim of Viagogo group set up to demand refunds from the Switzerland-based company.Viagogo has so far repaid almost £40,000 over the “glitch”, which affected tickets for multiple events in several countries, but members of the group say more than £25,000 is still outstanding.The prime minister’s interest in secondary ticketing firms comes after mounting pressure on companies such as Viagogo, GetMeIn, Seatwave and StubHub.Executives from Viagogo and Ticketmaster are expected to be summoned later this month to face questions from the culture, media and sport select committee as part of its inquiry into “ticket abuse” continues.
