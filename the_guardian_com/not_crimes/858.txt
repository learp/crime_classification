Apple chief executive Tim Cook plans to visit Beijing later this month to meet high-level government officials, at a time when the company is facing setbacks in its most important overseas market, a source said.Cook has frequently traveled to China since taking the helm of Apple five years ago, but his latest visit comes during a critical period. From weakening smartphone sales to the loss of an iPhone trademark dispute and the suspension of some of its online entertainment services, the US technology giant has been facing a flurry of problems in recent weeks in its second-largest market after the US. That has raised concerns over Apple’s growth momentum. Last week the company reported its first quarterly revenue drop in 13 years. On top of that, billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said in an interview with CNBC that he had sold his entire stake in Apple, citing China’s economic slowdown and worries about whether the government could make it very difficult for Apple to conduct business. During his China visit, Cook plans to meet senior government and Communist party leaders – including officials in charge of propaganda, said the source, who declined to be named as the plan is not yet public.Apple did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comments.Tim Cook: iPhones that will drive people to upgrade are on their way In recent weeks, the company has wandered into the crosshairs of the Chinese government’s ongoing campaign to control web content and ensure localisation of data storage. Apple’s online book and film services were shut in China in April, cutting off a potential source of income, following Beijing’s introduction of regulations in March imposing strict curbs on online publishing, particularly for foreign firms. Under the president, Xi Jinping, China is also trying to shift away from its dependence on foreign technology, especially in critical sectors such as banking and insurance. Foreign businesses have staunchly opposed new regulations that they claim threaten to cut them out of such industries. Harsh censorship has also shut down the online services of many foreign tech companies, prompting outcry from overseas governments and business groups. Beijing could “come in and make it very difficult for Apple to sell there”, Icahn told CNBC last week. Apple’s refusal to cooperate with the US authorities to provide source code to help them crack open the iPhone linked to a mass shooting in San Bernardino also made some Chinese officials sceptical. In China, Apple has been asked to hand over its source code but the company refused, according to Apple’s top lawyer. Despite growing concerns over its China business – Apple reported its revenue from Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped 26% last quarter – Cook argued that the country is a “lot more stable” than people think. “We remain really optimistic on China,” he added.
