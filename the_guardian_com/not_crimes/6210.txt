Love, romance and sex are wonderful, but they also bring with them an unappealing flip side: problems. Valentine’s Day, like other official commercially-driven days, pulls love or the lack of it into sharp focus. It can be a day when those love or sex-related issues surface from the depths of your subconscious. But do not fear.

Alix Fox, a sex educator and expert on matters of the heart, will be on hand to offer advice – no matter how unique the problem. You can fill in the form below – anonymously, if you prefer – or you can email podcasts@theguardian.com or tweet @thetokenpod. We’ll use a selection of responses in our podcast, and online.
