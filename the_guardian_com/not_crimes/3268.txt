It was the weekend that the West went a bit wild. The Wessex yeomanry was out with its muck spreaders and Dorset police with shields and helmets massed at midnight to close the county border.During the night and in the middle of nowhere, the police decided to dress for a riot and block one of their main highways.It would remain closed for more than 18 hours, the duration of a police exercise which failed to dispel the problem it had been designed to tackle.For miles around the farm irregulars were taking the law into their own hands and barricading every lane with the apparent blessing of authority.Remember the Battle of the Beanfield | Andy Worthington “I don’t imagine that even during the war when people were expecting a German invasion there were scenes quite like this,” said Mr Donald Wilkinson, a Dorset delegate for the council of the National Farmers’ Union.The police and the farming communities had mobilised to repel possibly 300 men, women and children travelling with their dogs and goats in a convoy of 95 ramshackle vehicles.Its members, already outcasts, had with their return to the road after eviction from a 13 1/2 acre meadow at Lyte’s Cary, near Somerton, Somerset, on Friday become part threatening invasion force, part crowd-pulling travelling show.They were not to be given another chance to occupy a farm field or other privately owned land. Farm gates and lane entrances were blocked along their entire route with tractors, Range-Rovers and machinery.Knots of local people, alerted by radio and by telephone, came out at every corner to watch with apprehension and curiosity.Their progress reached its most bizarre and potentially explosive point in the early hours of Saturday. As the tail of the mile-long convoy, often travelling two abreast, crossed into Dorset from Somerset, its vanguard was halted by police, astride the A37 main Yeovil to Dorchester road.About 300 police, many in riot gear and supported by ranks of vans and a lorry drawn across the road, refused to allow the convoy to advance. They were halted at Melbury Osmond, close to a junction known as the Travellers’ Rest.The two sides were to remain nose to nose for most of Saturday, the travellers questioning that the police action was lawful; the police maintaining that they were acting to prevent a confrontation or a breach of the peace.Mr Tony Pointer, assistant chief constable of Dorset, said that the sheer size of the convoy amounted to intimidation. “It is seen as being provocative by the local community, rightly or wrongly,” he said.Only if they agreed to move on in smaller groups would they be allowed to proceed. If not, they would be arrested for causing an obstruction.Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal MP for Yeovil, helped to thrash out a deal, with the travellers agreeing to move off in five groups at half hourly intervals and to reassemble on Saturday.The agreement ensures that the convoy would remain together – the very thing that the massive police action seemed originally designed to prevent.The convoy sections were received again by a countryside on the defensive in south Dorset. They reassembled and remained yesterday near Corfe Castle, where they were left in no doubt that they are people nobody wants.
