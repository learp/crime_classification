Christine Milne has called for a complete overhaul of the Greens' constitution to focus on winning more federal seats.Milne described the Greens' constitution as outdated at the party’s national council and said it should be changed to harness non-member supporters, which formed an important part of the recent WA election result.The Greens attracted a 5.9% swing in the primary vote, compared with a 5% swing against the Liberals and a 4.8% swing against the Labor Party. The Palmer United Party attracted a 7.4% swing.Milne said the party harnessed thousands of volunteers in the WA Senate re-run to hand out voting cards, knock on doors and operate phone banks to call voters.Milne is hoping to use the momentum to drive internal reform of the party, which she believes is critical to produce stable growth in the party’s electoral fortunes.When Milne became leader in 2012, she outlined a preference for a stronger cabinet-based approach as opposed to a high profile leader.When the new senate sits in July, the Greens will have 10 senators and a lower house member. Seven of the 11 representatives are women. The Greens claim to have 11,000 members across Australia, while the Liberal Party is estimated between 40-50,000 including the Liberal National Party in Queensland. Labor party numbers are estimated at 40,000.Her comments follow a review process that started last year when members were asked to contribute their views on every aspect of the constitution from state representation to membership fees.After a poor result in the Tasmanian state elections, Milne said the tide had begun to turn on Green support.“But we must be vigilant and renew ourselves,” she said.“The Australian Greens must continually strive to find the most effective ways to empower members in important decisions in the party.“The Australian Greens have always been a grassroots party and our membership numbers continue to grow because Australians see joining the Greens as an effective way to address the overwhelming challenge of global warming and ecological devastation and create the caring nation they want to be part of.“I am keen to see our party deepen our democratic structures and give members more ways to be directly involved.”The Greens are keen to rewrite the constitution to find a way to involve supporters who Milne believes have been galvanised by since the election of the Abbott government.The party developed as a group of loosely aligned green independents. Each state branch works differently as each grew from different movements. States currently vote to send delegates to national council but Milne believes the national organisation should be strengthened and states should be brought into a uniform structure with the same membership fees.Milne rejected the analysis that the swing towards the Greens in WA reflected a protest vote.“The strength of the Greens’ voice is not simply a protest vote against the old parties as some argue, instead it reflects our clear articulation of a set of values that resonate with millions of Australians,” she said.
