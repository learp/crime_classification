A few days before she faces Donald Trump in the first of the presidential debates, Hillary Clinton took the hot seat on on Zach Galifianakis’s Funny or Die web series Between Two Ferns on Thursday.Galifianakis, reprising his dim and politically incorrect alter ego from previous episodes, opens by asking Clinton whether she was excited to be the first “girl president”, then follows up by reminding her that “for a younger, younger generation you will also become their first white president, so that’s pretty cool, too”.Healthcare.gov sees traffic boost from Obama Between Two Ferns cameo Later, he describes Clinton’s style as “librarian from outer space”.“I really regret doing this,” she replies. Clinton is drolly tight-lipped for most of it, staring down Galifianakis as his questions grow increasingly offensive – but she does manage to get in a pointed dig at her Republican rival Donald Trump.When Galifianakis suggests Trump replace his red power tie with a “white power tie”, Clinton deadpans: “That’s even more appropriate.”Clinton’s willingness to be skewered in Between Two Ferns is not without precedent: in 2014, Barack Obama gamely appeared on the show to talk about healthcare. The interview was watched online more than 11m times on its first day online, increasing traffic to healthcare.gov by 40%.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest
