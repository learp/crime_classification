You’ve worked for us since you graduated. You believed all the rhetoric about how highly we value you. But now you’re part of a process that you have no control over, that does not recognise you as an individual. You are a number on a spreadsheet, a cost to be managed. And I have to manage that cost and manage you, to ensure you make a minimum of fuss.I hired and trained you. I nurtured and developed you. I am responsible for your wellbeing at work. But now I have to tell you your position is being eliminated, and while we’ll work with you to find another role in the company, the fact is that in two months you could be jobless.I will answer your question about whether there is any flexibility on timing with a commitment to try – knowing full well there probably isn’t any. You ask whether everyone is in the same boat. But of course some people will have kept their jobs in the restructuring, because they are the cheapest match for the remaining roles. Some people whose roles have been eliminated will get special treatment because they are seen as “top talent” to be retained. But you are neither, and so you are told the process is the same, based entirely on what roles are required.What I’m really thinking: the form tutor I tell myself that I am doing this to cushion the blow, to help you feel as if you have some input, or that the process is fair. But am I doing you a disservice by pretending it isn’t as brutal as all that? Wouldn’t you be better off knowing this is a transaction, not a relationship? By being humane, am I actually protecting myself – from your anger and disappointment – rather than you?• Tell us what you’re really thinking at mind@theguardian.com
