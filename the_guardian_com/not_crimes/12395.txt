The assertion by Professor Dave Goulson (Farmers could slash pesticide use without losses, research reveals, 6 April) cannot go unchallenged. He says that pesticides are massively over-used because farmers are advised by agronomists working on commission to sell products.The Agricultural Industries Confederation represents the majority of businesses that supply both agronomy advice and crop protection products to UK farmers. Farmers can elect to pay separately for agronomy advice and crop protection products. Farmers also have access to information from agrochemical manufacturers as well as independent agronomy research organisations – much of it free online. In many instances, those delivering advice do not receive commission.The UK crop protection industry is focused on ensuring optimum, rather than maximum, use of crop protection products to ensure the farming industry delivers safe, wholesome and affordable food. It is a legal requirement that agronomists selling crop protection products are highly trained and kept up to date with agronomic developments to deliver advice to ensure efficient production and environmental protection.Hazel DoonanHead of the crop protection and agronomy sector, Agricultural Industries Confederation• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
