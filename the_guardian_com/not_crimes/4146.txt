This book is an adventure story.It is about a young boy called Danny, as the title suggests. He thinks that his dad is the best dad in the world. Danny is surprised to find out that his dad often breaks the law. They have some interesting encounters with Mr. Hazell. My favourite part is when Danny thinks about his “sleeping beauty” strategy.I thought that the description of Mr. Hazell was too typical for a villainous character. He is always depicted as a horrible person with no unique quality. It makes an interesting read. The book paints a lovely picture of the affectionate father and son relationship between Danny and his dad.
