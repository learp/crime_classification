US tycoon Donald Trump has criticised a move to build an offshore windfarm near his golf resort in Scotland after a planning application for 11 turbines was submitted last Friday.The European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre is a £150m joint venture by utility company Vattenfall, engineering firm Technip and Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group.In a statement, Trump said: "I am very disappointed that Scotland may allow the development of a wind-power plant directly off Aberdeen's beautiful coastline."When I first became involved with our billion-pound development – golf course construction is weeks away from completion with a planned opening before 1 July 2012 – I was repeatedly promised, as an incentive for us to go forward and proceed with this project, that wind turbines would not be destroying and distorting the magnificent coastline."Unfortunately, despite these prior assurances that the wind project would not proceed, I am now learning that this issue has again raised its ugly head."Scotland is one of the most beautiful countries on earth, with its greatest asset being its magnificent coastline, a coastline known for its great beauty throughout the entire world."The windfarm planning application seeks permission for work to start on its construction and operation.The site of Trump's golf course is the Menie estate near Aberdeen on the North Sea coast, parts of which are designated as sites of special scientific interest.David Rodger, spokesman for the windfarm project, said: "We have been in regular contact with the Trump organisation and acknowledge the concern raised."We have made a strong case for the environmental and economic benefits of the European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre as a centre of global research and development for offshore wind [energy] and as such it is of strategic importance to Aberdeen and Scotland's renewable energy ambitions."The project is now subject to a formal consultation and decision-making process."
