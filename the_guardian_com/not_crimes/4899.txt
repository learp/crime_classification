A Carlsberg advert, entitled The Crate Escape, offers a flavour of how the beer industry traditionally views women.Sexist beer ads: why it's time for a cold, hard rethink The premise is that a group of long-suffering men, dragged to a health spa by their other halves, hatch an ingenious plan to dig a tunnel to smuggle beer past a security detail of stern female physicians. The unsuspecting wives and girlfriends are none the wiser. If such clunky stereotyping sounds like the preserve of mainstream ad campaigns, some smaller brewers rely on even cruder messages. What are female beer-lovers to make of Legspreader, a US-made bitter whose logo features a woman, her modesty covered only by the brewery’s name?A beer named Top Totty, brewed by Staffordshire based Slater’s Ales and featuring a scantily clad woman, was only removed from the House of Commons Strangers Bar in 2012 after complaints. Slater’s describes it as “a stunning blonde beer, full bodied with a voluptuous aroma”.Other examples include Slack Alice, a cider that is “a little tart”, and Bristol’s Ale and Naughty Noelle, whose labels both feature buxom women. It’s hard to imagine many of these labels getting the thumbs-up at this weekend’s Fem.Ale festival in Norwich, an annual event aimed at the women who brew and drink craft ale.Fem.Ale’s mission statement is to “continue combining feminism and activism with beer to celebrate women who are still underrepresented in numbers working in the beer industry and dispel the idea that beer is a drink only for men”.Beer and food writer Melissa Cole, a loyal fan of Fem.Ale, is all too familiar with beer companies’ ham-fisted approach to gender. “A new brewery approached me recently saying ‘Meet our Wild Blonde’. It was a blonde beer obviously. It’s so tired and naff and hackneyed. What bothers me is that nobody thinks about the ramifications for women working in the industry.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Sara Barton at Brewster’s Brewery.“When you name things Wild Blonde, and people see a blonde barmaid, it says that kind of seaside postcard bawdy humour is welcome here. What can the woman do without risking her job?”But with events such as Fem.Ale, not to mention a recent explosion of micro-brewing allowing anyone to set up shop on their own, the landscape is beginning to shift.Sara Barton, director of Brewster’s Brewing Company, has watched the gender gulf narrow in the course of her career. “When I started back in the late 80s it was a strange thing to see a woman in the brewing industry. It has become less unusual as time moved on and women enter supposedly male jobs,” she says.Barton is the instigator of Project Venus, a network of female brewers – known in the industry as brewsters – who meet regularly to swap tips and brew together. Over the years, she has witnessed successive attempts to tap into female audiences, some more successful than others.“Big companies have tried to make ‘lady beers’. There was one made by Molson Coors called Animée that had a couple of million invested in it but it bombed.” Animée was lighter than average and featured a more colourful, almost chintzy, label. Like fellow “female-friendly” brew Carlsberg Eve, it fell flat. “Women don’t like to be patronised,” Barton points out.Where beer companies have often got it wrong is in the assumption that women either want something fruity or lighter, less alcoholic and therefore less flavourful. If anything, the reverse is true.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Woodforde’s Grrrl Grey beer.“They do say that women have a lower threshold of being able to taste things,” says Barton. “So on tasting panels, women sometimes discern more. The long and short of it is that women are proven to have a better sense of taste than men,” Cole says.There is plenty of evidence to support the claim. The reigning brewer of the year – awarded by the British Guild of Beer Writers – is Jenn Merrick of Beavertown Brewery, based in London’s Walthamstow.And the industry boasts a clutch of highly regarded brewsters, such as Sue Fisher of Gadds’ Ramsgate Brewery and Belinda Jennings, head brewer at Woodforde’s, which has made an Earl Grey-infused brew especially for Fem.Ale called GRRRL Grey.Camra, the real ale enthusiasts’ group, recently embarked on a project aimed at modernisation, a process overseen by Emily Ryans.“More than 20% of our membership is female and this proportion is growing,” she says. “As a young, female Camra member and enthusiastic beer drinker myself, I’ve certainly noticed a rise in the availability and variety of good quality beer in recent years.“We are now looking at how we position ourselves in light of this and other developments in the industry and society.”Jane Peyton, author of Beer O’Clock and the instigator of Beer Day Britain on 15 June, is the first winner of the UK’s first Beer Sommelier of the Year awards.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   With an increasing number of women drinking beer, the brewing landscape is finally beginning to shift.

There are still brewers using that laddish imagery, which is bonkers because women are 51% of the population. It demeans men as well as women and it’s bad for business.”If beermakers want a lesson on women’s role in beer, says Peyton, they should look to history. “Women were the original brewers of beer … and in the creation myths of many cultures, beer was given to humans by females.”But Peyton isn’t confident that beermakers will abandon their comfort zone of lads’ culture marketing. “It’s going to take a long time for that to happen,” she says.
