Cookery writer Dorothy Hartley wrote in Food in England (1954) that “East End women make a rice pudding using broth ... when cooked it is finished under the joint of Mutton.” This is very similar to the “Ryse of Flesh” recipe found in The Forme of Cury (1390). Rice was an expensive import and therefore rice dishes would only appear on the tables of kings. Take Ryse and waishe hem clene. And do hem in erthen pot with gode broth and lat hem seeþ wel. Afterward take Almaund mylke and do þer to. And colour it wiþ safroun an salt, an messe forth. The Forme of Cury, ed. Samual Pegge, c.1390The Forme of Cury also gives a recipe for a rice pottage, virtually identical to Ryse of Flesh. The rice pottage is what would become the modern-day rice pudding and the recipe just omits the salt and broth, using water instead to cook the rice the first time.Sugar isn’t added in The Forme of Cury; for a sweetened rice pudding we have to wait until the 15th-century Austin manuscripts, which include a pudding sweetened with honey and sugar. In 1660, Robert May (The Accomplisht Cook) adds eggs, beef suet, salt, nutmeg, cloves, mace, currants, dates and powdered coriander seeds.

Photograph: Regula YsewijnA recipe for rice plainly cooked as a side dish only appears in 1669, but even then it is still served as a sweet dish spiced with cinnamon. This rice pudding is very savoury and might not be suited to modern tastes.(Serves 4)120g short-grain rice, such as arborio500ml beef broth500ml almond milkA few saffron strandsPut the rice and broth in a deep saucepan and heat gently. Stir well and bring to the boil. Simmer and stir often so the rice doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan.When the liquid is almost completely absorbed, after about 15 minutes, add the almond milk and saffron. Stir well, then simmer gently for 20-30 minutes, stirring every now and then until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is cooked and thick. Spoon the cooked rice pudding into a serving dish.Pride and Pudding: The History of British Pudding Savoury and Sweet by Regula Ysewijn (Murdoch Books, £20).
