Sometimes, when it comes down to it, you just like a thing because it’s likable. No one reason looms large; generally it is just pleasurable. That’s kind of how I feel about the American actor Emma Stone. I simply want good things for her.I first saw Stone, 28, in 2007’s Superbad. The film has many flaws (is anyone this interested in teenage boys’ lives?) but she is not one of them. As Jules, she’s a breath of fresh air: husky-voiced, knowingly wide-eyed, and somewhat gawky (but not in the usual romcom-heroine-in-mild-peril way). A lot of her allure is in her eyes, if I have to pin it down: they are bug eyes, and they make her face arresting, which is more interesting than uncomplicated beauty (perhaps it’s no surprise she once said she’d most like to have a coffee with comic legend Gilda Radner, also a bit buggy). They are eyes that accommodate both comedy and pathos. She displayed a nice balance of each in Birdman, and was Oscar-nominated for her performance. Why I love… comedian and actor Mo’Nique My favourite Stone is the one in Easy A, a modern reworking of The Scarlet Letter, in which she is a firecracker with real heart. Who expected to be so moved by a teen movie? It helped me studiously overlook quietly tragic career missteps like Magic In The Moonlight (2014) and Aloha (2015). “You are better than these,” I wanted to tell her, like we’re friends. And maybe someone else told her, because she is the star of current awards hoover La La Land, a musical that lets her be a little odd, with plenty of heart.More, please.
