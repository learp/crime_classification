This book is about a girl called Tiga Whicabim who lives in the shed with a horrible old lady. One day, Tiga discovers a fairy who takes her down the sink pipes for witch wars.I think children aged around 6 would enjoy this book because it has such a fantastic plot and it is easy to read. I liked Witch Wars because it was about a competition, and competitions are really fun to read about. I also liked seeing which characters would be disqualified from the witch wars as the plot progressed.   Witch WarsI give this book three stars out of five. I didn’t like it as much as other books I’ve read recently, like Murder Most Unladylike by Robin Stevens.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
