Firefighters are being hampered in flood rescue operations by unsuitable equipment and a severe lack of staff and training, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has warned.The union said waterborne infections had become widespread among firefighters drafted in to tackle the floods wearing equipment ill-suited to water.Some firefighters are using ageing or deteriorating boats, the union said, while other crews are wading into swollen rivers without dry suits or specialist vehicles.Dozens of fire brigades have been drafted in as part of the flood relief mission across the UK, in what union chiefs described as the biggest mobilisation of its staff since the second world war.FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said the floods response was being hampered by serious budget restrictions caused by cuts in government funding."Firefighters are doing a fantastic job in the floods, saving lives and reducing damage done to homes and businesses, and are always proud to serve their communities during difficult times," he said."But a very troubling picture is emerging of understaffed operations, badly equipped firefighters and inadequate training severely hampering their work and creating greater risk for firefighters and the public."Although there has been improvement in equipment after firefighters raised concerns during the 2007 floods, it seems our calls for better preparation and support have not yet been adequately addressed, with unprecedented cuts severely jeopardising our ability to cope with the floods effectively."The practice of drafting in firefighters from other parts of the UK has left the fire and rescue service severely stretched, the union said. It claimed that firefighters from 20 brigades were helping the local force in flood-stricken Devon and Somerset, and a further 16 crews were supporting firefighters in Berkshire.The union makes its claims about equipment shortages against the backdrop of a long-running row with the government over pensions. Peter Holland, the government's chief fire and rescue adviser, described the claims as completely unfounded and said that over 1,000 fully equipped firefighters were in force across the country.Holland said: "The crews who have been drafted in from around the country are specially trained professionals who have the very best equipment for dealing with the floods including high volume pumps, rescue boats, 4x4 fire vehicles and dry suits."He added: "While fire and rescue services are busy dealing with the floods, there still are plenty of fire engines in local areas to respond to non-flood emergencies."
