Like me, many Italians have eating rituals that we love to share. Coffee at 7am with your housemate, Sunday pizza with your partner and wine Wednesdays with colleagues are very common in Italy, and probably also in the UK.But for a really special sharing experience, you need “small food rituals”. And I mean really small, like an espresso. I remember one summer in Sicily when my cousin Ivano asked me: “Shall we share an espresso?” I was touched. Sharing such a small and quick thing to consume is an intimate gesture of love and generosity. It’s like giving away the last bite of your ice cream. Special shared moments I’ve experienced include a steamed artichoke eaten with my partner, a sweet Sicilian lemon sucked dry with my brother and a tiny triglia fritta (deep fried red mullet) savoured with my mum.It’s these small food rituals that have formed the basis for the recipe below. Although the combination of coffee and triglia (red mullet) might not be immediately obvious, it makes total sense for a dinner we’re organising in a coffee roastery. Toto (the chef) and I wanted to marry two unusual ingredients in one dish and, as our dinners are all about sharing, it was important that the produce we used had some special meaning. And of course, the taste is surprising and delicious – and perfect to share. Serves four.

Slowly add some coffee oil and a pinch of ground coffee until you get a moist and translucent bread crumble.Save the leftover oil in the fridge for future experiment.For the sauce1 medium red mullet300g Sicilian datterini tomatoOlive oil1 clove of garlicHeat some oil and garlic in a thick pan. Remove the garlic and add the tomato chopped in half.Add some salt and cook until loose and creamy. In another pan, quickly fry the fillets of mullet in some olive oil, skin down to crisp it up. Break them down roughly and add to the tomato sauce.For the pasta400g of your preferred long pasta2 stems of wild fennel1 lemonCook the pasta in salted water: remember the 1-10-100 weight ratio of salt-pasta-water. Drain it in a shallow pan when it has still a hard bite and finish cooking with the sauce adding some oil and cooking water. Finish off with some lemon zest, wild fennel and coffee bricioleTips: for a proper deep-sea flavour make some stock with the mullet head and bones and use it to finish the cooking of the pasta instead of the cooking water. You could also ask your fishmonger to leave the heart and the liver of the fish (a true delicacy) and add it chopped to the sauce.The Italian Supper Club regularly host dinners for Guardian members.
