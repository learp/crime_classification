The release of Rihanna’s Anti album is imminent, with strong rumours saying it will drop on 27 January. The singer’s eighth album has been subject to months of delays but has now finally been completed. The record is tied up in a $25m deal with Samsung, who are sponsoring the rollout and Rihanna’s upcoming tour. The website AntiDiary.com has been teasing fans with content since November 2015, but has slowed down in recent weeks. There were rumours that Rihanna was considering cancelling her tour, which starts on 26 February, in order to finish her album, or even that she might scrap the record entirely. According to Billboard sources, the huge sales of Adele’s 25 is one of the reasons why the record was repeatedly pushed back, but Rihanna is now ready to vie for the top spot.Anti is said to incorporate a wide range of styles, and has been preceded by the tracks American Oxygen, Bitch Better Have My Money and FourFiveSeconds, which featured Kanye West and Paul McCartney. It will be Rihanna’s first release since 2012’s Unapologetic.
