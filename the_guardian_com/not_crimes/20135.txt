 One figure has towered over the 29th Hay festival more than any other since it kicked off last weekend, his name echoing around the canvas from children’s events to political debates. No, not Benedict Cumberbatch, despite his surprise appearance at two charity performances of festival favourite Letters Live, and delighting partygoers by dancing until the small hours on two consecutive nights. No, it’s William Shakespeare, whose presence in this anniversary year has dominated the programme, from Russell T Davies and Maxine Peake discussing how to update him in their Midsummer Night’s Dream, or Marcus Brigstocke giving audiences his Romeo as part of John Sutherland and John Crace’s Abridged Shakespeare event; there’s Malorie Blackman presenting her young adult novel inspired by Othello, as well as more unexpected appearances, such as the Comedy Store Players attempting to improvise in Shakespearian verse.He also popped up as part of the new Hay Levels Live series, an opportunity for younger visitors to quiz the festival’s experts on their exam questions. The idea began a few years ago with an impromptu talk by mathematician Marcus du Sautoy to a group of students in the back of a minibus; now it’s expanded to its own venue, Compass, where Hay speakers offer Q&A sessions on topics such as Shakespeare, physics, biology or Tudor history, and a YouTube channel for those who can’t make it in person. Further sessions offer advice about university and beyond, and students are being bussed into the festival from schools all over Wales as part of an initiative funded by the Welsh government.It’s a good rebuttal to those who fear literary festivals can be a bit middle-aged, as is the number of young women talking about feminism for a new generation. Caitlin Moran was on fine form, asking her audience to crowdsource a name for intimate phenomena particular to women; typically for a Hay audience, we couldn’t agree, but Moran did appease her fans by promising to run for parliament if Boris Johnson ever becomes prime minister.
