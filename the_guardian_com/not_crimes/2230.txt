The final set of cranes from an ambitious project to reintroduce the birds to Britain has been released at a secret location in Somerset.Cranes used to be common throughout the country but were driven to extinction in the 16th century by over-hunting and the loss of wetlands.Over the past five years, the Great Crane Project has raised five classes of young crane chicks and released almost 100 on to the Somerset Levels and moors.The classes, including foraging and exercise, were taught by humans dressed in grey hooded overalls to prevent the young birds becoming accustomed to people.Yesterday, 16 young cranes completed the last 10-week course of Crane School at Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) Slimbridge reserve in Gloucestershire.They will join previous graduates and it is hoped the crane flock will start to grow naturally as the birds reach maturity and breed.The species should then start to spread out across western Britain.Amy King, of WWT, headteacher of Crane School, described the project as “unforgettable”.“This year’s Crane School class have really thrived,” she said.“They’ve loved their daily walks and this year we drafted in 40 volunteer ‘PE teachers’ who took the birds for more than 700 hours of exercise.“I’ve worked with the Great Crane Project since day one and it has been the most unforgettable experience. Some of the first birds that I raised have had chicks of their own now.“It’s just wonderful to know that they’re out there, living wild in our landscape once again.”The Great Crane Project, a partnership between WWT, RSPB, Pensthorpe Conservation Trust and Viridor Credits, aims to restore the Eurasian cranes to their former haunts.The cranes were hatched from eggs taken from a healthy wild population in Germany, with the disguised human teachers taking on the role of their parents.Cranes, long-lived and social birds, are naturally cared for by their parents for several months - lasting beyond the time when they learn to fly or are fledged.Damon Bridge, Great Crane Project manager, said: “With this last class now on the Levels, we’re all looking forward to the next phase of the project with the cranes settling down to breed and raise youngsters in the wild.“Putting these iconic birds back in this special place is so exciting, a real boost not just for the crane population in the UK, but we hope a symbol of a bright future for the Somerset wetlands.”Cranes were once common throughout the UK but today the only trace in many parts is in place names such as Cranleigh, Cranmore and Tranmere. Tran is from the Norse word for crane.In recent years, a small number have naturally started to recolonise eastern Britain, with a large flock also now established in Somerset through the project.
