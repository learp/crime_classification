Falling demand for “pop-up” shops has caused a sharp rise in the number of unoccupied retail units, a new survey shows.Retail vacancy rates have risen above 10% for the first time since April 2015, according to a quarterly research report published on Monday by the British Retail Consortium and research group Springboard.Planning applications for new shops fell 9% in past year The rise to 10.1%, from 9.6% in April 2016, is being partly blamed on start-up retail businesses taking short term leases, but then failing to convert them into longer agreements.Diane Wehrle, a director at Springboard, said: “Between October and January vacancies went down, partly on the back of more pop-up shops. Since then, temporary lets have not become permanent lets. The key thing is to see if pop-ups start increasing again coming into Christmas.”Wehrle added that because of a surge in popularity of pop-up shops in the run-up to Christmas 2015, 2016 was the first year where vacancy figures had been affected by the closure of some of that type of unit.Last year, telecoms company EE predicted that almost a third of new businesses launched in the UK between 2015 and 2017 would start as a pop-up, which tend to take six month leases on shops to test out a new business concept, or as a marketing stunt for established brands. Silent blight in a countryside of empty homes and shut shops The phenomenon was promoted by TV retail consultant Mary Portas and the then-communities minister Eric Pickles as a way to regenerate high streets in the aftermath of the 2008 recession.Earlier this month, the supermarket chain Tesco opened a pop-up wine bar in London’s Soho district, serving only Tesco’s finest wine range for two weeks. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, added: “After a long run of shop vacancies being below 10%, seeing them rise over that threshold once again will be a bitter disappointment to many.”
