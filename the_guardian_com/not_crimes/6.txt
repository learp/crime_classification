Pauline Hanson has asked the Turnbull government to underwrite a plan to connect Norfolk Island to a new fibre optic cable stretching between Australia and New Zealand.She said the new $300m Hawaiki cable linking the United States, Hawaii, Australia and New Zealand, would pass within 100 km of Norfolk Island.She wants the government to back a proposed 90km fibre optic spur that would connect the island to that cable.Norfolk Island leader calls for royal commission into 'Australian takeover' “There still exists a very small window of opportunity for Norfolk Island to connect if the Australian government is able to assist it either financially or through an underwriting agreement, such as the precedent set by the Norfolk Island/Air New Zealand underwriting agreement, which secures air travel to and from the island,” Hanson said in a letter to the communications minister, Mitch Fifield.“I am aware of private sector interest and capacity to fund the connection of the cable, however they are seeking some guarantee that the connection will be supported, rather than excluded by the NBN on the island.”Hanson said initial evaluation of the underwriting option indicated a “possible win-win” for Norfolk Island and Australia because the connection would enable greater economic development for the island, helping it to generate local revenues and reduce financial dependence on Australia.She made her request after a “fact-finding” trip to the island last week, where she was briefed on the island’s communications facilities.Documents supporting her letter claim the NBN’s Sky Muster Satellite, which the island relies on, cannot deliver on the promise of video streaming nor the low latency network connectivity required for interactive and business use.“To exhaust the Norfolk Island capacity of SkyMuster using HD TV would take just 25 simultaneous users,” the document says.“Assuming the average family of five, parents and kids watch different shows, this bottleneck would be reached very quickly, with a take-up and usage during peak times by less than 13 families on the island.”Norfolk islanders hope Pauline Hanson will take up some of their grievances The document was written by Ken McDonald, an engineering consultant who is based in Mornington Victoria but who has a home and office on Norfolk Island.McDonald says his expertise is in the design of high speed real time software-based control systems for the telecommunications industry.At the last census in 2011, Norfolk Island’s total population (excluding visitors or tourists) was 1,796.Hanson’s trip to the island occurred just days after she was given a position on the joint standing committee for the National Broadband Network.The Turnbull government removed veteran Nationals senator John Williams from the committee to make room for her.Last week Hanson called on Malcolm Turnbull to sack the government-appointed administrator of Norfolk Island, Gary Hardgrave, accusing him of misleading the Australian parliament, a claim he dismissed as “nonsense”.Hardgrave was appointed by the government to oversee the island’s transition from being an external Australian territory to becoming a part of the commonwealth.Hanson toured the island last week on the invitation of Norfolk Island People for Democracy, a group opposed to the Australian government’s revoking of the island’s autonomy and who are fighting to have the decision overturned.
