Representing least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states, Gyan Chandra Acharya calls on leaders to make the most vulnerable countries the top priority. “It is a sad reality that while the world’s most vulnerable countries have contributed the least to climate change, they are most at risk from its negative effects and the least equipped to withstand and adapt to it,” Acharya writes.You can stay updated with the Guardian’s coverage of the latest news from COP 21, including Africa’s ambitious renewable energy drive backed by the continent’s leaders, the latest push from religious leaders on action against climate change, and China’s call for rich countries to take responsibility for historical greenhouse gas emissions.Elsewhere on the siteKilled defending women’s rights: nine female activists who died in 2015Quest for tuberculosis vaccine begins as scientists aim to beat disease by 2035Brazil warns women not to get pregnant as zika virus is linked to rare birth defectHorrific attacks prompt South Sudan’s communities to form armed groupsMorocco: activists claim draft rights law fails to treat disabled people as equalsHumanitarian response treats women’s health ‘as an afterthought’, says the UNOpinionWhat should the world do in the face of unprecedented humanitarian disaster?
