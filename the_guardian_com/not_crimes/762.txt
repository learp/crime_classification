New Zealand authorities have filed charges against the owners of a cargo ship that ran aground on a reef six months ago, creating what authorities describe as the country's worst maritime environmental disaster.Maritime New Zealand on Thursday charged Daina Shipping with discharging harmful substances from the Rena. The charge carries a maximum fine of NZ$600,000 (£300,000) plus another NZ$10,000 for each day the offending continues.The 47,230-tonne Rena on 5 October hit Astrolabe reef near Tauranga, New Zealand's main export port, spilling 400 tonnes of fuel oil.Daina Shipping, incorporated in Liberia, is one of 80 subsidiaries of the Greek shipping company Costamare, which reported 2011 profits of $88m from revenues of $382m.The ship's captain and second officer have already pleaded guilty to operating the ship in a dangerous manner, releasing toxic substances and altering the ship's documents. The two Filipino men face of up to seven years in jail. They will be sentenced in late May.Marine officials said high winds and seas have battered the wreck – now split in half – causing more containers to fall into the sea and spreading oil still leaking from the ship.The worst of the spill killed thousands of sea birds and polluted beaches up to 60 miles away.
