Rural-dwellers who are unemployed, young or old, or disabled are increasingly stuck in their homes and unable to access essential services because of savage cuts to public transport in the countryside, MPs have warned.The "extensive" cuts that have happened already to rural bus services mean that people cannot find jobs, travel to school or college, or even access health services, according to the House of Commons transport committee. The situation is likely to get worse.At least seven out of 10 local authorities have made cuts or are planning to. In one area, Cambridgeshire, the plan was to cut all funding support for local buses, until a legal challenge forced a rethink.The MPs also warned that fare rises were already putting transport beyond the reach of many vulnerable or disadvantaged people. They complained of "little or no proper consultation" when many of the vital bus routes were closed down or scaled back.Louise Ellman, the committee's chairwoman, said: "We know that over 70% of local authorities have moved rapidly to reduce funding for supported bus services, forcing most operators to withdraw services or push up fares – or both – as the English bus industry adjusts to the greatest financial challenge it has faced for a generation."She added: "Rural, evening and Sunday services … are most affected, although in some areas every scrap of funding has been withdrawn from subsidised bus services."These cuts would have "very serious economic implications", she said, as people were unable to get jobs without access to transport, and could find it difficult to continue schooling or even visit local shops.While it is local authorities that oversee local bus services, the MPs want central government to take a greater role.The consequences of scaling back bus services are not only social and economic, but also environmental. Fewer buses mean more people will use cars.Richard Dyer, Friends of the Earth's (FoE) transport campaigner, said: "Spending cuts have come as a devastating blow to those who depend on buses to get from A to B – elderly people especially. Buses are also a greener, congestion-busting alternative to driving cars and it's vital they're given full financial support to keep the country mobile."He urged ministers to take action: "The government should ensure councils prioritise funding for transport measures that reduce traffic, cut emissions and help to tackle pollution – as well as encouraging healthier lifestyles."Recent research by FoE and the Sustrans campaigning group – looking at 16 transport plans in urban and rural areas – found that local authorities were spending only 70p per head, per year, a tiny fraction of their budgets, to help people make greener travel choices. Pilot programmes in three towns – Darlington, Peterborough and Worcester – that encouraged people out of their cars showed emissions were reduced and air quality improved as more journeys were made on foot, by bicycle and by bus.The MPs called for more services like the "dial a ride" schemes, which are often run by community groups to help the disabled and elderly, and to take people to specific destinations, such as hospitals. Ellman said: "This is not a substitute [for local bus services] but it would help to mitigate the problem."The committee also urged the Department for Transport to monitor the extent of public transport cutbacks made this year and to review provision again after cuts in the bus service operator grant take effect next year, so that it can "analyse … the wider costs and benefits of its policy changes to the country as a whole".
