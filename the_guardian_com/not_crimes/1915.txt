My routine is not extensive. I have a shower and a good old scrub: I wish I could tell you that it’s a cornmeal scrub with exfoliating properties, but it’s just soap and water. I am a northerner, unless you’re on Geordie Shore, you aren’t allowed to do any more than that, those are the rules. That said, I may dig out my dusty old hairdryer and some pomade, because the last thing you want to be doing is fiddling with your hair when you are photographed on the red carpet.I get nervous about events because I agonise over the dress code. The words I dread more than anything are “smart casual”, because I never quite know what that means. If it says “black tie” that is music to my ears because I can play it safe and wear a suit. I love a traditional cut. Back in the day, when I was a lot younger, I had a special suit by John Rocha that I wore on a Friday night in Bolton, thinking it was my pulling suit. I didn’t have a great amount of luck, but I don’t think it was the suit’s fault.David Coulthard, F1 presenter: ‘I have a business and a family, so don’t have hours to get ready’ Eighteen months ago my business partner, Zoe – we have a production company together – announced it was time for me to start dressing like a grownup. Now I am only allowed one pair of classic trainers; I used to have hundreds. Today I am wearing a grey Levi’s T-shirt, pale blue All Saints jeans, brown brogues and a khaki G-Star jacket with tortoiseshell Ray-Bans. I look like an off-duty spy! It’s nice to feel a bit more manly, a little more sophisticated. I don’t know if it’s the clothes, but I walk with better posture now: I stick my chest out, straighten my back and I wouldn’t go so far as to say swagger, but I certainly cut a dash.• Ralf Little presents the arts award on National Lottery Stars, 12 September, BBC1, lotterygoodcauses.org.uk
