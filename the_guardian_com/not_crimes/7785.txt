When Laurent Fabius brought down his green gavel in Paris on Saturday, the atmosphere in the hall was said to be electric. The global great and good, even the not-so-good, were all smiles, tears of joy and arms around each other, all of them caught up, at least for that moment, in the hope that they might just have been part of saving the world. It must be hoped that Amber Rudd soaked up her full share of this euphoria, because the UK energy secretary is going to need to draw on deep inspiration if she is to close the yawning gap between the UK’s rhetoric at the summit, and the recent UK record back home.World leaders hail Paris climate deal as ‘major leap for mankind’ The right sometimes complains that environmentalists are like watermelons – green on the surface but socialist red inside. It is, however, now clear that David Cameron’s one-time “vote blue, go green” pitch in opposition was no more than verdigris, a patina rapidly scratched off by the grind of being in government. Even under the coalition, where Ms Rudd’s brief was held by successive Lib Dems, George Osborne stoked anti-environmental sentiment by declaring to his party conference that he would never “save the planet by putting Britain out of business”, as if that were what those concerned with climate wanted. Today, six months into a majority Conservative government, the chancellor has been dictating the terms of environmental policy, to unremittingly destructive effect. On airport expansion the only question is where, not if. The next big idea for the green investment bank is privatisation, with ministers set to cede public control of the bank’s animating principles in order to bring in a little cash and get it off the Treasury’s balance sheet. Above all, the subsidies for renewables have been savaged, in some cases cut by 90%, and the damage to the sector has been redoubled by parallel tweaks to the planning regime.Almost as bad as what has been done is the way the government has set about it. There has been indecent haste, with deep cuts announced two months after the election, and profoundly important changes being written straight into the energy bill, without ever having gone through the standard consultative green or white paper stages. There has been profound imbalance, too. The government gives the falling price of solar energy cells as a reason to cut solar subsidies, but there is no parallel move to raise petrol duties after the oil price freefall. This is in explicit contradiction of the “fair fuel stabiliser” approach propounded during the last parliament, when ministers explained why – time and again – they had cancelled planned petrol duty rises in the face of rising oil costs. We have now reached a pass where even the former chancellor and noted climate sceptic Nigel Lawson berates Mr Osborne for his failure to take the chance to recoup sorely needed revenue at the pumps.Heathrow third runway decision put off until at least summer 2016 Malign symbolism compounds the immediate practical effect of the early closure of the renewables obligation in respect of wind, and the withdrawal of “nationally significant” status from the construction of onshore turbines. The great battle in greening energy is to convince investors that, well, the wind will remain in their sails. But moves of this sort will do exactly the opposite, creating uncertainty and deterring new projects, which is no doubt why such moves appeal to big carbon special interests and anti-environmental obsessives.Ms Rudd is emphatically not in the latter camp. She recently committed to phasing out coal power stations, and sounded serious about it too, emphasising the particular role of cleanish modern gas facilities. A few weeks later, however, came a UK capacity market auction, which awarded coal contracts, did nothing about constructing the mooted cleaner gas facilities, and most bizarrely sponsored the mushrooming of small generators which run off grimy diesel. So here’s hoping that the electricity of Paris will have given Ms Rudd the sort of shock that might jolt her from half-decent intentions into a real and lasting commitment to act.
