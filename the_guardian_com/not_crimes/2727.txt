As my mum always used to say when I was a young whippersnapper - do as I say and not as I do. Running a marathon as preparation for another marathon in a couple of months’ time is not necessarily the approved method - my coach would certainly not usually recommend it - but as a long training run, doing the Tokyo marathon takes quite some beating. From the brilliant lunacy of the short but intensely fun Friendship Run on the Saturday to the race itself (mid-race tomato, anyone?) I think I might have DOMS in my face from smiling so much.A long training run - the longest before a marathon race - is often a wearisome trudge. Do it in a World Marathon Major and instead you get a medal, a post race towel and something called Calorie Mate which looks like a second world war ration block. I haven’t dared unwrap it yet! And a tempo run feels easy when crowds are cheering you on with shouts of “gambare gambare!” - and the people at the bag drop clap you and repeated congratulate you with “good job!” I finished in a steady three hours and 22 minutes and hopefully after some recovery (and some crossed fingers) I am on track to go sub three at the London marathon in a couple of months’ time.But over to you (and back on a plane home for me). How was your weekend running? Racing, pacing or trudging - I want to hear all your stories below the line as always. Tomato fuel included.
