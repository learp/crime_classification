Hometown: Bristol.The lineup: Collins Nemi (music, production).The background: If you liked late-’90s and early-2000s garage – we hear it was a great era for British music – then you’ll love Conducta, almost as much as the 21-year-old Bristolian loves MJ Cole, DJ EZ, Large Joints and all the other exponents of the form from the first time round. He uses the fabulous clatter of garage, analysing period beats and programming his own takes on same. Then he places on top a series of female vocal melodies either lifted from old Aaliyah, Brownstone or Janet Jackson songs (he spends his every waking moment scouring the internet for luscious snippets) or “tapepacks” of US R&B – “royalty-free sample discs featuring loops of music that I flip and transform”, as he explains. Conducta is equally a fan of Teddy Riley and Timbaland, new jack swing and latter-day R&B. He makes sure he adheres to the low-end theory, his sub-bass frequencies contrasting with the aching melodies. “I wanted a balance of the smoooth with the rough bass-y elements,” he says. Not for nothing does Conducta’s music have the support of Benga, Skepta and others: it has the grittiness of grime. He also points out the importance of balancing out the retro and the modern. He adores old school 2-step (he recently did a show with Artful Dodger) and, in particular, MJ Cole. “He’s my hero,” he announces, hoping to create the 2016 version of Cole’s classic Crazy Love. “I don’t just want to regurgitate.” A mix of a tough beat and pulverising bass is what makes his music so effective. On Felt This Way, the pop romance tropes work and the soft female vocals have a cutting quality because they’re put in a harsh context, the industrial grind bringing a dash of the mechanical to the melodic melancholy. On Vague, as elsewhere, the female voice is tweaked into a high-pitched squeak – it is as affecting as it is inhuman, unearthly. All Night is well-named. This is music for lonely late-night driving round British cities: he gives good urban forlorn, does Conducta. City Breeze is as pretty as it is a speaker-rattling pummel. If U Leave features a popping beat and a sort of synth-y version of 2-step’s trademark pizzicato violins, a poignant plink that tugs at the heartstrings. Lacerating, meet lovely.The buzz: “It’s the straight-up UKG that we all know and love, but it has an attractive new car smell to it that proves inescapable” – Nest HQ.The truth: It’s ’90s R&B and UKG updated for 2016: more lovers bass than lovers rock.
