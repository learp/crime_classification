All you need for a make-up-free look is… make-up. Concealer isn’t just a spot coverer. As well as hiding under-eye shadows and camouflaging odd bits of skin, it’s a little stick of arrogance, with a light powder to hold it in place. Particularly fine is Laura Mercier’s Secret Camouflage, containing one shade to match the skin’s undertone and one for depth, inviting you to custom-blend your own concealer, right there on your finger.Stila Aqua Glow Serum Concealer, £19 asos.comBenefit Erase Paste, £20.50 feelunique.comLaura Mercier Camouflage Concealer, £27.50 spacenk.comCrème de la Mer Concealer, £55 cremedelamer.co.ukBourjois Healthy Mix Concealer, £7.99 boots.comTom Ford Concealing Pen, £42 selfridges.comDolce & Gabbana Perfect Luminous Concealer, £28 harrods.comNYX 3c Conceal Correct Contour Palette, £10 asos.comEmail Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman
