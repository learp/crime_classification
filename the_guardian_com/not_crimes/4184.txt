How brilliant are Rihanna’s Puma shower slides? A bastard hybrid of pink mule, shower sandal and an Ugg, it looks like something Jim Henson’s Creature Shop might come up with, but gets five gold stars for functionality.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Fenty x Puma with Rihanna – love the way it lies. Photograph: InstagramThe brilliance comes from the fact that RiRi has solved the dry shoe/wet shoe dilemma that haunts our dreams. Specifically, as the four-seasons-in-one-day weather takes us on a rollercoaster ride of sartorial difficulty (basically, every morning is a “WTF?”-fest), we don’t know which shoes would best complete our outfits. The slip-on, flesh-revealing shoe (for dry weather) or the padded, winter boot for the inevitable downpour? Thanks to these slippers-with-fur, it’s problem solved. A win-win for Fenty and feet.
