Is this the end for Crosby, Stills and Nash? It seems likely following comments from Graham Nash, in which he branded David Crosby as “fucking awful”. The future of the band’s extended version – Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young – has looked terminal ever since Crosby made disparaging remarks about Neil Young’s relationship with actor Daryl Hannah, despite a subsequent apology from Crosby. Now the former Byrd seems to have offended another even more integral bandmate. In an interview with Dutch magazine Lust for Life, Nash said that his relationship with Crosby has deteriorated to the extent that the band are no more. Recent feud leaves future of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young uncertain “I don’t like David Crosby right now,” Nash said. “He’s been awful for me the last two years, just fucking awful. I’ve been there and saved his fucking ass for 45 years, and he treated me like shit. You can’t do that to me. You can do it for a day or so, until I think you’re going to come around. When it goes on longer, and I keep getting nasty emails from him, I’m done. Fuck you. David has ripped the heart out of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.”In later comments, Nash told Billboard: “Right now, I don’t want anything to do with Crosby at all. It’s just that simple. In my world there will never, ever be a Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young record and there will never be another Crosby, Stills and Nash record or show.”While refusing to be drawn on specifics, he added: “I was letting Crosby be who he is. I let people play their hand in front of me, and I let him do it and then I make a decision.”Nash, who admitted to being “sad” about the state of the band, which formed in 1968, is now concentrating on his solo album This Path Tonight, due out in April.
