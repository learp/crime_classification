We're having a waxwing winter, apparently. Speaking on BBC Radio 4 programme Saving Species, the BTO's Paul Stancliffe reported that up to 3,000 of the birds are already in the country, and one Shetland blogger had up to 50 in his garden at once – he even fed apples to a few by hand. It's unlikely that I'll bear witness to such an event in my small London plot, but I'm hoping I'll see a few this year. Waxwings are amazing birds, about the size of a starling but with a sort of mohican (or crest), black throat, yellow and orange wing markings and a yellow tipped tail. They also have a black mask around the eyes flanked by white and orange feathers, reminiscent of heavy eighties make-up.Waxwings are regular winter migrants from northern Scandinavia and Russia, and tend to turn up in large numbers when berries are in short supply back home. The last time this happened was 2010. Berry eaters, they seem particularly fond of rowan, guelder rose and hawthorn, but they'll also eat cotoneaster berries, apples and rosehips. If you grow these plants in your garden, you may be in for a treat.The north of the country is the place to see them currently, but when food supplies have dried up they'll move south in search of more – some have already been spotted as far west as Ireland and as south as Cornwall. A few have been seen in London.I popped out in the vain hope that I'd spot some in the lone rowan tree that stands on the edge of my local park. No such luck – it had been stripped bare and was almost unrecognisable from the berry-laden tree I watched blackbirds feed from a few weeks ago.The hawthorn and elder had also been stripped of berries. There were plenty of spindle and guelder rose berries still available, and masses of holly and cotoneaster. Two fat wood pigeons gorged on the cotoneaster berries until a third one joined them and was chased off by a song thrush. It was a lovely little walk. I'll be keeping an eye out for waxwings and other berry-eating birds, both in my local park and further afield. I'll also report my findings to the BTO birds and berries study, which may help scientists understand more about the berry-eating preferences of birds and could even help us choose which berries to grow in our gardens. You can also report sightings to the Twitter account @waxwingsuk, which is tracking all waxwing sightings in the UK. In the meantime, I'm stocking up on apples in anticipation of a huge waxwing invasion in my garden. • Kate Bradbury edits Wild London magazine and writes for a number of publications including Guardian Weekend, Gardeners' World Magazine and Butterfly Magazine, and has a weekly blog on gardenersworld.com.
