There is a moment in Iain Sinclair’s London Overground, where the writer is challenged by a hostile and lubricated city developer during a Q&A with the members club at Shoreditch House. This “player, investor” takes umbrage with Sinclair’s tales of local history and heritage, referring to his talk at the swanky venue as “pigs’ bollocks dipped in sherbet” – adding that what Sinclair says about “Charles Dickens, furniture sweatshops, bagels and blah-blah-blah” has nothing to say about the “realities of the moment”. The Ginger line: Iain Sinclair on the London Overground A new collaboration between the master of psychogeography and Ewan Fisher and Ben Webster of Standard Planets sets this particular excerpt to song: the gluttony of the rich; capitalism versus creativity; the shifting generations and gentrification; Sinclair’s wry wit – all set to the sound of eerily lurching guitars and a burgeoning atmosphere of discontent.A limited-edition run of the vinyl is being released worldwide on 26 February but before then, take a listen below. <a href="http://standardplanets.bandcamp.com/album/overground">Overground by Standard Planets</a>To order this track email standardplanets@gmail.com.
