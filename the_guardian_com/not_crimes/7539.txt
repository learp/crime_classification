When David Cameron announced last week that he was resigning as an MP, the nation’s initial reaction was vague surprise that he was actually still around, followed swiftly by outrage that he was soon no longer to be so. That big quitter, I fumed, shocked that the tedious, glory-free grind of being an MP should hold few charms for a man whose idea of roughing it was taking a summer holiday in Cornwall instead of Tuscany. How on earth would Britain cope without that political titan on the back benches? Why, mere hours after he made his announcement, it emerged that the Great British Bake Off was leaving the BBC. The country was already falling apart!I’ve been thinking a lot about Cameron’s legacy this past week. Not his political legacy, because the closer you try to examine that, the faster it slips away, like grains of sand on a Padstow beach spraying behind you as you rush to make your reservation at Rick Stein’s restaurant. One defender claimed last weekend that Cameron had left Britain “stronger and fairer” (had they not heard about Bake Off?), and cited as proof of Cameron’s political nous his “exhausting capacity for decision-making”. This is like saying the best thing about a bad date was his “strong personality”.So let’s leave the politics to one side. Culturally, Cameron was epoch-defining. Partly this is because he played a double game throughout his time in office: in reality, he was part of an upper class, even aristocratic world; for the purposes of electability, he self-consciously tried to mute himself down to a humble upper middle class. He set about this the way anyone without an actual personality does: by making liberal reference to various cultural signifiers, something a country as class-obsessed as Britain picks up on keenly.Cameron was Downton Abbey meets Boden Man, and that anachronistic combination alone is indicative of how dated he already feels. Nothing makes 2010 feel longer ago than reading about Cameron’s television boxset collection the year he moved into 10 Downing Street, details of which were proudly released to the press at the time (24, Desperate Housewives). Sure, anyone’s TV preferences from six years ago would sound anachronistic, but I can’t think of another politician who has appropriated so much and so shamelessly, from Angry Birds to Lana Del Rey to Game Of Thrones. Cameron thought the way to prove his modernity was to be a person composed of things, as opposed to a politician driven by convictions. A former PR man, he always seemed more brand than prime minister. And when Cameron went down, he took a whole load of those cultural signifiers with him.Most obviously, there’s the Bullingdon Club. Last week it was reported that the Buller, as literally no one now calls it, had dwindled in membership from 30 to two people. It seems that Cameron’s brief involvement managed to do what two centuries of a reputation for extreme privilege and vandalism failed to achieve, and embarrassed the club into near nonexistence.Don’t blame the fashion world for the cult of skinny – even Roald Dahl plays his part | Hadley Freeman Eton, too, isn’t looking so hot. An Old Etonian once explained to me that what the school gave its students was manners and confidence. But when its most high-profile graduate referendummed himself into political oblivion, this latter quality seemed diminished. Boris Johnson’s appointment as foreign secretary was greeted as a global joke, while Tom Hiddleston, who acts for a living, couldn’t even convince the public he was in an actual relationship with Taylor Swift. Recent photographs of current Etonians hanging out with Vladimir Putin suggest that the old confidence is returning, but for a moment it looked as if Cameron broke Eton.These were David Cameron’s aristocratic signifiers, the ones he didn’t overtly brag about – and if there’s one thing we know about the aristocracy, it’s that it always survives. Instead, it is all the upper-middle-class stuff, which he clunkingly dropped into the public sphere to prove his aspirational-but-relatable realness, that he has ruined by association: the kitchen suppers, the Sunday lunches in gastropubs, the summer breaks in Cornwall, the posh Orlebar Brown swimming trunks.It is quite something to see how quickly the political waters have closed over Cameron’s head since his departure, as the Tories rewind to their pre-Cameron Euroscepticism and enthusiasm for grammar schools. Six years he was in power, and already he feels like the politician who was never there. Farewell then, David Cameron. Enjoy those kitchen suppers, whatever they were.
