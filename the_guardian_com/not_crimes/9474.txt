Nearly three-quarters of butterfly species which breed in the UK have seen their numbers decline over a decade, according to the biggest ever survey of the colourful insects. The data published on Wednesday by Butterfly Conservation also shows more than half have seen their distribution decrease.Richard Fox, lead author of the study by Butterfly Conservation and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said their results were "significant, worrying and depressing" because it included not just rare species but some of the most common household names like small tortoiseshell, the small heath and the wall."Butterflies are the 'canaries in the coalmine' for our environment and this new assessment shows they are in a poor state in 21st-century Britain," said Fox. "Despite grand promises by politicians, rare and common species of butterfly continue to decline in our countryside and towns as a result of farming, forestry and building practices that are hostile to our native wildlife."He added: "It's also depressing: we have just gone through a decade which has had the highest levels of public awareness about wildlife and conservation and effort and public money gone into the landscape for wildlife: in that context it's pretty bad news."The high brown fritillary has seen numbers fall by more than two thirds (69%) in the past 10 years, while duke of burgundy populations have declined by 46%. Both species have seen their distributions reduced.The common garden species the small tortoiseshell has also seen major declines in numbers of almost two thirds (64%) in the past decade.Meanwhile, the peacock, comma, speckled wood and ringlet butterflies have continued to spread north rapidly in response to climate change, Butterfly Conservation said.The survey did show, however, dramatic recoveries in a few rare species, including the large blue – reintroduced in the 1980s after becoming extinct in this country – which is now expanding its population and range, and the heath fritillary, which has been brought back from the brink of extinction.The reason for the disparity was likely to be that recovery programmes for individual butterfly species were intense and very focused, sometimes on as few as two locations, whereas most general environmental improvements schemes were much broader and less targeted. In particular, the entry level scheme funded by EU farming subsidies was too open to farmers to decide what improvements to make, without necessarily good evidence they were the most beneficial changes, said Fox.Although results of the latest survey cannot be directly compared with historic records, "there is no sign there has been declines of these kind of magnitudes before the 1950s – it really ties in with agricultural intensification," said Fox.The research, which analysed the distribution and numbers of 59 species of butterflies which regularly breed in the UK, found some species, such as the high brown fritillary and the duke of burgundy butterflies, have seen declines which have put them at risk of becoming extinct in the UK. A 10-year population trend was calculated from data collected by thousands of members of the public between 1995 and 2009.Butterflies are considered a key way to track the fabric of biodiversity which supports life on Earth. Records of how widely different butterfly species are dispersed go back to the 1600s – making them probably the longest running indicator of the variety of life on the planet.The butterfly survey follows reports last week that a 40-year record of 19 different UK species of farmland birds – another key indicator of biodiversity – reached a record low last year and overall numbers have fallen by more than half in those four decades.The declines follow drastic cuts in spending by the environment department, Defra, and the prospect that regulations to protect wildlife are to be reviewed and watered-down after the Chancellor, George Osborne, suggested that "gold-plating" of such protections was holding back economic development in his autumn statement.Dr Martin Warren, Butterfly Conservation's chief executive, said: "We now have firm evidence that targeted effort can reverse the decline of threatened butterflies, so it is especially sad that these hard-fought gains have been put in jeopardy due to government cutbacks in funding. Wildlife recovery needs more not less funding if we are to halt the loss of biodiversity and create a healthy environment for us all to live in."
