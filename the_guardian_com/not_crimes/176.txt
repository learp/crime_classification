As I travelled through South Lancashire yesterday there was no snow till I came near to Manchester, and then only a very slight covering. But the frost had spoiled the ploughman's chance, and the teams were employed leading manure, and where anyone could be spared for the work the hedges were being attended to. A few rooks alone were to be seen on the long reaches of level land, where plovers were so busy on Saturday, and where in the furrow behind the ploughman's heel an endless succession of gulls dropped as he stepped on. They have all, no doubt, crossed to the coast, where as the tide recedes they will find plenty of food, and need fear no trouble from frost. Some snow buntings were seen a few days ago on the high moorland between Buxton and Macclesfield. Since then this part of the country has been covered with a mantle of snow, and these little strangers will find themselves with more familiar surroundings. By nightfall yesterday there had been a considerable fall in the temperature, and this morning there was every sign of intenser frost. The birds about the house seem to have lost all fear. The robin will willingly come through the open door or window if it sees an opportunity for a meal. As I write the fog is becoming dense, and should it continue to-morrow then is the time for a country walk, as all animals and birds are under its influence, tame and easy of approach.
