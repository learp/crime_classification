Stephin Merritt, AKA the frontman of The Magnetic Fields, is the only conceptual artist you might sing along to. A writer who works best when he tethers his melodic gifts and wit to a strongly thematic collection, he has notably made albums of distorted rock (Distortion, 2008), and – his signature work – an exercise in the love song form (69 Love Songs, 1996). Last Friday, he released 50 Song Memoir, in which he presents a three-minute composition for each year he’s been alive.The album has a disarming wit and frankness. It covers early bouts of petit mal epilepsy (1992 Weird Diseases) and life in a low-rent ménage (1993 Me and Fred and Dave and Ted). 1973 finds one of his mother’s boyfriends setting a lyric he writes to music. “To impress my mother,” Merritt drawls, “He stole my song …” By 2002 Be True To Your Bar, he’s dividing his days into eight-hour shifts: writing in a cafe for the first eight, “booze and beefcake” for the next eight and then, finally, sleep.This new work finds Merritt joining a movement towards a new type of confessional song. For the singer-songwriter, raw feelings are no longer necessarily couched in the poetry of a number, like, say, Joni Mitchell’s A Case Of You. Instead, the present mood draws strength from its transparency, its forensic eye for detail. Sufjan Stevens’ All Of Me Wants All Of You from 2015 gets the mood well, when the singer paints a modern domestic scene: “You checked your texts while I masturbated.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Karl Ove Knausgaard: the shame of writing about myself The casual release of personal material is a feature of our social media behavior, but in this context the use of such detail can force an artistic breakthrough. Much like the writer Karl Ove Knausgaard, about 10 years ago, songwriters began to see the motions of everyday life as something worth exploring in detail as an exercise in exorcising demons or exploring dark corners.Working with a personal story can also offer a way to impose some kind of limit on personal circumstances. “Closure” is the TV term, but when rapper Angel Haze’s Cleaning Out My Closet recounted in stomach-churning detail her story of childhood sexual abuse, it equipped her to move on: “To grow, you’ve got to look at your root,” she sang. In country music, Margo Price has lately updated the booze/jail tropes of “outlaw country”, owning a traditionally male space with her own story. In Weekender she talked about how bereavement and alcohol landed her in Davidson County jail with a cellmate who “beat her boyfriend up while high on crack cocaine”.The confessional mode walks a tightrope between art and life – the more raggedly it presents itself, the more “true” it is sometimes thought to be. A knowing artist like Father John Misty can have a lot of fun upending those expectations. On the surface, his new song Leaving LA is a 13-minute splurge of memories, wry music critique and mother issues (or, as he sings: “A 10-verse chorus-less diatribe”). Really, though, it only reconfirms his vulpine lyric grace. And does his much-professed “mask” make it any less true?

Grant has written a song about discovering he was HIV-positive (“Doc ain’t looking at me, he says I’ve got the disease,” he sings in 2012’s Ernest Borgnine. “Now what did you expect? You spent your life on your knees …”). The song is certainly true. And it’s clearly more interesting for not being some bereft lament, but eerie and tuneful.The genius of the new confessional is often in the detail. Interestingly, it can also derive from the manner in which detail helps articulate absence. In Magneto on Nick Cave’s devastating 2016 album The Skeleton Tree, we hear about the singer vomiting in the bathroom sink, see him lost in thought in the supermarket queue, while around him plays music of an intensely vibrating melancholy. The album crackles with unease. What is never mentioned directly is the unspeakable event which prompted all this – the death in July 2015 of Cave’s 15-year-old son, Arthur.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest In January, Mount Eerie’s Phil Elverum struck directly at the heart of personal songwriting. In his composition Real Death he addressed the passing last year at 35 of his wife Genevieve, from pancreatic cancer, singing that real death, a sickening absence, is “not for turning into art”. What he does instead is create a more methodical record looking around their family home, feeling his wife’s loss. He recalls signing for a package since her death – a backpack, ordered for their daughter by his wife for first days of school she must have know she wouldn’t see. The moment is almost unbearable. Artistically, though, the confession proves transcendent. In the middle of tragedy, questioning everything, Elverum has against the worst odds found evidence of continuing life.The Magnetic Fields’ 50 Song Memoir is out on 10 March Nonesuch Records; Mount Eerie’s A Crow Looked At Me is out on 24 March via PW Elverum & Sun
