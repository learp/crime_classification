The first to make her entrance was Danica May Camacho of the Philippines, who was welcomed into the world as its 7 billionth occupant. Then came Nargis of India, Muthumali of Sri Lanka and Peter, born at St Thomas's hospital in London, each claiming to be the 7 billionth newborn.In truth, there could be half a million claimants to the title. The United Nations had designated 31 October as the day when the world's population could hit 7 billion. At current rates of population growth, that works out as about half a million babies born each day.By the time Danica arrived at a government hospital in Manila – early, technically, as she was born two minutes before midnight, Philippines time – UN officials were on hand to welcome her with a small cake. There was also money for a scholarship, from well-wishers, and to open a small shop. The country's health officials said they hoped Danica's birth would help the public focus on development needs; the country is the world's 12th most populous."She looks so lovely," her mother, Camille Dalura, was quoted as saying. "I can't believe she is the 7 billionth."She wasn't for very long. As the day wore on, a line of other newborns appeared, each welcomed by officials who declared them to be the 7 billionth. At a rural clinic in Uttar Pradesh, officials announced the arrival of Nargis Yadav. India's health minister said the milestone was not cause for celebration. The country is due to overtake China as the world's most populous in about 15 years. "We shouldn't be celebrating," Ghulam Nabi Azad told the Times of India. "For us a matter of joy will be when the population stabilises."
