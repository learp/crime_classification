‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù has been the question on our readers‚Äô lips - via tweets - when they heard that The Da Vinci Code is to be republished in a ‚ÄúYA edition‚Äù. The book, to be published in September, will precede the film release of another Brown title, Inferno, in UK cinemas in October. But what is there in The Da Vinci Code which is inaccessible to teenager readers? Is Brown going to get rid of the sex scenes (no shortage of those in YA fiction)? The violence (I can‚Äôt remember any)? Religion? Are any other contemporary writers planning to ‚Äútranslate‚Äù themselves to younger readers?Emma Maree (@EMaree)@GdnChildrensBks I'm an adult now, but I read the original when I was 12 so inner-teen-me is raging.May 18, 2016Aisha Bushby (@aishabushby)@_sectumsemprah @GdnChildrensBks I just said the same thing. I read it aged 12/13.May 18, 2016Jack Adams (@Jack_R_Adams)@GdnChildrensBks read it when I was 12 and it wasn't very complicatedMay 18, 2016Skeens (@readwatchshare)@GdnChildrensBks I read that book fine a couple of years ago and I'm still a teen. Don't insult our intelligence.May 18, 2016Patrick Sproull (@Grumblenook)@GdnChildrensBks I read the original when I was 14. Didn't exactly struggle.May 18, 2016I was also 12 when I read the Da Vinci Code. The book gripped me entirely. To be honest, it probably wouldn‚Äôt have hooked me in as much were I reading it later.Brown‚Äôs novel did two crucial things for me at the age when I started thinking hard about who I was and what was important to me.Firstly, it helped me take religion as a story rather than the story. Influenced by my religious grandmother and school, I collected icons as a child and was all into bells and smells. At 12, I developed ideas about gender. Feminism and religion, in my teen mind, contradicted each other. And Brown came just at the right time, with his theory of an anti-feminist conspiracy of the Church in having erased Magdalene‚Äôs role in Jesus‚Äôs and Christianity‚Äôs lives. The protests that ensued in the Catholic and the Christian Orthodox Churches only confirmed my new discovery that, alongside important values, religion held a lot of‚Ä¶ myths.Secondly, the book got me into thinking about art. While reading The Da Vinci Code, I stared at my dad‚Äôs book of reproductions of Leonardo‚Äôs paintings for hours. Visual art has since become a big part of my identity.So, if the book made me think about some of my most important values, I guess I... got it? And so did my cousin, aged 13, who read three other Dan Brown books afterwards, and, it seems, so did many other teens. If anything, I wonder whether a very large proportion of the novel‚Äôs readers were indeed teens, helping it to reach its sales figures of more than 200 million copies in 44 languages.But the outrage at this publishing decision is not just about patronising teenagers. It‚Äôs also about insulting a fiction genre. Holly Bourne, author of bestselling YA titles Soulmates, The Manifesto On How To Be Interesting and Am I Normal Yet?, protested that the rewriting of The Da Vinci Code implies that:Holly Bourne (@holly_bourneYA)YA authors' writing process: We write adult books and then edit out all the hard bits so the ickle teens can understands themMay 18, 2016Holly Bourne (@holly_bourneYA)DAMN YOU DAN, YOU'VE BLOWN OUR COVERMay 18, 2016So why is Dan Brown re-writing The Da Vinci Code for YA audience, cough cough, market? The answer is, most probably, money. GdnChildrensBooks (@GdnChildrensBks)Dan Brown to release "YA version" of the Da Vinci Code. Teens - are you feeling pleased or patronised by this news?May 18, 2016Aisha Bushby (@aishabushby)@GdnChildrensBks I think it patronises readers as well as the YA genre. Suggests YA is simplified fiction when I disagree entirely.May 18, 2016Rachel (@_sectumsemprah)@aishabushby @GdnChildrensBks YA can be more complex than adult fiction at times so this dumbed down version is pretty insulting I thinkMay 18, 2016Aisha Bushby (@aishabushby)@_sectumsemprah @GdnChildrensBks Completely agree. It's just missing the whole point of what YA fiction is!May 18, 2016Cat Anderson (@catamongpages)@GdnChildrensBks My 1st response was Why? YA more than capable of picking up 'adult' fiction. Patronised. #bandwagonMay 18, 2016Gemma Wilson (@gingelightning)@GdnChildrensBks given that I managed to read it when I was a teenager, I have to ask 'why?' üí∞May 18, 2016Michelle (@bookclubforum)@GdnChildrensBks I think the over-riding feeling seems to be 'why'?May 18, 2016LibraryJunky (@LibraryJunky)@GdnChildrensBks flat out insultingMay 18, 2016Dots (@fizzandnonsense)@GdnChildrensBks Somebody doesn't understand what YA is. It is not dumbed down adult fiction. It is fiction of special interest to YAs.May 18, 2016Lyndon Marquis (@LyndonMarquis)@bartsbooks @GdnChildrensBks Baffled at the notion that anything by DB needs redrafting for YAs...May 18, 2016‡ΩÄ‡ºç‡º®‡Ωá ‡ºã‡ºç‡ºã‡Ω†‡ºç‡Ω¶‡Ωñ‡Ωá‡Ω† (@chthonicionic)@neillcameron @GdnChildrensBks I think he's going to improve the grammar and writing styleMay 18, 2016SF Said (@whatSFSaid)Given how great children's books are right now, the YA Da Vinci Code must surely be WAY BETTER WRITTEN than the original!!!@GdnChildrensBksMay 18, 2016
