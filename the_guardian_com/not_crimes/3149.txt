The Revenant cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki won the top honor at the 30th annual American Society of Cinematographers Awards on Sunday night for his acclaimed work on Alejandro G Iñárritu’s award-winning survival thriller. It marked his fifth triumph in the feature film category at the ASC awards, following wins for Children of Men, The Tree of Life, Gravity and Birdman.The tracking shot: film-making magic - or stylistic self-indulgence? Lubezki addressed the “brutal conditions” of making The Revenant in his acceptance speech at the Century City event. “From my perspective, it was an amazing experience,” he said. “I think the most important thing was to have Alejandro – his passion, his incredibly energy. I think that’s what I’m going to remember most about the film. I share a big chunk of this award with him for taking me on this incredible journey and for being a great teacher and friend.”Statistically, the ASC awards don’t serve as a strong indicator for who will win the equivalent best cinematography Oscar at the Academy Awards: in the organization’s 30-year history, only 12 winners of the top theatrical prize have gone on to claim that honor. Still, Lubezki is largely considered a certainty to collect his third Oscar at this year’s ceremony for his work on the gruelling shoot. He previously won for Gravity and Birdman.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The evening’s other major theatrical honor, the Spotlight Award, which recognizes smaller films, resulted in a tie between Adam Arkapaw (Macbeth) and Mátyás Erdély (Son of Saul).In his acceptance speech, Erdély made a passionate plea for the importance of shooting on film as opposed to digitally. Director defends The Revenant after shoot branded a 'living hell' “We had a very limited, limited budget but our ambitions were great,” he said on stage of the Holocaust drama, which is up for the best foreign language film Oscar. “We shot on film and finished photo-chemically because we feel that is the most immersive experience a viewer can get. Cinematographers, this is our responsibility to keep film alive as an option – not just for us but for future generations.”John Toll received the night’s longest standing ovation upon collecting the ASC’s Lifetime Achievement Award. The veteran cinematographer and two-time Oscar winner, best known for his work on Braveheart, The Thin Red Line and Legends of the Fall, earned laughs and applause when he said: “We couldn’t do what we do if we weren’t just a little crazy.”Ridley Scott wasn’t present to collect the Governor’s Award from presenter Geena Davis, who worked with the director on Thelma and Louise. She fondly referred to Scott as “the only person I’ve been willing to drive off a cliff for”.Below is the complete list of Sunday’s ASC Award winners:Theatrical Motion PictureEmmanuel Lubezki, The RevenantSpotlight Award(tie)Adam Arkapaw, MacbethMátyás Erdély, Son of SaulEpisode Of A Regular SeriesVanja Černjul, Marco Polo, The Fourth StepTelevision Movie, Miniseries or PilotPierre Gill, Casanova pilot
