A bipartisan deal on a pared-back renewable energy target has been struck after the Coalition ditched plans for two-yearly reviews.The government on Monday backed down on plans to impose the reviews that had threatened to derail an in-principle agreement to slash the 2020 target from 41,000 gigawatt hours to 33,000GWh. The government-funded Clean Energy Regulator will monitor progress towards the target and cost of the scheme in a compromise with Labor that aims to return certainty to the sector.Labor’s environment spokesman says the deal restores industry confidence that Tony Abbott had “recklessly” jeopardised. “This has been a very, very sorry state of affairs for the last 12 months,” Mark Butler said on Monday. He said the prime minister’s “reckless attack” on the industry had brought it to the brink of collapse and stalled development.The environment minister, Greg Hunt, and industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, met with Butler in Melbourne on Monday morning.An in-principle deal to slash the target from 41,000GWh to 33,000GWh stalled last week when Labor and the clean energy industry refused to back any proposal that included the reviews.The sector’s peak body, the Clean Energy Council, says the latest move clears the final major stumbling block and should enable a deal to be reached. “It’s been a tough 15 months, but this development will be a huge weight off the shoulders of the 20,000 people working in the industry,” the chief executive, Kane Thornton, said. The government had been trying to slash the RET after a review last year found the legislated 41,000GWh could overreach the policy goal of 20% of all energy coming from renewables by 2020. While Labor opposes the government’s push for wood waste burning as a renewable source in the agreement, it’s not expected to be a deal breaker.
