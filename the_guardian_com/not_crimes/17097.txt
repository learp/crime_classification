The story takes place in a land called Erilea. The main character is an eighteen-year-old girl named Celaena Sardothien. She was an assassin, the best of her kind, until she made a fatal mistake and got caught. She was sent to serve a life sentence in the salt mines in Endovier, but after one year of hard labour there a young prince comes and offers her a deal that can save her: he offers her freedom, but she must win a competition that his father holds. In this competition she will fight against the best assassins and thieves in the land. The winner will serve the king for four years and afterwards the winner will be free. Celeana accepts this offer and soon she finds herself training in the king’s castle, but her life is threatened as someone starts to kill the other champions.What I liked the most about this book was the character of Celeana, she is strong, independent and sarcastic. She fights for what she wants, she looks like nothing can scare her and like she doesn’t care, but deep down she cares, just only about those she loves. The other thing that I really enjoyed was the world. It is set in a medieval time and even though I haven’t read many books that take place in this time period I loved it. The world is huge and the story has so many aspects, and together it creates a perfect world. The author did a great job when writing this book and I just loved her writing style. Once I started reading this book I couldn’t stop and I felt like I lived in that world throughout the whole story. I think this book is great for people who love fantasy and also enjoy historical fantasy. Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop
