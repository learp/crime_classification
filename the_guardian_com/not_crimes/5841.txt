This week, hundreds of young companies and artists head to the Edinburgh fringe, full of excitement and hope. Many will be graduate companies emerging from the cocoon of college with their first piece of work; some will be returning for a second or third time, hoping that against the odds and in spite of spiralling costs this will be the year that puts them on the radar and helps them make those all-important industry contacts.For the fringe in August is where the industry comes looking for new talent. A substantial number of theatres across the UK will have teams scouring the fringe looking for what they hope will be the next big thing. I know of one who will have at least 30 people coming and going over the festival’s duration.Edinburgh festival 2016: what to see and where to go British theatre is obsessed with the young and emerging talent, and in Edinburgh that obsession is magnified. Everyone is looking for the companies or artists they hadn’t heard of who they can put into artist development schemes, joining the hordes of young artists they put in the schemes after the last Edinburgh and the one before that. At its best, artist development is terrific, providing opportunities and genuine benefits for early-career artists; at it’s worst, it can be like butterfly collecting, and just as cruel.That’s because too many artist-development schemes are not designed to support ambition and scale and so they don’t help artists develop sustainable careers in the industry. It means that theatres are always on the hunt for new talent rather than investing in older or more established artists looking to make more ambitious work. It comes down to economics: young artists are cheap, and often pretty pliable, grateful for any scraps thrown their way.But for these young artists to become artists or companies who still have a career 10 or 20 years hence and who can support families and work on a far bigger scale requires real investment. With young artists you might be able to get three or four – or more – individuals or companies in development for the price of one company trying to create bigger, bolder work. It means companies and individuals are still emerging well into their 30s. Or they find themselves and their work increasingly ignored in favour of the next big thing.Earlier this year at All Tomorrow’s Theatre, an event organised by Battersea Arts Centre and Camden People’s Theatre, the performance and film-maker Paula Varjack spoke eloquently of being suspended in an emergent state for years, after she took her first steps in the industry. Where, she asked, were the schemes open to those who had already had some support but needed more to upscale?      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Hoofing it in Edinburgh.

If you’ve already received some development you are almost marked out as having been tarnished. This obsession with the new extends to work made under development schemes, which often fails to ever find a slot in a theatre’s programme – something that playwrights have long been familiar with, since the rise of play development schemes in the late 1990s. These have led to a situation where it is possible to eke out a poverty-stricken living as an unproduced but constantly in-development playwright. Something similar is happening with the development of non-script based work, in which you can keep receiving tiny amounts of money for making a new piece, but seldom actually get a show programmed for a run in that theatre’s spaces. As Varjack pointed out: “As soon as you’ve made the baby, somebody from the venue is asking you when you are going to make the next one, which makes me want to ask, ‘Don’t you even want to hold this one?’”Of course, not all theatres and venues behave like this. Many are acutely conscious of the bottleneck at the start of the profession and have been thinking hard about what is the best way to offer support, when every year universities and colleges dispatch more graduates after pocketing their money for three years, saying: “Goodbye, you are now an artist.” It is as much up to these academic institutions to be honest about what their courses really deliver and to be responsible in ensuring their graduates have the knowledge to survive in the real world as it is for theatres to help those young theatre-makers who show talent.The poet Adrienne Rich once spoke eloquently about education not being something passively received but actively claimed, and it seems to me that is the same with artist development. Too often it is something that is done to artists by theatres, rather than something in which they are actively involved.New writing is a risk but it's one theatres must take All artist-development schemes beg the question why the theatre doesn’t just give the money to the artists and let them develop their work in the way that is best for them. But while Arts Council England is moving towards understanding the importance of funding individual artists, artist development is likely to be with us for a long time to come. As Annabel Turpin of ARC in Stockton has observed, one solution for theatres and venues would be to support fewer artists but offer them more money. But as she is fully aware, that means some talent will be overlooked, and it means that the gate-keeping around who does and who doesn’t access a career in the theatre industry is increased.I really don’t know what the solution is, but it’s a pressing problem and one that is likely to get worse if recession beckons and government finances lead to more cuts to arts funding. For those heading to Edinburgh this year with such optimism, hoping this will be the year when they get picked up for development, it’s wise to be careful about exactly what you wish for. An opportunity is only a real opportunity if it offers genuine support and the chance to develop as an artist over time and sustain a career.
