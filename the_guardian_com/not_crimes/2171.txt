 A triumphant mix of wit and warmthI couldn’t agree more with the Telegraph Books of the Year reviewer. Even though there isn’t much to talk about with a mixture of heart-tickling reads all in one book, I still have much to appreciate. Saying this book was funny would be an understatement. Saying this collection of short stories was the best for children in 2016 would be obvious. Even though I tend to read YA novels, saying I don’t really care about children’s books would now be a lie after experiencing an hour of laughter. I am a David Walliams fan. Reading each and every one of his books just takes me into another world, taking me into a dream of chortling with Sofa Sofia, Earnest Dribbling Drew, a boy whose drool gets him into trouble; and Blubbering Bertha, a girl who bawls and tells terrible tales.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I would truly recommend this book to whoever is in for a laugh – whatever age you are. A positively gruesome book! 10/10. For 10 of the world’s worst children.Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop
