Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.This week’s question: I’m going to a first holy communion party for my eight-year-old niece in Ireland. I’m told I have to put €50 in an envelope, and that some kids “earn” €1,000. I don’t want to be seen as tightwad auntie, but must I do this? What do the kids do with all that money?Do you have a problem readers could solve?
