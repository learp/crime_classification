The most beautiful libraries in America – in pictures The New York Public Library reopened its Rose main reading room for the first time in two years on Wednesday 5 October, allowing library visiters to see the results of a $12m upgrade of both the Rose reading room and the Bill Blass public catalog room at the Stephen A Schwarzman Building.
