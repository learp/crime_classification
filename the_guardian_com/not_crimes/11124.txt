Continuing my Pilgrim’s Progress clockwise tour of hillocks in Lakeland, as started four weeks ago and aborted in Buttermere through fatigue, I recently resumed the trail again. My original plan, intended for leg-strengthening following my hip revision operation, was meant to take only a day. No matter; upwards and onwards.So on I drove into the Jaws of Borrowdale, and up Castle Crag with its quarried summit I slogged, after falling into the beck from the stepping stones, despite my trekking poles. To be rewarded by Derwentwater’s panorama stretching out for three wooded and be-cragged miles below, alive with woodpeckers, badgers, roe deer and red squirrels.Shortly afterwards I arrived in Keswick’s teeming streets, then set off to view these from Latrigg’s summit overhead. Although I took the easy way, driving up the potholed road past the Italianate mansion of Underscar Manor, my final climb on foot was up slopes where sailplanes are launched. This heart-thumping ascent was followed, via the A66, up steps next to Gowbarrow Crag near where Wordsworth saw his daffodils, with shining Ullswater nearby. After driving up Kirkstone Pass, I descended the Struggle with its whiff of burning brake pads, which plummets down to Ambleside. Grasmere came next, followed by Alcock Tarn cupped high above the Swan Hotel.My final port of call? Langdale’s Copt Howe crag, where outdoor centre students roped together were scaling a buttress of crystalline rock, though I bypassed them on fellside turf as green as Lord’s cricket ground. My orthopaedic surgeon, Mr Kuntal Patel, would surely have approved, his handiwork put to the test. I returned – feet still damp – through Chapel Stile and Ambleside back to Bowness-on-Windermere, from where I first embarked a month ago.
