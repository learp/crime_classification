When I founded Tilted Axis Press in 2015, I made a few broad commitments: to focus on translations from Asian languages, to operate without unpaid interns, to get a tattoo of our logo. These were choices that made some people wince or shake their heads at my naive idealism, but they made sense to me.One decision was a little different – that at least 50% of our list be by women. While my day job translating Korean literature has been woman-centric so far, this was always more by luck than judgment. In South Korea, possibly uniquely, women almost always outnumber men on the top prize shortlists, and the idea of a Korean Baileys prize would be seen as outmoded. I’d never been aware of the gender biases in publishing.I’d never crunched the numbers. So it was something of a shock to discover Joanna Walsh’s #readwomen campaign. After seeing how she highlighted the quality of the writing that was out there, and the pervasive nature of gender discrimination which meant I’d either never heard of these fantastic books, or else been discouraged from reading them because their marketing gave no clue to their excellence, a 50% target for Tilted Axis seemed to be the least I could do.Lionel Shriver rubbishes plans for dedicated Year of Publishing Women So when Kamila Shamsie called for a Year of Publishing Women, I was proud and excited to sign Tilted Axis up. While it’s vital that publishing women not be seen as a gimmick or a one-time thing, Shamsie’s insistence that “the YPW doesn’t end up looking like the year of publishing young, straight, white, middle-class metropolitan women” was welcome. It’s reminder that if the publishing industry is serious about improving diversity, there needs to be at least a basic awareness of the way gender intersects with race, class, language, and a host of other issues. For me, the biggest problem with Lionel Shriver’s dismissive, blinkered comments is her failure to acknowledge that as a white American, writing in English, living in London, holding an MFA from Columbia, she is in an extremely privileged minority.If it really was just a case of “let’s publish more women – any women, purely because they’re women”, that would indeed be as simplistic and unhelpful as Shriver suggests. But of course it’s not. It’s about recognising the various biases, often near-invisible, that mean writing by women is less likely to make it to publication, and, when it does, to be accorded the same reception as similar work by men – both the extent and the nature of the coverage. Translated fiction by women must stop being a minority in a minority  These biases are only exacerbated when the conversation turns to translation. When a UK publisher is asked what they look for in a book, one of the most depressingly common answers is “universal themes”; such as a Norwegian man chopping wood, or a university professor having a midlife crisis. Outside Europe? Editors’ preference for writing they can identify with weights the scales towards writers in English, who have had access to a certain type and level of education – and who produce books with a familiar style and form, along with a little exotic colour. In other words, books from the elite – just as the majority of those who publish, and are published, in the UK are from this country’s elite. And almost everywhere, the elite is disproportionately male. Male writers are more likely to receive critical attention. Women are more likely to win prizes if their central characters are male. You’d have to be wilfully blinkered not to recognise this.Then there are the various ways in which writing by women is dismissed as less than “proper” literature – it’s too personal, too trivial, too sensational. In June, we launch our list with Panty, a darkly surreal, stylistically daring novel by Sangeeta Bandyopadhyay, translated by Arunava Sinha. Bandyopadhyay has been called “the woman who reintroduced hardcore sexuality to Bengali literature”. The (male) establishment has tried to dismiss her work by labelling it as erotica, but the sex scenes are an integral part of the novel, with exactly the same transgressive function as her use of chronology and narrative voice.I do understand Shriver’s discomfort with the idea of women receiving special treatment – it’s hard enough for us to make it to the top, without having doubts cast on whether we’re there on merit. Publishers have to be careful to ensure that our efforts to promote women’s writing make it clear that, rather than being some dreaded worthy cause, actively seeking work from under-represented groups is one of the most effective ways of giving publishing a much-needed shot in the arm. Establishments are conservative, and conservatism means more of the same; women writers’ outsider status can make for thrillingly original work. In November, Tilted Axis will publish a narrative poem from Indonesia, which explores a young girl’s abduction into the Indonesian interior with tactile artwork and a Braille translation, by poet and activist Khairani Barokka. Doesn’t that sound a bit more exciting than chopping wood?
