Pacts and pledges left in pieces the theme this week: think of a track and note it down below for next week’s playlist.Back in 2015 there was “promises and choices” rundown, you can find a list of all previous themes and songs picked and so ineligible for the series here.You have until 11pm on Monday 13 June to post your nomination and make your justification. Regular RR contributor chippiparai will then select from your recommendations.   Guardian contributor chippiparai 17 June 2016 4:16amNew Topic is Songs About Broken Promises. I was revisiting LOTR with a friend's son and we had neared the end of the first part where the Nine take off and this dialogue comes: 'Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,' said Gimli.'Or break it,' said Elrond.So I thought both sides of a topic should generate enough songs. Cheers.If you would like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions – and potentially blog about the process/selection for the Guardian – please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com with the subject line ‘RR guru’ or make yourself known in the comments.Here’s a reminder of the guidelines for RR:Tell us why it’s a worthy contender.Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of a song’s words.Provide a link to the song. We prefer YouTube, but Spotify or Soundcloud are fine.Listen to others people’s suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist.If you have a good theme, or if you’d like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.comThere’s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are “zedded”, at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of “zedded” (picked for a previous playlist so ineligible), “donds” and other strange words used by RR regulars.Many RR regulars also congregate at the ’Spill blog.
