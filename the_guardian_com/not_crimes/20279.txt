At least 22 pieces of Asian art at the National Gallery of Australia have questionable ownership history, with 11 pieces classed as highly problematic, an independent review has found.Of the 36 Asian art objects acquired by the NGA between 1968 and 2013 that were the subject of the investigation, only 12 have satisfactory provenance. Another two pieces need more investigation before their ownership history can be confirmed.National Gallery of Australia reveals $8m of art masterpieces – in pictures All pieces are genuine, but 22 have insufficient documentation to satisfy the reviewer, a former high court justice, Susan Crennan, of their ownership history.“Where provenance has been identified as highly problematic, this is because documentation recording a recent chain of ownership now appears dubious or because there is no certainty about when, and in what circumstances, an object was exported from its country of origin, or both,” Crennan’s report said.Crennan notes that “all objects were purchased in good faith” by the gallery.Fourteen of the 22 questionable objects were bought from the now discredited New York art dealership Art of the Past. The former owner of the dealership, Subhash Kapoor, is in jail in India awaiting trial over a multimillion-dollar looting scandal involving Indian antiquities.In September 2014 the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, returned an 11th century bronze statue called Dancing Shiva to India, a figurine the NGA had purchased in 2008 from Kapoor for $5.6m.Two other artefacts were also repatriated to India in 2014-15, including the second century Kushan Buddha, which the gallery bought in 2007 using funds offered by benefactor Roslyn Packer.Buddha statue found to have been stolen will be returned to India Both returned pieces were included in the review undertaken by Crennan, which was initiated in November 2014 after the revelations that Dancing Shiva may have been stolen from a temple in Tamil Nadu.All provenance histories of Asian art pieces will be made public on the NGA’s website, and representatives of the gallery have travelled to India to meet archaeological experts to examine local archives.“In establishing a framework for restitution of stolen property to the country of its origin, NGA has set a worthy example for other countries and institutions to follow,” the Indian high commissioner, Navdeep Suri, said.Director of the NGA, Gerard Vaughan, said the review gave the gallery the tools to ensure that looted antiquities were not kept on display.“The review provides a clear set of guidelines which the NGA can incorporate into its acquisition procedures and due diligence policies, and which the gallery can use in retrospectively assessing items already in the collection,” he said.The NGA is a signatory to the International Council of Museum’s code of ethics on acquisitions, which states that galleries must exercise due diligence to ensure their purchases have been looted.
