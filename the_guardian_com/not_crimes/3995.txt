A film about gangs set in the tough Brussels suburb where a jihadi cell planned the Paris terror attacks has been pulled from French cinemas.The distributors of Black, filmed in the Molenbeek area of the Belgian capital made notorious by the 13 November gunmen, told Agence France-Presse on Friday they were forced into the decision because so many cinemas were refusing to show it.It is the third film handling such sensitive subject matter to have run into trouble in France since the killings in which 130 people died.The move came as a Paris court overturned a decision not to allow anyone under 18 to see Salafistes, a controversial exposé of African radical Islam, which was an almost unheard of restriction on a documentary.Riots break out at cinema showing acclaimed teen street gang drama The distributors of Black had already been hit by a similar decision from the culture ministry to bar under-16s from seeing their Romeo and Juliet-style story of forbidden love between members of two rival gangs.A spokesman for Paname Distribution said: “Due to the reluctance of cinemas to show Black in the current climate, we took the decision to cancel its cinematic release.”Young people threw stones at police outside a multiplex in Brussels when the film was first screened there in November.Black was a hit in Belgium despite some cinemas refusing to show it after the violence and it being issued with an over-16 certificate that its makers condemned as unjust given the characters were mostly teenagers.But it has suffered the same fate as Made In France, a story of homegrown jihadis plotting to bomb Paris that eerily predicted November’s bloodshed, which was immediately withdrawn by its distributors in the aftermath of the attacks.A furious debate on freedom of speech in France erupted after Salafistes was given an 18 certificate last month.Claude Lanzmann, the director of the acclaimed Holocaust film Shoah, condemned the decision as “shameful censorship”, calling Salafistes “a genuine masterpiece, illuminating daily life under sharia law in a way that no book or ’expert’ on Islam ever has.”But judges overturned the decision on Thursday, allowing anyone over 16 to see it, in what its co-director François Margolin called a “major victory”.“They said that we were apologists for terrorism, that we were playing the jihadists’ game,” he told AFP. “But the judges agreed that we were doing exactly the opposite.”Black, which won an award at the Toronto film festival, centres on a turf war between a Moroccan street gang called 1080, the postcode for Molenbeek, and their “Black Bronx” rivals from Matongé on the other side of the Belgian capital.As well as Abdelhamid Abaaoud – named as the leader of the attacks on Paris – the run-down suburb was also home to two key suspects still on the run, Salah Abdeslam and Mohamed Abrini.Eleven people have been arrested and charged in Belgium in connection with the killings.Black, which had been due to hit screens on 19 March, will now be released online, Paname Distribution told AFP.
