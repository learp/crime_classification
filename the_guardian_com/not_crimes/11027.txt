The government’s proposal to leave tackling air pollution to local authorities alone is another sign that the Tories are intent on trashing the green agenda (Government passing the buck on air pollution, say campaigners, theguardian.com, 13 September). Air pollution is not only a local issue, it is a national health crisis causing 50,000 early deaths each year. Many of the most harmful pollutants have no respect for national or local borders. They are blown around our country and continent, with low-lying and coastal areas particularly at risk. We need a comprehensive approach to tackling this deadly problem which combines local measures with concerted efforts at the national and European level.Crucially, local authorities must have access to adequate funding from both the UK government and EU for measures to improve air quality such as low-emission zones, improved cycling infrastructure and cleaner buses and taxis. At a time when local councils are seeing their funding cut to the bone, additional support is needed to make the transition to cleaner towns and cities which will save billions of pounds in health costs in the long-term. The UK government must also ensure EU limits to curb pollution are tightened and properly enforced. The longer we wait to tackle this invisible killer, the more lives will be tragically cut short.Catherine Bearder Liberal Democrat MEP, Tom Brake Liberal Democrat MP and foreign affairs spokesperson, Kate Parminter Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson, Stephen Knight Liberal Democrat London assembly environment spokesperson, Councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson Liberal Democrat group leader, Local Government Association• The Global Apollo Programme (Letters, 16 September) is a wonderful concept, and truly a global priority. The task is formidable, but not impossible. At the risk of stimulating cries of “mission creep”, may I suggest an additional objective: to develop technologies that work at the required scale to extract greenhouse gases directly from the atmosphere, so solving the fundamental problem of there being too much carbon dioxide and methane “up there” right now.Dennis SherwoodExton, Rutland
