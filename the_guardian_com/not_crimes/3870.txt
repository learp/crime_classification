That’s what the Branford Boase award is all about, it celebrates the combined efforts of both the author and editor of each nominated children’s book.The award was set up in memory of author Henrietta Branford and editorial director Wendy Boase, who worked together on a number of Henrietta’s novels. Both Henrietta and Wendy died of cancer in 1999.Top writing tips for new children's authors from top editors The chair of the judges, Julia Eccleshare, said it’s been “an extraordinary year for debuts”, with five more books making the longlist compared to last year.The longlisted authors often go on to great things.
