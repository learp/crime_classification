Matt LeBlanc has signed a two-series deal with the BBC, which could be worth as much as £2m, to become the host of Top Gear when it returns in 2017.As the terms of the deal were hammered out with BBC Worldwide, the corporation’s commercial arm, the broadcaster will avoid new rules designed to name all on-air talent earning more than £150,000 a year.Although understood to have been signed after the departure of Chris Evans in July, the confirmation that Le Blanc has agreed to front the popular BBC2 motoring show for another two years will come as a fillip to the BBC after the loss of the Great British Bake Off earlier this month.BBC Studios boss: ‘We’re not looking for another Chris Evans on Top Gear’ The former Friends star, who is to start filming the next series of the car show in the coming weeks, will be joined by Chris Harris and Rory Reid, with regular appearances from Eddie Jordan, Sabine Schmitz and the Stig. BBC2’s channel editor, Patrick Holland, said: “I am thrilled that Matt LeBlanc is returning to Top Gear. He’s a huge talent whose love of cars is infectious. I can’t wait for the series to return to BBC2 next year.”In signing the deal, the BBC had to agree to schedule filming around Le Blanc’s commitments to the US sitcom Man With a Plan, which premieres on CBS next month.BBC Studios director Mark Linsey said: “Matt was hugely popular with Top Gear viewers last series with his humour, warmth and obvious passion for cars and for the show, so I couldn’t be more delighted that he’s agreed to come back and do more for us.”The confirmation of the deal prompted several pundits to suggest that the BBC had been prepared to throw more money at its most valuable show – sales of the Top Gear plus books, live shows and other merchandise nets the corporation more than £50m a year – following the departure of its most-watched hit in Bake Off.This was denied by the BBC, where a source said “Matt LeBlanc’s deal was done prior to the Bake Off announcement so any suggestion they are in any way linked is entirely false.”The motoring show can lay claim to being the most popular factual television programme in the world – complete with a Guinness Book of World Records entry – as it is watched by 350 million people in 214 territories.The 24th series of the show will air on BBC2 and globally next year with Clare Pizey as the executive producer and series editor Alex Renton.LeBlanc signed up for Top Gear following his former co-host Chris Evans’s departure. The radio DJ quit after one series, saying he gave it his best shot but it was “not enough”.He added that LeBlanc is the “captain” and should remain on the show and dismissed reports that the pair’s relationship had broken down amid flagging audience numbers and unfavourable reviews.Evans said: “For me, [LeBlanc] is the man. He is the captain Top Gear truly needs going forward, the perfect torso for the rest of TG’s limbs.“Not only does he eat, sleep, breathe and dream engines, propshafts and trail-braking, but the overwhelming quality that struck me about him is that he’s just such a pro.”Evans said working on the programme for a year had been a “dream” and “the Top Gear ship has been steadily re-floated” following the departure of previous hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond.
