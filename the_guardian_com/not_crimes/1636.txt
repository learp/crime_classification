Why do the English lie so much? The question arose in a puzzled letter to a travel site from a foreigner wondering how he could tell whether an American was being sincere. If someone says “We must have lunch,” or “You must come to see us in Washington”, do they actually mean this as a practical suggestion?Although this is difficult enough when dealing with Americans, in comparison with the English they are entirely straightforward. My experience is that an American who is not trying to sell you anything will tell the truth entirely as they see it. The English middle classes would regard such a policy as destructive of civilisation.Sweden is the ‘goodest’ country – according to the baddest of surveys | Andrew Brown It’s not that the English are particularly dishonest, even if they do lie all the time. Lying is, of course, perfectly OK when everyone knows what you really mean. “Don’t call us; we’ll call you” does not mean “We’ll call you”.What makes English lying so subtle and destructive is that “everyone” is not, in English, everyone. It is only the right people. English politeness means, in practice, that you should assume almost everything an upper-class English person says will be manipulative or insincere despite hardly any of it being literally untruthful.The former archbishop of York, John Habgood, an Etonian of painful earnestness, used to reply to crank letters with a stock phrase: “Thank you for your communication, which I will read with the attention it deserves.” I get the same kind of pleasure from that as I get from seeing a chess move or solving a programming problem.It’s not a coincidence that one of the classic novels about how to be an English gentleman is Beau Geste, in which the entire plot hinges on the moral necessity of lying. Honour demands all kinds of heroism and horrible deaths from the brothers, but it never asks them to tell the truth.This is how I was myself brought up and while I can be entirely insincere when I need to be – trust me on this – I do find it exhausting. It was a great relief to go to Sweden and find that people there don’t lie. At least they very seldom fool others if they are not also fooling themselves. I have learned that I am a Swede inside: I get on much better in cultures where people say what they mean, and I find exhausting the cognitive load required to know whether an English person is lying, so I tend to assume that they are lying all the time. This applies whether they are praising or blaming me but more usually, because of my temperament, when I am praised. I always feel around such a compliment the way I feel my folding bike, looking for the catch that will collapse the whole thing.This is a mistake. What makes English manners so peculiarly difficult is that you can never be entirely certain the person you are talking to is in fact lying. Sometimes they will be entirely sincere, even when it is not to their advantage to do so.Sometimes they will mean to be sincere, by saying something that you’re meant to understand is untrue, but fail, because you think they are telling the truth – and then the blame for their insincerity is entirely yours. And then you do, in fact, feel dreadful – at least I do. How could I be so brutishly insensitive as to believe them?But I don’t know that being a Swede like me is in fact morally superior to being a perfidious Anglo-Saxon. Consider that perfidy requires you to pay much more attention to the other person, and to work out all the time what they really mean.Isn’t this a moral good? Perhaps the English lie so much because they care so much more about the feelings of others than Swedes do? And perhaps we should have lunch some time to discuss this.
