There is a shop near where I live called Leila’s. It’s a very fine shop, carefully curated so that you always end up buying ingredients that go together. They harmonise. Not long ago, craving cool-climate flavours to match the weather, I bought rye bread, creme fraiche, a smoked mackerel and red onions for pickling.The shop piles wooden crates in its window, bulging with whatever is in season. I like to think I know my seasons pretty well, but somehow Leila is always one step ahead of me. On this visit, she reminded me it was time for wet walnuts.Wet walnuts are so fresh that they haven’t dried out yet. They are plump and delicious, and I love sitting around the table shelling them in an attempt to prise out the kernel entirely intact. They are also my favourite walnut to bake with: because they are so fresh they are sweet with a hint of spice. No bitterness at all.The next best thing is to bake with the first dry walnuts of the year, which is just now. Shell your own!Now, while I enjoy a classic bake, I am also a fan of re-interpreting the cakes of my childhood. With that in mind, this week I give you a classic French financier (so-called because they are baked in moulds resembling bars of gold) and a luxurious revamping of the Walnut Whip, a British cornershop favourite. I use a walnutty sponge as a base for the marshmallow – of which this recipe makes a little too much. So any that you have left over can be used in a warming cup of hot chocolate while you’re assembling these fiddly little guys.

Instead of baking them in financier moulds, use a mini cupcake tray greased with a little melted butter.2 For the marshmallow, have your electric mixer with the whisk attachment ready. Measure all the ingredients into the metal bowl of the mixer and put over a pan of boiling water (do not let the water touch the bottom of the bowl or it will cook the egg whites).3 Hand-whisk continuously until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is very warm to the touch. If using a sugar thermometer, whisk continuously for 2 minutes, or until it reads 70-75C – whichever comes first. Transfer the bowl to your electric mixer and whisk quickly until nearly stiff peaks form.4 Put the mixture in a piping bag with a large round nozzle. Pipe large blobs on to your cooled cakes, or use a spoon.5 To make the ganache, break the chocolate into small pieces and put in a heatproof bowl. Heat the cream until just bubbling, then pour it over the chocolate. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then stir until smooth. Drizzle over the walnut whips. Top with a walnut. Let them set for 15 minutes before serving.Claire Ptak is a pastry chef, author and food stylist and owns Violet Bakery in London.
