On 1 December 1948, the body of man was found on Somerton beach in Glenelg, just south of Adelaide in South Australia. The corpse – sitting against the sea wall, fully dressed with feet crossed – carried no identification. Later on, as police investigated the case, a scrap of paper was found sewn inside the man’s trouser pocket. The paper was torn from a New Zealand edition of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and carried on it the Persian words for “ended” or “finished”: Tamam Shud.Those words resonated through Australian culture – the case, never solved, became known as “the Tamam Shud case” – and 20 or so years later they made their way back to the country’s beaches, in the form of what might be the world’s only improvisational psychedelic surf band album. Tamam Shud’s first LP, 1969’s Evolution, recently reissued on vinyl by Anthology Records, is very much of its time: wide-eyed balladry sits alongside bass-heavy rock; the lyrics are, to be charitable, naive (“What is the time, Mr Strange? / Do you think it’s time for a change?”); the sleevenote is perfect, in that late-60s way (“The sound of the Shud is heavy. The vocal of the Shud is incidental”). It’s a classic curio,the kind lovers of psychedelia should devour. “We gave the drugs a shot,” says Lindsay Bjerre, the band’s guitarist, singer and songwriter, looking back to the days when they were bringing the summer of love to the Sydney suburbs. “To be honest, when we first tried some of these things, they were still legal anyway. Everyone thought LSD meant pounds, shillings and pence. But you can’t work if you’re doing that all the time. And we weren’t so deeply into it, because we were ocean guys. We were in the water and we loved our surfing.” One legend holds, irony of ironies, that Tamam Shud were late for a gig with the Beach Boys and the Easybeats, because they’d been surfing and got caught in a riptide.

We were a surfy band, but the rockers looked after us. Anyone gave us any grief, they got their lights punched out. They knocked one guy unconscious who was giving us grief.”That was before Tamam Shud became Tamam Shud. They’d started off as the Strangers, becoming the Four Strangers, and then the Sunsets, before donning paisley and growing facial hair to fit in with the hippy revolution.“The Strangers were a surf band, simply because we all surfed,” Bjerre says. “We were part of the Merewether Boardriders up in Newcastle [in New South Wales] and we used to surf between rehearsals.” As the Four Strangers, they put out a surf single – twangy guitar and all – called The Rip. “It was going to be called Bombura, but the Atlantics had a track called Bombura out before us, so we changed it.” As the Sunsets, they recorded an instrumental theme for surf documentary director Paul Witzig’s 1966 film A Life in the Sun. In 1967, when he made a film about Australia’s new wave of shortboard surfers, called The Hot Generation, he asked them to step in again. The Hot Generation, with its none-more-happening opening line of “Well, we belong to the hot generation”, became a minor garage-punk classic, but it was the link-up with Witzig that was to prove more significant.After years of playing three to five shows a week in pubs and hotels, the group had gone up to Queensland’s Gold Coast – “If you went to Queensland with New South Wales numberplates, you were a target for the police” – to play a residency at a club owned by the TV personality Digby Wolfe, in late 1966. Their surfing connections meant they were hearing stories about how the music scene was changing in California ahead of their contemporaries, and when they returned to Sydney after six weeks away to discover they seemed to have been dropped from the local music scene, they decided it was time to change.Their bass player, feeling that getting one job a fortnight wasn’t enough to make staying with the Sunsets worthwhile, quit. “I spotted this guy riding around on a motorbike, and it was Peter Barron,” Bjerre says. “I said to the guys, ‘Who’s that bloke with the long hair?’ ‘He’s one of the best surfers around here and he plays bass.’ He fit the bill.”Barron joined, insisted the band change its name, and then, as Bjerre puts it with a certain understatement, “it all became psychedelic and trippy. We changed the name, and everybody wanted to discover us. We were doing the universities, big old theatre jobs with light shows and Bob Dylan’s film running and Yoko Ono’s film running. It was a righthand turn from the pub gigs. The pubs were getting more conservative, and we were going the other way.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Watch the trailer for surf movie Evolution.Yet these longhaired rock musicians, living in a deeply conservative country, managed not to become the target of police harrassment, unlike plenty of their contemporaries. Bjerre puts that down to the surfing, meaning they didn’t look like obvious drug users. “We were always tanned. There were a lot of guys who had long hair and were pale and they looked a lot more drugged-out. They just didn’t look as healthy as us.”Then came the break. Witzig was working on a third film, Evolution, which was centred around a 17-year-old surfing prodigy called Wayne Lynch. Once again, he need a soundtrack. And once again he called Bjerre and his bandmates to supply it. This time, though, there were to be no peppy pop songs. Those songs that were included were to be of the new “progressive” style, but the rest of the music was made up on the spot.“The actual soundtrack to the movie was improvised. We slotted in the song as it was going along, but we just looked up at what was on the screen and played to the movie,” Bjerre says. Confusingly, though, that isn’t the album that came out as Evolution, though four songs that also feature in the movie appear. “We had a full hour left at the end of the recording time, and Paul said to us: ‘Why don’t you go in and use the hour yourselves?’ And that was the album – we did it in an hour. We set up, played and sang live, no overdubs. We only did it to hear what we sounded like. Then we heard it and thought, ‘Let’s lease it out.’ CBS pressed 10,000 and they sold very quickly and that was that. Now they sell for up to a thousand bucks. Crazy stuff.” Once the movie was out, Tamam Shud played their soundtrack live at screenings, decades before the live soundtrack became a regular part of cinematic life. “They paid well, and you didn’t have to play covers in the pub night after night,” Bjerre points out.There was to be a second album in 1970, the excruciatingly named Goolutionites and the Real People, then contributions to a third hit soundtrack – Alby Falzon’s surf movie Morning of the Earth (“We were never paid properly. It made a fortune but we got none of it”) – but by 1972, Tamam Shud were no more. There have been reunions – for an album in 1994, a nostalgia package tour in 2002, and a new Tamam Shud album earlier this year. But, as is so often the way, the history of the group is in dispute. Dannie Davidson, who drummed on Evolution, has a website in which he lists the ways he believes he has been written out of Tamam Shud history, literally and financially, while Bjerre suggests Davidson got fed up of him much earlier: “The drummer didn’t think Peter and I were professional enough. We were more interested in going surfing and sailing than making music.”Bjerre is 69 now, and thinks some of the Evolution album is “a little embarrassing”, though he likes most of it. But if he’s no longer a psychedelic warrior, he’s still committed to the waves. “I look on the internet to see where the waves are, and I go out there. I’ve got about 15 boards. But these days I have to pick my board. And I have to pick my surf.”Hang 10, Tamam Shud! • On 13 October 2016, the caption for the main image of this article was amended to correctly identify Lindsay Bjerre.• Evolution is out now on Anthology Recordings
