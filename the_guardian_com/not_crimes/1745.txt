A tricky topic hoping to unearth some gold from your record libraries this week – for more on what we’re looking for, read on ...Vinyl destination: who is actually buying records? RR regular Paul Hayes (who posts in the comments as Fuel) will select from your recommendations and produce the playlist, to be published on 12 January. He says:  I’m looking for songs specifically  released as 12” singles as well as remixes, extended versions, special disco versions, dub versions, and so on and on an’onnnn! I want versions that make a bad song good and a good song something extraordinary.Here is a list of all songs previously picked and therefore ineligible for the series. Our guru adds: “I’ll allow remixes of songs that have previously been listed for other themes in the RR series – if they are sufficiently different.”You have until 11pm on Monday 16 January to post your nomination and make your justification. If you want to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions – and potentially blog about the process/selection for the Guardian – please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com with the subject line “RR guru”, or make yourself known in the comments.Here’s a reminder of the guidelines for RR:Tell us why it’s a worthy contender.Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of a song’s words. If sharing links, make sure there is appropriate copyright permission.Listen to others people’s suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist.If you have a good theme, or if you’d like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.comThere’s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are “zedded”, at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of “zedded” (picked for a previous playlist so ineligible), “donds” and other strange words used by RR regulars.Many RR regulars also congregate at the ’Spill blog.
