Andy Murray has put John Inverdale in his place for saying the Scot was the first person to win two Olympic golds for tennis, as the BBC presenter made the latest in a string of on-air gaffes.Inverdale, interviewing Murray after he defeated Argentina’s Juan Martin Del Potro to claim his second Olympic gold, said: “You’re the first person ever to win two Olympic tennis gold medals. That’s an extraordinary feat, isn’t it?”But the Scot shot back: “Well, to defend the singles title ... I think Venus and Serena [Williams] have won about four each but hadn’t defended a singles title before.” John Inverdale apologises for X-rated comment on Cheltenham coverage He added: “I mean it’s obviously not an easy thing to do. I had to fight unbelievably hard to get it tonight as well. Yeah, I’ll enjoy this one.”Murray’s comment won praise on Twitter, including from Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon:Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon)Yet another reason to love Andy Murray... https://t.co/qWPaIIkNmxAugust 15, 2016Murray said earlier this year he had become a feminist after witnessing first-hand the “criticism and prejudice” his former coach Amelie Mauresmo has endured.The incident marked the end of a less than vintage weekend of presenting for Inverdale, who has also managed to get off-side with five-time Olympic medallist Sir Steve Redgrave, with whom he is co-presenting coverage of the rowing.Tension has been brewing between the pair, with Redgrave walking off the set live on-air on Thursday after pulling a face at Inverdale.The spat continued the following day when Redgrave appeared to deliberately shake a wet umbrella over Inverdale.After the second incident the BBC moved to deny that Redgrave and Inverdale do not see eye-to-eye, saying that any suggestion that there is an issue between the pair is “simply untrue”.

You’ll never be a Sharapova, so you have to be scrappy and fight.”This year Inverdale raised hackles on social media after he likened Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios to a “character from the Jungle Book”.It is not entirely clear what Inverdale meant by the comment about Kyrgios – the son of a Greek father and a Malaysian mother, who was born in Canberra.“I think the word is lumber. Nick Kyrgious lumbers off like a character from the Jungle Book,” said Inverdale as the player, beaten in straight sets by Murray, made his exit from Centre Court.Inverdale apologised after using the phrase “rose-cunted spectacles” in Radio 5 Live’s coverage of last year’s Cheltenham Festival, blaming a “slip of the tongue”.RioRun
