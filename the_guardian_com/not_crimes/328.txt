Microsoft is backtracking on its aggressive upgrade policy that has seen Windows 10 apparently installing or attempting to install without users’ permission leading to lawsuits and interrupted weather forecasts.Part of the frustration for users is the way Microsoft shoehorned Windows 10 into the Windows Update process of Windows 7 and later. At first Windows 10 only installed if a user requested it. Then it became an optional update, which would only be downloaded if users had configured Windows Update to install optional updates.Later it was upgraded to a recommended update, which meant many more had Windows 10 automatically downloaded and prompted to install. It was at this point that the dialogue box, which many simply dismissed using the red X in the corner, essentially locked users into a scheduled install.The red X didn’t cancel the process, as one might expect, but confirmed the scheduled install of Windows 10, leading some to find it unexpectedly installing while attempting to do something else.Terry Myerson, executive vice president for Windows said: “This week we’ll launch a new upgrade experience for millions of PCs around the world.“The new experience has clearer options to upgrade now, choose a time, or decline the free offer. If the red X is selected on this new dialogue, it will dismiss the dialog box and we will notify the device again in a few days.”The move comes after Microsoft was landed with a bill for $10,000 in compensation after a reportedly unauthorised Windows 10 install failed, crippling a computer used to run a travel agency by Teri Goldstein in Sausalito, California.Goldstein is just one of a string of users angered by Microsoft’s forceful pushing of Windows 10 during its free upgrade period, which is due to expire on 29 July.Complaints aside, the company’s strategy has seen Windows 10 rapidly gain market share, running on 350m devices and 17.43% of the world’s computers, second only to Windows 7, according to data from NetMarketShare.10 quick questions about installing Windows 10 – and how to block itWindows 10 review – final version of Windows might be Microsoft’s best everMicrosoft pays out $10,000 for automatic Windows 10 installation
