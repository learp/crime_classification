Tiny tuna crabs have been washing up by the thousands on some Orange County beaches.  The Orange County Register reports that the crustaceans, which look like tiny lobsters or crawfish, created a bright red rim along the shoreline of Dana Point, San Clemente, Newport beach and Huntington beach on Sunday. Experts say the 1- to 3-in long crabs, which normally live off Mexico’s Baja peninsula, are going farther north because of the warm water that has lingered off southern California for the past year. In recent weeks, blue, jellyfish-like creatures known as “by-the-wind sailors” have been spotted, and tropical fish such as yellowtail and Bluefin tuna are showing up earlier than normal this year.
