Experiences of bipolar disorder: 'Every day it feels like I must wear a mask' Lisa, Arizona, USMy son was diagnosed with schizophrenia last March, and it was pretty sad the way it all went down. My mom has paranoid schizophrenia, so I knew the signs. I was trying to get help in a hurry and the crisis unit sent out an officer to assess the situation. The officer had no idea how to deal with someone having a breakdown, and put him in handcuffs. My son was hearing voices and this made him worse. He flipped out and kicked the officer in the groin area and tried to resist, so they took him to jail, and blamed me for his behaviour.The only thing I can hope and pray for is that officers get more training and understanding. As long as people with mental health problems have a good support system, they’re less likely to end up back in the hospital. I spent months trying to get my son on the correct medicine. It has been a hard road for us. I encourage and love my son. It’s one day at a time for us.Ed, 45, from LiverpoolI have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, which means I am pretty much excluded from society. Doors that are open to most people are firmly closed to me. The reality of my life is isolation, poverty, fear and hopelessness. I sometimes like to express my thoughts and experiences in little cartoon strips.
