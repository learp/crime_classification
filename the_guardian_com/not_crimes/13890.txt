Towards the end of the noughties, Colm Tóibín bounced into the office of a London publisher clutching a fat Australian novel and insisting that he had to bring it to the UK. His enthusiasm for what he would later acclaim as a book “of immense power and scope, reminiscent of Jonathan Franzen’s The Corrections and Don DeLillo’s Underworld” caused some surprise at Atlantic Books, which was among the 80-odd publishers that had already rejected Christos Tsiolkas’s The Slap.But Tóibín persevered and the novel – which had already been out for two years in Australia – became the literary talking point of 2010: loved and reviled with equal passion, this yarn about a falling-out over an unruly child at a suburban barbecue was longlisted for the Man Booker prize and went on to be made into two TV mini-series.

Unlikelier still that they would recognise it as a stablemate to László Krasznahorkai’s wayward Hungarian epic Satantango or Chris Kraus’s cult hit I Love Dick, which have since joined it on the list. But Tuskar Rock – founded by Tóibín and literary agent Peter Straus and named after a lighthouse rock off the coast of Tóibín’s home county of Wexford in Ireland – has been quietly lighting up a corner of the UK’s publishing landscape since 2005.Now into its second decade, Tuskar Rock is one of the older kids on a block that is becoming more crowded with each publishing season. In May, Little, Brown launched a new literary imprint called Fleet, which joined an existing stable of 12 with a mission to be “fleet of foot, alert, responsive”. In October, Orion will launch two new commercial imprints, Spring – devoted to wellbeing and lifestyle – and Trapeze, whose five-book autumn line-up includes works from Alan Partridge and badass YouTuber KSI.So what is an imprint, and why are there suddenly so many more of them? The simple answer is that they are subdivisions of bigger publishers. Sometimes, they come about through takeovers and sometimes they are startups. Andrew Franklin, whose Profile Books recently took over Tuskar Rock, points out that imprints have no legal status, “so if Tuskar Rock had libelled someone with I Love Dick, it’s Profile that would be sued. On the other hand, they break up monolithic companies and give space to individual editors.” Some insiders say an imprint can be a handy way of sidelining editors who are difficult or don’t fit in Philip Jones, editor of the trade journal the Bookseller, sees their rise as symptomatic of an identity crisis created by the rise of publishing giants such as Penguin Random House or Hachette. “For agents and their authors, they are a way of getting books to the relevant editors within publishing groups that are growing ever larger and more anonymous. They indicate who (ie which editors) are on the rise, who is acquiring and what types of books they want – although of course, this being publishing, it’s not an exact science. For booksellers they are a way of finding those titles as they come through the publishing thicket.”Off the record, some insiders say an imprint can be a handy way of sidelining editors who are difficult or don’t fit in. But they can also be a way of giving talented, ambitious publishers a free rein, and reassuring authors that they are not disappearing into the corporate ether. Maggie O’Farrell, Patrick Gale and Andrea Levy are among the big hitters who decamped to a new imprint Tinder Press, set up in 2013 as a literary boutique for the more commercially minded Headline, and run by three publishing veterans known for nurturing writers.O’Farrell said: “My main reason for moving to Tinder was to stay with my editor, Mary-Anne Harrington. I’ve worked with her on every book and the idea of writing a book without her at the helm was unthinkable. So off to Tinder I went.”But it’s not only the big money companies that are playing the game. When Chigozie Obioma’s debut novel The Fishermen was longlisted last year for prizes including the Man Booker and the Guardian first book award, staff at Pushkin Press had to keep reminding the media that it was not actually the work of the small indie publisher, but of its even smaller sister, One. Set up in 2013, One was the brainchild of writer and editor Elena Lappin, born of her frustration at seeing some books she loved passed over because editors were too nervous to pick them up, and others falling short of their potential because publishers didn’t know what to do with them.

Photograph: PRShe took the idea to Pushkin boss Adam Freudenheim, whose focus was on literature in translation, “and he felt there was room for an imprint that would be completely different: one exceptional book per season, which would be a debut.” The Fishermen was the fourth book that One had published and the first for which it had world rights in English. “It took a year to edit it properly, and to me that is what has got lost in much of contemporary big-house publishing. We give a book that attention and it does always pay off,” says Lappin.Tuskar Rock’s involvement is less intensive, according to Straus. “It is really Colm’s press and is seen as a rescue mission for books we feel should be heard and are not available here. I am helping him on that.”But though imprints are “a wonderful way for the trade to organise itself, it would be a mistake to assume they were relevant to consumers or meant to be so,” says Jones. “Nobody buying the books cares about the name of the publisher. The consumer doesn’t need to know that Mantle, say, has a reputation in literary crime, but booksellers can use that knowledge when shelving their books and getting them to the right readers. They are the invisible webs that just about make the trade understandable – no more and no less. That some may come to mean something to consumers is just luck.”Five imprints you’ve probably heard of:GollanczSpeciality: Science fiction, fantasy and horrorOwner: Orion, part of Hachette UKHistory: Founded in 1927 by Victor Gollancz, became specialist SF/ Fantasy imprint in 1998.Authors include: Terry Pratchett, Philip K DickSceptreSpeciality: Literary fiction and nonfictionOwner: Hodder & Stoughton, part of Hachette UKHistory: Started in 1986 as literary arm for Hodder & StoughtonAuthors include: David Mitchell, Thomas KeneallyPenguin ClassicsSpeciality: Mainly classics and but also occasional new booksHistory: started in 1944 with translation of The OdysseyOwner: Penguin Random HouseAuthors include: Marcel Proust, MorrisseyPuffinSpeciality: Children’s booksHistory: Founded in 1941 in England to produce paperbacks for childrenOwner: Penguin Random HouseAuthors include: Roald Dahl, Jacqueline WilsonViragoSpeciality: Books by womenHistory: Started in 1973 as feminist indieOwner: Little, Brown, part of Hachette UKAuthors include: Sarah Waters, Marilynne RobinsonAnd five you probably haven’tFleetSpeciality: Literary fiction and nonfictionOwner: Little,Brown, part of Hachette UKHistory: Launched in May 2016 with three novels and a science memoirAuthors include: Charlotte Rogan, Hope JahrenTinder PressSpeciality: Literary fictionHistory: Founded in 2013Owner: Headline, part of Hachette UKAuthors include: Maggie O’Farrell, Patrick GaleBloomsbury SigmaSpeciality: Popular scienceHistory: Launched in 2014Owner: BloomsburyAuthors include: Jules Howard, Timandra HarknessOneSpeciality: Literary fiction debutsHistory: Founded in 2013Owner: Pushkin PressAuthors include: Chigozie Obioma, Olivia SudjicMantleSpeciality: Fiction and narrative nonfiction with focus on crime and thrillersHistory: Founded in 2010Owner: PanMacmillanAuthors include: Benjamin Black, Andrea Camilleri
