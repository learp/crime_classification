Seen the list? That actor, whatisname, what for, twatting around pretending to be Oliver Cromwell, I can pretend to be other people, has he tried doing Audrey Hepburn in Africa? Any of them knighting lot ever done any charity work? You think we should have told them how hot Africa is before they knighted that old singer, total joke, and what’s Mo Farah got one for? I can run, we can all run, but it’s all Sir Mo this, Sir Mo that, did he ever hold a poorly kiddie?It’s a disgrace, that’s what, I make it 153 kiddies I’ve held in six years, listen no way am I going back to Africa, state of it, that last jet, no hand sanitiser, I had to spend my own actual money, disgrace to be honest. If I was American it would’ve been a knighthood like years ago, don’t tell me they don’t do knighthoods well they can piss right off.Modern tribes: the anti-march protester You tell them that’s my last sick kiddie till I get the nod, cos if I quit, who’s going to suffer? That’s right, my own kids, I’m tearing up thinking about it, to be honest.Got to be an eye for an eye as they say, tell you what, how about I go on telly, and they’ll go, what makes you emotional? I’ll go, it’s my kids crying when I’m not on the honours list, then they go, are you worried about the message that sends to other selfless charity workers? I’ll be like, you know me, love the work, but as a role model, naming no names can you believe her majesty, she’s like a nan to me to be honest, told me this, there’s people out there who only do charity for what they can get out of it? I was like, never! She was like, too true, if you’re not in the next list, my son, just tell ’em from me to fuck off. I was like, your wish is my command my liege, her majesty was like, and you can put that on Instagram an’ all.
