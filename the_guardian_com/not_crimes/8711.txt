The New South Wales government is seeking to ban Aboriginal communities from making land claims on coastal areas and to cancel around 1,800 outstanding claims to beachfront land.Hundreds gathered in Sydney on Monday to protest against the proposal, which the state’s Aboriginal Land Council has slammed as “racist” and “scare-mongering”. The state government’s move follows a successful 20-year legal battle by the Coffs Harbour district local Aboriginal council to claim a section of land on the state’s north coast that includes a 3.7km stretch of Red Rock beach. The land claim was initially rejected by the government on the grounds the area was needed for “essential public purpose”, but was granted by a court last December, with an easement guaranteeing public access to the beach.But a spokesman for the state’s lands and water minister, Kevin Humphries, said the Red Rock decision clashed with the policy of successive NSW governments “that beaches belong to everyone and should not be owned by any particular individual or groups of individuals”.“This action is not directed against the right to make Aboriginal land claims but defends the general principle, widely supported by the community, that our beaches should not be privatised,” he said.

We’re undertaking developments, we’re building homes, we have our own funeral fund, we do scholarships, we do community sponsorships,” he said.“This is what the government should be aiming for: legislation that allows us to provide and support our own community and be self-dependent.”Gordon said the government had granted coastal land claims 30 years ago “when they thought they were wastelands”.“Now they’re realising it’s pristine land and they don’t want blackfellas to have it.”He said the “racist” legislation undermined other positive initiatives by the Baird government, including the appointment of an Aboriginal deputy ombudsman and the devolution of power to local communities. “This government wants Aboriginal land rights to end. They want us to no longer be able to claim crown land,” he said.
