My handbook for walkers states that a beef bull, if together with cows, may be placed in a field crossed by a footpath. However, a dairy bull accompanying cows must not be so placed. Why are beef bulls considered safe, while dairy ones are not? Do beef bulls understand that they should not attack walkers?Eithne Buchanan-Barrow, London SW6• Post your answers – and new questions – below or email them to nq@theguardian.com
