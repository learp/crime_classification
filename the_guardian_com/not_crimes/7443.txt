Until Proven Guilty has to be the best book I have ever read! It is about a boy called Nathan and his best friend Ben. Their Dads are friends as well. It all starts when Nathan’s Dad arrives back late from work. They then find out that a girl has been murdered in the area on that same night. Nathan is curious as his Dad is acting all weird!Half way through the story, Nathan’s Dad is arrested because the police think he murdered the girl and she has his DNA under her fingernails but Nathan does not want to believe it.It is surprising to read when the whole story unfolds and the killer is revealed. The suspense is very intense and I really enjoyed it.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes crime or suspense because this book has lots of both and is a great read. I would give it a rating of 5 stars most definitely.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
