Heavy rain left parts of the country affected by flash flooding on Friday nightwith a 60% to 70% chance that the remnants of hurricane Bertha will hit the south of England on Sunday, according to the Met Office."The situation is still very uncertain," said Laura Young, a Met Office spokeswoman. "[The storm] is coming in our general direction, and one of the tracks we're looking at is that it comes across the South Downs, through the Wash and out through the east coast into the North Sea."Although the hurricane has now been downgraded to an Atlantic depression, rain and strong gusts of wind could still affect the whole of the east coast, reaching as far as the north-east of Scotland on Monday, Young said.In the south, rainfall could top 50mm and coastal gusts could surpass 60mph. The average rainfall for the whole of August in England is 69mm.Forecasters said southern parts of the country are most at risk from "heavy rainfall, strong coastal winds and large waves".Heavy downpours yesterday led to several streets being left underwater and residents evacuated from their homes in the Lincolnshire town of Louth. Roads in Maidstone, Kent, were also affected. The Environment Agency has a flood alert in place along Louth Canal and Waithe Beck.Cambridgeshire police urged people to avoid driving on the county's roads unless absolutely necessary after it was hit by deluge of rain. The force said traffic was extremely slow moving on parts of the A14 and surrounding roads while there has been localised flooding in March, Wisbech, Dry Drayton and Bar Hill.Downpours also led to flooding in York. North Yorkshire fire and rescue service said it received a high number of emergency calls due to the rain.The Environment Agency added a number of other flooding warnings – two in the Midlands and one in the North East – and eight flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, in East Anglia and Nottinghamshire, along with two in the north-east and four in the south-west.The Met Office said there was still a 30% to 40% chance of the storm missing the UK completely, passing through northern France instead. "That would leave the south with some very calm weather on Sunday," said Young.The direction and intensity of the storm will depend on whether it fragments and weakens as it comes across the Atlantic, so the next 24 hours are critical for predicting the implications for the UK.The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning for Sunday, covering Wales and southern England.Bertha is the second hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season. It passed through the Caribbean this week, leaving thousands of homes without power. Parts of Puerto Rico saw 25mm of rainfall, with some mountainous regions receiving as much as 254mm.Bertha is currently off the coast of New York and is moving across the Atlantic towards northern Europe.On Thursday Craig Woolhouse, the flood risk manager at the Environment Agency, said there was some chance of flooding in parts of the UK on Sunday and Monday. "A combination of high spring tides and strong westerly winds brings a possible risk of flooding to the south-west coast of England and along the Severn estuary, while heavy rain may also lead to localised surface water flooding in parts of southern and central England."He advised people to check the forecast frequently in the next few days.At at time when many are heading off on their summer holidays, Ross Macleod, the coastal safety manager for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, told those who are planning to visit the beach to be vigilant: "As little as one cubic metre of water weighs a tonne and shows that you should never underestimate how powerful the sea can be."This summer has been warmer, drier and sunnier than average so far, according to the Met Office.
