The BBC drama chief responsible for Wolf Hall and Poldark appears poised for a switch to ITV after less than a year in the job in a move that would be a big loss for the corporation.Polly Hill is understood to be considering an offer to change channels following a big-money bid by ITV’s new director of television, Kevin Lygo.Her departure, which is yet to be confirmed by either side, comes as the BBC’s future is up for grabs as part of the renewal of its royal charter.A source said an official announcement was expected within 48 hours but nothing had yet been signed.The quality and reach of BBC drama is regularly held up by the BBC’s director general Tony Hall as one of the corporation’s key contributions to culture in Britain and around the world.It was also announced on Monday that another senior BBC executive, Wendy Darke, head of the corporation’s acclaimed natural history unit, would be leaving the corporation.Hill succeeded Ben Stephenson in the BBC’s top drama role in May last year and the success of the genre since then was underlined by its prominence in a glitzy launch event hosted by new overall channels boss Charlotte Moore last month. Previously head of independent drama at the BBC, Hill has overseen productions including BBC1’s Poldark, The Missing and Doctor Foster, and Wolf Hall, The Honourable Woman and The Shadow Line on BBC2.Reports that she was close to being prised away by ITV’s Lygo first appeared in Broadcast magazine.It comes days after ITV announced the exit of its own drama chief, Steve November, after 16 years at the commercial broadcaster.Announcing her appointment last year, the BBC’s then director of television Danny Cohen said Hill had an “exceptional track record for delivering outstanding drama … Polly’s work speaks for itself and is driven by her passion for writing and storytelling”.The BBC and ITV were unavailable for comment.Darke was the first female head of the NHU and had been at the department since 1991. The NHU is responsible for programmes from BBC1’s Africa to BBC2’s Springwatch and Andy’s Wild Adventures on CBeebies.She was one of the senior executives in charge of the BBC’s fledgling BBC Studios operation unveiled last December which has already seen the departure of its chief, Peter Salmon, since replaced by Mark Linsey.Revolving door - senior departures from the BBCDanny Cohen, director of television: announced he was leaving after eight years last OctoberKim Shillinglaw, controller of BBC2: left channel after role was scrapped in shakeup in JanuaryAlan Yentob: still at the BBC as a presenter and chairman of BBC Films, but no longer its creative directorPeter Salmon, first head of BBC Studios: left before it had come into being to head up Endemol ShineJanice Hadlow, controller of special projects and seasons: the former BBC2 controller left in JanuaryWendy Darke, head of BBC natural history unit: quit after 25 years at the BBC, her exit announced on MondayPolly Hill, controller of BBC drama commissioning: off to ITV?
