Initially Jacobs responded on Instagram by saying it was “funny” that critics don’t “criticize women of color for straightening their hair.” “I respect and am inspired by people and how they look. I don’t see colour or race – I see people. I’m sorry to read that so many people are so narrow minded … Love is the answer. Appreciation of all and inspiration from anywhere is a beautiful thing. Think about it,” he wrote.He also posted screenshots of articles that said the uproar over the issue was “ridiculous”.But he apologized on Sunday for what he called “the lack of sensitivity unintentionally expressed by my brevity.”“I wholeheartedly believe in freedom of speech and freedom to express oneself though art, clothes, words, hair, music...EVERYTHING,” he posted.“Of course I do “see” color but I DO NOT discriminate. THAT IS A FACT!”Associated Press contributed to this report
