Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 2:04pmS: I don't know much about his music, but I think he's been using the name longer than we have. We've managed to peacefully coexist.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.07pm BST14:07RichXS saysMy Mrs reckons Ether sounds a bit like the Crocodile Dundee soundtrack. Who’s your favourite Dundonian?  Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 2:03pmS: Mine is Brian Cox.D: That's who I was going to say! He's just the best Hannibal Lecter.S: That's what I was going to say!

What should we expect from the album and upcoming live shows? The couple of bits that have seen the light of day so far have been fantastic, btw.  Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 2:00pmS: It was really great working with Rachel, James and Justin - the album was a lot of fun to make. Expect ten good songs that people like. It's totally done. The live shows are sounding good, Martin from Mogwai is playing drums with us live, another guy Callum is playing keys - rehearsals are sounding good and we're looking forward to it.Listen to Minor Victories: A Hundred RopesFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.02pm BST14:02ID9552055 asksNo doubt you are musicians above all – but are you also driven as a Scottish or a British band? And Scotland, independent or part of the union?  Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 1:59pmS: We did all vote Yes. The democratic deficit of Scotland continually being run by politicians no-one in Scotland voted for, and the pile of nuclear weapons parked up.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.57pm BST13:57The band's favourite gig venuesmwng2k asksWith such an extensive back catalogue to choose from, how do you go about putting your setlists together? Are there any live venues that you would love to play at, but have not yet had the opportunity to visit?  Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 1:56pmS: The setlist - you put a good song to start with, a good song to end with, and you fill in the middle. If you have a new record you put some of those in, plus ones you've been enjoying playing on tour.D: It doesn't take long to work out what tunes work the best live, and they're the ones that usually stick about.S: We've been lucky - we've played a lot of great places. My favourite venue is the Glasgow Barrowlands. I really like the Hammersmith Apollo. D: I really miss the Astoria - that was a great place to play.S: The Bikini in Toulouse. There's a nice dog hanging out there that I like.D: The guy who owns the place cooks you a dinner and it's unbelievable. We don't always sell a huge amount of tickets, but we get a lot of booze and tasty food.Updatedat 1.58pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.55pm BST13:55Simon Bleasdale asksWho is the girl speaking at the beginning of the Young Team album, on Yes, I Am a Long Way From Home? What is she doing now?  Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 1:52pmS: That is a person called Mari, who was one of the first people to book a Mogwai gig outside of the UK. We went to play in Norway in 1996, and we played in Oslo, Stavanger and Bergen. It was brilliant tour - we slept on the venue floors quite a lot. What she's saying is her translating a review, a really hyperbole-filled review we thought was hilarious because the concept of someone taking our music seriously was sidesplittingly amusing to us. Even having it at the beginning of the record was meant to be funny, but it's been taken more seriously over the years, which is quite nice. Mari still lives in Bergen, she's got a family - she's still doing well. We see her any time we're around there.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.55pm BST13:55Mykell Pledger asks:Would Mogwai do the soundtrack to a live-action Akira movie?  Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 1:53pmS: Oh yeah. D: Undoubtedly.S: Presuming it was brilliant, which we would presume, until it wasn't. D: It's one of those ones in production hell isn't it - it's going to be very hard to make it into a good film.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.51pm BST13:51lh100lh asksWhat are the last 5 records you both bought?  Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 1:49pmS: I got some two days ago. I went to Edinburgh to do a radio interview and - namedrop klaxon - I met Ian Rankin in a second hand record shop. I got a Section 25 12", a Strawberry Switchblade album, Butthole Surfers, Squirrel Bait, and the new Tim Hecker album which is amazing.D: It's too long! I've no idea.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm BST13:49CQwellingbonePhD saysSaw you in St Malo, France in 2011. Best and worst things about touring?  Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 1:48pmS: The best thing is getting to play a concert every night.D: Flying and anything to do with airports gets pretty gruelling after a while. Everything else is pretty good.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm BST13:49djsatan asks: I always thought it plausible that you could have had a fight. Who would win?  Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 1:47pmS: I think if Mogwai had a fight, Martin would win.D: He's by far the hardest. There would be lots of shouting, and some feeble punches.S: I'd lose in a fight against myself.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.48pm BST13:48gimpyblog 2d saysSaw you play years ago in Edinburgh with Arab Strap. I was so wasted I can’t remember anything about the gig. Was it any good?and Robin Layfield addsIf it was the one on Valentine’s Day that ended with Stuart punching a giant Rupert Bear on stage while playing then it was bloody brilliant. 2nd best Mogwai gig ever (after closing Glastonbury and blowing the crowd down like dandelions under a lawnmower).  Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 1:45pmS: We were wasted too.D: I got pretty steaming. My strongest memory is that I kicked my pint over and it landed in a cable box, and the girl manning the monitor desk tore right through me on stage. I felt pretty bad. It was an accident though.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.48pm BST13:48Porcinho asks: If you’d never done Zidane, who would be the top 3 players you’d like to soundtrack a film about?

Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 1:44pmS: Presuming you don't mean the terrible football phone-in... Ian Wright, I don't think he's funny, he just seems self-satisfied and disinterested, and he was terrible in his short period for Celtic.D: I remember when he was a pundit when Northern Ireland beat England - he wouldn't speak, he was too furious. It's literally your job to speak about games!S: There you go, keep employing this guy, BBC - who shows licence fee payers utter contempt!  Ian Wright scores for Celtic v Kilmarnock, 30 October 1999.

Immediately catapulted into my top 3 live acts. Spontaneously burst into tears during one song when really quiet became REALLY, REALLY LOUD. My question is: have you ever done a Buckfast Challenge?

It’s been almost eight years!  Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 1:41pmS: Chris now lives in Sao Paolo but is still making music, so I really hope he does put out a new record.

Guardian contributor MogwaiBand 06 April 2016 1:40pmS: I would probably say Cameron because the damage he's doing, he's inflicting it now. And Cameron is doing things Thatcher wouldn't have dared to do - taking away housing benefits for the under 21s, cutting the disability benefits, fucking a pig. Just generally being a complete evil bastard. But they're two cheeks of the same arse.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
