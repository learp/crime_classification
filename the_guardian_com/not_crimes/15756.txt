Ylvis – The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?)I recently found this track without knowing much about the artist and became hooked on the intro – it immediately takes you into the music. During the chorus, people start to dance in a strange way, and I really liked it! I might as well dance with them.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Michael Jackson – Smooth CriminalI started listening to Michael Jackson when I was in junior high. The video really surprised me, especially the bit when Michael tilts his body. I have not stopped enjoying it since then.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Marilyn Manson – mOBSCENEThis video scared the young me so, so much. But as a young child, I just couldn’t keep my eyes off it. Although my music is very different to Manson’s, I have genuine respect for an artist like him who is so determined to create his or her own world through music and videos.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest YELLE – Ce JeuYelle is one of my favourite artists. I love her music and videos – they represent her so well. They are simply fabulous. This video has a stripe theme – I’m in love with its consistency and fashion.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Hikaru Utada – TravelingHikaru Utada is a Japanese artist, and this video is a strong interpretation of the music. People living outside Japan will also enjoy her creativity. It’s pop and yet a little bit dark and scary. I like the chemistry.
