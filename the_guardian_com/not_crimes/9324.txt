When Monty Don recently put his wellington boot into self-sufficiency, writing in Gardeners’ World magazine that living off the land was a “non-starter”, I was surprised. I didn’t believe anybody actually followed John Seymour’s 1976 Complete Guide to Self-Sufficiency to the letter any more. That’s the type of all-consuming, no-consuming living off the land that leads – in Monty’s eyes – to failure, bad breath and possibly malnutrition.But if the good life is still your dream, diggersanddreamers.org.uk lists UK communities that are looking for members. These communities are outstanding examples of permaculture – sustainable, self-sufficient agricultural ecosystems – and provide inspiration for those of us who don’t subscribe to the hard labour of the full downshift but do fancy trying “self-provisioning”, usually defined as growing part of your diet yourself. But smart self-provisioning goes further than diet. Stitchedup.coop and Sewing Café Lancaster are two examples of fashion activism combined with reskilling that are helping to re-establish a make do and mend culture.At the newly refurbished Museum of English Rural Life in Reading, curator Guy Baxter notes that a surge of interest in growing food has been accompanied by increased appetite for heritage craft. The museum houses the lathe of renowned woodturner George Lailey. Their books are inspiring too. I’m hoping the Scything Handbook will see a Poldark-inspired uplift in Christmas sales.Critics may say this is fiddling, stitching, sycthing and pickling while Rome burns but I think the new self-provisioners represent a significant shift for sustainable living, achievable and desirable to huge numbers of people.

Photograph: Simon Wisbey/MakeI try really hard not to bring you ethical fashion brands that are still being crowd funded – honestly, I want you to be able get hold of the product right now – but then I came across the perfect pyjama set from AmaElla (pictured) combining ethically sourced fabrics and European production with the prettiest design.
