There is something infinitely soothing about observing the flow of water beneath a bridge. Resting against the sun-warmed wood, I am half mesmerised by the shifting patterns.Beneath the centre of the bridge the water is deep and slow-moving, passing over a riverbed whose features are invisible beneath a silty deposit of a rich deep brown. Occasionally a long strand of river weed floats past, gently curling and uncurling on its journey downstream.Against the far bank where it glides slowly around the curve cut through the sandy soil by the winter spates the river runs quietly. But for just a short distance along the nearer bank it reveals an entirely different and more playful nature. Here part of the little river diverts from the main body of water. Running faster, bubbling and chuckling as it goes, it splashes its way through rock-strewn shallows, finding its way around and between the obstacles in a series of eddies and swirls, and creating glistening bubbles that cling to the partially exposed rocks.Below the waterâ€™s surface these same rocks are ringed with seaweed: although the view from one side of the bridge is inland to the hills, from the other it is out across the beach. Here, twice a day, the seaward movement of the fresh water mingles with the saltiness of the incoming tide.Brilliant green, the weed moves lazily in response to the shifting water while the afternoon sun transforms the riverbed to a glowing amber patterned with a web of gold. Towards the middle of the river, where the amber begins to darken again to brown, is a flotilla of five small fish. They move neither further upstream nor allow themselves to be carried seaward by the river but hang almost motionless, maintaining station with minute adjustments of tail and fin.Twitter: @GdnCountryDiary
