O, Great Northern Mall, you dwindling oracleof upstate New York, your colossal lotof frost-heaved spaces so vacant I could cutstraight through while blinking and keep my eyesshut, I’ve come like the flies that give up the ghostat the papered fronts of your defunct stores,through the food court where napkins, unusedto touch, are packed too tight to be dispensed,past the pimpled kid manning the registerwho stares at the buttons and wipes his palms.If I press my eyes until checkers risefrom the dark – that’s how the overheads glowerin home essentials as I roam through Sears,seeking assistance. I know you’re here.For this window crank I brought, you show mea muted wall of TVs where Jeff Goldblumpicks his way through the splintered remainsof a dinosaur crate. There must be fiftyof him, hunching over mud to inspectthe three-toed prints. I almost didn’tcome in here at all, driving the oppositeof victory laps, and waiting as I hopedfor the red to leave my eyes, but my urgencysmacked of your nothingness. I did it again –I screamed at the woman I love, and in frontof our one-year-old, who covered his ears.
