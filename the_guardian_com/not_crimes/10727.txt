Emma Watson has announced that she will take a year away from acting to further her knowledge of feminism.Emma Watson at Davos: 'Women need to be equal participants' The actor, last seen in the supernatural thriller Regression, told author and activist bell hooks about her intention during an interview in Paper magazine. “I’m taking a year away from acting to focus on two things, really,” she said. “My own personal development is one ... my own personal task is to read a book a week, and also to read [another] book a month as part of my book club. I’m doing a huge amount of reading and study just on my own.”Watson was tempted to spend the time at university but decided against it. “I almost thought about going and doing a year of gender studies, then I realised that I was learning so much by being on the ground and just speaking with people and doing my reading,” she said. “That I was learning so much on my own. I actually wanted to keep on the path that I’m on. I’m reading a lot this year, and I want to do a lot of listening.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The Harry Potter star will also focus on HeForShe, an initiative that she launched in her capacity as a UN Women goodwill ambassador, aimed at engaging men in the fight for gender equality. The campaign will include an arts week, a university tour and the launching of a new site. Watson has also launched a feminist book group on Twitter, called Our Shared Shelf.“I’m on my journey with this and it might change, but I can tell you that what is really liberating and empowering me through being involved in feminism is that … so much of the self-critiquing is gone,” said Watson. Before taking her break from Hollywood, Watson will be seen alongside John Boyega in the thriller The Circle, and in the lead role in Disney’s live-action Beauty and the Beast.
