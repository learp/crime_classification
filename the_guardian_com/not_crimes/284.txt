According to the UN, the world's population is due to hit 7 billion on 31 October. It took until 1804 for humanity to reach its first billion – and has taken only 12 years to add our latest billion.As part of our people's panel series, we'd like to hear from readers willing to write about how they came to a decision about the number of children they decided to have. Do you believe overpopulation is a problem, or, as columnist George Monbiot does, a myth? Did you take population numbers into consideration before starting your family? Perhaps you are childless by choice, or like many commenters in this thread, decided to stop after one or two children? Or do you have a large family, but are careful to be frugal, for environmental reasons?If you would like to participate, please email Jessica Reed (jessica.reed@theguardian.com) before Wednesday 26 October at 12pm (UK time), with a contribution of about 250 words.
