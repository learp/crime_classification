Barbra Streisand is set to make a major comeback in a big screen adaptation of Stephen Sondheim’s classic musical Gypsy, directed by Rain Man director Barry Levinson. The star is in final negotiations to play the lead role of Mama Rose.Streisand is also the film’s producer, according to Variety. The Fisher King writer Richard LaGravenese, who recently directed the Anna Kendrick musical The Last Five Years, is writing the screenplay, with Streisand rumored to be aiding in its development.Gypsy review – Imelda Staunton gives ‘one of the greatest performances I’ve ever seen in a musical’ Gypsy will mark Streisand’s first film since she appeared opposite Seth Rogen in the 2012 road trip comedy The Guilt Trip, and her first movie musical since her 1983 Oscar-winner Yentl. Her involvement with Gypsy dates to 2011, when Streisand was first revealed to be in negotiations to star in the musical. First made into a film in 1962, Gypsy centers on Mama Rose, a fiercely ambitious stage mother, and her daughter Gypsy Rose Lee, who goes on to become a burlesque legend. Previous actresses who have played Mama Rose, known for her signature song Everything’s Coming Up Roses, include Ethel Merman, Angela Lansbury and Bernadette Peters. Most recently, Imelda Staunton drew rave reviews for her portrayal of the character in last year’s West End revival in London. Writing in the Guardian, Michael Billington called her turn, which netted two Olivier awards, “one of the greatest performances I’ve ever seen in musical theatre”.Production on Gypsy is said to start this year.
