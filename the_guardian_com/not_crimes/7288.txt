2.23pm GMT14:23That's all for todayThanks to Harry for taking questions on everything from Simpsons to Spinal Tap to Trump. As he mentions, he’ll be at King’s Place on 8 December for the charity event Christmas Without Tears.  Guardian contributor HarryShearer1 23 November 2016 2:10pmThe Guardian's lease on this office has run out, so I must gather my things and scram. Please, if you're in LOndon or thereabouts, consider coming over to King's Place Dec 8 for "Christmas Without Tears", an annual comedy-music variety show Judith Owen and I put on for charity, thjis year benefitting Shelter. Guests include Chris Difford from Squeeze, Jacqui Dankworth and Charlie Wood, two great nonexistent people (Barry from Watford and Tina C) and lots of surprise guests. See you there, or elsewhere. Thanks.Updatedat 2.26pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.20pm GMT14:20George White asksIs it true, Harry you did voiceovers for Monty Python?

Given Trump’s victory, it seems more relevant than ever to remember the last fragile ego in the White House.  Guardian contributor HarryShearer1 23 November 2016 2:06pmThank you, and yes, I'm planning a new little Nixon series--not "Little Nixon"--based on a recently released series of tapes with him and Kissinger. Not funny this time, very dark and chilling and apropos of our era of perpetual war.Updatedat 2.41pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.16pm GMT14:16TheKernel asks:Firstly, I must have watched Spinal Tap 200 times, so you’re probably due some extra royalties from me.It’s a given that you’re a master with voices, but it took me about 10 years to seriously believe that you and the boys were from the US, not Squatney. So, the boring question is, when you’re researching a character or role, what kind of research and practice regimen do you engage with?  Guardian contributor HarryShearer1 23 November 2016 2:05pmIt depends. So many of the characters I play are people that have inhabited my mind for a while before I've been able to tackle them, so there's already a lot of them inside. But I do make a fairly close study of technical things like, if they're real people, how they hold and user their mouth in speaking and how their body works.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.15pm GMT14:15MrGluben asks:Is there another voiceover artist you really admire?

(And I remember catching Spinal Tap’s debut on The TV Show with Rob Reiner.) Which of those sketches do you look back on most fondly?  Guardian contributor HarryShearer1 23 November 2016 2:00pmActually, a sketch from my second time at SNL, Men's Synchronized Swimming. From the TV Show, probably "The Trial of Adolf Hitler," with Rob playing Hitler.Updatedat 2.13pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.11pm GMT14:11dylabolical asks:Loved you on WTF With Marc Maron.

I know that you previously did work for Family Guy. Are you still permitted to do work for “rival” animated shows under your new contract for The Simpsons?  Guardian contributor HarryShearer1 23 November 2016 1:59pmI never did work for Family Guy. For me, one animated show, that just happens to be the longest-running entertainment show in US television, is enough.Updatedat 2.13pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.09pm GMT14:09Myles Gaby asks:What is your least favourite Simpsons episode?

Guardian contributor HarryShearer1 23 November 2016 1:58pmIt seemed to deny 12 years of accumulated knowledge about the character , and to sort of negate the audience's investment in that knowledge.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.08pm GMT14:08DaveCook asks:You are a master voiceover artist. When did you first realise you were good at a wide range of voices, and what is your method for coming up with voices for characters?  Guardian contributor HarryShearer1 23 November 2016 1:57pmI played around wtih characters as a kid, when they all came out sounding like my kid voice. Looking back, I realized that I was training my ear long before I could actually recreate those sounds vocally.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.07pm GMT14:07traleebob asks:If you were US president for one day, what single law would you introduce?

Could you sum up the nub of your grievance? It does sound like life imitating Tap. And will there ever be a That Was Spinal Tap reunion movie?  Guardian contributor HarryShearer1 23 November 2016 1:54pmAs I stated in a video on YouTube when the suit was filed, Chris, Michael, Rob and I were partners in the film, and we deferred much of our salaries in return for which we were supposed to be paid a share of the film's profits.

Michael JacksonJozef Brodala asks:Who has been the most fun guest star to work with on The Simpsons?  Guardian contributor HarryShearer1 23 November 2016 1:52pmFor me, Michael Jackson. Just kinda...weird. I know that's hard to believe. E.g., we were doing the final readthrough before recording, he read all his spoken lines, then when it came to the version of "Ben" his character was supposed to sing, he sat silent and nodded across the table. Suddenly a white guy started singing the lyrics, in an MJ-like voice. I whispered to Yeardley, "I guess we paid enough for the talking Michael Jacikson, not for the singing Michael Jackson."FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.02pm GMT14:02Boojay asks:If I had your job, every morning I’d wake up and run around the neighbourhood like a bald man who’s just discovered Dimoxinil.
