Glass Sword continues Mare’s flight from Maven who betrayed both his brother Cal and Mare. The journey Mare now faces is to find the newbloods before Maven does. However in the process of this daunting task, some relationships inevitably blossom while others breakdown.I couldn’t put it down. I was constantly trying to read as fast as I could so that I would know what was going to happen. Although I have read so many YA books where I have the problem of not getting into the book, and the main reason for this is because there are some aspects or plotlines that are repetitive and clichéd, I didn’t have this problem with this book. There was a tense atmosphere throughout the book and I kept on having the feeling that something bad was going to happen.However as I got halfway into the book the plot didn’t develop so I got to the point where my anticipation was wearing off but this was saved by the character development. You see Mare grow from a girl to a young adult who knows what she wants and what she has to do to achieve it. As a reader you also get more involved in the world and you get to see how the world is run.On the other hand there was one main aspect that made me dislike the book a little bit. Sometimes there were passages that had some coming-of-age quotes. This was a little out of place for me. I didn’t see how it fitted into a hard fantasy/dystopian book. It was a little awkward. I know that those parts were included to show that main character was growing up but it could have been written in a way that complimented the plot and themes of the book.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? Overall I did enjoy the book more than the first in the series. I would suggest that if you didn’t like the first book you should carry on because so much happens and the plot twist is just devastating and very unexpected. I can’t wait for the third book to come out and see what lies in Mare’s path.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
