I jump in the shower 45 minutes before I need to leave. If you have a bath you end up having a sweat on for an hour afterwards and, because I have a business and a family, I don’t have hours to sit around. I use leave-in conditioner on my frizzy hair and a bit of vegetable extract gel – I don’t like super-hold hair gel.I cover up any signs I’m still going through puberty; I don’t think anyone needs to see a red spot on my face. I glance in the mirror to make sure I’ve done the best I can with what nature’s given me, breathe in – belly in, chest out – and head off. I like to be on time, preferably ahead of time. It’s better to be one of the first at a function as opposed to last in the room.I used to wear a kilt to all black-tie events but now I only wear it at non-UK events. As a British citizen and a Scotsman, it’s nice to wear your national dress but it is easier to throw on a black dinner suit and, at a UK event, there are always enough Scots to do the tartan thing. I am just organising a kilt for my seven-year-old son, Dayton. We were originally from the Midlands, so there wasn’t a Coulthard tartan until I had one made and registered 15 years ago.With the kilt I wear the Prince Charlie jacket and waistcoat, which have decorative buttons, a white shirt and a straight tie because I am not a fan of bow ties. As well as a sporran, I have a sgian dubh (small knife) – if you are right-handed it’s in your right sock; left-handed, in your left. I wear long socks and no knickers to make sure I honour the Scottish tradition.• David presents highlights of the German Grand Prix this Sunday from 6pm on Channel 4.
