Given that prescriptions are free to children under 16 and to those aged 16-18 in full-time education, could the government be persuaded to allow sanitary pads and tampons to be counted as an eligible prescription item? Then we could all contribute – through our taxes – to providing the funds to help girls get this most basic but important necessity (Letters, 22 March).Jane WoddisBirmingham• Rather than suggesting My Ding-A-Ling was not “the real Chuck Berry” (Letters, 23 March), Mike Pender should celebrate it for what it is – Berry’s only properly British hit song for a nation brought up on innuendo under centuries of government censorship.

I sometimes encounter my Hausarzt (GP) in a bar we favour, when we both quickly conceal our cigarettes under the table and pretend that the large glass of wine is our first. Any overt reference to our peccadilloes is met by him threatening a prostate examination.Brian SmithBerlin• I wonder if Ian Mitchell’s GP reads the Guardian?Tim LidbetterKingston upon Thames, Surrey• I’m pleased to assure Rev Philip Welsh that “anent” is part of my core vocabulary.
