It could be the start of a wonderful friendship. Hillary Clinton, who looks set to become the first female president of the United States next month, said she was “thrilled” to receive the backing of Adele during her concert in the US on Tuesday night. She also tweeted to say it was “quite a birthday surprise”. Clinton’s comments came after Adele told a crowd at Miami’s American Airlines Arena that she was strongly anti-Trump. “I do know what to do – don’t vote for him, that’s all I’m saying.”She added: “I support Hillary Clinton 100%, I do. And for anyone else that wants to vote for him, I don’t care, good for you, do whatever you want. I’m just letting you know who I would vote for.”Clinton attended the concert and said she was “really grateful” for the singer’s support. Speaking to US radio station SiriusXM, she said: “I went to the Adele concert after we finished our day of campaigning in Florida, and I was stunned and thrilled because I’m a huge fan of hers and it meant a lot to me that she said something so positive.”Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton)That was quite a birthday surprise, @Adele. Loved the show last night! -H https://t.co/2QJ76wABh0October 26, 2016Readers may not be surprised to learn that Republican nominee Donald Trump was less than pleased to hear about Adele’s backing. After facing criticism for taking time out of his campaign to promote the opening of his latest luxury hotel in Washington, he told ABC News: “Hillary Clinton goes to see an Adele concert last night, and everybody says, ‘Oh, wasn’t that nice, isn’t that wonderful’. I can’t take one hour off to cut a ribbon at one of the great hotels of the world?”Trump has had previous grievances with Adele, after the singer requested that he stopped playing her songs at his rallies. Trump had been known to warm up to tracks including Rolling in the Deep.
