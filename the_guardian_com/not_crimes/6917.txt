TheatreMuch Ado About NothingOriginally staged at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 2014 under the title of Love’s Labour’s Won, Christopher Luscombe relocates Shakespeare’s comedy to late 1918 and an English country house that has been commandeered as a military hospital for returning soldiers. It’s a charming and at times bittersweet celebration of being alive at the end of a conflict, one that bursts with the relief of having escaped death.Theatre Royal Haymarket, SW1, to 18 MarchGroundedIt’s one last hurrah for Christopher Haydon, the departing artistic director of the Gate, with the return of his brilliant production of George Brant’s play about a female US fighter pilot who is reassigned to the role of drone operator. She sits in a trailer in the desert near Las Vegas pressing buttons that will have consequences for her target thousands of miles away. Haydon’s cleverly conceived production heightens the tension and themes, and Lucy Ellinson reprises her scorching performance.Gate Theatre, W11, to 18 March The Suppliant WomenAeschylus’s play in which the 50 daughters of King Danos flee forced marriage may be 2,500 years old, but it couldn’t seem more modern in this new version by David Greig, first seen in Edinburgh last year and now remounted for the Royal Exchange. Utilising a chorus of local women, this is an evening that seems startlingly modern as it asks big questions about democracy, freedom, female agency and asylum seekers.Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, 9 March to 1 AprilHedda GablerBoasting a brilliant central performance from Ruth Wilson, who doesn’t seek to explain Hedda, only present her in all her multifaceted complexity, this might not be Ivo van Hove’s greatest production but it is fascinating to watch. Rafe Spall is a particularly repellent Judge Brack in an evening that gradually closes down Hedda’s options until she is almost totally diminished.National Theatre: Lyttelton, SE1, to 21 MarSinners ClubRuth Ellis was the last woman to be executed in Britain, hanged in 1955 for shooting dead her lover, David Blakely. This show – an enticing mix of theatre and gig – doesn’t directly tell her story, but conjures the era and ponders heartbreak, jealousy and our fascination with peroxide blonde bad girls through allusion, connections and unexpected collisions.Theatr Clwyd, Mold, to 18 March Dance      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Tree Of Codes.
