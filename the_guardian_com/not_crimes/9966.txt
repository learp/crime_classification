I am devastated by the news of Zsa Zsa Gabor’s passing because I had every intention of marrying her, even though I knew her running joke about being just a housekeeper – every time she got a divorce, she kept the house.Don’t get me wrong, I lament the loss of every grande dame who knew the Austro-Hungarian empire, and I don’t envy her those final years of falling out of bed while watching television, strokes and so on. I followed the reading of her last rites, and I am respectful, but I knew that she was only playing with the world – it would be the last wrongs that signalled curtains.You’re wondering whether this is in bad taste? Of course it is, yet bad taste was Zsa Zsa’s Tokay. I know there are vestiges of the career of an actor to be discerned, but let’s be clear about this: Zsa Zsa went straight from nonentity to celebrity (that modern destiny) and she did it years before the rest of the world had caught on to the trick. She was a pathfinder who wrote a different autobiography every 10 years or so to bookend her masterpiece, How to Get a Man, How to Keep a Man, and How to Get Rid of a Man. At least she never had to write a book called How to Bore a Man to Death.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Gabor in Moulin Rouge. Photograph: ITV/RexThe men in her life included husbands like Conrad Hilton (the hotel magnate) and George Sanders (the most melancholy of the great actors), not forgetting General Rafael Trujillo. No, nearly the only ones she forgot were you and me, and perhaps you know more than you’re saying.She was Miss Hungary in 1936 (a fantastic year for Magyar pulchritude). She was a modestly witty figure on TV game shows – though her true metier was as guest celebrity. She did walk on and off in a few movies, like John Huston’s Moulin Rouge and Orson Welles’s Touch of Evil. She went to jail for three days for slapping a traffic cop who had impeded her – “This happens every time I go fucking shopping,” she is said to have said.And that’s the truth about Zsa Zsa and her 99 years. She was reported, she was photographed, she was joked about, she got married and divorced, she shopped. So she didn’t make important discoveries in the field of radar, as Hedy Lamarr did. And she didn’t make immense contributions to charity or clasp stricken and hungry children to her bosoms, like Angelina Jolie. No, she kept her bosoms for wearing low-cut dresses and she knew that husbands and shopping and being said to have said things is a full life.So … I had every intention of marrying her, but I was busy myself and I had a few entanglements to disentangle. I suppose she knew I was never going to be able to come up with the jewellery she was used to. OK, but I was fond of her and I would have laughed at her jokes – even if they weren’t jokes. There are marriages that manage on less.
