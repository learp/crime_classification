Much of the buzz at New York fashion week has been at the business end of the industry. The See Now, Buy Now trend, for designers to sell clothes straight off the runway, was the height of innovation.That was until Thursday afternoon and Marc Jacobs’ show. In a move familiar to many in the front row, the designer once again closed the schedule with a show that visually and creatively killed what came before it.

It certainly was. To a soundtrack of Underworld’s 1996 hit, Born Slippy, models wearing 15cm high platform boots, pastel dreadlocks, stripy knee socks and dinner-plate-sized sleeves stalked a high catwalk of New York’s Hammerstein ballroom, lit by bare bulbs hanging down on wires.There were dresses with Marie Antoinette worthy frills, camo jackets with ruffles around the bottom, short sequin skirts in rainbow colours and sweet buttoned up blouses with marabou feathers. The overall impression was frankly mad compared with the sensible uptown elegance seen at the majority of New York shows.New York fashion week spring/summer 2017: 10 key shows – in pictures This was a hot mess of ideas, as if manga character Sailor Moon, Almost Famous’s Penny Lane and Die Antwoord’s Yolandi Visser had a lovechild. Supermodels including Gigi and Bella Hadid, Karlie Kloss and Jourdan Dunn were in this show – but they were unrecognisable here, transformed, partly through a raised catwalk and huge shoes, into giant alien-like figments of Jacobs’ vivid imagination. Jacobs’ take on fashion has always been about youth culture and rebellion – since he was sacked from Perry Ellis in 1992 for his now infamous ‘grunge’ collection. Now 53, he still has that spirit.Spring 2017 could be seen as a kind of collage of youth subcultures – psychedelia, cyberpunk, goth, gothic Lolita and rave included. But it wasn’t just ideas. Taken apart, there was some pieces that could – if they were available – be worn straight off the runway.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A model during the Marc Jacobs show.

Bags with everything from Saturn to eyes and a cat face appliquéd onto them will be snapped up by anyone out for likes on Instagram. Most things were covered with embellishment – sequins, embroidery, patched leather and fringing, sometimes all in one outfit. This was a show with maximum immediate impact, put together with clothes worth waiting for.The only downer came through the news that Jacobs, usually paying court backstage post-show to journalists and congratulators, accompanied by a Marlboro Light, had left the building as the applause rang out. The audience had to be content with a quick bow and a weary wave from a leather trouser-wearing designer this season.

Suhl has taken this into account for the brand’s strategy going forward.A focus on bags at the more affordable end of the designer price tag – with 70% of bags under $500 (£380) in each collection – is designed to catch the attention of this customer. They will no doubt be on board once again with this collection, with youth right at the heart of it.

Since leaving Louis Vuitton three years ago, he has put all his attention into his eponymous line. A beauty line was launched in 2013 and he closed the diffusion line Marc by Marc Jacobs last year, with the idea of putting more affordable clothes into the main line collection which he directly oversees.New York fashion week concluded on Thursday. The focus now turns to London where shows start on Friday morning.
