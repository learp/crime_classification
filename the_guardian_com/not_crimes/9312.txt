They are just goods and commodities. I don’t feel like I own them. Once someone pays the copyright, it’s none of my business.”If Raimi signs on, it would be his first film as director since 2013’s Oz the Great and Powerful, which made $493m worldwide but received largely negative reviews. He has since been involved with Ash vs Evil Dead, the TV series based on his horror franchise.
