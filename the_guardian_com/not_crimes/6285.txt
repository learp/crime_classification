Hometown: Mossley.The lineup: Lee Broadbent (lead vocals), Joe Martin (vocals, guitar), Eoghan Clifford (guitar), Stephen Evans (bass), Asa Morley (drums).The background: Cabbage have been described as “Manchester’s most exciting new band”, a phrase still guaranteed to tantalise, even if you happen to believe the last musical aggregate of note the city produced was a quarter-century ago. It wouldn’t be hard, on the 40th anniversary of the Sex Pistols laying siege at the Lesser Free Trade Hall, to argue that Manchester has produced more great music than anywhere else in Britain these last four decades. So the idea that Cabbage – from Mossley, an insignificant dead zone eight miles east of Manchester – might be the next in line after Buzzcocks, Magazine, the Fall, Joy Division, New Order, A Certain Ratio, the Smiths, Happy Mondays, 808 State and A Guy Called Gerald makes them at least worthy of investigation. Actually, turns out they’re more like a northern version of Fat White Family’s southern uproar, with a dash of the Fall’s garage rumble and Shaun Ryder’s dingy surrealism. The name Cabbage suggests they’re steeped in the banal minutiae of British life and so it proves, with their songs about dinner ladies and austerity, but there is a political inflection that gives them an angry charge. They call it an “idiosyncratic, satirical attack in the form of discordant neo post-punk”, and there is a similar sense of literate but degenerate transgression to FWF, with a penchant for juvenilia, if not outright scatology and coprophilia. In one song the protagonist, a male food operative at a public school, does end up having a “wank in the quiche”, and in the video to another they liquidise a bunch of food detritus and pour the resulting brown goo all over themselves, with shades of Earl Sweatshirt’s gob-smacking video to Earl. Perhaps not surprisingly, they’re fans of the vile, vilified GG Allin. “GG Allin is a big inspiration,” says singer-guitarist Joe Martin, whose dad went to school with Thomas “Mensi” Mensforth of Oi! band the Angelic Upstarts. “Lee [Broadbent, lead vocals] showed me a video of him on stage, having a shit and getting his little willy out, and it fascinated me. He’s a true heart-on-sleeve original, who died for his cause. It may not have been a very focused cause, but he was artistically great.” Martin considers the other Cabbagers “a bunch of scruffy bastards”, adding, “I was instantly at home when I found them – I realised I wasn’t the only one who hadn’t had a wash.” He likes “the thought that anything can happen” at a Cabbage gig, and indeed concerts have seen all the members disrobing, although in his defence this is largely because “it gets really hot”. It’s not, he argues, premeditated, merely the corollary of their going-for-it attitude that is itself the result of them getting wound up by matters both trivial and titanic. “Unless you’ve had your head in a washing machine for your entire adult life, how are you not writing about something political?” wonders Martin of his disengaged indie peers. “It’s baffling. No bands are saying anything whatsoever.”Cabbage have mixed feelings about their home turf, aware that the city’s future cannot merely be based on its admittedly impressive history. “It’s dying from resting on its laurels,” moans Martin, who prefers the doomy, dark Manchester of Joy Division to the acid-house happy iteration of the Roses et al. “We’re not claiming to be bastions of originality, but it doesn’t seem to take much effort to step away from the past. Manchester got that big, exploded, and the ashes are everywhere. Someone needs to blow the cobwebs off. You only have to walk down the street and see all the Liam Gallagher-alikes with their sideburns flapping in the wind to see it. It’s 20 years since Knebworth, and people are still talking about it. Tony Wilson said, ‘We do things differently here.’ That’s died a death.”One response to this moribund state is the acrid grotesquerie of Cabbage’s music and videos. A class-war diatribe, new single Dinner Lady – out now on Tim Burgess’ Ogenesis label – opens with one of the band vomiting into a bin. In Kevin, which explores the nature of consciousness and “the debate between reproduction and immortality”, bassist Stephen Evans plays a religious cult leader who violently inducts the other members into his sect before brainwashing them.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest From their Le Chou EP, Contactless Payment and Austerity Languish examine what it’s like to live in Brexit Britain with no money or prospects. Musically, Cabbage haven’t alighted upon a new paradigm to match, say, the Mondays’ squalid funk and scabrous disco, but new songs Necro Flat in the Palace and It’s Grim Up North Korea, which draws parallels between British working-class life and Kim Jong-un’s DPRK, indicate a move in the right direction, the latter evincing a degree of motorik propulsion. And Corbyn rant Terrorist Synthesiser will, promises Martin, find them “experimenting in other musical realms”. But you get the impression Cabbage eschew hipster genres like krautrock in favour of opting for something more primitive. All the better to simply communicate their bleak message: that this age is a mess. But are they as unruly as they seem? “No, we’re very polite,” reassures Martin, who studied music journalism at college, so he can’t be all bad. “Our northern-boy charms will get us a long way.”The buzz: “Manchester’s most exciting new band.” The truth: They’re a scabrous object in the path of the obvious. Most likely to: Throw light on the parlous sociopolitical situation in this country. Least likely to: Throw up.
