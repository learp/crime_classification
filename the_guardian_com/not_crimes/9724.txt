Beards are being discarded. On the catwalks, smooth cheekbones led the way as purposeful Prada men set out on their urban hikes to work, faces as soft and oiled as a puppy’s tummy. Shaving used to be about pain. You’d scratch away the stubble with a Bic and then splash on the Old Spice, recoiling as if bitten by a snake. Back then, pouring alcohol on open wounds was what it meant to be a man. So discovering after-shave balm – basically a moisturiser that isn’t a manure for acne – was a wonderful moment. Now it’s all about creams to take the pain and fire away, and leave you cool and silky, at least for an hour or so.Get the lookNeal’s Yards Calming Balm £15.50 nealsyardremedies.com Susanne Kaufman Balm £44 libertylondon.com Creed £85 creedfragrances.co.uk Carthusia £32 carterandbond.comAveda Dual Action £29 aveda.co.uk Hawkins & Brimble £8.95 hawkinsandbrimble.co.uk Kiehl’s Repair Gel £24 kiehls.co.uk Miller Harris £22 millerharris.com Bed Head Balm Down £9.99 available in salonsRoger & Gallet £12 marksandspencer.comNow’s the time to…Miaow.
