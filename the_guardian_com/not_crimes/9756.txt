This week’s best city stories from around the world see a pro-cycling scheme in London hitting bumps in the road – but an “e-highway” plan in LA getting the green light. Meanwhile, we explore “skateboard urbanism” in US cities and Berlin’s food revolution.We’d love to hear your responses to these stories and any others you’ve read recently, both at Guardian Cities and elsewhere: share your thoughts in the comments below.Trouble DutchOver the last week, a pro-cycling scheme known as “Mini Holland” has been tested in Walthamstow, London – to a less-than-positive reaction. As CityMetric reports, the project – funded by Waltham Forest council and Transport for London – aims to create a cycle-friendly urban quarter through traffic calming, pocket parks and a Cycle Superhighway. The name of the project is meant to reflect the popular cycling culture in the Netherlands, where most journeys are made by bike. But the necessary restriction of cars as part of the Walthamstow scheme has angered local businesses. Stella Creasy, the local MP, has asked the council to clarify how residents can give their feedback on the trial. Walthamstow may not be ready to turn into a miniature Holland just yet.Skateboard urbanismIn Philadelphia, a group dedicated to raising funds for a skatepark are demonstrating, as Next City describes, a growing movement of “civically engaged skateboarders who are taking city building seriously”. So-called “skateboard urbanism” reflects the ways that spaces in cities are being created or protected for skateboarding, with the will and commitment of active groups of skaters and their advocates. This has been seen recently in London, with the battle to keep the Southbank Centre’s undercroft as a dedicated space for skating. In Seattle, skateboarding is not only welcomed at skateparks, but at “skate spots” and “skate dots” across neighbourhoods. Downtown Portland, for its part, has even designated special skateboard routes. Tallinn-ho!Finland and Estonia could find themselves with a new connection. Authorities in Helsinki and Tallinn are looking into the possibility of linking the two cities via an undersea tunnel – and have commissioned a feasibility study, with the help of the EU. As CityMetric reports, the “Talsinkifix” rail link project would cost €9bn at current prices, and, at a minimum of 50km from one coast to the other, would be the longest undersea tunnel in the world. LA’s e-highwayOne part of a 20-mile road in LA known as the Alameda Corridor – used mostly by large, exhaust-spewing trucks transporting goods – is going to become an innovative “e-highway” next year. As CityLab explains, the project aims to reduce and potentially eliminate the pollution problems caused by the heavy truck traffic. The experimental e-highway, which will first be built along one mile of the corridor as a test, involves an overhead catenary system to which trucks can attach. Although these trucks have to be specially outfitted hybrid or all-electric vehicles, once connected, they will pull all their power from the overhead lines, rather like some streetcars do ... and become emission-free. It’s a small start, but the organisers hope the project could eventually be upscaled to a network of emission-free routes.Beyond OktoberfestThis month, a new food festival in Berlin will aim to help encourage the movement of locally produced food in cities to become more accessible, inclusive and affordable. Stadt Land Food will involve educational workshops that cover all aspects of urban food, from production to preparation and consumption. Tremors magazine takes a look at the festival and other independent initiatives in Germany’s capital creating a “food revolution” by addressing the challenge of feeding an ever-increasing population. Original Unverpackt is Germany’s first packaging-free supermarket; Infarm is a seed-to-table project that shows the value and viability of micro-farming. Roof Water Farm explores decentralised water use and aquaponic farming. There’s even an urban foraging app, which notifies users of nearby fruiting trees. What do you think of Walthamstow’s plans? Are e-highways like the one in LA a good idea? Share your thoughts in the comments belowCan e-trikes revolutionise Amsterdam’s food system?How the bullet train made Tokyo into a monster
