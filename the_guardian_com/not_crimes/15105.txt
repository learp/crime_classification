10.00pm BST22:00Apologies again for the tech glitch that prevented us starting on time. But thank you for staying with us and we look forward to normal service - twits doing daftness with commentary - resuming next week. See you in the comments!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.59pm BST21:59Next week, they are throwing the team right into the pit with the advertising challenge. It looks like Alan gets pretty angry about jeans next week. Something to look forward to.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.58pm BST21:58Michelle is bitter and thinks Rebecca is skating on very thin ice. Back at the house, the teams welcome back Alana and Rebecca and quiz them on what the firing finger jamboree is like.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.57pm BST21:57As the drums build it’s Michelle! The PM is fired and she thanks Alan for the opportunity. The opportunity to run around London like a pillock, and have it filmed for TV.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.56pm BST21:56Alan’s summarising and he starts with Rebecca. She’s a bit meh, Alana didn’t something or other, Michelle didn’t boss good.But Rebecca feels the crosshairs hot on her forehead.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.55pm BST21:55Alan says Michelle didn’t take control of her team properly. When do we think we’re going to find out Alana was actually named after Alan by her Apprentice super-fan mum? Perhaps there’ll be a subplot which reveals she’s actually Alan’s daughter? I’m drifting off while they argue.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.53pm BST21:53In terms of television, I suppose Rebecca would be the least noticeable loss on account of her not making any kind of impression at all. It would be like Lord Sugar firing water or air.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.52pm BST21:52Alana and Michelle turn on Rebecca because she looks a bit weak and an easy target because she sold nowt.Claude also has it in for her. Is she to be the first sacrifice for blending into the wallpaper?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.51pm BST21:51Karrren tucks into Alana while the three wait outside. It’s not long before they are marched back in. Who is getting the firing finger right in their mush?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.51pm BST21:51It’s reality show tradition that a woman should go first. The world is a misogynist. Business is a misogynist.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.50pm BST21:50Trishna has put in quite a chippy boardroom performance so far, saying she knew it was all bobbins and she was the only one who tried to do it properly. All eyes turn towards Michelle for want of a better scapegoat. She brings back Alana and Rebecca. I don’t think she even knows who Rebecca is. I certainly don’t.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.48pm BST21:48Grainne appeared briefly there, frozen in the headlights. Has she spoken yet or is she a Westworld escapee stuck in a reverie?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.48pm BST21:48Frances (no distinguishing features so far) blames Alana as sub-team leader for the poor pricing policy at the car boot. Natalie (Scots) apologies for selling two £300 vases for £15. I hope the vases’ new owner is watching tonight and drinking champagne out of those vases.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.46pm BST21:46Lord Sugar aims both barrels at the team in general and Aleksandra (god it takes a long time to type her name) jumps straight in and blames the team leader with a side order of Alana.

That’s how austere this segment gets. They don’t deserve china.The arguing begins. Michelle says she isn’t here to make friends and starts fighting for her life. Everyone blames everyone else but not for long as they’re back in boardroom hell.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.43pm BST21:43Never mind the boys lindy-hopping.
