As anyone who has witnessed their sweat-drenched live shows can attest, Vancouver two-piece Japandroids are one of the most exciting guitar bands on the planet. Direct, euphoric and really, really loud, their garage punk combines the psych-tinged lo-fi sounds of the late-1960s Nuggets era, with the later intensity of punk and hardcore.After a break of four years, the duo – drummer and vocalist Dave Prowse and guitarist and vocalist Brian King – return this month with Near to the Wild Heart of Life. To mark its release, we asked them to discuss their top 10 favourite garage punk LPs. “We had a really long debate about what does and doesn’t count as garage punk,” Prowse explains. “We spent ages going: ‘Is this garage rock? Is this proto punk?’ And then, at a certain point, we just went: ‘Fuck it, let’s just pick the albums we like and we can justify where they sit.’”The Who – The Who Sings My Generation (1965)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest DP: I feel this might be a controversial opinion because the Who are considered a classic rock band but, when I think of garage punk, I think of the Nuggets compilation album. And when you put on songs from The Who Sings My Generation (the US version of My Generation) next to a song off Nuggets, it seamlessly goes together. You could argue it’s more sophisticated songwriting than what the Sonics were doing, but it still has that primal energy. The Who were like five different bands over the course of their career. You listen to something off that record and then you listen to Baba O’Riley and it’s like: “How the hell is this the same band?”The Sonics – Boom (1966)DP: Any “best of garage rock and punk” lists are always going to feature this record, for good reason. I bought it sight unseen, when I was 19. I had a total shitbox car that had this cassette deck and I had to hook up my Discman into the adapter thing. I remember running that CD in my car and listening to the first few chords of Cinderella and just being like: “Holy shit, this band are just fucking changing the way I view music.” I had that visceral feeling you get from listening to the Sonics, where you feel the speaker might break because everything is being played so loud, so passionately. There’s a great tension in their records where you feel like, at any moment, the thing is going to implode.Witch – In the Past (1974)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest DP: Witch were a 70s band from Zambia. There’s really not much information online about them. In the Past is a record I stumbled on by happenstance and become obsessed with. It’s in that Nuggets realm, but I would say it’s almost psychedelic soul music from the 70s. It’s one of my secret weapons for parties. If I have a bunch of people over, and I throw this on, everybody perks up and goes: “What the hell is this?”Iggy Pop and James Williamson – Kill City (1977)BK: There’s a lot of debate over what counts as garage punk. But in terms of what influenced garage punk, it has to be the Stooges. Kill City was designed to be the fourth Stooges record, after Raw Power. Because of some kind of naming dispute with their label, they couldn’t use the name the Stooges. But, really, it’s the final Stooges album. They’re similar to the Velvet Underground – they made four pretty defining records that are all quite different. Kill City doesn’t sound like Raw Power, in the same way that Raw Power doesn’t sound like Fun House, but there’s still a quality that links them all that’s definitively the Stooges. Of course there’s Iggy’s voice, but there’s also that wild, loose spirit.The Gun Club – Fire of Love (1981)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest BK: The Gun Club played a big role in the evolution of Japandroids. We even covered one of their songs on our second record. There was a lot of debate over whether they’re garage punk – they incorporate blues, punk, country and garage rock. They used a lot of imagery from the American south in their work, like a modern take on Delta blues music, but they do it in a faster, more aggressive, punk-rock way. The guitarist, Kid Congo Powers, went on to play for the Cramps and then Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. So they were a great gateway band for us. And I heard a lot of great Delta blues that I wouldn’t have discovered without them.The Cramps – Stay Sick! (1990)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest BK: I could definitely talk about the Cramps for a long time. Their first two records [Songs the Lord Taught Us and Psychedelic Jungle] are considered to be their most iconic, but Stay Sick! is the first album I got. They’re a very cool-looking band. With garage punk, it’s not the easiest genre in the world to really stand out, to have a sound that’s unique. It’s a genre where the more you sound like something that’s already been done, the better. Whereas the Cramps are one of those bands who are like: “We’re going to do the opposite, we’re going to be so over the top and wild.” That’s why they’re still one of the greats. There’s no mistaking the Cramps.The Murder City Devils – In Name and Blood (2000)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest BK: This is a quintessential Japandroids-influencing record. When we started a band, there were 10 artists we really loved and we decided to mix their sounds together and find our sound. One of the defining things about the Murder City Devils is that they use the organ really prominently. When you go back to 60s garage rock, the organ sound is an essential part of that. By the 70s, though, the organ began to be associated with progressive rock, and fell out of fashion with garage rockers. But the Murder City Devils were totally repping the old school super-eerie, but also catchy, organ sound. And that’s one of the things that made them stand out.Dead Moon – Echoes of the Past (2006)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest BK: Dead Moon were one of the two big rock bands that came out of Portland, Oregon, in the 80s. The other one is the Wipers, who are better known because Nirvana covered them. Dead Moon is a classic guitar, drums, bass, vocal setup, but very raw and direct. They have quite a few albums, so they’re not the easiest band from which to grab a record and pick your favourite. But a few years ago, Sub Pop released Echoes of the Past, a best-of with all the songs selected by lead singer Fred Cole. It’s a perfect introduction. It’s the kind of record you just put on in the car and cruise – an hour of great garage punk music.Hot Snakes – Thunder Down Under (2006)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest DP: This is where what is and isn’t garage punk gets a little dicey. But, to me, Hot Snakes represent a garage band without being a throwback. They’re not trying to sound like they existed in 1967, but they have that blood in their veins. They have that same sense of ferocity and wildness about them as the best 60s garage rock records, but played three times as fast, and the singer is screaming instead of singing. Thunder Down Under is a live recording for Australian radio station Triple J and it’s incredible. They’re so crazy tight.Slam Dunk – The Shivers (2011)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest DP: Slam Dunk are a band from Victoria, near our home city of Vancouver. They fit in the same realm as Hot Snakes – not as aggressive – but The Shivers has the same elements of garage rock from a bygone era, except it’s modern and three times as fast. Slam Dunk are very creative musicians and great showmen – goofy, wacky, super-energetic, rambunctious dudes. Rambunctiousness – that feels like an important element of garage punk!
