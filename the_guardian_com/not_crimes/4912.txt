Nina Willner’s childhood was, on the surface, little different from that of her classmates in Kansas, deep in America’s midwest. School, piano lessons, sports matches, camping trips, television, plenty of food: Nina – and in due course her five siblings – enjoyed the trappings of 1960s suburban America. There was, though, Nina realised, one large difference. Her friends had grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins. Where, she asked aged five, were hers?The explanation was baffling. “We learned they were behind an iron curtain. What do you mean they can’t get out? A curtain, wait, I’ll go pull that aside,” recalls Nina, now 55. It was, she vaguely understood, no ordinary bit of window dressing. “It must be huge. I thought it must go up to the sky. I somehow realised we were lucky.”Nina’s mother, Hanna, had grown up in the village of Schwaneberg, about 100 miles south-west of Berlin. She was 17 when, with the second world war over, Russian troops rolled in. Germany was being carved up among the allied victors and the villagers were now in Soviet-controlled East Germany.As life grew harder – with food, land and the school curriculum taken over by the Communist party and the zone’s borders ever more harshly policed – Hanna became increasingly unhappy. In 1948, a week before she was due to collect her high-school diploma, she bought a return train ticket to the city of Magdeburg, telling her family she was going to register at teacher training college. But she was really planning to escape. Two previous attempts to reach the West had left her fully aware of the risks. She had been fired on. Her family was already being watched.

The rest of the group was rounded up, but Hanna hid in a barn where a woman and her son were living. When the guards came looking, the woman pretended Hanna was her niece. The son had struck up a relationship of sorts with the guards, giving them things in return for letting him cross back and forth. He told them Hanna was his cousin visiting her grandmother in the West, handed over cigarettes and she got through.She had nothing with her but a small case containing a photograph of her parents and seven siblings, 10 marks and a warm jumper.“It was heartbreaking for my mother. She was little more than a teenager,” says Nina.Hanna settled in Heidelberg, where she learned English, found a job with the US army and married a serviceman, Eddie, an Auschwitz survivor with American citizenship. In 1960, the couple moved back to America, where Nina was born.It would be 40 years before Hanna and her family were reunited.In November 1989, Hanna and Nina (by then herself the mother of two young children) watched stunned as images of the Berlin Wall being torn down were relayed on American TV.“We just couldn’t get it into our heads. It took days to sink in,” says Nina. “My mother kept waiting to hear that the borders had been closed again.” In East Germany, Nina learned later, her relatives were even more shocked and wary. “They thought it was another trick to ferret out the non-believers.”Five months later, Hanna and Eddie flew to Frankfurt to meet her five surviving siblings and their families. “When the reunion came, it was epic,” says Nina. “There were tears for months and months. They knew the family could have been destroyed. Everybody knew what it meant to come back together. And everybody knew what they lost in those 40 years.”Hanna’s parents had died, as had three of her brothers – Roland, the oldest and Hanna’s favourite, only one year earlier. “That was very tough.” In all the years of separation, says Nina, Hanna never resigned herself to losing her family.“Letters, when they did get through, were already open and usually devoid of information.” Letters announcing the deaths of two brothers were withheld, Hanna only finding out through devastatingly oblique references a year later.On the bureau in her bedroom, recalls Nina, Hanna kept the few photographs she had. “There was a family frozen in time, her brothers as little boys. I would look them over and wonder who they really were.”To a large extent, to Nina if not to her mother, this proof of existence was enough. “My father’s family had all died in the Holocaust so having this side of the family – even if we couldn’t actually see them – was particularly important.”Nina enjoyed helping her mother to pack parcels. “She was always packing boxes. Clothes, knitted blankets, food, soaps, cigarettes, trinkets, nail clippers, anything she could think they might need.” Few parcels reached their destination. Cigars, clothes, grapefruit were all intercepted. There were occasional successes, though. A swimming costume sent for Nina’s cousin Cordula – a promising athlete who was later selected for East Germany’s cycling team – was particularly treasured.Though Nina would not meet Cordula until after the fall of the wall, their paths had almost crossed earlier. After graduating in 1982, Nina joined the US army as an intelligence officer. She was posted to Berlin, undertaking regular reconnaissance missions into East Berlin at the same time Cordula was training in the city’s velodrome.“The moment we passed through Checkpoint Charlie I knew we were in my mother’s family’s country. They were somewhere there,” says Nina. “The contrast with the West was stark. We were followed immediately. There was very little movement, few people around. It felt eerie, grey, dark. It gave me a much clearer sense of what my mother – who always had so much spirit – had escaped.”During one visit from her parents, Nina arranged a bus tour into East Berlin. Hanna, immediately struck by anxiety, was unable to complete the outing. “She was safe. We were with the US army, but she felt so frightened she couldn’t get off the bus.” It was, for Nina, an important moment. “I had never seen her like that. It was a visceral reaction. I understood.”Today, Nina is delighted that her children can enjoy the extended family she once missed. “We all visit. We talk. We send pictures. I even get weekly reports from my aunt Heidi on what is growing in the garden. We all know how important it is. We have come full circle and there is no going back.”• Forty Autumns by Nina Willner is published by Little, Brown, £20.
