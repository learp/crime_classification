2.05pm GMT14:05That's all we have time for  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 2:03pmThanks everyone for taking part in this webchat. If you take nothing from this experience, please remember the following things. Number one, #Calman4DoctorWho. Number two, Grey's Anatomy is brilliant. Number three, being emotional is fine. Number four: things will get better. See you soon Orkney!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.04pm GMT14:04mrszombie asks:How terrifying do you find standup? I saw you in Bath and you seemed close to tears at the end - was it with relief or dismay? We were a nice audience.  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 2:02pmI think that was because of the show I was doing rather than fear of standup. I tend to do shows that are about something and can get quite emotional. Sometimes people are frightened of emotion; I am not. I cry quite a lot, almost constantly - in fact I'm crying right now. I'm always the kind of standup who will show how they feel about things. That is not a sign of weakness to me - it's a positive thing. I am absolutely fine. I have five cats.Updatedat 2.04pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.02pm GMT14:02shanecois asks:Is 2016 the worst year for humanity since the second world war?  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 2:00pmI think it's fair to say that this has not been the best of years. However, sometimes things get worse before they get better. So, what we have to do is steel ourselves for a while in the hope that sunshine comes after the rain, which is also the title of one of my favourite 1990s dance track. But yes, it's been quite awful hasn't it? Why don't you watch some Grey's Anatomy - that always cheers me up.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.01pm GMT14:01James Mcgeorge asks:Susan, do you have any plans for the Zombie apocalypse? If you could fight your way to salvation through the flesh munching hordes who would you take as your sidekick?  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 1:59pmIf there was an apocalypse, I would try and find Clare Balding. She seems to me to be cheerful during adversity, but also a very sensible woman who I could rely upon during stressful times. She can also, as I understand, ride a horse. And that will probably become the main mode of transport in the future. I cannot ride a horse, therefore I would require to be taught, by Clare Balding.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.59pm GMT13:59jamesbranch asks:This webchat clashes with Gareth Southgate’s England press conference. How do you feel about that?  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 1:57pmI apologise sincerely. I didn't have it marked in my diary. Hope all is well at the press conference.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.58pm GMT13:58mccaffepj asks:When you’ve starred on ‘The News Quiz’, ‘Just a Minute’ or ‘Clue’, which fellow panelist made you laugh the most?  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 1:56pmJeremy Hardy has made me laugh more than anyone else has at times on the News Quiz. The sexual tension between the two of us is palpable at times, but I also enjoy working on I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue with Tim Brook-Taylor and Graham Garden and Barry Cryer. Barry often phones me for a chat of an afternoon and he is a delightful and hilarious man in every way. Barry still listens and watches comedy avidly and will often call me to tell me about something he's seen, because he keeps up to date; he's sharp and pointed and satirical, and I could listen to his stories all night.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.56pm GMT13:56James Mcgeorge asks:What was the happiest moment of your life, so far?  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 1:54pmThe happiest moment of my life was when I married my wife. We had previously become civil partnered and as soon as the law came in to force, we went to Glasgow city chambers, just the two or us and the registrar and upgraded to full marriage. Having fought for equal marriage most of my life, the idea that it had finally happened was mindblowing. We went to the pub afterwards and had a quiet drink just celebrating what we had achieved. I never thought growing up under section 28 that it would ever happen in my lifetime. It was a great day for equality in this country.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.54pm GMT13:54ClaphamBlackCoat asks:You are indeed a very funny standup but I have always wondered how you combine being a full-time entertainer and leader of the Scottish Conservatives?  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 1:51pmGosh, that's a funny joke. I've never heard that one before. I have tried for many months to tell people that I'm not Ruth Davidson. Just because we are both Scottish lesbians does not mean we are the same person. In the same way, I am not Rhona Cameron. Although, I did have a lovely time on the night of the final Brexit debate, thanking people for how good my performance was with Sadiq Khan. So, just to reiterate for a final time, I am not Ruth Davidson.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.53pm GMT13:53Andy Murray is the most attractive manvammyp asks:Who would you rather go for a pint with? Andy Murray, or that paperclip that gives you advice on Word?  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 1:50pmI feel I should start my answer with a confession. I am in many ways the most gay woman who has ever lived, but I have feelings for Andy Murray which are very, very wrong. I think he is the most attractive man I have ever seen in my life. I saw his mother Judy during the Edinburgh fringe and hid behind a bin because I didn't want her to meet me looking like I was looking. I think he is the most extraordinary man, feminist, sportsman, and all round hunk of burning love that I have ever seen. I have never met him and I'm worried that if I do, I will launch myself at him like an Exocet missile. So the answer to your question is: I'd rather go for a pint with the paperclip, because I don't know how I would behave if I actually met my future husband.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm GMT13:49David Burdon asks:Did you actually play Chuckie Egg in your youth? Evidence says otherwise.  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 1:47pmI take it you are referring to my performance on Go 8 Bit, where I was appalling at Chuckie Egg. In my defence, when I was younger, I used a keyboard to control the characters and in this TV show I was given a shit joystick. I did play Chuckie Egg, I was good at Chuckie Egg, and sometimes – and I don't wish to alarm you – television lies.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.48pm GMT13:48Bob Pite asks:Hi Susan,We love you. My daughter’s a lawyer and works ridiculously long hours. We keep talking about starting a goat farm instead. Do you think that’s a good alternative career?Bob  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 1:46pmIt's a brilliant alternative career. My dream is to open a greyhound and donkey sanctuary. Perhaps we could collaborate?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.47pm GMT13:47Biddy Radford asks:Can you promise me that you will apply for the job as the next Dr Who when the present incarnation regenerates?  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 1:46pmI will. It has always been my dream to be the doctor. I think now is the time for this to happen. It is also quite useful that Peter Capaldi is there just now, because the storyline I imagine is that I am a small part of his conscious that breaks off in a vortex requiring only a partial regeneration, hence why I'm so short. I firmly believe that enough people get behind the campaign of Calman 4 Doctor Who, I will get the part, hopefully the millions of people reading this webchat will get on board. #Calman4DoctorWhoFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.44pm GMT13:44mackal asks:Glasgow or Edinburgh?  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 1:43pmWhat an interesting question. If you are not from Scotland you may not know of the traditional rivalry between these two cities. I am from Glasgow, and my wife is from Edinburgh. She calls me a soap dodger, and I say she's tight with money. It's an old-fashioned romance in many ways. I still live in Glasgow, and to me, it is the best place to live in the world, although I enjoy my month's summer holiday in Edinburgh for the fringe every year. Glasgow rules!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.43pm GMT13:43JimCricket asks: Dear Susan, I’d like to start by thanking you for your very honest and unbelievably helpful book, ‘Cheer up love!’ I should also add how much I enjoy your appearances on the News Quiz and I’m waiting to see you team up with Sandy on QI! So lastly my question - Trump, Farage and Johnson, kill, snog, or marry (PS in my version of this game you’re allowed to kill all of them if you want) ;-)  Guardian contributor SusanCalman 14 November 2016 1:41pmWhat an interesting question. I had never thought about any of them in that way. I wouldn't like to kill them, nor snog them, not marry them. So if it's ok with you, I'd like to just ignore them.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
