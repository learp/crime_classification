Strawberry jam  Strawberry jamsMaribel Strawberry Conserve 450g, 99p, lidl.co.ukImmediately tastes of strawberries. Large pieces of fruit. A slightly perfumed flavour – I quite like that.★★★★Rosebud Preserves Strawberry Jam (Extra) 227g, £3.60, rosebudpreserves.co.ukGood texture: firm enough to stay together but loose enough to spread easily. A deep rich flavour. A bit too much jamminess.★★★Bonnie’s Jams Strawberry Jam 248g, £8.95, harrods.comSeparated into fruit and syrup. Nice toffee-ish flavour. It’s got consistency issues, might be a bit of a disaster on bread.★★★Tesco Finest Strawberry Conserve 340g, £1.50, tesco.comAlmost more jelly than jam. Some pieces of fruit, but mostly quite smooth. A straightforward jam, not setting my world on fire.★★Crunchy peanut butter  Crunchy peanut butterWhole Earth Original Crunchy Peanut Butter 340g, £2.99, wholeearthfoods.comPleasing, not too firm or claggy. You can see the little pieces of skin. Properly seasoned with a strong peanutty flavour. The salt really helps to bring it out. ★★★★Waitrose Duchy Organic Thick & Crunchy Peanut Butter 340g, £1.99, waitrose.comSolid texture, pale colour. The nuts probably haven’t been roasted very deeply. Lots of crunchy bits. ★★★★Koeze Peanut Butter 468g, £4.50, marksandspencer.comUnderseasoned. Almost has a slightly vegetal raw peanut flavour, not necessarily in a terrible way, just not what I like in a peanut butter. A bit bland.★★★Meridian Crunchy Peanut Butter 100% 280g, £1.99, meridianfoods.co.ukTastes like the kind sold in a health food co-op, hand ground by members of the commune. Really boring. I don’t like it.★Chocolate hazelnut spread  Chocolate hazelnut spreadVenchi Hazelnut Chocolate Spread 320g, £11.50, selfridges.co.ukIt’s got some cocoa bitterness but is sweet enough that children would like it. The best chocolate flavour.★★★Choco Nussa Chocolate Hazelnut Spread 400g, £1.29, lidl.co.ukLess of a professional texture which might suggest it doesn’t have as much vegetable oil? Lovely strong hazelnut flavour, it’s very very sweet though.★★★Tesco Finest Crunchy Hazelnut Choco Spread 200g, £1.29, tesco.comA child-friendly chocolate spread. I really like the pieces of hazelnut. It’s the equivalent of those chocolate Christmas tree decorations. Too sweet.★★Ocado Hazelnut Chocolate Spread 400g, £1.49, ocado.comThe dullest. I feel like it has the most sugar, maybe because it has a slightly grainy texture. I’m struggling to find cocoa. ★White sourdough  White sourdough breadWaitrose 1 White Sourdough 400g, £2.49, waitrose.comHalf-hearted slashes. As much hole as it is crumb. Not overly tangy and the texture is a bit dry. It would probably make great toast.★★★Taste the Difference San Francisco Style Sourdough 400g, £1.50, sainsburys.co.ukMisshapen, looks like one of those tear and share breads. Quite fluffy and tight for a sourdough. Very sour… a bit too tangy for me.★★Marks & Spencer Oak Smoked Sourdough 400g, £1.90, marksandspencer.comA tale of two breads - a crunchy, maybe slightly overbaked outside and then a fluffy generic inside. Tastes like smoked ham… bizarre.★Asda Sourdough Batard 450g, £1, asda.comOne side has a great tan but the other is a bit flabby. I don’t get the point of sourdoughs that don’t taste sour.★Baguette  BaguettesMarks & Spencer Baguette Rustique 315g, £1.50, marksandspencer.comLooks good, well cooked, nice ear action going on, Instagrammable. Crunchy crust. Good chewiness but still soft and fluffy. I would buy this.★★★★Taste the Difference White Baguette 520g, £1, sainsburys.co.ukA flatter shape. Tastes more like what I got in France. Slightly chewy, nice crust, good level of salt. Quite a decent loaf.★★★Asda Baker’s Selection White Baguette 400g, 75p, asda.comVery soft and fluffy. It’s fine, but the bread itself isn’t chewy. A generic British baguette – not terrible, just pretty boring.★★Lidl Bakery French Baguette 445g, 49p, lidl.co.ukIt’s obviously not but it feels like one of those part-baked baguettes. Gummy and bland. The only baguette thing about this is the shape.★Seeded loaf  Seeded loavesBEST BUY: Champion Multiseed Loaf 750g, £1.49, lidl.co.ukQuite heavy - you could prop open a door with it. Generous amount of seeds. It’s got that sourness of rye, and a slightly buckwheaty flavour.★★★★Waitrose Six Seeded Brown Batch Bread 400g, £1.37, waitrose.comIt’s got a nice texture, maybe a bit bland. A good canvas for something else. It has seedy interest. ★★★Taste the Difference Multiseeded Loaf 800g, £1.20, sainsburys.co.ukStandard shape, useful for sandwiches. It has a permatan going on. A very dry chewy crust. A bit boring. I’d like a bit more salt.★★Tesco Whole Seed Loaf 800g, £1.20, tesco.comIt’s a bit burnt on the top and the seeds are quite bitter. Nice distribution of seeds. Doesn’t really taste of much, it’s a bit bland and squidgy.★★
