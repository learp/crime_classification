A major new Andy Warhol exhibition, a retrospective of Robert Mapplethorpe’s photography and work by modernist artists Georgia O’Keeffe, Margaret Preston and Grace Cossington Smith are among the highlights of the Art Gallery of New South Wales’ 2017 program, which was announced on Tuesday.At the launch event, Wayne Tunicliffe – the gallery’s head curator of Australian art – spoke on an issue that has been plaguing public galleries in Australia: the gender diversity among collections. “If women hold up half the sky, it’s a miracle it’s not fallen on our heads in the state and national galleries,” he said. “We are working very hard to address that situation.” New survey paints grim picture of gender balance in Australian visual arts Among the Australian collection of AGNSW, Tunicliffe said that 56% of works made in the past 10 years came from women artists. He highlighted some involved in the 2017 program, including BC (formerly Brown Council), Pat Brassington and Mikala Dwyer.Following on from the record-breaking success of the Andy Warhol | Ai Weiwei show at the National Gallery of Victoria this year, Adman: Warhol Before Pop has been billed as one of the most comprehensive exhibitions assembled of the artist’s early work. Opening in February during the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, Adman will showcase Warhol’s output as a commercial illustrator in the 1950s, when he was commissioned by brands such as Tiffany’s, magazines including Vogue and Harper’s, leading Fifth Avenue department stores and the major art directors of Madison Avenue.More than 200 objects will be on display from the art and archival collections of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, including rare drawings and photographs, vintage ads, recreated department store windows and artist books, which dip into the pre-Mad Men, pre-pop era of commercial art and reveal Warhol’s development as a queer artist, and his early influences of Matisse, Cocteau and Picasso.
