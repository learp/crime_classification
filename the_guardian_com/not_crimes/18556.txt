Super Size Me director Morgan Spurlock is set to direct a biopic of pioneering Hollywood superagent Sue Mengers, it has been announced.According to Deadline, Spurlock’s production company has acquired rights to Brian Kellow’s Mengers biography Can I Go Now?, and the director is working on a script that may become his first dramatic feature.Mengers, who died in 2011 aged 81, was a celebrated Hollywood figure in the 1970s and 80s, very much identified with the Hollywood new wave. She represented key talent of the era, including Faye Dunaway, Candice Bergen, Peter Bogdanovich and Gene Hackman – though she was best known through her connection with Barbra Streisand, whose acting career she successfully piloted until the disastrous All Night Long (directed by Mengers’ husband Jean-Claude Tramont) in 1981.

More than that, I love people who buck the trend and do things that haven’t been done before and go into spaces unheard of, whether it be gender or race. Sue Mengers took over the boys’ club of Hollywood and did something groundbreaking.”
