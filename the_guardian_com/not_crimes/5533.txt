Phoenix Dance Theatre, NewtownabbeyAlthough they’ve been established some 35 years, Phoenix continue to trawl for interesting new work from a variety of sources. The latest addition to their repertory comes from distinguished choreographer Kate Flatt. Based on five of Shakespeare’s sonnets, Undivided Loves combines words and dance in an exploration of duplicity and desire. Also in the programme is Sharon Watson’s Melt, a fusion of aerial dance and floor-based choreography set to a score by Wild Beasts, and a revival of Itzik Galili’s Until.With/Out.Enough.Theatre At The Mill, Wed; touring to 17 JunAlexander Whitley Dance Company, LondonWhitley’s dances are fascinating not only for their intricate, inventive choreography but also for their investigations into philosophy, technology and design. In Pattern Recognition, the Sadler’s Wells New Wave Associate collaborates with artist Memo Akten to create a staged experiment in how we perceive and remember information in the digital age – basing the choreography and design on motion-responsive technology that corresponds to the two dancers as they move. The work is set to an original score composed by Oliver Coates and the pioneering sound artist Scanner.Platform Theatre, N1, Thu to 9 Apr
