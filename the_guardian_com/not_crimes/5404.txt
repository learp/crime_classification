Two unusual memoirs impressed the critics this month. Peacock and Vine, by AS Byatt, is “a short but luminous book”, according to Nick Rennison in the Sunday Times, in celebration of two men: “William Morris, high priest of the English Arts and Crafts movement … master of a dizzying variety of skills”, and “Mariano Fortuny, similarly multitalented, but less well known in Britain … one of a dynasty of Spanish artists [who] worked as an architect, photographer and inventor.” Or, as Frances Wilson put it in the Daily Telegraph: “William Morris, the roly-poly pre-Raphaelite with the bushy beard who made wallpaper a political cause [and] Mariano Fortuny, who designed Albertine’s favourite gown in A la Recherche du Temps Perdu”. Both admired the small but beautiful mini-biography, while Tanya Harrod in the Literary Review thought it “fascinating and original … We are given two lives as well as something approaching a miniature autobiography, for in following the twists and turns of her research we come closer to Byatt herself”. In the Darkroom by Susan Faludi is also, to some extent, a biography of two people: her violent, aggressively masculine father, Steven, who told her, in his later life, that he had begun living as Stefánie. In the Observer, Rachel Cooke was moved by this “out-and-out masterpiece of its kind”, particularly by a scene in a Holocaust museum. “First, it bewildered me, and then it disgusted me, and then, as she stood in that basement allowing the rage to rise inside her at last, it filled me with pity.” The New Statesman’s Helen Lewis was also impressed by Faludi’s sensitivity and avoidance of cliche. “Her father’s story resists the easy narratives so often applied to transgender memoirs: the butterfly emerging from a chrysalis, the rebirth, the person who can ‘at last be myself’. For most people, most of the time, identity isn’t that simple.” In the Financial Times, Horatia Harrod was also touched by the book: “[It] is filled with questions of history and identity, but it is above all an extraordinary act of love.”An unusual novel also delighted and confounded the critics, with the Scotsman’s Stuart Kelly even expressing sympathy with the publishing industry, which can barely keep up with Joanna Kavenna’s varied and prodigious output. Her new novel, A Field Guide to Reality, he wrote, “deals with the nature of light and enlightenment, quantum physics and strange attractors, grieving and gifting [but] is bristling with acute little observations … There is a very English kind of surrealism at play … This novel of Roger Bacon and baked beans, a comic metaphysical thriller, is a nebulous and sharp delight.” The plot concerns Eliade Jencks, explained Sofia Laing in the Telegraph, “whose casual but significant acquaintance with an Oxford professor moves him to leave her his great work, the ‘field guide’ … It doesn’t emphasise the ‘standard’ features of a novel, such as Forsterian round characters or narrative tension. Instead it opts to push the boundaries of what the novel is, playfully borrowing from other forms and genres … ” While David Collard in the Literary Review found it to be “a sophisticated and occasionally opaque roman des idées, part Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, part Gulliver’s Travels”, the Daily Mail’s Harry Ritchie called it simply: “not only weird but rather wonderful … extremely ambitious, inventive and written with a sure lightness of touch.”
