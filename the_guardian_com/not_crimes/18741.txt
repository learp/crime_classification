The first trailer for this year’s eagerly anticipated Rogue One: A Star Wars Story has premiered.The adventure will be the first spin-off film set in the Star Wars universe following JJ Abrams’s new episode of the saga last year. The plot follows a Rebel mission to steal plans for the Death Star and takes place just before the events of A New Hope.It’s directed by Gareth Edwards, behind the most recent version of Godzilla, and stars British actors Felicity Jones and Riz Ahmed as well as Mads Mikkelsen and Forest Whitaker. “It comes down to a group of people who don’t have magical powers who band together to bring hope to the galaxy,” Edwards said last year.Disney will truly know the power of Star Wars' dark side if it ruins Darth Vader and Han Solo He has also explained that the film exists within the same world as the Star Wars chapters but is a “self-contained story”.“It’s exciting because we’re not held to anything and we can be a bit more free, more brave,” he said to Flicks and the City. “And what’s great about everyone at LucasFilm is that they’re encouraging that.”Rogue One is one of many films planned within the Star Wars universe outside of the main franchise. Other titles include prequels focused around both Han Solo and Boba Fett. The film is expected to be one of the year’s biggest box office hits after Star Wars: The Force Awakens broke records last year on its way to making over $2bn (£1.4bn) worldwide, and will be released in the UK and US on 16 December.
