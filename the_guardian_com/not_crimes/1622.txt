Speaking to the presenter, Tess Daly, after the result, she said: “I’ve really enjoyed being here. This was a place for me to get to know my ‘female’, and this place allowed me to do that; the hair, the makeup, the production, the judges gave me great comments.“You [Daly] and Claudia [presenter Winkleman] have been amazing, the way you run this family. This family is beautiful and you [Cole] are amazing. Thanks for everything.”Cole also had warm words for his partner, adding: “This programme will miss you. I will miss you. Thank you for teaching me so much about everything and for being a fantastic partner. Thank you so much – what a great ride.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Ed Balls and Katya Jones on Saturday’s Strictly Come Dancing.

It smashed ITV1’s X Factor ratings, which averaged an audience of 5.7 million, for another week running.Dressed as a mad scientist, the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls scored his highest place on the judges’ leader board so far with an electrifying cha-cha packed with crotch-grabs and pelvic thrusts to Hansel Martinez’s version of Love Potion No 9. Len Goodman, the head judge, called it Balls’ “best dance yet”.
