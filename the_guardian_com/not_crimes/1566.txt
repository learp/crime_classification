Airports don’t need to advertise, because people literally have to visit them. You don’t book a trip to Skiathos because you fancy a steak at Café Rouge or a dump in a windowless loo. The people in Heathrow’s needless marketing department don’t seem to realise this though, so, erm, here’s a cuddly ad to entice you to swing by this Yuletide.Two little bears arrive at Heathrow and move seamlessly through an eerily quiet airport, suggesting it may have been evacuated due to some terrifying threat, like, say, a sentient teddy wandering about in a flat cap. Then, just as they’re spotted at the Arrivals gate by some children, they morph into elderly humans.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Why they were bears in the first place is unclear. The target audience is unclear (sociopaths who wouldn’t otherwise bother seeing their families, but for the couple of quid they can save on gin and Toblerones?). Why all involved haven’t sat around trying to fart the Magic Roundabout theme instead of making this ad is unclear. The only thing that is clear is that using bears to advertise a transport terminus only makes you think of one place: Paddington.
