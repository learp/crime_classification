What is a dog’s favourite television programme? Sadly for Christmas crackers everywhere, it’s not likely to be Woof Hall. According to the commendable work of scientists at the University of Lancashire, dogs prefer watching Coronation Street to anything else, including clips of other dogs playing.The researchers placed two labradors in a controlled, home-like environment and showed them 12 clips of 20 seconds each. They then collated the responses, looking at attention times and at which of the three screens the dogs looked. In order to replicate the science, I also created a controlled environment and let my whippet lie on the sofa with me while I watched television.My experiment suggested that she is a big fan of Planet Earth II, particularly when birds feature, and especially that bit in the final episode where the langurs do a simian version of parkour across the rooftops of Jodhpur. Continuing our family tradition of enjoying drunk nanas falling over at weddings and sunburned dads jumping into – and breaking – paddling pools, she is also a big fan of You’ve Been Framed. She briefly paid attention to Netflix’s new show The OA, but only when Steve’s dog barked at Prairie. She would rather sleep through The Young Pope.The University of Lancashire study suggested that, ultimately, dogs simply are not as interested in watching stuff as they are in eating, sleeping and playing. But I spoke to several dog owners who disagree: “She watches EastEnders with me but I don’t think she truly appreciates it.” “Really likes the cricket.” “Wasn’t allowed to watch Springwatch because he went so berserk.” “I once made her a Barcelona kit to wear while watching the Champions’ League final.”Furthermore, my study concluded that in no way are dogs’ viewing habits connected to the fact that watching stuff involves lying on warm humans on a comfortable sofa.
