Like a high-street travel agent or a Hotmail account, the concept of a battle for the Christmas No 1 struggles to remain relevant in an age in which it no longer makes much sense. It’s now more or less impossible to walk into a shop and buy a single, and the vast majority of people stream music on subscription services such as Spotify, rather than paying for MP3 downloads. The old-fashioned retail battle for the nation’s spare change is largely a thing of the past.The shift away from traditional single sales does have one exciting benefit: it makes it much harder for X Factor winners to get to No 1. To rack up streams, people actually have to listen to a song, rather than just buy it as a stocking filler for the nan they don’t like, and so, if this year’s X Factor champ is forced to release a dirgy cover of Wires by Athlete (or similar), they’re unlikely to do well. Last year’s winner, Louisa Johnson, missed the top 10 completely.So, the field has opened up a bit. James Corden is the current favourite, with a song about an overworked factory worker who clones himself so he can see more of his family over Christmas. The song, featured on the Sainsbury’s Christmas advert, is an zero-hours take on novelty pop – a sort of I, Daniel Snowflake. The exhausted worker complains about long hours and a full inbox, almost in tears when he sings: “The greatest gift I could give this year ... is me.”All the other Christmas ad songs are in the running, but for those who think Christmas has become too corporate, there’s also Robb Johnson and the Corbynistas, who are throwing their hat in the ring with JC 4 PM 4 Me. It’s as cheery a political campaign song as you’re likely to find, although a bunch of grizzled socialists singing about austerity in Santa hats on a non-denominational festive track might play into certain stereotypes about the Labour leader’s base.The smart money, though, is on Hallelujah, already a Christmas No 1 eight years ago when performed by Alexandra Burke, but now likely to shoot up the charts as a tribute to Leonard Cohen (although it may actually be the more celestial Jeff Buckley version that does well). The song ticks all the boxes: it honours a recently dead legend, it’s sort of about religion and it’s actually pleasant to listen to. Best of all, the widely reported rumour that Simon Cowell purchased the rights to the original version is just an urban myth, so people can listen in the safe knowledge they won’t be giving Scrooge a backhander.
