It's a momentous morning in Liverpool where the UK's first singing litter bin has just been launched to cheerful applause.The former Scaffold singer Mike McCartney, who belted out Lily the Pink in 1968 in a fashion none of us ancients will ever forget, had his hit song of the previous year Thank U Very Much played back to him by the otherwise modest-looking receptacle.It's one of two installed in Matthew Street, one of them opposite the legendary Cavern club, after research by city fathers in Scandinavia. Singing litter bins there attract three times more rubbish than mute ones; and so long as the local council keeps emptying them, this can only be a good thing.McCartney is specially pleased to be kicking off the pilot scheme because his father was a Liverpool binman. He says: I love Liverpool and I love the idea of the singing bin. I have a huge amount of respect for binmen, because of my dad, so I was delighted to do this re-recording. It's a fun approach to a serious issue and sometimes being quirky is what's needed to make people stop and think. The fact a bin is going to sing to you is a good incentive to drop litter and I'm sure the kids will love it. If it helps keep the city centre clean then I'll be happy.Promoters of the scheme will be on hand to check that McCartney's optimism is justified, hoping that the alternative scenario of people shrinking away and dropping their litter in disbelief will not materialise. Kirstie Allsopp, an 'ambassador' for Keep Britain Tidy, says: Â These bins will hopefully bring a smile to people's faces and encourage them to do the right thing. By taking small actions, like putting our rubbish in a bin, we can make a big difference and tackle the problem of litter that blights our beautiful country.Would you like to have a singing litter bin?
