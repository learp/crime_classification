Claudia Winkleman has quit the BBC’s flagship movie review show, Film 2016, after six years fronting the programme. Winkleman, who also co-hosts Strictly Come Dancing, said the decision had been a hard one, but that the film show “simply deserves someone who can give it their all”.Winkleman succeeded Jonathan Ross as the host in 2010, Ross having inherited the mantle from Barry Norman in 1999. She co-presents with Danny Leigh, who is understood to be remaining on the show – alongside a new presenter – when it returns in the autumn. Mark Bell, BBC head of arts commissioning, said: “We’ve loved having Claudia on Film 2016 and I’d like to thank her for all her hard work and commitment to the show.”As well as Strictly, Winkleman presents the BBC’s The Great British Sewing Bee, hosts a Radio 2 show and writes for a variety of publications, including a weekly column for the Sunday Times.
