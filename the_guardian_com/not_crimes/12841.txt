The Queensland senator Glenn Lazarus says he hopes a Senate inquiry into unconventional gas mining will restart political momentum around a push for farmer land rights which has waned in the months since the death of activist George Bender.Lazarus has dubbed the Senate investigation the “Bender inquiry”, in honour of the Queensland farmer whose suicide last October after a 10-year battle with gas companies put the issue on the national agenda.The deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, was among the federal government figures who subsequently said they supported farmers’ rights to veto coal seam gas exploration and extraction on their properties.Glenn Lazarus answers Clive Palmer's Twitter tirade: I don't like bullies But legislative changes were in the hands of state governments, a spokesman for Truss said at the time.Lazarus said the issue had since fallen by the wayside, despite him meeting to discuss it several times with the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. “Some politicians from the major parties did voice concerns but nothing’s been done,” he said. “The real frustrating thing is that while it was topical, they all said the right things. But of course people have got on with their lives and the George Bender issue is months old and doesn’t get a mention anywhere.“So I’m hoping this inquiry will bring those issues back to the forefront and we can get some strategies or something in place where the farmer has rights and that we’re not completely stuffing up the environment.”Lazarus is an unlikely crusader who has amplified his attempts to raise the need for scrutiny of the resources industry after deserting the political party founded by the mining entrepreneur Clive Palmer last July.The independent senator said he was proud to have been able to mount a Senate inquiry to give a platform to people who felt they were being ignored by the political establishment.“I tell you what, it took a lot of hard work because both major parties really didn’t want anything to do with it,” he said. “But I think through public pressure, it certainly helps and we got it up.”Lazarus said he was struck by the weight of anecdotal evidence to date from farmers about the duplicity of some gas companies in their dealings across Queensland’s gasfields.Bores running dry and animals being born blind are among the alleged impacts of gas drilling he has encountered during regular visits to the western downs since last year. He cited shale gas in the Northern Territory and tight gas in Western Australia as the emerging frontiers of the issue.A Queensland government report showed production of coal seam gas in 2014-15 at 457 petajoules was more than 10 times the amount of conventional gas. The report said exploration for shale gas and tight gas in Queensland – the latter of which may be found in “significant” quantities – was “only just beginning”.Lazarus said the “unfettered” rights of gas companies to use scarce water resources and the risk that contaminated water posed to the beef industry were key concerns. “The mining companies will tell you this is all bullshit and they look after [landholders] really well,” he said.“But at the end of the day, there’s too many people that have come to me and told me they are living in horrendous conditions and are really worried.“I’ve seen pictures where people who are not living far out of towns like Dalby have to have water shipped in on a pallet because they don’t have any fresh water.“[The companies] tell you it’s not affecting anything. The issue for me is either they don’t know what they’re doing or they do know and they’re deliberately denying it.”Lazarus called for more funding for an independent testing regime for environmental impacts of gas extraction and more scrutiny of gas company operations in remote areas. Any future discovery of contamination of livestock through the spread of water polluted with fracking chemicals in paddocks and waterways could bring the meat industry to its knees, he said.Malcolm Turnbull will 'look into' suicide of anti-CSG farmer George Bender “One of the things that doesn’t get spoken about is a lot of the cattle farmers are under an immense amount of scrutiny when it comes to their meat,” he said. “That meat is tested on a regular basis and, I have to say, if one of them gets caught out, it’ll pretty much close them down.”Lazarus denied the inquiry would represent a “witch hunt” of gas companies but would shed light on the environmental and financial impacts of the industry, from royalty regimes to compensation payments. “I’ve met people whose land was pretty much unworkable and they’ve got CSG wells and they’re really happy,” he said. “So we need to hear all the facts, good and bad.”Lazarus will chair the select committee running the inquiry, which will also include the Greens senator Larissa Waters, the Liberal National party senators Matthew Canavan and Joanna Lindgren and Labor senators Joe Ludwig and Anne McEwen.Submissions close on 14 March, with hearings likely to begin in Dalby next month.
