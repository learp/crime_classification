The first trailer for Paul Feig’s much-anticipated reboot of the Ghostbusters has arrived, giving us our first real look at the all-female cast.Rise of the reboots gives new life to Rocky and Ghostbusters Feig reunites with his Bridesmaids breakout stars Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig and adds Saturday Night Live comics Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon for a line-up that has caused controversy amongst some fans. The director, who was also behind hits The Heat and Spy, referred to the irate feedback as “vile, misogynistic shit”.As well as the main four gender-swapped leads, the film also stars Chris Hemsworth as their receptionist and will feature cameos from original actors Sigourney Weaver, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson and Dan Aykroyd.The new film is Sony’s major attempt to restart one of their few successful franchises and also create a “cinematic universe” that would allow a number of related films to exist. Feig turned down the chance to do a more traditional sequel for a rebooted take.“I seem to have a very feminine take on the world,” Feig said in a recent interview with The Mary Sue. “It is just who I am. I get sent scripts all the time, and when it’s a typical male character who has things together but is faced with a problem, I zone out. I just get completely uninterested. I’ve realized after years of watching movies, I’ve tired of the problems of men. I’m tired of seeing it portrayed.”Ghostbusters is released in UK and US cinemas on 15 July.
