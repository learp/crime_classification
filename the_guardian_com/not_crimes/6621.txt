Last year Ethan found out that he was a Changer and therefore has to live each year of high school as a new person. The year that followed was crazy; Ethan became Drew, a pretty cheerleader, and had to figure out a lot of overwhelming things, including her romantic interest in her best friend Audrey and how on earth female bodies work. This year, Drew is Oryon, an African-American skater boy, and has to navigate life in his new identity whilst trying to keep parts of his old life, namely Audrey.Having enjoyed the first book in this series, expectations were set fairly high for the second instalment of Changers, especially as Drew’s new identity as Oryon would see him experience life as a different race, hopefully prompting some really interesting conversations about the different ways people treat you. This book delivered on some of those expectations but similarly to the first one, some things weren’t explored as fully as they could have been, leaving issues tackled a little half-heartedly. However as the book progressed and Oryon started noticing prejudice in others around him, his frustration becomes more and more apparent and the book takes a rather emotional turn.This completely unique perspective of someone experiencing life as part of a less privileged group of people makes this book pretty special as Oryon’s observations about the difference in his new life are really heartbreaking as he puzzles over why strangers treat him differently as an African-American citizen than when he was white.This book feels a little sloppier than the first and certainly didn’t flow as well. The storyline involving Chase and the RaChas movement still feels like an irrelevant afterthought to the novel, thrown in so it could fit into that “question authority figures” mould that dystopian novels do so well. There are so many relationships to focus on: Oryon’s parents, his Changer friends, Audrey and the new friends he makes as Oryon. It all feels a bit jumbled up and confusing; if Oryon attempts to maintain all of these in his next body, Book 3 will really struggle to keep a clear narrative. Despite its flaws, Oryon is such a likeable character that it’s much easier to buy into the plot.Transgender: identity is never one single thing so tick the box that says 'other' Changers Book 2 is a typical sequel, slightly weak in plot and a little overly ambitious but ultimately good fun to read. I’d recommend it to those who want a light read with a focus on social issues.Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop
