Last year saw a sharp fall in the number of illegally poisoned birds of prey in Scotland, in advance of tough new laws making landowners liable for persecution by their gamekeepers.The latest map of poisoning locations released by the Scottish government on Wednesday showed that there were 10 incidents in 2011 involving 16 dead birds of prey, roughly half the 22 incidents recorded the year before, which involved 28 deaths by poisoning. {"dataSourceUrl":"//docs.google.com/a/guardian.co.uk/spreadsheet/tq?key=0ApbXznsEnzURdHZyMFloZTRJWlRKdDlldVUxZkl3dUE&transpose=0&headers=1&range=A1%3AB6&gid=0&pub=1","options":{"vAxes":[{"title":"Total number (all species)","minValue":0,"viewWindowMode":"pretty","viewWindow":{"min":0,"max":null},"maxValue":null},{"viewWindowMode":"pretty","viewWindow":{}}],"series":{"3":{"color":"#76a5af"},"2":{"color":"#45818e"},"1":{"color":"#134f5c"},"0":{"color":"#0c343d"},"4":{"color":"#a2c4c9"}},"title":"Total bird of prey deaths in Scotland - SASA data","booleanRole":"certainty","height":276,"animation":{"duration":500},"legend":"none","width":460,"vAxis":{"format":""},"useFirstColumnAsDomain":true,"hAxis":{"title":"Year","format":""},"isStacked":false},"state":{},"view":{"columns":[{"calc":"stringify","type":"string","sourceColumn":0},1]},"chartType":"ColumnChart","chartName":"Chart 1"} The drop in the number of killings last year, which involved seven buzzards, four red kites, two peregrine falcons, two sparrowhawks and one golden eagle, has raised hopes that a concerted campaign by police, wildlife agencies, Scottish ministers and landowners has begun making an impact.Overall persecution rates in Scotland have been causing high levels of anxiety for conservationists and ministers because of the damage to Scotland's ecosystems and its reputation. Those rates peaked recently in 2010 when 28 birds were poisoned in 22 incidents, including three golden eagles found at one exclusive Highland estate alone.Scottish landowners now face perhaps the toughest bird conservation legislation in Europe after new laws came into effect in January making them potentially liable for illegal conduct by their gamekeepers, shooting tenants or shoot managers, under a system known as vicarious liability.Wildlife crime experts warn that yearly statistics only show the number of cases detected, which is largely down to chance, not the true level of persecution. Last year's levels of nest destruction, illegal trapping and shooting are said to have remained constant with previous years.Stewart Stephenson, the Scottish environment minister, said the new poisoning map suggested that the multi-agency campaign against persecution being coordinated by the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime (PAW) was having an effect.The maps, first published in 2009, identify the rough locations of all proven poisoning cases, allowing the police, landowners and conservationists to identify persecution "hot spots". Areas around South Lanarkshire, the Borders south of Edinburgh, Angus north of Dundee, Perthshire and Speyside south of Inverness have emerged as the worst areas for persecution recently.Stephenson said: "I hope this proves to be the beginning of a continuing reduction in such cases, leading to the end of this outdated, dangerous and cruel practice."Birds of prey are a key part of our ecosystems and a magnificent spectacle in our countryside. They are valued by locals and visitors alike."Senior conservationists believe last year's decline was in part due to landowners reacting before the vicarious liability rules came into force. Echoing the minister's caution about this year on year drop, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said it hoped this was the start of a downwards trend.RSPB Scotland believes a continuing fall is needed to prove last year's figures were not a blip: there was a drop down to similar low levels of 2008 with 17 birds poisoned but that was followed by a sharp spike in 2009 and 2010, with 27 and 28 birds poisoned in each year.Duncan Orr-Ewing, head of species and land management for RSPB Scotland, said the real test of whether poisonings and persecutions had fallen would come when bird of prey numbers increased, and empty regions, particularly near Inverness, are recolonised."We hope that this is the start of a downward trend in illegal poisoning in Scotland, which in time should also be reflected in an increase in the populations and ranges of some of our most vulnerable species, including golden eagles, hen harriers and red kites," he said.Doug McAdam, chief executive of the landowners organisation Scottish Land and Estates, disputed that the new liability rules were an influence since they only came into force in January.He said that all-round campaigning and education by PAW members had been responsible for the decline, which he believed marked a definite trend, not a temporary blip. Five years ago, the number of incidents hit close to 30. "There's no room for complacency but I'm very encouraged by where we are and it hasn't just happened. There has been many hard yards going into this," he said. "We're in a much better place than where we were five years or so ago."
