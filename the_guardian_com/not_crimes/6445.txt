“I’ve never been much of a traditionalist,” says Lopè Ariyo. “Whenever my mum and grandma see me doing stuff, they’re like, ‘O-kaaay’.” She mimics a Nigerian woman looking askance at jollof rice made with grated cauliflower instead of actual rice, or fish and chips with cassava batter and spicy yams for chips. “It’s only once they’ve tasted it that they say, ‘OK, I see what you’re doing.’ Now my mum gets a bit upset when I don’t cook for her.”As well she might. Last September, her daughter, who is 24, went from being an undergraduate with a food blog on the side, to an author whose first book, Hibiscus, out in June, may change the way we see African food in Britain.Ariyo was in her final year of a maths degree at Loughborough when she heard about a competition to find a cook who would “break an African cuisine into the home kitchens of the UK”. The competition, conceived by Red magazine and HarperCollins, was responding to a lack of diversity in British cookery writing.With encouragement from friends, Ariyo sent in an application, which she rushed home from her final exam to complete, and was called in a week later to cook alongside four other finalists representing North, East, South and Central Africa. Her freewheeling, boldly flavourful take on Nigerian cuisine won out and landed her a book deal with HarperCollins.“My cooking is a union of English and Nigerian,” Ariyo says when we meet near her family home in East Croydon. Like any born-and-bred south Londoner, she was exposed to a wide variety of flavours growing up: “We did eat Nigerian food at home but not on a daily basis.” It was when she went to boarding school in Lagos at the age of 11 that she got a proper taste for traditional dishes such as jollof rice, pounded yam and egusi soup.Returning to London two years later, she craved the food she’d left behind and set about recreating it at home – but in a liberal fashion, improvising with whatever was available and sneaking in ideas from other cuisines. Purists such as her Nigerian grandmother may raise an eyebrow (at least initially) but her British friends were unanimous in their approval.As were the competition judges. “She jumped out instantly,” says Pip McCormac, lifestyle director at Red. “Her recipes seemed really approachable – interesting and exciting but not beyond the realm of comprehension.” Having tasted her sticky-sweet hibiscus chicken and that jollof cauliflower rice, which is intense, satisfying – and healthy without seeming virtuous – I heartily agree.For all its richness and mindboggling variety, African food has yet to cross over in the UK. With her lively, accessible take on Nigerian cuisine, Lopè Ariyo could be the person to make it happen.Three more to watch■ Another standard bearer for West African food, Irish-Ghanaian Londoner Zoe Adjonyoh started out selling peanut butter stew at festivals and now has her own restaurant in Brixton, with a book, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, out in April.■ Ex-Clove Club sous chef Tim Spedding is turning out incredible food, solo, at tiny east London wine bar P Franco until the end of January.
