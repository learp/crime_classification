Executive director Ben Carter says Knowlton shot a mature black rhino bull, who was older and identified as detrimental to the herd.Knowlton had the top bid in last yearâ€™s auction. The funds go to the Namibia ministry of environment and tourism, which issued the permit as part of efforts to cull the herd.
