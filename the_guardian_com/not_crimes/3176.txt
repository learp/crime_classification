You are either a foreigner in the Youtube world or you are too old to Youtube, if you don’t know who Tyler Oakley is.This 26-year-old video blogger has been on Youtube for over 8 years now. On his journey he has: sold out shows worldwide, starred in a documentary, and most importantly, written a book called Binge.It is 2016, and every other Youtuber has a book in your nearest bookstore, but Tyler has a different story. In 2012, he got an offer to write a book but he wasn’t sure what he would write about, so he prolonged it until 2014. Binge is a compilation of Tyler’s stories, but those which he never shared online to his audience of 7 million. in all his 8 years of Youtube. This arose curiosity amongst his fans and as soon as pre-order went up everything went insane. Even months before the release date, his book went to number one in various online stores.Some people suggest this book mainly interests people who know about Tyler and his life, however I believe this claim is incorrect. After finishing this book, you might look at Tyler and still wonder if you know him well enough. I, as a Youtube viewer, had no idea that Tyler is his real name (EXACTLY!!). His books have surprise elements that make the reader want to scratch their head really hard. So, if you don’t know Tyler Oakley and you want to, I suggest the book is perhaps the best way to get to know him.This book is autobiographical which means that he wrote about his real life story. Life stories are generally insane and in Tyler’s case it is no different. His book explores every emotion: you will laugh, then you will cry for sure too, you will gasp and you will be terrified, and then you will have to many emotions and will want to stab the book and throw it out of your window! (But you will not actually do it because by that time the book will be very dear to you.)This book deals with all the problems Oakley has had on his way to the top, ever since birth. He shares his LGBTQ+ experience, his coming out to his parents, family, and friends. He shares stories about being a broke kid and how to cope with it. He shares his difficult life after the divorce of his parents. He talks about school and how miserable it can be. He talks relationships. Tyler Oakley talks about everything which makes this book special and very overwhelming, in the best way possible. Overall, Tyler Oakley took me to a journey with him with this book and it was a very meaningful and fun voyage.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
