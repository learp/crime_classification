Eurohouse10.05am Summerhall (until 26 August)One of those quirky and rewarding shows that the fringe sometimes throws up, this collaboration between Nasi Voutsas and Bertrand Lesca investigates how the dream of the EU and the reality – particularly for austerity hit Greece – don’t match up. Childlike but never childish, it’s enacted a bit like a playground scrap in which packets of sweets are given then demanded back, and the Greek Voutsas gets reduced to his underpants. It’s a playful and thoughtful work that makes light work of the ongoing Greek tragedy but proves enormously moving, too. LGHot Brown Honey8.20pm, Assembly Roxy (until 28 August)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Subversive cabaret … Hot Brown Honey.“Fighting the power has never tasted so sweet,” is the call-out in this show, which is creating a real buzz with its raucous but oddly effective mix of hip-hop and variety acts, laced with a strong political message calling out sexism, racism and colonialism. Part of a new wave of politically aware and subversive cabaret, it has such a naughty satiric edge and infectious energy that the message just slips down. Surprising and wildly entertaining. LG Police Cops9.45pm, Pleasance Dome (until 28 August)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Wall of silly … the Pretend Men’s Police Cops. Photograph: Will HazelLast year, the Pretend Men’s award-winning Police Cops appeared on the fringe listed under theatre, and made a justifiable splash for its high-octane, lo-fi, wall-of-silly spoof of US police drama conventions. After a sell-out run at the Soho theatre, London, it’s now back branded as comedy, and will delight anyone looking for big, consistent laughs. As the trio (Nathan Parkinson, Zachary Hunt, Tom Turner) flit hyperactively between their vast cast of naive rookies, Mexican drug lords and jaded cops coaxed back from retirement, it’s not just funny, it’s exhilarating.
