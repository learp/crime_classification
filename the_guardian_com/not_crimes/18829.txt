After a highly competitive bidding war, the heavily buzzed slavery drama The Birth of a Nation has been picked up by Fox Searchlight.The Birth of a Nation review – slavery epic as brutal as Braveheart According to Variety, the film, which opened to Oscar buzz and enthused reviews at this year’s Sundance film festival, has been bought for a reported $17.5m, the biggest purchase the festival has ever seen.Actor Nate Parker, best known for roles in Non-Stop and Beyond the Lights, took on the story as a passion project. As well as writing and directing, he plays the lead role of Nat Turner, who led a slave uprising in 1831 that led to 60 white deaths and stricter laws on how slaves could be controlled. Parker invested his own money in the production, which also stars Armie Hammer, Gabrielle Union and Jackie Earle Haley.The bidding war was reportedly between Fox Searchlight, Sony, The Weinstein Company and Netflix. Fox Searchlight picked up the worldwide rights with hopes of pushing it for next year’s Oscar race.It would make for an interesting inclusion, given the debate over the 2016 Oscars and the film’s largely African-American cast. “It’s cultivation,” said Parker at the festival. “I think diversity is more than a colour palette. It’s a celebration of heritage and culture and that’s the one thing that we don’t do so often. Before that we have to heal. There are wounds that exist because of the legacy of slavery in this country.”Other big purchases of the festival include Kenneth Lonergan’s Manchester-by-the-Sea, starring Michelle Williams and Casey Affleck, and Whit Stillman’s Love & Friendship, both picked up by Amazon.
