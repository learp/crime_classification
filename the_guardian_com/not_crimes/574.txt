Scottish Power is planning to cut its prices by 3.3% after criticism that it had failed to pass on savings from the government's rollback of the green levies that were added to power bills.The move will reduce typical household gas and electricity dual fuel bills by about £42 and the energy company is also expected to pass on a further £12 rebate to all customers for the Warm Home Discount, which the government has said will be funded through general taxation instead of through levies on energy bills.A spokesman for Scottish Power said: "We are committed to delivering the reductions as agreed with the government and will make an announcement this week."The tariff cut will only partly reverse increases of 8.5% and 9% for gas and electricity respectively from Scottish Power a month ago.The expected move follows a New Year's Day bill reduction of 3.2% by British Gas.
