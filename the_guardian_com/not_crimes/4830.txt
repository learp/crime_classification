New episodes of Black Mirror and Transparent will premiere at next month’s Toronto film festival.Previews of the third seasons of Charlie Brooker’s dystopian sci-fi satire and Jill Soloway’s comedy-drama about a transgender retiree will feature as part of Primetime, Toronto’s TV sidebar.Two Black Mirror episodes will be screened at the festival: San Junipero and Nosedive. San Junipero features Belle’s Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Mackenzie Davis. Nosedive, which was written by Parks and Recreation star Rashida Jones, stars Alice Eve and Bryce Dallas Howard. Plot details have not been revealed. The screenings of San Junipero and Nosedive will offer the first look at Brooker’s show since it moved from Channel 4, where it first aired in 2011, to Netflix. The show, described as “The Twilight Zone for the digital age” has developed an international following since its first two series were made available on the streaming service. Netflix’s acquisition of the black comedy’s UK broadcast rights led to a spat between Channel 4 and the show’s producer Endemol Shine in March, with Channel 4 claiming they’d not been given a chance to counter Netflix’s reported $40m offer. Toronto will show the first three episodes of the new season of Transparent. The show stars Jeffrey Tambor as a retired political sciences professor who stuns his family by announcing his decision to live as a woman. According to the Toronto press release, the third season of the show will see Maura (Tambor) develop her relationship with her new girlfriend Vicki (Anjelica Huston). Maura’s daughters Sarah (Amy Landecker) and Ali (Gaby Hoffman) will follow different paths to spiritual enlightenment, while their brother Josh (Jay Duplass) struggles with depression. The third season of Transparent will be launched on Amazon Prime on 23 September. Black Mirror season three will launch on Netflix on 21 October.
