An exhibition at Saatchi gallery plans to explore the importance of selfies as an art form.Opening in March, it will showcase a selection of well-known pieces as well as selfies that have “quickly become icons of the digital era”.From Selfie to Self-Expression will feature self-portraits from artists including Vincent van Gogh, Tracey Emin, Rembrandt, Velazquez, June Calypso and Kutluğ Ataman.More modern examples include a selfie featuring the former US president Barack Obama and former prime minister David Cameron, and the moment the actor Benedict Cumberbatch “photobombed” a press shot at the Academy Awards.

The selfie generation is becoming the self-expression generation as each of us seeks to explore and share our inner creativity through the one artistic tool to which we all have access: the smartphone.”• From Selfie to Self-Expression runs 31 March-30 May and the competition runs 23 January-19 March
