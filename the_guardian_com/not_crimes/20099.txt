He resigned from the position in 2016 after Fox News anchors Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly made sexual harassment allegations. It was subsequently reported that Ailes helped Donald Trump with his presidential campaign, but Trump’s team issued a denial.Ailes’ downfall has proved catnip for film-makers: a feature film about the harassment scandal is in the works, with The Big Short writer Charles Randolph on board, while a TV miniseries based on Gabriel Sherman’s Ailes biography The Loudest Voice in the Room is also in development.
