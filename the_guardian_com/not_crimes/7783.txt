When Adam Henson landed a coveted but daunting presenting job on the BBC’s rural affairs show Countryfile, he turned to his father, Joe, for advice. His father was a farmer too, but he was also a seasoned television veteran. Thirty years before, Joe Henson had blazed a trail on shows such as Animal Magic and In the Country, discussing animal behaviour and farming traditions with passion and eloquence. “Dad was a TV natural,” says Adam. “He was a fantastic storyteller and his timing was impeccable, so when we briefly worked together on Countryfile years later, the producers and directors loved him. He was also my biggest supporter and always rang after the programme to congratulate me or offer gentle pointers.”Eight months have passed since his father’s death and Adam’s emotions are understandably raw. He is nevertheless keen to pay tribute to a man he idolised and to whom he pays tribute in a new book.“It’s devastating for anybody to lose a parent, but my relationship with Dad was particularly close,” he says. “Right from my first days, he was my rock, my mentor, my hero. It’s no exaggeration to say he taught me virtually all I know about farming and television.”He fondly recalls an idyllic early childhood on Bemborough Farm in the Cotswolds, where his father showed Adam and his three sisters how to appreciate the natural wonders on their doorstep. “He’d point out a buzzard climbing the thermals or a barn owl quartering across the long grass at dusk, hunting for voles. When the snows came, Dad would show us the wing markings that an owl had left while swooping and grabbing a mouse, and how to follow a fox’s prints around the yard.”Joe was also a visionary who set up the Cotswold Farm Park, the first domestic rare breeds farm open to the public, in 1971. “Dad’s love for British rare breeds might have remained a low-level hobby had he not been invited to join a working party in 1969, whose purpose was to find a home for unwanted rare breeds at Whipsnade zoo,” says Adam. “The zoo had decided to jettison these unglamorous creatures in favour of breeding white rhinos, and Dad bought the majority for his new enterprise. A lot of his mates thought he had gone mad, but since he founded the Rare Breeds Survival Trust in 1973, no further breeds have been lost.”His father shrewdly gifted each of his four children a rare breed from the park to encourage their interest. “I was given the Exmoor ponies and Dad taught me how to maintain the breed, and buy and sell the stock,” recalls Adam. “I’ll never forget the first time he took us to market. It felt very exciting and grown-up. Whenever we sold an animal, half the money went into our piggy banks, which, as well as teaching us about rare-breed conservation, underlined to us that the farm park was actually a business.”Looking back, Adam realises his father went out of his way to give his children the secure childhood he never had. The young Joe – the son of Leslie Henson, an actor and comedian who co-founded the Entertainments National Service Association, known as Ensa, and became a West End star, and Harriet Collins, a music hall dancer and actress who performed under the stage name Billie Dell – had an unsettled childhood.“Leslie was married to another actress when Dad was born and the scandal could have ruined his career,” says Adam. “So it was agreed to keep the baby a secret, although Leslie always provided for Billie and Dad. Leslie was a bit like a favourite uncle: he would turn up and then leave again, so in effect Dad was raised by a single mum. But finally Leslie’s wife agreed to a divorce and he married Billie. It was only then that Dad was told that Leslie was his father.“To conceal the illegitimacy, Dad wasn’t allowed to attend the wedding and was sent away to boarding school. Leslie could have been a much better father in my eyes, but Dad adored him.”Adam only discovered the true extent of his father’s troubled childhood when his dad documented it all in a letter towards the end of his life. “Dad seemed a little nervous about revealing his secrets, but reading his account made me admire him even more and marvel that someone who had undergone such difficulties could have become such a warm and loving family man,” says Adam.When Adam decided to follow in his father’s footsteps, Joe was delighted. “I was a bit of a Jack the lad in my late teens, but when I knuckled down on the farm, Dad appointed me his livestock manager and was always receptive to my ideas,” he says. “I loved working closely with him. Going to market with him still felt fun and exciting, as if we were two big kids on the way to a sweet shop.”Sadly, Adam’s world came crashing down last year when his father was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 82. “Dad told me he’d had an amazing life and had packed his bags and was ready to go. It was an incredibly moving moment. He had been a huge inspiration all my life and even in his dying he was being remarkable.“Thankfully, we had a few months in which to share everything we needed. I told him I was incredibly proud of him, thanked him for everything he had done for me and promised I would continue conserving the rare breeds he was so passionate about. He told me he wasn’t frightened of dying. He was a religious man, but also, as a farmer, you learn to be philosophical about life and death because you are confronted by it all the time. His attitude was that it was part of life and it was his time.”“Today I run the farm that Dad nurtured for nearly 40 years and its centrepiece remains the farm park. I’ve also been lucky enough to follow him into television. But my little footsteps will never fill his great big ones.”• Like Farmer, Like Son: A Memoir by Adam Henson is published by BBC Books, £18.99.
