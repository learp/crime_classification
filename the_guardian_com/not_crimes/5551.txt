The 90s TV show Cold Feet, The Big Chill for generation It Could Be You is back. This first photo of the reunited cast is unexpectedly illuminating, an anthropological peek into the style mores of the Established Middle Class. Each cast member is channelling such sartorial types that this could be a sketched caricature from a 2016 government style census. There’s the Dipster (hipster dad) Jon Thomson dressed in a Saint Laurent-style Hawaiian shirt and turn-ups; New Tory Hermione Norris power body conning with such conviction she looks on the cusp of a cabinet reshuffle; and a hair-raising James Nesbitt who looks like a visiting Dot Com millionaire wearing a suit (Hermes?) in cool grey. You can tell that he’s boring everyone with a chat about the Nasdaq, but he looks sharp (and, you know, $$$), so best to keep him on side post-Brexit. Other questions that need to asked looking at this photo: why is Thomson pulling at Fay Ripley like a possessed jester? Why is Nesbitt looking on like a benevolent angel (Sixth Sense vibes anyone?). And, finally, has Robert Bathurst been green-screened in from a recruitment video for Lloyds Bank? All will be revealed when the show returns to ITV later in the year.
