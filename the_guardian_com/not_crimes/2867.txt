Our hearts go to John’s family, his wife, Helen, and two daughters, Lorin and Lucia.”Nine’s director of news, Darren Wick, said everyone at Nine was saddened to hear of Clarke’s death. “John, along with his partner in satire, Bryan Dawe, entertained audiences on A Current Affair between 1989 to 1997, in the days of Mike Willesee and Jana Wendt hosting the program,” Wick said.“Our sincere condolences go to his family at this time. John was truly one of the most memorable and much-loved people on Australian television and at Nine we will remember him fondly. His commentary and wit on political matters will be missed greatly by audiences across the country.”Wil Anderson (@Wil_Anderson)Two of the greatest minutes of satire you will see: https://t.co/8xVgMYK3SH #JohnClarke #TheFrontFellOffApril 10, 2017A household name in Australia and New Zealand, Clarke was inducted into the TV Week Logies Hall of Fame in 2008.He appeared in The Ex-PM for the ABC with Shaun Micallef between 2015 and 2017, wrote the ABC’s Mental Health Live Broadcast in 2014 and appeared in the documentary Stop Laughing … This Is Serious about Australian comedy in the same year.
