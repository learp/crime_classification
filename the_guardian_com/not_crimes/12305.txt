The Big Short has emerged as the new frontrunner in the best picture race after winning the top prize at the Producers Guild of America awards.The Big Short's Adam McKay: ‘A lot of people lost houses and jobs and didn’t really know why’ The financial comedy-drama, which follows a group of men who predicted the housing crisis and market crash of 2008, beat favourites The Revenant and Spotlight to win the Darryl F Zanuck award. The prize is seen as an indicator of Oscars success, with previous winners such as Birdman, 12 Years a Slave and Argo going on to triumph with the Academy.Producers Jeremy Kleiner and Dede Gardner accepted the award and Gardner used her speech to remind people of the importance of diversity in the wake of the Oscars controversy.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest “We have privilege in our hands as storytellers,” she said. “We need to tell stories that reflect our world on every street corner.” The film’s other producer, Brad Pitt, was not in attendance. Pitt also stars in the film, alongside Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell and Christian Bale, who received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.Other winners of the night included Inside Out for top animated movie and Amy for top documentary.The Big Short’s surprise win has led to some bookmakers placing it as the favourite to come out on top at the Academy Awards, which take place on 28 February. Previously, journalism drama Spotlight had held that position despite gritty adventure The Revenant winning best picture at the Golden Globes.The last time a PGA award-winner didn’t go on to win best picture was in 2006 when Little Miss Sunshine eventually lost out to The Departed.
