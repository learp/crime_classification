Unmissable show?I watched the trailer for the new series of Daredevil about five times in a row because I’m really anxiously awaiting the arrival of that show. I think it’s absolutely brilliant. Maybe “brilliant” is an overuse: I chide my children about using the word “awesome” incorrectly. But I think it’s really good TV, and being a comic-book fan I think it’s beautifully executed.Earliest TV memory?I always go back to when Tobe Hooper did the adaptation of [Stephen King horror] Salem’s Lot in the 70s. As a kid I’d never seen anything that terrifying on television before, and it still holds up. I have a lot of my early favourites on DVD. I like to binge-watch Mission: Impossible. I grew up watching Thunderbirds – the original Thunderbirds, not the dreck now with the CGI. That’s so offensive to me.Guilty pleasure?Rewatching the Adam West version of Batman. They’ve stuck it all on Blu-ray. It’s a lot different from the [dark] Batman of Zack Snyder, but it still has great merit. I’m envious when I watch it because they had Otto Preminger and Cesar Romero and Burgess Meredith – all these great, serious actors – and you know they just had an incredible amount of fun doing that show, and taking the piss out of it a little bit, too.Pitch us a TV showI’ve always wanted them to explore the early story of [Marvel character] Nick Fury, when he was Nick Fury and Howling Commandos. I was always partial to that second world war angle. But maybe the second world war is too dated for audiences now; there’s not enough hi-tech stuff.Mastermind specialist subject?Toy collections. I’ve long been a collector, related to films, Japanese anime. I have shelves of it. It’s the bane of my wife’s existence. She calls them my “dolls”, which I always clarify by saying “action figures”. She says: “You can call it what you want, but it’s a doll.”Bosch season two is on Amazon Prime from Friday 11 February 2016
