Tights, camera, action! Superheroes are everywhere, but in the increasingly crowded confluence of TV capes, cowls and crossovers – from a Flash/Supergirl musical episode to Netflix’s imminent Iron Fist – the new X-Men spinoff Legion stands apart. Though based on a minor character from Marvel’s vast mutant mythology, it has no overt connection to the movie franchise. In fact, if it wasn’t for the discreet X that pops up in the O of the show’s logo, you would be hard pushed to identify any tangible link between the two.This affords Legion some very welcome freedom, though when we first meet David Haller, the troubled young man at the heart of the story, he has none. (David is played by Dan Stevens, a man who, after three seasons of Downton Abbey, knows a thing or two about societal straitjackets). After apparently being diagnosed as schizophrenic, Haller has been institutionalised in the Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital, a facility where the inmates are identified by old-school tracksuit tops and even the nominally soothing pursuit of ping pong is made strange by square bats.David hears voices in his head and sees things that aren’t there. We know this because we hear and see them too. At moments of crisis, his delusions appear to trigger uncanny abilities within him – including, in one memorable slo-mo sequence, a burst of telekinesis potent enough to dismantle a kitchen – although the agents who interrogate him on behalf of a shady, seemingly governmental outfit called Division are keen to downplay his powers. David’s deadening Clockworks routine gets interrupted by the arrival of a new in-patient called Sydney Barrett. (Even X-Men co-creator Stan Lee, lover of on-the-nose superhero codenames, might balk at the cute Pink Floyd reference.) Despite her shy smile and phobia of touching, Syd is going to open his mind.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Hearing voices … Dan Stevens as David. Photograph: FX NetworksThat’s not even half of what’s going on in this week’s first, feature-length episode. Spooling backward and forward through time, we see a capsule history of David’s early life, the apparent aftermath of a crisis at Clockworks, the ominous march of shock troops in riot gear and what looks like a demonic frog. In the headspace of Legion, every shot can be unsettling, the camera switching between the clinical poise of Black Mirror and smacked-out, gauzy reverie.The production design is as beautifully styled and obsessive as that of Wes Anderson, from the weirdly retro technology – at one point, a gigantic oscilloscope is wheeled in by three technicians wearing matching Steve Zissou-style beanie hats – to the heightened colour palette. When not blasting out righteous 60s hits from the Who and the Rolling Stones, the soundtrack is also shifting, keening, unpredictable. Occasionally it sounds like an ice-cream van jingle as the battery runs out. Legion is endlessly, and deliberately, disorientating. Other dramas that walk the tightrope of “Is this real?” are often sunk by off-puttingly cryptic dialogue. Legion is buoyed by flashes of humour, and Stevens’ soulful performance.It is so scattershot that it is initially impossible to get much of a handle on it. You have to surrender to the mind behind it – in this case, Noah Hawley, the man who transformed the Oscar-winning Fargo from a singular Coen brothers movie into a critically acclaimed TV series. For Legion, he seems to be channelling the psych-ops surreality of Patrick McGoohan’s paranoid classic The Prisoner, and it’s a bracing experience.

Photograph: FX NetworksAs superhero TV reaches critical mass, Hawley has helped the genre take a necessary evolutionary leap, mutating it into something refreshingly sophisticated and artful. He’s also smart enough to pre-empt those fans sifting for clues to pre-emptively solve the mystery of David and his destiny, deliberately keeping them at one remove.If Haller is indeed a powerful telepath, the voices in his head could just be a manifestation of his powers. Or is all this happening in David’s head? Are characters such as his drug buddy Lenny (Aubrey Plaza) real or imagined? Even a climactic action sequence that seems to show, unequivocally, that this is a world where people with superpowers exist, is such a chaotic and unlikely rush of amplified action that it resembles a dream or violent breakout fantasy.Can such a hyperactive outlier survive, or even thrive in the current TV climate? Hawley seems to be betting that diehard comics fans are being super-served elsewhere, so 2017 is the perfect time to launch something both freaky and unfettered by continuity. With only eight episodes in this first season, it doesn’t even require a major time investment to see the story through. The X-Men are supposed to represent humanity, evolved. Legion might just do the same for TV.Legion starts on Fox in the US on 8 February, and on Fox UK and FX in Australia on 9 February
