In that frantic final stretch between finishing my degree and waiting for the sweet release of summer, I chose to combat my stress by watching a childhood classic, 1982’s ET. My howls of anguish brought concerned housemates to my room, where I pointed at the screen and gasped, “It’s Gertie. She’s just so cute!” The film’s youngest character was played by cherubic child actor Drew Barrymore, and I knew then that I’d always have a soft spot for her.Barrymore, now 42, is a Hollywood scion of the type we rarely see these days (Steven Spielberg is her godfather) and has a storied CV to match: drugs, booze and rehab, all precociously young.Why I love Emma Stone But she powered through, and by the 90s was enjoying critical and commercial success at a clip. That’s my favourite Barrymore era: the classics Scream (1996), The Wedding Singer (1998) and, my second favourite Drew performance, Never Been Kissed (1999). Simply put, she radiates warmth: her smile is broad, her eyes are limpid pools, and her lisp is cute and distinctive. Her whole vibe is “aggressively gentle hippy” with an edge (a side-effect of her hardcore childhood?). Her coolness is inherent, and it makes her sexy in a breezy way. She wears many more hats now (she produced both Charlie’s Angels movies, and directed Whip It), but I love her best as an actor: my favourite Drew film is Going The Distance, an underrated but weirdly realistic and very funny romantic comedy.Barrymore’s latest project is (the somewhat middling) Netflix horror comedy Santa Clarita Diet, about a fortysomething enjoying a surprising new lease of life. The metaphor is clangingly obvious. Shine on, Drew.
