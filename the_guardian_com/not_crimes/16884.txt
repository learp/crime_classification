The Madonna biopic may be going ahead, but it appears the star whose career is reportedly to be made into a movie by Universal will not endorse its production. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the script to Blond Ambition – a screenplay by Elyse Hollander that topped last year’s Black List of the industry’s best unproduced scripts, and is named after the artist’s 1990 tour – was acquired the studio, and will focus on her early career. But it appears the musician will not be authorising its filming. “Nobody knows what I know and what I have seen,” she said in a post on Instagram in the wake of the news. “Only I can tell my story. Anyone else who tries is a charlatan and a fool. “Looking for instant gratification without doing the work. This is a disease in our society,” she concluded.Madonna before stardom – in pictures According to reports, the story for Blond Ambition takes place in the early 1980s, with the star working on “her first album, struggling in a business that treats women badly, while also dealing with a burgeoning love life and the first hints of fame”.Of course there is a chance that Madonna’s animosity towards the film comes from a place of frustration, and that she would prefer to take the reins on her own life-story. She has, after all, starred in and directed a number of films, most recently 2011’s W.E., a drama inspired by the romance of Wallis Simpson and Edward VIII.
