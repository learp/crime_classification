Just Eat has struck a £10m-a-year deal to be the new sponsor of The X Factor and intends to launch a nationwide “Chef Factor” hunt for takeaway cooks to star in its branded clips.Just Eat’s multiyear deal, one of the largest for a weekly show on British television, includes sponsorship of The X Factor TV show, app and the annual live tour.The move marks a major ramping-up of the online takeaway food service’s marketing and advertising strategy following significant growth in its business after it swallowed Hungry House, its biggest competitor in the UK, for £200m in December. When good TV goes bad: why X Factor lost its way with One Direction A fall in The X Factor viewing numbers – last year’s final was the lowest-rated in the show’s 12-year history – has not dented the value of the deal. It is understood to be similar to the figure paid by TalkTalk, which last year ended its 10-year partnership that dated to when it was part of Carphone Warehouse. ITV had reportedly sought up to £15m a year for the sponsorship. The deal comes as Channel 4 kicks off the search for a sponsor for The Great British Bake Off, which will air on commercial TV for the first time this year, with bids starting at £8m.“It is a great fit for both brands as we each play a key role for millions of people every weekend,” said Barnaby Dawe, chief marketing officer at Just Eat. “The partnership will give the business a fantastic opportunity to reach an even broader audience.”ITV said Just Eat, which sponsored The X Factor app last year, will be associated with one of the most valuable properties on commercial television.Just Eat has almost 28,000 restaurant partners serving more than 100 types of cuisine to about 9 million regular customers in the UK.“To have the opportunity to showcase the breadth and diversity of their cuisine, as well as their singing talent, is incredibly exciting,” Dawe said.
