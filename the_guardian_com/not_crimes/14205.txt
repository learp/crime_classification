Profiles in History founder Joe Maddalena said the blazer – which had an asking price of $6,000-$8,000 (£4,500-£6,000) – was scheduled to be sold before Prince’s sudden death in April. The signature shirt worn by Prince’s character the Kid had an asking price of $3,000-$5,000 (£2,300-£3,800) before the auction. Prince, 57, was found dead at his Paisley Park compound in Minnesota on 21 April, from what was later found to be an accidental overdose of a powerful painkiller, Fentanyl.

It’s what made his career. It’s probably what he’ll be remembered for always. To have an important piece like this is pretty astonishing and an amazing opportunity.” A spokesman for Profiles in History refused to reveal who bought the items from the Icons of Hollywood sale. A Swarovski crystal-studded glove worn by Michael Jackson on his 1992 Dangerous world tour was also due to auctioned but was removed. Last week, a yellow Cloud electric guitar that Prince played in concerts was sold at auction to the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, Jim Irsay. Prince used the guitar at gigs until the mid-1990s. Mr Irsay, who collects musical instruments, paid $137,500 (£103,000) for the guitar when it went on sale at Heritage Auctions in Beverley Hills, California.
