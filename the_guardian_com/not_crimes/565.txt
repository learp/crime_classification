I had passed the villages of Ash, Highway and Coat in territory unknown to me close to the river Parrett when I saw the name New Cross and pictures of cherries on a board, which told me that I had reached my destination, once a typical Somerset mixed farm where cattle roamed but now a fruit farm.There are two good reasons for growing fruit hereabouts, near South Petherton. The protection of surrounding hills and ridges like the Poldens produces a balmy micro-climate, and a specially helpful soil retains moisture. The fact that one field, now given over to gooseberries, has long been known as the cherry orchard and that old villagers used to talk of the great cherry trees that once grew there tells of local fruit-growing in earlier times. But I was taken to see ranks of modern cherry trees. Several varieties were all growing on Gisela 5 rootstock, which keeps the trees compact, and under frames of netting to keep out the birds â€“ mainly blackbirds, though this year mistle thrushes too.Only one kind of tree needs no such protection. The Morello cherry, grown to make liqueur by a neighbouring distiller of cider brandy, is so tart that birds will not touch it. Twelve young people from Romania and Bulgaria, here on a six-month scheme for seasonal agricultural work, and the farmer's wife, were meticulously picking each cherry from its clump, discarding any split ones, and retaining the perfect ones in their satchels. They were working intently on Sweetheart cherries before moving off in their trucks to the long tables outside the barn for a cheerful mid-morning break. It looked like a traditional scene from Provence. A good, warm spell at flowering time meant that fruit was ready to pick 10 days earlier than usual, and hand-picked fruits as well as produce like honey and apple juice were on sale at the farm gate.
