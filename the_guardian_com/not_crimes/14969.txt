Standing in the depths of one of the surviving remnants of the ancient pinewoods, I waited for the sound I had come to hear. The silence of the Highlands has to be consciously listened for and here it was indeed – complete silence. Visually it was difficult to know what to look at first. The trees were a mixture of birch and rowans plus the scots pine which, as usual, surpassed all the others.Along the river Farrar were the scattered juniper bushes, though perhaps trees would have been a better word. They were columnar rather than prostrate and were that dark green that looks almost forbidding as only these very old trees can. Other impressive trees were nearby, the small stand of aspen whose leaves were changing from their pale summer green to the yellows of autumn.In contrast, their silver bark was well marked with black diamond shapes that looked almost unreal. But there was something missing and it suddenly dawned on me – the aspen leaves were not trembling. The extremely flattened leaf stalks means that even in the slightest of breezes the leaves will shake. Well might the Latin name be Populus tremula.So there was no sound, and no breeze, but another of my senses was alerted as the fragrance of the pinewood came over me. It seemed like the resin from the pines but I could not be sure. Then the silence was broken by the guttural roaring of a red deer stag that sounded very close, but in such woodland I stood no chance of seeing it.It was answered by another stag and then another and within a few minutes there were at least five stags joining in from various parts of the wooded glen. It was one of those rare, magic moments that will long live in my mind.
