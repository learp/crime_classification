7.57pm BST19:57They dance their final dance to ‘Yesterday’, which is a song about when this was actually filmed. They give it their own personal spin with some Running Man and disco moves, which probably would have kept them out of the dance-off. Oh the irony.So that’s it for Strictly Week 2! Next week it’s MOVIE WEEK, so let’s endure it together from 6.45pm next Saturday. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, so feel free to swing by and give me a wave. Thanks for joining in, and have a brilliant week! HxFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.55pm BST19:55Ooh, TWIST! Anastacia and Brendan aren’t going to dance again, so the dance-off has been cancelled. So instead the public vote is deciding who is going home, and it’s….MELVIN AND JANETTE! I think that was the right way to do it, and the right decision in the end, as Melvin was the weakest dancer on the night. And on the upside, Janette now has all the time in the world to plan her wedding to Aljaz. Every cloud, eh?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.53pm BST19:53Next week is Movie Week! It’s my least favourite of all the theme weeks, and of course it has a rubbish trailer. Judge Rinder is going to be a Flintstone, but he doesn’t say which one. Wilma? Pebbles?

Judge Rinder and Oksana are safely through to next week, along with Danny and Oti, Laura and Giovanni, Claudia and AJ, Ore and Joanne, Ed and Katya (YES) and Naga and Pasha! So that means Melvin and Janette are in the Dance Off! This is going to be awful, how are the judges going to decide?

Tameka and Gorka are safe, along with Greg and Natalie, Louise and Kevin, Daisy and Aljaz, Will and Karen (yay #justiceforwill) and Lesley and Anton.The first couple in the dance-off is…Anastacia and Brendan!OH NO. This is bad. Are they really going to make her dance again? This is not a dance-off I want to see at all.Updatedat 7.39pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.31pm BST19:31Ooh, I’d forgotten about Laura and Giovanni’s Waltz. It was proper dreamy.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.28pm BST19:28Goodness – turns out Anastacia’s injury last night was torn scar tissue from her mastectomy. That sounds awful, hope she’s able to continue.Updatedat 7.28pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.26pm BST19:26Last night on Strictly: some pretty decent dancing, all told. My mum came over for lunch today and is not happy about how good everyone is, it spoils the ‘journey’ for her and means the non-dancers get hoofed out too early. Thoughts?Highlights for me included Claudia and AJ’s whirling, Ore’s anorak, Ed’s banjo, Tameka’s swimsuit and Oti’s silver dress. Lowlights included Greg’s bum, Daisy’s cupcake costume, Louise’s lampshade, Rinder’s slapstick, Lesley’s grinding and the overall lack of training footage.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.23pm BST19:23Tess and Claudia Dress Watch: Tess in a one-shouldered horror in a really unflattering length, Claudia in a weird lace thing. 2/10.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.21pm BST19:21Pro dance time! Gorka’s on Spanish guitar, Oskana is contempo-wafting in a white hankie. An amateur production of Chicago provides the backing dance, while someone sings a half-arsed cover of Zayn’s Pillowtalk at a really weird tempo.
