Amazon is recalling the power adapter for some models of its popular Fire tablets, including one aimed at children, because of a risk of electrical shock.The recall affects the USB power adapters supplied with the UK versions of Amazon’s Fire 7in and Fire Kids Edition 7in tablets.Amazon said: “We have determined that, in rare cases, when the power adapter included with the UK Fire 7in and UK Fire Kids Edition 7in tablet is pulled from the wall socket, the adapter assembly may detach and create a risk of electrical shock.”The adapters with model number FABK7B were sold with the two tablets from September 2015. Amazon has requested that users stop using the original adapters immediately. The USB charging cable and tablet are unaffected and can continue to be used via another USB power adapter or computer.
