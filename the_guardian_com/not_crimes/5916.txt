Take a fresh look at Christmas lightsWaddesdon Manor, BuckinghamshireWhen darkness falls at the 19th-century Waddesdon Manor, the grand house and gardens provide the perfect canvas for some of Britain’s most exciting light art. The wizards at Woodroffe Bassett Design, the lighting designers who lit up the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, have created a light-and-sound show for the facade of the house. Best of all is light artist Bruce Munro’s piece Field of Light – an ethereal “meadow” of 9,000 fibre-optic glass spheres that bloom as you wander through them in the darkness.From 9 November-2 January, Wednesday-Sunday, waddesdon.org.ukGet a messiah complexNationwideAs much a Christmas tradition as overdosing on mince pies and TV, Handel’s Messiah is the only choral work many of us pay attention to all year.

That said, there are a handful of more modest, but no less joyful or triumphant, events organised by choral societies around the country.12 November, Ashton-under-Lyne, oldhamchoral.org.uk. 19 November, Ellesmere Port, epmsonline.co.uk. 20 November, the Nidderdale Messiah, Knaresborough, nidderdalemessiah.org.ukUnleash your inner poetWriters’ Centre, NorwichFeel inspired by Christmas and the beauty of winter and want to convey something a bit more complex than the words to Jingle Bells?
