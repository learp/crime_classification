Not one, but two PBs! Ok, so neither of them was mine but at least 50% of my house were beating their best, over that gruelling, will-sapping sufferfest that is, um, junior parkrun. Well, 2k is quite a feat of endurance if you are four ...So yes, both my girls were on fine form, albeit with their own inimitable melodrama: my seven year old gasping for water mid trot for all the world like someone lost in the Sahara. I swear she had more gulps than most people do during the entire MdS ... I cannot recommend junior parkrun highly enough for those wanting to give their kids a run around (rather than getting it in return). On these early autumnal days, with crisp air and golden sunshine, the parks are at their best - and I defy anyone not to laugh at some of the most creative mid-race excuses you’ll ever hear. Yesterday’s overheard highlights include: “I can’t run any more because my socks are too new”, “I’m tired because you wouldn’t let me watch television this morning” and the all time classic, applicable for all ages, “Where is the finish it’s too far away!”So, as always, I want to hear your own stories from the weekend. Did you PB, and if so did it also involve pizza and ice cream celebrations? Are you nursing a niggle (yup me too) or bouncing back to form? Your tales below the line please.
