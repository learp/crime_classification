Locally sourced food has graced our dining tables for years, but what about the dining table itself? Along with growing environmental concerns about flying furniture around the globe comes an increasing demand for locally produced furniture, ceramics and lighting, created with homegrown materials and inspired by nearby landscapes to create an interesting backstory.

They make furniture inspired by their city. “The north-east is steeped in industrial heritage,” says co-founder Mark McCormick (the graphic designer). “It has mined coal, built ships and invented steam trains. It has a creative force that’s really inspiring.”Originally designed for a riverside cafe, the Staiths shelving unit references the Dunston Staiths – industrial timber structures built in the river Tyne at the turn of the 20th century to expedite the transfer of coal from rail to river. “The Staiths weren’t built to be attractive,” says McCormick. “They are utilitarian, functional and industrial, but the rhythm of their latticework has its own beauty.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Novocastrian shelving inspired by timber structures built on the river Tyne at the turn of the century.Another Novocastrian product, the Slate Binate coffee table, comprises a blackened steel frame topped with Cumbrian slate quarried 75 miles from their workshop. “It’s about elevating local materials,” says Richy Almond (the architect). “Slate is seen as a boring, bumpy building material, but lift it off the ground by 350mm, frame it with a brass trim, and it’s totally different. A honed finish brings out the natural grain. Suddenly it’s as beautiful as Italian marble.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Kangan Arora’s Radium rug, £550, references the offcuts of vinyl that decorate trucks in her native India.

Her latest collection of cushions and rugs consists of three prints, Radium, Painter and Jali, sparked by a recent trip home. Radium references the offcuts of vinyl used to decorate commercial trucks in India: “They end up stuck to every surface in the workshops and create this incredible colourful camouflage,” she says. Painter comes from the traditional hand-painted signs that vinyl is slowly replacing: “I’ve taken their brushstrokes and enlarged them into a Memphis-style pattern.” Jali echoes decorative steel screens used protect Punjabi windows. “They’re functional objects, yet they have such beautiful, intricate patterns,” she says. Arora screen-prints her products by hand in her south London studio. “London is an incredible city, but it’s rather grey,” she laughs. “I think people are drawn to my colours.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Seaweed lines vessel, £190,Charlotte Jones.When the furniture designer Sebastian Cox was studying sustainable design at the University of Lincoln, bamboo was in vogue. “I couldn’t help thinking, ‘I’m sure coppiced hazel behaves the same way,’” Cox recalls. He now uses hazel, coppiced from woodland where he grew up in Kent, for his Underwood collection of seating, ladders and shelves. “Hopefully people will notice hazel in the woods and make that connection,” says Cox. Using the hazel “in the round” – with the bark intact – also reduces waste from a typical 50% to just 10%, and limits processing, which reduces the environmental impact and enables Cox to keep prices down.Ceramics designer Charlotte Jones finds inspiration in England’s most south-westerly county: “Living in Cornwall opens your eyes,” she says. “It might be the grain of local granite or some dead leaves, but something always sparks an idea.” Jones makes her pots from white stoneware clay, coloured with oxides and clay she digs herself. She burnishes them with a stone before firing them. “I wanted a pebble-like surface, so using a pebble I found on a local beach seemed only right,” she says.Nearby, Tom Raffield designs steam-bent furniture from a workshop in a tree-filled Cornish valley. His Scots Light, a lampshade made from 80 individually cut and steam-bent shards of ash, is inspired by cones that fall from the Scots pines surrounding his workshop. “I wouldn’t be making the work I am if I were anywhere else. I only need to step outside and an idea will be staring me in the face.”
