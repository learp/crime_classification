Aphex Twin is set to play his first UK show in five years with a performance at 2017’s Field Day festival. The pioneering electronic musician is set to play a two-hour set at The Barn, the festival’s new indoor arena. He has not played live in the UK since October 2012, despite the release of his acclaimed comeback album Syro in 2014. He will also play Day for Night festival in Texas at the end of this year. Tom Baker, Field Day’s co-founder, said it was an “incredible honour” to have Aphex on their bill. He added: “It’s truly amazing to have Aphex Twin headline Field Day, I’ve been listening to him since I was 16, he played and curated some of the first ever Eat Your Own Ears nights (the most memorable being a warehouse on Brick Lane that got closed down by the police!). It will be a phenomenal, mind-blowing, mesmerisingly fantastic two hours of absolute genius.”Watch the teaser video for Aphex Twin at Field Day 2017The Barn aims to act as a rival to the main stage at Field Day, with cutting-edge lighting and sound equipment within its gigantic metal construction. Field Day has developed a reputation for securing top artists to play the festival in Victoria Park, London.
