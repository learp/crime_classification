Fire at Sea, a harrowing documentary about Europe’s refugee crisis, has clinched the Golden Bear top prize from a jury led by Meryl Streep at the Berlin film festival.The movie by Italian director Gianfranco Rosi offers an unflinching look at life on the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa, where thousands of asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East have arrived trying to reach the European Union over the last two decades. Thousands more have perished on the dangerous journey in rickety, overcrowded boats.Fire at Sea review – a powerful study of migrant crisis The Eritrean-born Rosi, who spent several months on Italy’s Lampedusa making the film, dedicated the prize to its residents “who open their hearts to other peoples”.“I hope to bring awareness,” he said as he accepted the trophy from Streep. “It is not acceptable that people die crossing the sea trying to escape from tragedies.”The picture is told through the eyes of a 12-year-old local boy, Samuele Pucillo, and a doctor, Pietro Bartolo, who has been tending to the dehydrated, malnourished and traumatised new arrivals for a quarter of a century.In chilling footage, Rosi accompanied coastguard rescue missions answering the SOS calls of people on boats, most of them arriving from Libya. Many of the vessels are packed with corpses of people who suffocated from diesel fumes.Three-time Oscar winner Streep said her seven-member jury was “swept away” by Fire at Sea, which she called “urgent, imaginative and necessary filmmaking”.“It’s a daring hybrid of captured footage and deliberate storytelling that allows us to consider what documentary can do,” she said. “It demands its place in front of our eyes and compels our engagement and action.”The Golden Bear for Fire at Sea comes after the Cannes film festival in May 2015 awarded its Palme d’Or to Dheepan, a drama about Sri Lankan refugees living on the violent outskirts of Paris.Rosi, who captured the Venice film festival’s 2013 Golden Lion for his film Sacro GRA, said when his film premiered that Europe’s refugee crisis marked one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes since the Holocaust.He told reporters after the awards ceremony late on Saturday that he would aim to show the film to the people of Lampedusa in an open-air screening in the spring.
