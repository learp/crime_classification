Barack Obama says he looks forward to a time when girls are “astonished” that women once earned less than men and a woman had never occupied the Oval Office.Obama and other Democrats seized on Equal Pay Day on Tuesday, a symbolic event marking how much longer it takes a woman to earn as much as a man. Women still make on average 79 cents for every dollar (55p to every 70p) men are paid.Obama dedicated a new national monument to women’s equality and pushed Congress to pass legislation requiring employers to show pay disparity is not based on gender. He said he had been encouraged by movement toward full gender equality in many arenas including boardrooms, sport and politics.The president said: “I want [women] to be astonished that there was ever a time when women were vastly outnumbered in the boardroom or in Congress, or there was ever a time when a woman had never sat in the Oval Office.“I don’t know how long it will take to get there, but I know we’re getting closer to that day.”The president has not endorsed a successor, but his comments are the latest in a series that suggest he’s supporting Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner who would be the first female US president if elected.“If we truly value fairness then America should be a level playing field,” Obama said at the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum, the one-time home of the National Woman’s party. It is now designated as Belmont-Paul women’s equality national monument.Members of the US women’s football team recently filed a wage discrimination complaint against the sport’s governing body, and the actor Jennifer Lawrence has spoken out about being paid less than male co-stars.The Democrats’ focus on equal pay comes during a presidential campaign where the Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, has alienated many female voters with his comments.
