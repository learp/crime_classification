I wonder why.Juliette EyreLondon• I was surprised to see the cauliflower described as humble (How the cauli got hip, G2, 14 April). It used to be considered rather grand. Hence Mark Twain’s remark: “Cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education.”Martin StubbsLondon• The Disney version is far from being “the original” Jungle Book film (Peter Bradshaw, 13 April). Some of us remember Sabu in the 1942 Korda classic and it was not a musical either.Rob MorrishOldbury, West Midlands• Exotic reasons for train delays (Letters, 13 April) surely get no better than one I once heard that involved changes to the space-time continuum. As the train from London pulled in to Norwich, the train manager apologised for its late arrival, saying this was due to “the gradual loss of time during the journey”.Peter AffordLondon• Stations now regularly advise travellers to “inform station staff of any suspicious behaviour”.
