I really want to build a small pond in my garden because I know they are a really good way to get lots of wildlife, such as birds, frogs and insects, to visit your garden. But I'm unsure exactly how to do it. My garden is on a gentle slope and I don't have any other source of water beyond my hosepipe. Does a pond need to be fed with fresh water, or can the water just be left alone? Will any plants I put in the pond keep the water clean? Do I need to stock it with animals, or will they just come by themselves? Please help!P Keene, by emailAnyone fortunate enough to have a pond will usually extol their many benefits, not least their magnetic qualities when it comes to wildlife.But they don't just happen by magic. They require planning and maintenance. Pond Conservation, a UK charity which works to "create, conserve, protect and promote ponds", has produced some excellent resources aimed at answering just this question. Here's just a introductory taster:Really clean water is essential for making great wildlife ponds. For most people rainwater is the best as tap water often has high nutrient levels. Most garden ponds need a liner - but don't add soil or upside down turves to your pond to root plants, because turves have high levels of nutrients that will pollute the pond. Put a layer of fine washed gravel or clean sand (we use the sand for children's sandpits) on the bottom. If you are adding aquatic plants in pots fill these with a sand/gravel mix, not compost to avoid adding nutrients.I will be asking Pond Conversation to participate in the debate below, but this column is an experiment in crowd-sourcing a reader's question, so please let us know your own thoughts, advice and experiences (as opposed to emailing them).
