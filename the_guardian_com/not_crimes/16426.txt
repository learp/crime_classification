We are writing to express our deep concern about the threatened closure of the New Art Gallery Walsall as a result of cuts to public funding (Report, 26 October). Since it opened in February 2000, just before Tate Modern in London, the gallery has become a symbol of the social and economic regeneration of Walsall. It has been proof that the nation is committed to the principle that everyone should have access to the arts wherever they live in the UK.The gallery is the home of the world-famous Garman Ryan Collection – 365 works gifted by Kathleen Garman to the people of Walsall in 1973. This donation features many works by her husband, the renowned sculptor Jacob Epstein, their friends and family members, including Modigliani and Lucian Freud, alongside masterpieces by artists such as Turner, Van Gogh, Monet and Constable.The gallery has worked with many leading contemporary artists over the years, presenting a programme of outstanding commissions and exhibitions. Its closure would be a devastating blow to the life of the community and send a signal that the authorities have no regard for the value of the arts to those very communities.Fiona Bradley Director, Fruitmarket GalleryDr Maria Balshaw Director, Manchester City Art Gallery and Whitworth Art GalleryIwona Blazwick Director, Whitechapel GalleryCaroline Collier Director of partnerships and programmes, Tate Jeremy Deller ArtistDr Stephen Deuchar Director, Art Fund Adam Caruso Caruso St John ArchitectsAlex Farquharson Director, Tate BritainMartin Green CEO & Director, Hull City of Culture 2017Simon Groom Director, Scottish National Gallery of Modern ArtPaul Hobson Director, Modern Art OxfordAlistair Hudson Director, Mima, MiddlesbroughJudy Kelly Artistic director, Southbank CentreDavid Lan Director, The Young VicJames Lingwood Co-director, ArtangelDave Moutrey Director and CEO, HomeAndrew Nairne Director, Kettle’s YardHans Ulrich Obrist Artistic director, Serpentine GalleryCornelia Parker ArtistGrayson Perry ArtistFiona Rae ArtistJonathan Reekie Director, Somerset House TrustCharles Saumarez Smith CEO, Royal Academy of ArtsConrad Shawcross ArtistMatthew Slotover Co-founder, FriezeKathleen Soriano Chair, Liverpool BiennialPeter St John Caruso St John ArchitectsPolly Staple Director, Chisenhale GallerySally Tallant Director, Liverpool BiennialPaul Thompson Rector, Royal College of ArtMark Wallinger ArtistSimon Wallis Director, Hepworth WakefieldJonathan Watkins Director, Ikon GalleryRichard Wentworth ArtistSamuel West Chair, National Campaign for the Arts• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
