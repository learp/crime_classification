What better way for a newly minted US citizen like myself to celebrate the fact than with a third helping of The Purge? Or, as I think of it, Murder: Legal For A Day! It was easily the most American movie I could have watched over the Independence Day weekend, and also, handily enough, easily the most anti- or un-American.The Purge: Election Year review – a pardon for society's lust for carnage Purge the first, from three summers ago, didn’t seem to realise what a great premise it was sitting on – a corrupt patriarchy, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA), plucked from a rib of The Handmaid’s Tale, permits an annual 12-hour suspension of the taboo against murder – and instead positioned itself as a domestic siege movie in the mode of Assault On Precinct 13. The Purge: Anarchy from 2014 remedied that shortcoming with a vengeance, imagining the Purge’s evolution into a Darwinian, state-sponsored ethnic and social cleansing pogrom, with the champagne-swilling One-Percenters cheering on the mayhem from the safety of their armoured compounds.It also benefited from the addition of Frank Grillo, whose face and bearing recall any number of hardy, ill-shaven B-movie and comic-book platoon sergeants, and whose arrival switched the franchise from a defensive stance toward the offensive tendencies of the follow-ups. The besieged took to the streets, some reluctantly, others for sport, and took the fight to the enemy, usually in tooled-up RVs and buses, so that stationary Precinct 13 gives way to kinetic, headlong Race With The Devil, by way of The Omega Man.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest In The Purge: Election Year, Grillo’s Leo Barnes is chief of security for a senator (Elizabeth Mitchell) aiming to end the Purge, who is thus Target No 1 for the NFFA. You get the picture: the compound is betrayed and Leo and Senator Roan must face the minatory streets, populated by a cohort of “murder tourists” from such morally compromised nations as South Africa and Russia, as well as the usual hordes of spree-killers and gang-beef score-settlers, plus the heavily armed NFFA execution squad.The Purge: Anarchy review – social breakdown in thriller sequel Most of the fun lies in the adornments – the crazed costuming, the emblems on the NFFA uniforms (circular swastikas, Confederate flags) – and the psychoticisation of pretty much everything emblematically American: gun-toting Uncle Sams; “PURGE” painted in blood on the Lincoln Memorial.Sure, it has its moralistic cake and eats it too, abhorring and embracing its own chaos, but who cares? I haven’t seen this much wickedly pointed social commentary in a pure drive-in movie since Dawn Of The Dead in 1978. Perfect fare for a sceptically minded New American.
