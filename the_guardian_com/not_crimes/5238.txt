Above all, this magazine likes to celebrate. We like to find the joy and shout about it. Which is partly why we publish our annual list of 50 things we love about food. Sometimes the list includes events, ingredients, people, places that are happening now, such as the tacos at El Pastor at London’s Borough Market or the sterling (and to my mind crucial) work of the country’s best coffee machine mechanic. Other times we look forward, an appetiser to something that is bound to be good, say the opening of Monica Galetti’s first restaurant.If it’s worth talking about, we will be there. Whether it is something within the reach of everyone such as Bread Ahead’s ginger cake or something for those who like to track down the lesser known and hard to find, such as the beautiful Hungarian mangalitsa pigs at Coombeshead Farm in Cornwall, we like to sing about it. We usually have something for everyone. This year’s favourite 50 starts on page 17.We also love to celebrate the classics, including those recipes that never let us down. Which is why we have a section devoted to the time-honoured dishes of the Middle East. And, more specifically, the recipes of Claudia Roden. These are dishes that have been made countless times, that transport us to their homeland, and, let’s be honest, will probably be cooked for ever. We have chosen a handful of our favourites for you.This month, the magazine also takes a look at Tom Daley’s Life on a Plate – just what does a champion eat? And I bring you a crateload of recipes with oranges, lemons and limes, from a yolk-yellow Seville orange curd to a midwinter fireside dinner of potatoes baked with lemon and cotechino sausage. Something else to celebrate.
