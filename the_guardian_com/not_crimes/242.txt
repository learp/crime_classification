A drone was flown just 30 metres from a Boeing 757 jet near Manchester airport, according to an official near-miss report.The pilot of the airliner “expressed his surprise” after spotting the object shortly after take-off, the UK Airprox Board (UKAB) said.He was turning right at an altitude of 450 metres (1,500ft) – a “critical phase of flight” – when the incident occurred.The report stated that the drone was “extremely close to the aircraft”, passing just 15 metres above and 30 metres to the left.Experts “quickly agreed that there had been a definite risk of collision” and the incident was put in the most serious risk category.The latest monthly UKAB meeting examined six near-misses between drones and aircraft, including reports from near Heathrow, Glasgow and Newcastle airports.The British Airline Pilots Association has said the risk of collisions between aircrafts and drones is “unacceptably high”.Last month a drone was believed to have hit a British Airways flight landing at Heathrow, although it later emerged it may have been a plastic bag.Drone operators must keep their craft away from planes and airfields, and not fly above 120 metres. They are also barred from flying drones with cameras within 50 metres of people, vehicles or buildings, or over congested areas or large gatherings, such as concerts and sports events.In the Queen’s speech it was announced that the government would introduce new regulations on drones in a modern transport bill.
