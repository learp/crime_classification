It was the first attack on political correctness I had come across.The funniest TV show I’ve ever seenI can never choose between The Office and I’m Alan Partridge.The funniest number3.The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever hadThere is nothing funny about hair, it’s just very thin strings on your head.The funniest dream I’ve ever hadThe one where I was licking Vladimir Putin’s face like a popsicle.
