Morrissey has cancelled all remaining dates on his US tour, while placing the blame squarely with his management.The December dates had already been rescheduled once due to Gustavo Mazur’s health problems – the keyboardist collapsed backstage before a show in Boulder, Colorado. Writing on fansite True to You, Morrissey said that 360 Management were to blame: “There was apparently not even enough money to transport the touring party to the next scheduled city, and 360 Management faded out as quickly as they had faded in.”       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   His ninth favourite audience this year … Morrissey in Gothenburg, Sweden in August.

That was good news for Philadelphia, which topped the list, but rather less welcome for fans in Tokyo and Tel-Aviv, who were placed bottom of his list. His hometown Manchester came in at eighth place. Morrissey wrote: “This year, the mobilized strength of our ragingly loyal audiences were most appreciated, by me, at:1. Philadelphia, USA.2. Brooklyn, USA.3. Hong Kong, China.4. Adelaide, Australia.5. Melbourne, Australia.6. Santa Barbara, USA.7. Helsinki, Finland.8. Manchester, England.9. Gothenburg, Sweden.10. Chicago, USA.11.
