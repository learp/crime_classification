The National Television Awards7.30pm, ITVThe awards season accelerates towards top speed, nearing the point where gongs are doled out at such a rate that one suspects a lot of time and money could be saved by delivering statuettes and speeches via drones and Skype. For now, though, such events remain stubbornly in meatspace, meaning it’s time for Dermot O’Leary to dust off his dinner jacket and head to the O2 for the annual viewer-voted awards. Expect the Downton Abbey team to suffix their swansong with a win in the drama category. Mark Gibbings-JonesSin City Motors8pm, DaveThis returning hot-rod show focuses on the cars customised by Steve Darnell, who charges around $60,000 per build. Tonight’s client on a false deadline is pharmacist Craig, who wants to turn a derelict ’57 Chevy into something that his wife can use – but will make him feel as if he is cutting loose, too. Steve has a hairstyle analogy. “It’s kind of like a mullet,” he says. “Business in front. Party in back.” Once a C4 (1984-1996) Corvette with decent suspension is found, the transformation can begin. John RobinsonThe Town That Took on the Taxman9pm, BBC2As part of the Black Economy season, Heydon Prowse looks at the techniques used by large companies operating in the UK to avoid tax and sees what might happen if local businesses in a small town in Wales used them. Crickhowell is home to a number of independent concerns – including a salmon smokery and bakery – that have successfully fought off a large supermarket chain. Now, in a satirical experiment, they see if they can’t pull the same tricks to dodge tax as used by their more overbearing competitors. David Stubbs24 Hours in A&E9pm, Channel 4This week at St George’s in Tooting, 52-year-old retired fireman John is airlifted to the A&E department after being hit in the face with a golf club – the force of the blow snapped the club in two. It’s a critical head injury, with doctors concerned that his right eye is not reacting properly, while he experiences weakness on the right-hand side of his body. Elsewhere, 77-year-old Joan arrives after falling down the stairs and hurting her leg. As she waits for treatment, she tells her story of growing up in nearby Camberwell. Ben ArnoldEmpire of the Tsars: Romanov Russia with Lucy Worsley9pm, BBC4The Romanovs didn’t do change. Or rather, as Lucy Worsley outlines in her usual crisp fashion, Alexander II (1818-81), who freed the serfs, began to drag feudal Russia into the 19th century, but was ultimately assassinated for his troubles when radicals grew tired of compromise. His successors, Alexander III and Nicholas II, decided on a return to autocracy. But the world had changed and the dynasty’s demise, hastened by Russia’s entanglement in the first world war, was nigh. Jonathan Wright10,000 BC: Two Tribes10pm, Channel 5Once again, this reality show takes 12 people back to the stone age, dumping them in a remote part of Bulgaria wearing sack-like fashions. However, this time round there’s a twist: what they don’t realise is that there’s a rival group and soon they’ll have to compete for food and drink, which means there’s a small chance they might eat each other on TV. Some of this lot don’t look as if they could get on a bus by themselves, so it’ll be interesting to see how they approach the fight for survival over the next two months. Hannah VerdierComic Strip Presents: Red Top10pm, GoldNews International gets a thorough skewering in this new instalment of the veteran satire series Comic Strip. The peerless Maxine Peake stars as flame-haired red top editor Rebekah Brooks, an “innocent and beguiling northern girl” who rises to the top of the tabloid publishing empire alongside Russell Tovey’s Andy Coulson. As ever, it’s a star-studded affair, with Stephen Mangan as a 70s Tony Blair and Harry Enfield as Ross Kemp, alongside top turns from Johnny Vegas, Nigel Planer and Alexei Sayle. BAFilm choiceHitchcock (Sacha Gervasi, 2012) 9pm, Film4This portrait of the crafty, complex and creepy – but, lest we forget, great – director covers the making of his horror masterpiece Psycho. Anthony Hopkins (in the title role) and Helen Mirren as his wife are their usual efficient selves, and his struggle with the nervous studio bosses is entertaining, but it’s all rather reverential and less incisive than the HBO/BBC movie The Girl. Paul HowlettGood (Vicente Amorim, 2008) 11.45pm, BBC1The weakness at the heart of this study of Nazi evil mirrors its pliable protagonist. In 1930s Germany, Viggo Mortensen’s Professor Halder is no champion of National Socialism, but finds himself rewarded for his casual compliance. He is flattered by Mark Strong’s high-ranking Bouhler and sexy student Anne (Jodie Whittaker), and betrays his old Jewish friend (Jason Isaacs).
