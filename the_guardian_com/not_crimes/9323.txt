Almost two weeks have passed since the nesting female mute swan was viciously attacked by dogs and succumbed to her injuries, but it feels as though the mill pond is still in mourning.Rain tears my cheeks, the water is turbid with suspended silt, and the customary raucous gaggles of mallards, coots and moorhens are conspicuous by their absence. Even the rising chorus of chiffchaffs, Cetti’s warblers and reed warblers is muted. It seems apt that the ruby-petalled beach rose (Rosa rugosa) scrambling over the bank above the seawall provides the only splash of colour in this sombre landscape. The rose is sacred to Aphrodite, goddess of love, as is the swan. According to Greek mythology Aphrodite was born of sea foam, and from this foam, wherever it touched the ground, grew white rose bushes. When Aphrodite’s lover was slain the blooms were stained with his blood.Clutch engages the curious I heard that the bereaved cob had taken on the task of incubation, but within days of the pen’s death a bevy of swans had been spotted loitering offshore and he had been forced repeatedly to abandon the nest to fight for his territory. I can see the nest lies deserted, the eggs presumably scavenged by predators. My suspicions that the cob had finally been dethroned are confirmed when the usurpers glide out from behind the reed bed. Surprisingly, both birds are lean and lightweight, with the gangly look of youth. I reckon they have only just reached sexual maturity and are probably newly coupled. It looks unlikely that they will attempt to breed this year, as they are displaying no signs of courtship behaviour.My spirits are buoyed by a twittering warble. I look up to find two swallows perched on a branch above the tidal stream. The female takes flight, her forked tail streamers fluttering in the breeze. The male whirls after her, looping and swooping over the alder carr. Swallows too are associated with Aphrodite and are reputed to carry the souls of the dead. As the rain stops, the pair spiral up in effortless ascension. I watch as they grow smaller and smaller, eventually dissolving into the cloud and becoming part of the sky itself.
