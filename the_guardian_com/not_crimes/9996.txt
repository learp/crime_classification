What an amazing book! It did not even take me two days to complete it. The entire book I just raced through it just to find out what will happen next and how are they going to solve their problems.Imagine, you and your mother were in the supermarket and for a split second you can’t see where your mother is and that certain feeling you get, just thinking about it gives you goosebumps. Or, imagine your mother going out of the house not informing you where she is going, why she is going and when she will be coming back. Isn’t that just creepy and scary? Danni, a 15-year-old young woman, had to go through this horrific incident where she had no clue where her mother went and when she would be coming back. Her childhood friend, Levi, is one of the main leads who helps Danni in dealing with the situation. On the other hand, the disappearance of Danni’s mother, Mary, is not a coincidence but a big secret which Danni is not aware of. As the story progresses there is more action and revealing of many secrets which just keeps the reader engaged, like every part of the story is linked to everything. Danni then has to live with her father until this problem is solved. But some weird incidents take place such as people start treating the poor girl differently, calling her a particular group of people where they are just a damage to the society. From here the story is exhilarating and it just keeps you read more. Through solving problems they come across many evil people which just sums up why this entire thing is happening. On a personal note this is a must read book for everyone as it just gives a whole new experience. The story is a mixture of modern and older religion practices which just makes it very effective to read and also a more educational book. How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
