A new train ticket website is promising to save passengers as much as 60% on rail fares by finding route combinations and “split ticket” deals not normally available on standard booking systems.Ticketclever.com, created by a former senior executive of Virgin Trains and Trainline, went fully live this week and says it uses “groundbreaking” algorithms that crunch hundreds of millions of fare and route combinations to unlock savings.It will also take advantage of the many quirks in Britain’s train ticketing system – not least because of the number of different rail operating companies – such as split ticketing. This is where a journey is broken down into separate parts with a ticket for each section.The launch coincided with news of what’s been dubbed the biggest shake-up of train fares for three decades, with “radical” changes supposedly guaranteeing simpler fares and, it is claimed, removing the need for split ticketing.Trials are due to start in May on selected routes including London and Sheffield, Glasgow and Edinburgh.Overhaul of UK train ticket pricing to be trialled in May Ticketclever is not the first to locate cheap tickets – the TicketySplit tool and app on Martin Lewis’s MoneySavingExpert.com site does the same, as does splityourticket.co.uk. But Ticketclever claims its service is simpler and faster, and its website is certainly quite hi-tech and user friendly. Indeed, when we carried out our own test, we found that splityourticket.co.uk failed to supply data on some occasions, while TicketySplit was more laborious for some journeys as it would only give prices for single tickets (it says it doesn’t “yet” provide a split ticket search facility for returns, adding that two singles are often - but certainly not always - cheaper).So how did Ticketclever fare on test?The very cheapest long-distance fares are only available by booking far ahead, and the specialist websites will probably be no better at finding them than the National Rail Enquiries service or the train operating companies’ sites.Short-distance routes – such as daily commuter journeys into London – rarely throw up split-ticketing opportunities. And it’s often the case that they don’t seem to be able to offer better deals at weekends, when fares are typically lower.Where sites such as Ticketclever and TicketySplit should work best are for cheaper deals on journeys that have to be taken on the day, or in the next few days. They also seem to be better at sourcing those for cross-country routes rather than those into London.

Photograph: Atoc/PAGet a railcardRailcards give a third off most fares – but the type will depend on the journeys you make.For £30 a year, the Network Railcard gives a third off all tickets across most of southern England (in the network area) but only on trains that leave after 10am weekdays, or any at weekends.The £30 16-25 Railcard gives young people (and all full-time students) a third off all fares UK-wide. There isn’t the same 10am restriction, but minimum fares (£12) apply to pre-10am weekday trains. It is a similar deal to the £30 Senior Railcard for the 60-plus, and Disabled Persons Railcard (£20 a year).The Family & Friends Railcard has a similar off-peak offer, but adults have to travel with kids. The card is on special offer at £24 for half-term if you use code FEB17. There is also the Two Together Railcard which gives one-third off standard and first-class anytime, off-peak and advance fares after 9.30am Monday to Friday, or any time at weekendsThe gold card trickIf you travel regularly, consider the cheapest gold card season ticket, which gives a third off all travel, including Oyster, made after 9.30am. The cheapest is the £140 Exeter St Davids to Exeter Central (part-time). Many commuters who leave on post-9.30am trains use this for the third off the standard fare. Crucially, there is no minimum fare.You can also buy a child/partner a discounted railcard for £10.Book earlyVirgin season ticket means I can reserve a seat, so why am I forced to stand? To get the lowest fares for non-commuter trips, you have to book 12 weeks before travel. Contractually, Network Rail must have the timetable set 12 weeks in advance.Therefore operators commonly, though not always, release cheap advance tickets shortly after. National Rail has a handy future travel chart showing the dates you can buy advance tickets for each train firm.The Trainline website has a little-known system that emails you an alert the moment cheap advance tickets for a specific journey come on sale.Remember, two singles are often cheaper than a return. However, many of the cheapest fares are non-refundable if you don’t turn up. You also have to get the exact train you booked.But don’t book using Trainline as its booking charges are too high. Instead, use the Virgin Trains East Coast website (yes, for all tickets, not just its own) for buying long-distance tickets. Travel off peakIf your search reveals the cheapest advance fares have gone, you may still find a cheap alternative if you switch to another day. For example, from London to Edinburgh for the weekend, the cheapest are available on Saturday afternoon. Coming back, they are cheaper on Monday evening. The rail companies have moved to airline-style pricing, which rewards those prepared to travel when there is the least demand.Vary the route/timingBy switching routes slightly you can bring the fare down dramatically. If you took the 08.00 direct train from London to Manchester, arriving at 10.07, your single journey would cost £169 and take two hours and seven minutes.Yet take the 08.07 from London to Stafford, then switch trains and travel on to Manchester, and it would cost £111 and take two hours and 26 minutes. The extra 19 minutes saves £58.Most travellers between London and Bristol will generally go from Paddington using Great Western Railway. However, South West Trains also runs to Bristol, but the fares are cheaper.Last-minute travelYou can buy advance fares up to 6pm the night before and pay substantially less than if you turn up on the day.MegatrainThe website sells hundreds of discounted singles on South West Trains and East Midland Trains. A weekend return London to Leicester in late February was £11 each way on the Megatrain website this week – £22 in total. National Rail quoted £35.50 on the same trains.
