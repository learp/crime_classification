A recent study has shown what every teacher and parent knew: most boys read less enthusiastically and thoroughly than girls. Sue Palmer, in her book 21st Century Boys attributes this to brain development. Testosterone accelerates right brain growth and makes boys more interested in overview, movement and space for longer. The effects have now been confirmed in two big studies led by Keith Topping, professor of education and social research at the University of Dundee.So what can we do to stimulate the left brains of squirmy boys and get them reading with as much commitment as their sisters? Don’t underestimate the power of example, for a start. Boys need to see older males reading joyfully – otherwise they risk writing it off as a “girly” thing. So that’s down to dads and other male role models. Primary schools – female dominated environments, usually – should regularly invite in male authors, librarians and volunteers to talk about reading and share books. A footballer with a passion for books would be good, for instance.Ah, football … When I worked as a teacher-librarian in a challenging inner-city boys school I quickly learned to tap into their interests and show a real interest in them. Last week I gave a visiting seven-year-old boy a review copy I had of Chris Hoy’s On Your Bike. He opened the book and disappeared into it, because bikes and cycling are his current “thing”. Of course, his parents are now encouraging the cycling and the reading.There’s much to be said for blocks of dedicated reading time, both in school and at home. Simply set aside half an hour when silence falls and every adult and child dives into a book of choice. It used to be called Eric (Everyone Reads in Class) and it’s vital that “everyone” means exactly that, so that children see adults they respect immersed in reading. And don’t worry if some boys choose “easy” material. You have to build the habit and reading stamina before you can start – very gently and unjudgmentally – trying to nudge them towards anything more challenging. We all read at different levels at different times, and boys are no different.• Unlocking the Reader in Every Child by Susan Elkin is published by Ransom.
