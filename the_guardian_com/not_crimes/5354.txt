10 Years Of Hypercolour, BristolWhen people are serious about equipment, they tend to be serious full stop. Marieu and Lucretio – a Berlin-based techno duo so into their hardware that they named their live act Analogue Cops – are such people. In some ways, such unwavering stridency is a strange fit for Hypercolour’s 10th birthday. Having released the neon house of Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler and Eats Everything, the Bristol label is far from conservative, and over the last decade it has done a great deal to challenge the elitism that infected so much dance music in the mid-00s. Yet Analogue Cops are neither dull, nor as flimsy as some of Hypercolour’s output; their energising noise will be the perfect headline for a night celebrating the young pretenders who have turned it into a dancefloor institution. They’ll be joined on the night by starry-eyed producer A Sagittariun and Berlin acid explorer Luca Lozano. Come down and get set for the next decade.The Island, SatCJFatima Yamaha, London & LeedsIn 2004, Dutch producer Bas Bron released an EP on a small Irish deep house label under a new moniker, Fatima Yamaha. Down at the end of the B-side was What’s A Girl To Do, a mid-tempo electropop number with a dogged little pulse, a sample of Scarlett Johansson in Lost In Translation, and an addictive raspberry ripple melody. It didn’t cross over, but slowly became a secret weapon for everyone from Dixon to Bicep; Jackmaster called it “the tune of the week/month/year/history of the universe”; and Hudson Mohawke included it on his 2009 Essential Mix, then sampled it for his track Resistance last year. It eventually got a triumphant reissue, and was voted (perhaps a little damningly, given its age) the best track of 2015 by the staff of Resident Advisor. Fatima Yamaha is far from a one-hit wonder, though: What’s A Girl is one of the more contemplative moments of his live sets, which tie together dramatic deep house, cutesy electro and headrushing cosmic disco with his signature funky squiggles.Village Underground, EC2, Thu; Hi-Fi Club, Leeds, FriBBInside Out, ManchesterEdinburgh-based Firecracker Recordings have spent the past decade enriching Scotland’s music scene with a commitment to oddball house, techno and experimental electronics. Having released numerous long and short players by enigmatic artists such as Vakula and Fudge Fingas, it had a surprise hit last year with Expressions, the follow-up to Nick Moore’s 2009 debut as Linkwood. Effortlessly shifting gears between colourful grooves and understated, machine-informed melancholy, Linkwood is similarly ambitious and skilful in his DJ sets. Alongside Inside Out’s knowledgable residents Mike O’Mara and Chris Feinmann, he continues to expand on his sound.The Whiskey Jar, FriJTHinge Finger x All City, DublinJoy Orbison and the Trilogy Tapes’ Will Bankhead have spent the last four years rolling out carefully considered cuts from the margins of dance music via their Hinge Finger label. Its five releases to date include Madteo’s slurring Bugler Gold Pt 1, complete with decaying vocals and the producer’s portrait on the cover; Blawan’s renowned and revered His He She & She EP; and, most recently, Barnt’s gloriously ricocheting His Name. On this night the two label bosses wil take each other on head to head, with support coming from the All City residents.Bar Tengu, SatSCLobster Theramin, LondonBonkers by name but sober by nature, Jimmy Asquith’s label Lobster Theremin is a valuable curio in the UK’s techno underground, where deep cuts pulse with charred luxuriance. This showcase features 14 of its acts, from the milky rave of Hedge Maze to the superb ambient techno tracks of Imre Kiss, and the high-tempo, low-empathy output of Snow Bone. Celebrating his 30th birthday, Asquith plays a set, too, while topping the bill is the label’s best-known name, Palms Trax, who taps into the most humid moments of Chicago house.Corsica Studios, SE17, SatBB
