On a rare sunny morning, river mist wafts up the north side of Hingston Down. Above that shadowy hillside the old chimney of Greenhill arsenic works and the mine stack on Kit Hill are silhouettes against the blue sky, and sunlight catches in smoke from the road-stone quarry near Chilsworthy.Here, on the Devon side of the Tamar, opposite Latchley, lanes and bounded tracks thread past stubble, turnip crops for sheep, hilltop copses, strips of steep woodland, undulating pastures with belts of maize and kale that shelter pheasants, and isolated farmsteads with converted barns.On the narrow unmetalled paths rain has flushed out leaf mould and mud to reveal the sparkly white stones of spar rubble spread on to the slate bedrock. This gangue, or lode waste, probably came from the parishâ€™s short-lived mines, such as Wheal Carpenter, Devon Kapunda and Wheal Grace, which raised copper and lead in the mid 19th century when adventurers hoped to replicate the riches of the nearby Devon Great Consols.Country diary: St Dominic, Tamar Valley: The remnants of a rich mining history Now, along these quiet ways, where miners once walked to and from work, leaves of primroses, celandines, honeysuckle and even bluebells, enhance the winter greenery of pennywort and polypody ferns.Bedraggled flowers of campion add touches of pink, and snowdrops spread out from an old orchard at Youngcott. Along narrow byways, sunlit tree tops cast a tracery of shadows and, out in the open, the sun reflects its brilliance on puddles, water-filled tractor ruts and wet asphalt.Little streams rush towards Sydenham Mill and through Buddlemead and Portontown Wood, where holly leaves glisten above the sodden undergrowth. From higher ground, beyond the church, (rebuilt and reduced in size after a lightning strike which caused a fire in 1955) there are clear views towards Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor, where unusually green fields adjoin the stony slopes of Cox Tor and North Hessary Tor.Back by the swollen river Tamar, where the 15th-century Horse Bridge leads towards the Cornish bank, a rainbow arches above the upper reaches and Endsleigh, once a summer residence of the dukes of Bedford.
