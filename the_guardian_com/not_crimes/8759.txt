Late-night hosts continued to discuss Bill O’Reilly’s dramatic exit from Fox News as well as how America celebrated 4/20.Late-night TV hosts on Bill O'Reilly: 'The Sith Lord of cable news' On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert opened with a dance to celebrate O’Reilly’s dismissal and also greeted any of his viewers that might now be watching his show instead. “I’d like to welcome any orphan Bill O’Reilly viewers to our show tonight: welcome,” he said. “I know this is a confusing time for you, you’ve been through a lot. Not as much as women who’ve worked for Bill but still, a whole lot.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest He then joked that O’Reilly’s career had “exploded in a hail of blood and bone” but that he “still has his books, his rage and a Fox News payout of $25m”. Colbert then read out parts of O’Reilly’s 1998 novel which was “dedicated to the women in his life or, as they’re affectionately known, the plaintiffs”.The book focuses on a TV personality who is fired and then takes revenge on those who humiliated him. Colbert joked that his previous alter ego, also called Stephen Colbert, wasn’t played by him and O’Reilly should instead aim his anger at Steve Carell, who was probably behind it.This week saw Sarah Palin, Kid Rock and Ted Nugent visit the White House, and after posing with Trump they took a picture next to a portrait of Hillary Clinton, ridiculing her. “You know something’s weird when Kid Rock is the dignified one in the picture,” Colbert said.On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed marijuana in the US as Thursday was 4/20, a day that’s unofficially devoted to people who use the drug. He discussed how the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, was keen to roll back Obama’s more lenient stance.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest “I would argue that however dangerous weed is, alcohol is 10 times worse and you can buy that at pretty much every single grocery store,” he said. “4/20 is only once a year; Miller time is every day.”He then went on: “I have a theory that President Donald Trump is always high.” Noah explained: “He forgets people’s names, he mixes up Iraq and Syria – and what do high people always do? They forget where they put things, and last week Donald Trump didn’t just lose his keys, he lost the navy.”He also showed the clip of Trump hugging the American flag. “If Donald Trump hugged Melania that passionately, maybe she would live with him,” he said.On The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon also kicked off with more 4/20 chat. “If you see someone who looks red and totally out of it, don’t worry, that’s just the president of the United States,” he said.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest He then went on to ridicule the White House visit by Nugent, Palin and Rock, “or as they’re more commonly known: the redneck holy trinity”.A picture of them with Trump was then flashed and Fallon joked: “They were going to do a silly one then they realized, that was the silly one.” He added: “It’s like an episode of Beverly Hillbillies.”
