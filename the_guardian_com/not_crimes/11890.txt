9.03pm BST21:03I'm leaving with ValIt’s been an hour since I ate anything, so I have to go, like, now. But thank you all for being so much fun to play with down below. I mean that in the most suggestive way possible!I shall be on Inspect A Gadget duties as usual, and please say hi on the tweeter or the Instant Gran. Heidi, who’s been baking herself on the Costa del Crime, will be back next week, funnier than ever. Don’t tell her I broke everything.Take care of each other, and stay informal!RxFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.02pm BST21:02We’ll never see that amalgam of nanny mimsiness and sharp-edged psycho in the tent again. She was one of a kind. We salute you Val! It was, as people have pointed out below, a good innings. Pleased for Candice too. She puts herself through the emotional wringer.

The ribald burlesque with a faint hint of baking domme has finally grabbed star baker! CANDICE for the win!He’s done it! Rav, the cardamom comeback kid, lives to bake on, on bake off. There may be a better way of phrasing that. Val meanwhile, is escorted from the premises. Emotional, love filled speech. We love ya, Val! Thanks for the laughs.Having said that, there will be a rampage in Yorkshire tonight. Please pack a parkin and get underground. Valzilla will be looking for victims. She hits.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.56pm BST20:56Also don’t think we won’t come back to ‘That’s just the sort of surprise I like before a meal,’ Mary. You aged bottle of sauce.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.55pm BST20:55HMMM. What’s even more interesting is the bottom of the table. Who’s gonna be checking out of pastry week in a filo body bag, basted with the butter of bitter regret? Val has done excruciatingly rubbish this round too, whereas Rav’s parcels were beauties. Has he pulled off a creme pat resurrection? Will we roll back the stone to find Rav’s not there? If so, who will be?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.54pm BST20:54Most of you think Jane has got this? Jane has been too bold, but pulled off her flavours with a plum. No a plomb. No, a cherry, and some cured meat. But Candice gets a 10 for presentation, and faultless flavour too. Can she edge ahead? “Star Baker” whispers Jane as Candice walks past. But not in a ... feline way. Just a supportive, GBBO way. I like Jane. Do we like Jane? God it’s tense.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.50pm BST20:50Selasi is helping! Drink! Candice is fiddling with her balls! Drink all the drinks for ever!Man these are some beautiful bouches. Hats off- that filo looks so unwieldy. Judges step in. Benjamina’s done good because she is good. Selasi’s had a quiet week. Andrew has imparted a piquant flavour, like Jupiter Ascending! Okay there was no natural way to slip that film title in, and it’s the only other Eddie film I’ve seen, and I’m not here next week so gimme a break.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.48pm BST20:48Okay, you guys like the historical interludes. Fair enough. I am a philistine. I’m typing this on an abacus made of mud. Off topic, but I really like Mel’s Little My hairstyle. Jane has knocked over those filo cones about a hundred times now. It’s like she’s drunk on an endless fresher’s week. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.47pm BST20:47Rav thinks he’ll have time to spare. That should go fine, then. Val’s rolling pin is a broom handle, so let’s take the GBH/witch jokes as a given and move on. The bakers are attempting to stretch filo until it’s basically transparent. Having tried making my own pasta a few times, I feel sick with anxiety just watching them.Jane decides her pastry is ready when she can read a bottle of alcohol through it, which is a Val technique. Benjamina’s cooking with a ruler, which is trademark Andrew. It’s a hall of mirrors, I tells ya!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.43pm BST20:43Tom’s making chocolate steak, while the thought of the sausagemeat collecting under Candice’s nails makes me feel a bit ick. She tells us “it’s good to get a handful of sausage,” so I suspect the entire recipe is predicated on an opportunity for smut. A girl after my own heart too. When she asked Mary to feel the weight of her enormous black pudding, well. Carry On Candice.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.43pm BST20:43Could be the new ‘informal’Liam Murphy (@liamwaterloo)"Looking for something a little more refined than a gobful," is my new Grindr profile description. #GBBOSeptember 21, 2016FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.40pm BST20:40‘Yorkshire gobfuls’ sounds like Val’s street-fight finishing move.White chocolate samosas? Rav’s going down fighting. Although he is basically cooking with his coat on. Andrew is making baklava with a dough so wet it’s probably distantly in line to the throne. And –OH NO it’s a historical interlude.

Andrew still beats Val with his Africa ... situation. Selasi third, Candice second, and yup, I think we’re looking at a twice starred baker Jane. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.35pm BST20:35Val has in fact made a very bad tart. Think about her family. “It holds its own” cuts Mary, assessing the wattle and daub cladding. “Our first soggy bottom!” crows Paul. I’d stick to main roads tonight, Paul. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.34pm BST20:34This is going to be horrific. Judges step in. Jane, of course, has smashed it. (I think the Bakewell recipe gets handed out with Freedom passes.) Candice and Selasi are okay. Rav has a collapsed goo. I think that sound is his ship, about to set sail. (Sorry Rav! You seem very nice.) Andrew has drawn a map of Africa on his tart, in reverse-relief icing. But the bake is good, which amounts to a miracle.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.34pm BST20:34Val flapping her towel is like some ancient apotropaic dance to ward off evil.
