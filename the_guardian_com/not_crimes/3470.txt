The environment minister, Greg Hunt, has approved controversial dredging off the Queensland coast that will help create one of the world’s largest coalports, while imposing some of the “strictest conditions in Australian history” to safeguard the health of the Great Barrier Reef.Hunt said he would allow the contentious dredging program for three proposed terminals at the Abbot Point port near the town of Bowen. The approval documents show the spoil from the dredging will be dumped within the Great Barrier Reef marine park area.One of the three terminals was proposed by the Indian resource giant Adani, the second by a joint venture between the Indian company GVK and Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Coal, and the third site was to be developed by BHP Billiton. But BHP recently pulled out of its involvement in the project.Hunt has also approved the Arrow LNG facility on nearby Curtis Island, as well as its associated transmission pipeline.The four projects have been opposed by environmental groups for a variety of reasons, including fears of damage to the reef caused by increased shipping and dumping dredged seabed near the world heritage-listed site.Hunt said the projects would meet “highest environmental standards and conditions”, placing 95 conditions on the Abbot Point projects and 53 conditions for the Curtis Island venture.These include a 150% “net benefit requirement” for water quality which, Hunt said, would result in a long-term reduction of sediments entering the reef marine park from land-based sources.The reef will also be aided by an $89m boost to programs such as the Reef Trust, a Coalition plan to improve water quality and tackle threats such as a plague of starfish which has devoured much of the reef’s coral. A total of $32m in “offsets”, to be paid by developers, will be required over 40 years to bolster the health of the reef and protect sea turtles.“Some of the strictest conditions in Australian history have been placed on these projects to ensure that any impacts are avoided, mitigated or offset,” Hunt said.The environment minister said the Coalition had scaled down the previous Labor government’s plans for Abbot Point, with a reduced total of 3m cubic metres of seabed set to be dredged.Hunt added that he would require all spoil from future dredging in central and northern Queensland to be placed at the “shoreline, near to shore or land reclamation disposal”.A study commissioned by the previous Labor government found that dredging spoil dumped at sea travelled further than previously thought, potentially endangering coral and other marine life.This year Unesco’s World Heritage Centre warned that the Great Barrier Reef, which has lost half of its coral cover in the past 30 years, would be placed on its “in-danger” list if there were major new port developments.“The Great Barrier Reef is one of Australia’s great natural wonders and protecting it for the future is vital,” Hunt said. “As well as being a natural marvel, the reef plays a vital role in the north Queensland economy, generating significant business and tourism.”Hunt’s decision, which was twice deferred, is likely to be welcomed by both the Queensland government and mining industry, which have hailed the Abbot Point and Curtis Island LNG projects for their job-creating potential.The expansion of Abbot Point will open the way for the large-scale export of coal from Queensland’s Galilee basin region. Two proposed coalmines in the region could be responsible for an estimated 3.7bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over their lifetimes. “The Abbott government has sacrificed the climate and the Great Barrier Reef for overseas mining companies with its approval today of the world’s largest coalport and another CSG plant in our Great Barrier Reef,” said the Greens senator Larissa Waters.“The prime minister is ignoring the World Heritage Committee’s warnings about the mass industrialisation of the reef, and is inviting a world heritage ‘in danger’ listing.“The coal to be mined from the Galilee basin and exported through Abbot Point each year which will create more CO2 emissions a year than produced by both Denmark and Portugal combined.”Louise Matthiesson, Greenpeace’s Queensland campaigner, was also scathing. “The approvals today are a massive assault on the environment and place the future of the reef in jeopardy,” she said.“Minister Hunt has ignored the evidence and thumbed his nose at the serious concerns of scientists, tourism operators, fishers and Unesco about the impacts of these industrial developments and activities.”On Monday the Coalition passed changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to strip away any repercussions if the government fails to consider expert advice before approving major developments such as mines and ports.The Coalition initially wanted to permanently remove the ability for community groups to legally challenge new developments if the environment minister failed to consult approved advice.But Monday’s bill passed with a Labor-agreed amendment which stipulates the Coalition’s change should only apply to environmental approvals made up to 31 December this year.The Greens say this deal prevents any legal recourse against previous Labor decisions, as well as approvals to be considered by Hunt, such as the Abbot Point decision.“There is obviously mutual convenience here for Labor and the Coalition to paper over any administration errors,” Waters told Guardian Australia.“Expert advice is relevant no matter what the time of year, so this rings warning bells for me.”A spokesman for Hunt said the amended act would “clean up Labor’s mess”.“There are up to 30 decisions that have already been made under the EPBC Act that could be challenged on this ground and one has already been overturned by the court,” he said.“It is important to get these amendments through to give industry certainty over projects that are due to commence. This supports many local jobs in building and development.“This latest amendment will only make the provision retrospective so it won’t apply to future decisions. This is because the Coalition government will do the job properly when making robust EPBC decisions.”A spokeswoman for Mark Butler, the shadow environment minister, said: “Labor is satisfied the government has sufficiently revised its amendments to the EPBC Act to maintain environmental protections.“The 31 December sunset clause put forward by the government provides investment and jobs certainty for projects that are already under development or operational while not weakening protections into the future.”While Labor struck an agreement with the Coalition over the issue of expert advice, and agreed to tougher penalties for the illegal hunting of dugongs, it sided with the Greens to oppose the government’s bid to devolve environmental approval powers to the states.The Coalition argues environmental approvals need to be streamlined into a “one-stop shop”, while opponents claim the states cannot be trusted to safeguard the environment without federal oversight.A Productivity Commission report, released on Tuesday, backed some of the Coalition’s concerns on environmental laws, identifying “long approval timeframes, duplicative processes [and] regulatory uncertainty.”The bill will be debated in the Senate next year.
