My grooming routine doesn’t change: shower, shave, teeth and hair. My hair has been twisted for twentysomething years. In the morning, I retwist locks that are loose; they never completely untwist. The hair “locks” and becomes thick cords. I wash it once every 10 days, because it takes two or three hours to drip-dry (the best way to dry locks). My default headgear is a Kangol Bamboo beret that I colour-coordinate with my outfit.I love clothes. Every time I get dressed, even to walk around the house, I feel like I’m playing dress-up. I adore Tom Ford, I love Marc Jacobs and I almost exclusively wear Karl Lagerfeld shirts. The style of shirt he makes, with very high collars, became popular when I was a teenager: we called them “high boys”. I will wear it with a skinny tie and couldn’t care less about lapel size.I always wear my prescription sunglasses. I used to have a television show and John Lee Hooker was one of my guests. I hosted my show without my glasses and, at the end, John pulled me aside and said, “Hey, bud, never, ever get photographed without sunglasses.”How I get ready: Pearl Lowe I don’t dress age-appropriately – I am 63 and the stuff that catches my eye is what caught my eye when I was 16. At this moment, I am wearing a pair of white Toms. I am very into his philosophy: for every pair of shoes he sells, he gives a pair away to an underprivileged child. I have a closet devoted to them, like Imelda Marcos.• Nile Rodgers curates Fold Festival at Fulham Palace, London SW6, on 24-26 June; go to foldfestival.com/london-2016 for ticket details.
