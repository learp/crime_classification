Two days after her fellow male late-night TV cohorts eviscerated Donald Trump’s much criticized performance during Monday night’s presidential debate, Samantha Bee finally weighed in on Wednesday with a pointed takedown of the Republican nominee’s perceived sexism on her TBS program Full Frontal.After opening her segment devoted to the debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton by describing the clash as “American democracy playing Russian roulette”, Bee swiftly laid into Trump for his consistent interruptions of Clinton. Over the course of more than 90 minutes Trump interrupted Clinton 51 times, while she only interjected 17 times.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest “Shush, the lady has the talking stick,” scolded Bee. “Don’t insult her until you’re asked to insult her!” In a now notorious exchange, Trump claimed that Clinton doesn’t have “the stamina to be president of this country”. Bee said: “Just say penis, Don. Three-syllable words don’t suit you.”Bee also tackled Trump’s comment that it’s “hell” to live in some cities in America, while arguing that crime rates in black neighborhoods are so high that “you walk down the street, you get shot”.Late-night roasts Trump after debate: 'His head doesn't have room for facts' “What the fuck would you know about walking down the street?” inquired Bee, showing a photo of a white limousine. “Second, if you think a tired old racist dog whistle is how you heal the divide, you’ve got a lot to learn about listening to people of color.”To show “how it’s done,” Bee cut to a clip of Mary J Blige serenading Clinton during an upcoming episode from the singer’s Beats 1 radio show The 411, which airs Friday. “If every white person would allow one black person to make them that uncomfortable it wouldn’t do anything for the racial divide, but it would be so entertaining,” added Bee.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Like Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers, Bee was harshest on Trump when addressing his apparent lack of preparation.“Trump warned us that Hermione Clinton would be cheating by doing something called preparing – like some kind of busy PTA mom over-planner,” said Bee. “But Trump never considered the possibility that she might be a kind of Count of Monte Cristo over-planner. She spent months building an elaborate trap for Trump and he lumbered right into it. All she had to do was step out of his way when he called a woman fat.“Those wily Clinton bastards knew there are three things Trump can’t resist,” she added. “Calling women names, doubling down and making dumb mistakes on Fox and Friends.”It was on Fox and Friends on the Tuesday morning after the debate, that Trump didn’t back down from once calling Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado “Miss Piggy,” by saying “she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem”.“No, you had a stunningly beautiful Miss Universe winner and you treated her like garbage,” Bee responded to Trump. “Now you have a real problem – not only with her but with every woman who’s ever been called fat. Which is all of us!”On Wednesday’s Daily Show, host Trevor Noah also went off on Trump’s mistreatment of women by branding him the Master of Sexism.“Let’s be honest here, folks,” said Noah. “There’s only one pig in this whole story, and it’s the one that got slaughtered at the debate on Monday.”
