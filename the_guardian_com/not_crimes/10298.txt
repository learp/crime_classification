One thing I miss from my time living in London is the ability to celebrate life’s triumphs (or commiserate its occasional troughs) by having delicious food delivered to your door. Hassle-free calories are one of life’s supreme luxuries.I remember with crystal clarity one evening eating sushi. My wife wasn’t drinking, so I was casting around for something that didn’t require opening a bottle of wine. I had some posh whiskey stashed in a cupboard from Christmas and I thought - why not? It was a legendary pairing that left an explosion of flavour and fullness in my mouth; a sort of ecstatic brimming over.I know now this pairing is one way of achieving what the Japanese call umami; the fabled fifth taste that compliments sweet, sour, bitter and salty. Umami is linked to the other four tastes in the sense that it somehow mysteriously completes them - and yet it stands alone in the sense that it can be absent. I have discovered that so many of my highest points in the garden have a sort of visual umami to them. These are the moments when the eye experiences an ecstatic brimming over and the heart soars. This happens when the picture is made mysteriously so much more than the sum of its constituent parts. For me, this is a large part of what gardening is about.These moments don’t come about in high concentration as regularly as one may like; though as I make progress with my new garden, they are beginning to come with more frequency. For three years I have wanted to plant an avenue of trees down the garden’s central axis. We jokingly call this area main avenue; a grand name for what has until recently been merely a strip of mown grass. Time, expense and other more important jobs stayed my hand. But this autumn I finally got round to it. I planted the small cherry tree Prunus incisa ‘The Bride’. As I planted the last tree and stood up to look back along our now properly constituted avenue, I experienced an overwhelming sense of visual umami. The trees have added so much more than even I expected. It is powerful stuff, this visual umami, (at least to me it is) and I rushed off to do the school run grinning. I was still smiling inanely as I went to bed that night.I remember the sensation of visual umami in much the same way as I remember its culinary counterpart. I can hold in my mind’s eye exactly how I felt after I had seen the cherry trees in place; just as I can recall the first time I accidentally mixed whiskey and sushi. Capability Brown famously described how a turn in a river might act as a comma, or a thicket of trees a full stop. Was this his grammar for attempting to achieve the same thing? Certainly his landscapes can deliver an overwhelming concentration of optical flavour and fullness. There is something of this same visual taste in merely beholding a freshly edged flowerbed or a combination of plants that I have (usually accidentally) successfully matched. In any case, the quest to create visual umami, and of the highest possible intensity, is one of the things that keeps me heading out to the garden.Charlie Hart is a gardener and garden writer.
