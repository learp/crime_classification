This book is about a boy who is missing and presumed dead. However his best friend, Meg and his brother Stevie believe he is still alive and are determined to find him no matter what it takes. Along the way they learn about friendship and the power of never giving up hope.The plot is very different, almost magical and filled with ups and downs. It made me think deeper about what could happen next and what I think of the characters as people. My favourite character was Stevie because even though nobody believes Oscar is alive, he did and isn’t going to give up.I was engaged throughout the whole book, especially because it was very unusual but that’s what I liked about it the most.It’s not filled with action and high drama but it is filled with loyalty and standing up for what you believe in. This book will leave you with a smile on your face.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
