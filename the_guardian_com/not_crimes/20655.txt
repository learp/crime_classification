A film about Simon Weston, the former soldier-turned-campaigner who was badly injured during the 1982 Falklands war, is to go into production.According to Screen, Railway Man director Jonathan Teplitzky has been hired for the film which will draw on material contained in Weston’s three autobiographies. The script will be written by historian and former Guardian columnist Alex von Tunzelmann.Simon Weston: My family values Born in Caerphilly, Weston was serving in the Welsh Guards when he suffered severe burns after the landing craft Sir Galahad was bombed at Bluff Cove in June 1982. Forty-eight soldiers and crew aboard the Galahad were killed; Weston survived, but subsequently needed more than 70 operations. After a period of severe depression, Weston turned to charity work (for which he was awarded an OBE in 1992 and a CBE in 2016), as well as campaigning on military issues. In 2008 he agreed to join the opposition Conservative party’s military covenant commission, which reported on the relationship between government and the armed forces.No details of casting has yet been announced, but a biopic has been in the works at least since 2003. Recent UK military history has not proved a popular subject for British film-makers, with Kajaki – an account of a 2006 incident during the Afghanistan war – being one of the few exceptions.
