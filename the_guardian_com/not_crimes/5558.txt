There are a lot of strange things in Alex Noble’s live-work studio. The weirdest is probably what he calls “the green fist” – an oversized green Hulk hand that sits on a shelf above his computer. Noble reaches over and puts it on: “We thought we’d do this” – he punches the air – “every time something good and ethical happens in the studio.”Noble is an artist, stylist and fashion designer with an aversion to creating more clothes. “I am constantly overwhelmed by the amount of clothes that exist,” he says. Three years ago, he went from creating one-off, avant-garde designs for style icons such as Lady Gaga and Florence Welch to launching Everything Must Go (EMG) – an ethical creative design initiative that uses waste material produced by the fashion industry as a way to challenge “destructive consumption”.

They are destined for The Hackney Shop, a council-run retail space in the borough’s newly coined “fashion district.” Giles Deacon was the first to respond to Noble’s call-out for waste material; others were quick to follow. Each unique EMG T-shirt will incorporate offcuts from up to six fashion houses. They retail for £125, with 40% going towards a day centre for children of garment workers in Bangladesh.“We don’t exist to be a fashion brand,” says Noble. “We exist to use our practice for positive impact. That’s the mission. We use creativity as a force for good. Only we’ve been stuck making T-shirts for three years…” Confronted by the transience and obsolescence of the industry, and a general surfeit of stuff, Noble admits, “The whole industry is really complicated. It’s such a massive subject that incorporates everything from serious human-rights exploitation to creative exploitation. It’s difficult to navigate.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Work-life balance: a sewing machine but also, lots of loudspeakers at Noble’s home.

His personal possessions could probably be reduced to a boot-load – if you exclude his collection of mannequins. “I’ve always had a big obsession with mannequins,” says Noble. After graduating from the London College of Fashion Noble found a temporary job on the shop floor of Selfridges at Christmas. He stayed for two years, masterminding the window displays, and hoarding neglected mannequins. “At one point I had 30 in here,” he confesses. “I had to do a cull.”In the kitchen are vegan cookbooks, house plants, a jar of wholewheat pasta, a bottle of JD and “a female version of sliced bread in wooden form”. At least that’s how Noble describes the curvilinear mannequin that stands at one end of his kitchen table. “I love her organic curves, but she’s really hard to dust.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Cool for cats: Noble’s bedroom, including a banner made for a festival. Photograph: Anna Batchelor; styling Tamineh DhondyHis bedroom has little in the way of furniture – Noble gave most of it away when he moved into the building five years ago. He has kept what matters: a wall-mounted Chinese chequer board and a one-armed bandit slot machine, both salvaged from his childhood home; a glossy bag for Fiorucci Safety Jeans that his mum bought when she was a teenager.What Noble hasn’t reappropriated from his childhood home or the basement of Selfridges, he has created. Murals and drawings cover the walls of his studio: above the bed is a totemic pink cat made for a festival; above the desk are line drawings of Björk. “They are for work,” says Noble, who is storyboarding concepts for her immersive virtual-reality exhibition at Somerset House, London, next month. “But I draw every night for my own personal practice, too,” he says. “You have to commit to your work personally, not just commercially.”No one could suggest that he does otherwise.
