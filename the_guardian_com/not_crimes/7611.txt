After Amelia and Oliver have yet again topped the list of most popular baby names in England and Wales, we look at how other names are faring.While Mia and Ella were gaining fans, there were fewer new Lilys and Sophies. So who is on the way up and which names are on the way out? girls tableNoah, a name that has seen its popularity rise over the past 20 years, was in the top 10 boys’ names. There were 4,148 boys in England and Wales who were given that name in 2015 – compared to 137 in 1996. Table boysWe have also checked the list against some well known people to see whose name is in and whose is out of fashion.The cabinet      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Theresa May speaks as she chairs a cabinet meeting. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AFP/Getty ImagesThink the cabinet consists of old fuddy-duddies whose names are fast going out of favour? Well, for the most part, you’re right. In each of the past 20 years, fewer than 0.02% of baby girls were named Theresa. In 2014, there were just 14 new Theresas, in 2015, it was 15. Boris, on the other hand, has seen his popularity grow, albeit from a very low base. While five boys were named Boris in 1996, there were 43 in 2014 and 32 this year. James Brokenshire has the most popular first name of the current cabinet: there were almost 4,200 babies newly named James in 2014 and 3,912 last year. But even James has decreased in popularity. In 1997, it was the second most popular name in England and Wales. Now, it is in 11th place.

However, if there were fewer than three babies given a particular name in a year, the ONS did not release data so perhaps there are more we don’t know about.The royals      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Queen Elizabeth II with members of the royal family on her official birthday in June 2016.

Having made the top 10 every year between 1996 and 2005, it had fallen to 23rd place in 2014. Last year, it fell back to 25th place, with 1,951 newborn girls named Charlotte. Her big brother George, on the other hand, saw his name jump in popularity from seventh place in 2014 to fourth last year. Both of the newest additions to the royal family lag behind the popularity of their cool uncle Harry, however. The name has been among the top 10 boys’ names for the past decade, was the most popular boys’ name in 2011 and 2012, and came in third in the 2015 rankings thanks to 5,308 new Harrys.

In 1996, it was ranked in 382nd place, with just 87 girls given that name in England and Wales. But its popularity has skyrocketed ever since. In 2014 more than 4,000 newborns were called Isla, putting it third. Last year, it fell to fourth with 3,474 newborn girls given this name.Friends      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A promotional shot for Friends, Season 3, which aired in 1996. Photograph: Allstar/Warner BrosIt is now 22 years since we were first introduced to the cast of Friends. But two decades (and an impossibly high number of repeats later) it appears the love affair has ended. Well, as far as the names of most of the main characters go at least. In 1996, more than 2,100 newborns were named Rachel while more than 1,000 boys were given the name Ross. Fast forward to 2015 those figures had fallen to 179 Rachels and 71 Ross’s. Chandler and Monica never enjoyed the same popularity: indeed, the number of Chandlers is so low as to appear not to have made our chart (we swear we did put the name in): just four boys were called Chandler in 2014, and it did not feature at all last year.The chart shows the change in popularity in the names of the various Friends characters between 1996 and presentThe chart shows the change in popularity in the names of the various Friends characters between 1996 and presentJoey has crept up in popularity in recent years, but it is Phoebe who has made the biggest comeback among the Friends characters’ names.
