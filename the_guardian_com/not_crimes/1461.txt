Solo albums. The very concept seems like a relic from rock’s bloated heyday, invariably bringing to mind the classic story about the four members of Kiss all releasing dodgy solo efforts on the same day, thus bringing their record company to its knees.Pretty things: Arcade Fire and fans throw Bowie a New Orleans send-off Not saying that Arcade Fire are the Kiss of our times, but next month drummer Jeremy Gara will become the fourth member of the Canadian troupe to release a solo album in the last two years, following violinist Sarah Neufeld, guitarist-keyboardist Will Butler and utility man Richard Reed Parry (bassist Tim Kingsbury also has a solo album in the works). Gara’s ambient electronica doesn’t sound much like Rebellion (Lies), but his PR team couldn’t resist billing him as “Arcade Fire’s Jeremy Gara”, suggesting that his “collection of organised improvisations” might have been a harder sell if he wasn’t a member of a famous band.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Ultimately, Gara falls foul of one the two biggest solo album cliches. Usually they are experimental odysseys that would never be sanctioned by their regular bands (democracy works, folks); or they are stripped-down confessionals, because the world really needs to hear about the personal travails of the guitarist from Paramore. Both are a kind of hubris, and both are almost always rubbish.Side projects can serve a useful purpose for the music business, maintaining visibility for the umbrella brand while the main songwriters take a breather. Often they are hobby projects, requiring little A&R investment: LNZNDRF, a new album of passable krautrock by sundry members of the National and Beirut, was recorded in just two-and-a-half days. And they keep the artists fulfilled. So what’s the harm?   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Solo albums aren’t merely isolated salvoes of disappointment; they are also a sign of the rot setting in. Just as Lennon and McCartney’s patchy solo careers signalled the end of the 60s dream, and the spate of tedious Ashcroft/Butler/Coxon solo albums in the late 90s drummed the final nails into Britpop’s coffin, this current rash of Arcade Fire/Vampire Weekend/National solo records is sounding the death knell for 00s Pitchforky indie as a cultural force. The zeitgeist is rarely defined by musicians, four albums in, who fancy a change of scenery.El Vy: Return to the Moon review – Matt Berninger’s low-key side project There have already been repercussions: just weeks after unveiling his debut solo single, Vampire Weekend keyboard-prodder Rostam Batmanglij announced he was quitting the band because his “identity as songwriter and producer needs to stand on its own”. Sure, it must be a bummer when the good-looking guy at the front gets all the credit. But when a band subdivides, the maths rarely add up: Batmanglij’s single basically just sounds like Vampire Weekend with some vital bits missing. Noel Gallagher plus Beady Eye does not equal Oasis. Thinking of going solo? Just say no.
