Terry Wogan may have gone on to become one of the most recognised voices on British radio, but his career could have got off to a very different start if another BBC legend hadn’t been put off by the young broadcaster’s Irish accent.Letters from the BBC archive dug up by the Radio Times reveal that Sir David Attenborough turned down a request from Wogan for a job on BBC2 in 1965 because the channel, which had only been running for a year, already had a presenter who was “also from Dublin”.Wogan, who died last month, wrote to Attenborough saying that although he would be “familiar with neither my name nor my work” he hoped the then controller of BBC2 would be “receptive enough of new ideas and personalities” to give him a job.Sir Terry Wogan obituary In typically direct style, he also said it was “simply ambition” that made him pitch for the job out of the blue. Wogan was then working at Irish broadcaster RTE as a senior radio announcer and presenter of shows such as long-running quiz Jackpot, and had already written to BBC2 with a similar request a year earlier.However, Attenborough’s reply said that the channel had “no vacancies for anyone with your particular talents and experience” according to letters published by the Radio Times this week.Attenborough, who is now a renowned broadcaster and naturalist, added: “As one of our chief announcers on BBC2 is also from Dublin … We would feel, other things being equal, that we should look for someone from a different part of the country [sic] if we were to make an additional appointment.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Terry Wogan’s letter to the BBC.

Tuohy was just a year older than Wogan, but had already been the first face to officially appear on the new BBC 2 in 1964 and would later go on to work for Panorama and ITN.Like Wogan, Attenborough had initially been turned down when applying for a radio producer role at the BBC in 1950, but had instead been offered a job in television. Wogan followed the reverse path after his rejection by BBC2, getting his first position with the corporation on a Radio 1 show called Midday Spin in 1966.A 1968 memo from BBC TV light entertainment producer Johnnie Stewart, published alongside the correspondence, describes Wogan as a “likeable personality” with an “unmistakable, though not aggressive, Irish accent” who at 29 was “still young enough to fit into most scenes other than pop”.In a highly prescient assessment of Wogan’s career prospects, Stewart added: “I think he would make a great all-rounder.”Wogan went on to become one of the BBC’s biggest stars, hosting Blankety Blank for four years from 1979 where he attracted audiences of more than 20 million and also presenting the weekday breakfast programme on Radio 2, which reached 8 million listeners.Though he initially aimed for TV, one of the many memorable sayings attributed to Wogan’s is less than complimentary about the medium: “Television contracts the imagination and radio expands it.”However, he eventually got his chance at TV and in 1982 began presenting an eponymous chat show that ran for a decade as well as becoming the face of the Eurovision Song Contest from the early 1970s before handing over to fellow Irishman Graham Norton in 2008.Attenborough told the Radio Times he did not remember Wogan’s letter and the late star had never mentioned it to him, but said the decision 50 years ago was the right one.He said: “I think it was a perfectly reasonable answer. To have had two Irishmen presenting on BBC2 would have looked ridiculous. This is no comment whatsoever on Terry Wogan’s talents. It’s just that I couldn’t have had two Irish presenters.”Wogan died on 31 January from cancer at the age of 77 and a private funeral is to take place this week.
