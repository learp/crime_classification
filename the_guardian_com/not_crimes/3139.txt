My kitchen is … spacious and new. We went for a induction hob, which is handy to clean and safe with kids. It’s minimalist, all stainless steel. There’s a blackboard listing the kids’ schedule and everything we need to get done in the week. Lots of surfaces and lots of storage, with a dining table too.My favourite kitchen tool is … a 1950s flywheel Avery Berkel meat slicer in Ferrari red and a collection of six knives I couldn’t live without, made by a friend of mine in Norfolk.My storecupboard staple is … spices, chillies and, most of all, pickles. With charcuterie and cheese and bread, you need that crisp acidity. We make them all the time – pickling vinegar and spices, and other aromatics. The antidote to heavy food is pickle.When I’m starving I … have either homemade pizza (anchovy, black olives, chilli) or pasta with fresh sausage meat, garlic, chilli, capers, fresh basil and a squeeze of lemon.My culinary inspiration is … Nigel Slater and his Kitchen Diaries and Yotam Ottolenghi. Always surprising and impressive results.My best-kept kitchen secret is … preserving. I grew up in a self-sustaining community that tried to live off the grid. If we needed stuff for dinner, we’d go out and dig it up. Part of making that life possible is learning to preserve. Whether it’s killing an animal and having lots of fresh meat, or early summer and everything is ripe, knowing what to do with a glut is key. It has to be really achievable and really simple.When I’m invited to dinner I always take … charcuterie. Many of my friends are people in my industry: people don’t need a bottle of wine, because that’s part of the experience they’ve planned for you. But good sausage is something a bit different: hard to get hold of. It usually pleases people. Sliced charcuterie is so good with an aperitif.Everything tastes better with … Encona West Indian hot pepper sauce – it’s really fruity and it goes with a lot of things that we eat at home. We often have simple rice or couscous with veg. Working with such intense charcuterie flavours all the time, I really want fresh simple flavours when I get home.When I go shopping I … like to just see what looks amazing. I never think too many meals ahead. Not a planner. And I love food shopping in London. It’s one of the last places where you can still have a varied high-street food shopping experience. I miss it so much when I go back to Norfolk: because of the rise of supermarkets and the global food industry, independent food shops can only exist in urban areas. I don’t mean posh hipster delis, but genuine grocers with produce from everywhere. We live in Streatham, which has eight or nine exceptionally good grocers: Indian, Pakistani, Polish; open 24 hours a day, excellent quality and cheap. Supporting them is important to us.For dinner tonight … I’m making cod with anchovy and tomato sauce, and thyme croutons. I might add in a little chorizo too. With good homemade bread. Lauren, my fiancée, makes beautiful bread.Sean Cannon is co-owner of charcuterie Cannon and Cannon in Borough Market, London.
