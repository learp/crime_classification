The actor starred as the dance instructor in the summer camp TV show from 1980-86. He later had a guest role as Oliver Barnes in the Doctor Who Christmas special in 2009. Born in Nottingham, Howard began his career in the theatre and later appeared regularly in pantomime. The CBeebies presenter Chris Jarvis, who appeared in a show with him, paid tribute on Twitter, saying: “So sad to hear Barry Howard has died. A real gent and incredibly funny off stage too. Happy days in Bournemouth with him and Su Pollard.” He added: “His scenes in Hi-de-Hi were such high quality, full of pathos as well as hilarious - RIP Barry Howard.”
