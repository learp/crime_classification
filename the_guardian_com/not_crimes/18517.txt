Eragon is simply amazing. There are some books that you can’t put into words because of their greatness; Eragon is one of those books.The book is about a boy named Eragon who lives in his nice, cosy cottage in a beautiful town… But suddenly all that changes. Instantly, Eragon finds himself on the back of a dragon flying over the ocean! Eragon has been set a quest, but it is proving quite difficult to finish because of the enemies that he has gathered over time.Once I started reading this book I could not stop. The words flow smoothly and the description is absolutely extraordinary. I doubt that any other writer would have been able to match the excellence of the words used in this novel.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I love the way that most of the story is travelling over land and through different terrains, a bit like the hobbit except that Eragon has more magic, more fantasy, and a very different story. The writer has setup an exciting world inside the story, with one of the best villains in the history of novels. The work and effort put into the characters is amazing and the writer makes them seem so real.I recommend this book for ages 10 and up because some parts have quite a lot of political complications, and some of the book’s themes may be confusing for young ones. How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? But if you like a good book with adventure, fantasy, magic, dragons and cool characters, then this is the book for you.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
