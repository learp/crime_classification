Susan Cain’s good advice, that introversion is something to treasure rather than “conquer”, unfortunately runs counter not only to our increasingly extrovert culture, but also to current educational thinking (The shy student who has quietly changed the world, 4 June). This year the Sutton Trust report, A Winning Personality, found that extroverts are better paid. Rather than address any issue of discrimination, or challenge the equation of social skills with being assertive, enthusiastic and talkative, the report has instead triggered various calls to train young people into conquering introversion and developing extrovert traits. Cain is correct about cultural bias. And like all prejudice we should tackle it, not slavishly follow a culture that rewards performance as show rather than substance.Peter McKennaLiverpool• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
