Hollywood A-lister and environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio has bought the big-screen rights to a green-themed young adult novel called The Sandcastle Empire, according to the Hollywood Reporter.Controversial 'lost' Leonardo DiCaprio film Don's Plum removed from web Kayla Olsonâ€™s as yet unpublished novel describes a post-apocalyptic 2049, in which climate change, coastal flooding and overpopulation have brought human civilisation to its knees. As mankind struggles for survival, a radical cabal known as the Wolfpack overthrows the authorities and takes power. Set against the autocratic rulers is a young girl named Eden, who escapes from a Wolfpack labour camp and sets out on a journey of discovery which could furnish her with the tools to bring down the oppressors â€“ as well as information about what happened to her missing father. At least one of these plot lines explicitly recalls the hit Hunger Games saga, which has taken close to $3bn at the global box office and helped make a huge star of the actor Jennifer Lawrence.DiCaprio, the bookmakerâ€™s favourite to win the best actor Oscar next month for his performance as a 19th-century trapper in Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rrituâ€™s harrowing western The Revenant, picked up the rights through his production company Appian Way, and will produce with his business partner Jennifer Davisson Killoran.Leonardo DiCaprio: 'I would love to play Vladimir Putin' Appian Way is a serial purchaser of rights to promising Hollywood projects, not all of which see the light of day. But DiCaprioâ€™s passion for green themes suggests The Sandcastle Empire might be a priority. There is no indication about whether the actor will take a role in front of the cameras, but with his current sky-high status in Hollywood, there would be no faster way of securing studio funding for the project, at a time when young adult dystopian fare has begun to struggle at the box office. The ChloÃ« Grace Moretz-led sci-fi film The Fifth Wave is the latest such offering to fail to live up to expectations, having taken just $20m in two weeks of release at the US box office â€“ though it is doing better outside North America.The Sandcastle Empire would by no means be DiCaprioâ€™s first foray into environmental-themed film-making. In March, the actor, who has addressed the UN Climate Change summit and donated millions of dollars to help protect endangered species through the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, signed a multi-year agreement to make nature documentaries for Netflix.The publication status of Olsonâ€™s novel remains unclear. It is not available on Amazon and the authorâ€™s website does not list any published works.Kayla Olson (@olsonkayla)Oh my goodnessâ€”I so appreciate you all being so excited with me!
