Drought this Spring brought the longed-for excuse to stop cutting the grass. The simple backyard has developed to a high point of beauty. After insects and wild plants have undergone their summer completions we will post again, talking over the experience of different techniques, as the rain has brought a huge spurt of growth in some corners.  Never sown with a commercial mix, our own "lawns" grow miniature varieties of grass. Now we've stopped mowing everyone finds they can't resist touching them as they go past. The flowers are flat and pliant, like tiny vertebrae.A delicate-looking but surprisingly resilient cocoon shelters insect life until the weather improves and it's matured.Fantastic metre-square decorations provided by bee friendly colonies of things like wild geraniums..... and Prunella.....carpeting the old allotment with dabs of cheerful cobalt.It's like the Garden of Eden.Even the workshop roof is gilded fit for a temple.
