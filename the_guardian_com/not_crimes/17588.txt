A followup to Mad Max: Fury Road, George Miller’s surprise commercial and critical hit, is in the works, according to unconfirmed reports.According to the Australian Herald Sun, the untitled prequel “will be filmed in and around Broken Hill”, an area in New South Wales, and that shooting “could start as soon as later this year”. The script is said to focus on the backstory of Furiosa, played by Oscar-winner Charlize Theron.The enormous success of 2015’s Fury Road has meant there is a keen appetite for another movie. At February’s Oscars, the film walked away with six awards (the best result of the night) and took $378m (£289m) worldwide.Charlize Theron on Mad Max: ‘We live in a very toxic world’ In January, Miller spoke of his eagerness to explore Theron’s character further, but said he was keen to tackle a smaller-scale project before returning to the vast canvas of Mad Max.Theron has spoken of the challenges of the extended shoot in Africa. If the reports are correct and the film’s events will unfold before she teams up with the titular character, then she will not have to work with Tom Hardy, with whom she apparently did not get along.
