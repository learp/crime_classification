The remaining "fab four" British oil beetles are in decline across many parts of the UK, particularly in the east, wildlife charity Buglife said on Wednesday.The organisation ran the first nationwide hunt for the four remaining species of oil beetles in the UK last year, with hundreds of people contributing almost 1,500 new records of the invertebrates.Buglife said the results showed beetle populations in decline across many parts of the UK. The black oil beetle and violet oil beetle have almost disappeared from East Anglia and south-east England.The black oil beetle also appears to have declined in the north-east, according to the new records, which were added to historic sightings to map the distribution of the beetles before and after the year 2000.The number of oil beetle species found in the UK has halved in the past 100 years, and the remaining four – the black oil, violet oil, rugged oil and short-necked oil beetles – are under threat.The species, which are often found around coasts and particularly in south-west England, have been hit by the loss of flower-rich habitats and reductions in wild bees, which they use as unwitting hosts for their young.The survey by Buglife, in partnership with the National Trust, Natural England and Oxford University Museum of Natural History found the south west remained a stronghold for the beetles.The data also revealed hotspots for the rugged oil beetle in Gloucestershire and on the nearby English-Welsh border.Anne Halpin, Buglife's oil beetle conservation officer, said: "The data we receive is vital for helping us target our efforts to conserve these species."We are now writing habitat management guidance for landowners to help improve conditions for oil beetles."She added: "Our national oil beetle hunt will continue this spring. We hope to receive more records in 2012 that will help us find more oil beetle sites and conserve these brilliant beetles."The oil beetles are normally found between late March and June and can be spotted on wildflower-rich grasslands, heathlands, moors and coastal areas, such as cliff tops. They are easy to spot on bare ground at the edge of footpaths.
