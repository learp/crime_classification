Antonio Carluccio claims there is no such dish as spaghetti bolognese in Italy (Shortcuts, G2, 12 October). Yet I have eaten it in Bologna.

He might have added a fourth: the garden bridge in London for which there is no need or demand.Joan BakewellLabour, House of Lords• Tim Lott (Opinion, 7 October) is mistaken in supposing that small talk at dinner parties is a matter of politeness. The point, of course, is not to bore. “Ukip voters and Stockport welders” are by no means alone in thinking that too many “broadsheet-reading, Newsnight-viewing would-be sophisticates” are indeed – as he puts it – “all up themselves”.David HullDevizes, Wiltshire• Finally!
