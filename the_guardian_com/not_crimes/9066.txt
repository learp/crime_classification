9.58pm GMT21:58Osborne accused of over flood defencesThe Chancellor, George Osborne, has been accused of jeopardising Britain’s crumbling flood defences over the past five years by prioritising cuts to the deficit, and has also been warned that infrastructure spending may need to rise sharply to adapt to climate change.You can read a full report here on the warnings leading academics. Here’s a snippet: Professor Simon Wren-Lewis, of Oxford University, who has analysed data on recent flood spending, said there was little sign that the government had changed course to take into account the growing threat of extreme weather.“What you would really expect is to see spending at a much higher level,” he said. “It doesn’t seem like the same kind of reaction which we know has happened to the threat of terrorism, where we know spending levels have increased by a large magnitude.”David Cameron has promised to invest £400m a year on shoring up flood defences over the next six years; but official data shows spending was cut sharply at the start of the last parliament, from £360m in 2010-11, to less than £270m in 2012-13.The blog is being wrapped up nowUpdatedat 9.59pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.56pm GMT21:56Phyllis Young was one of those on board the Stagecoach bus when it got into difficulty in Dailly, South Ayrshire (See earlier post)Speaking after the rescue, she told BBC Scotland:  The water came in the bus, it came up and up and got to the windows and was just like big waves. You could see the current - it was very, very scary.We moved up to the back of the bus because the seats were higher. I actually sat on the ledge at the back. Some people were standing on the seat grab bars. My feet and legs were in the water the whole time.The whole of the front lower section of the bus was completely covered with water.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the road was open to traffic at the time the bus was making the journey from Girvan to Ayr.
