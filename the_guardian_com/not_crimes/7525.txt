“I warn you, it’s a bit of museum,” says artist Rachel Ducker, leading the way down the narrow corridor of her Oxford flat, past teetering bookcases. It is hard to know where to look first. On walls and tabletops, birdcages jostle with antlers, Gothic mirrors vie with peacock feathers and every surface teems with offbeat objects, adding to the impression that you have stepped into a cabinet of curiosities. “I love finding stuff that other people overlook, in junk shops, markets and even skips,” says Ducker. I love finding stuff other people overlook, in junk shops, markets and even skips It is this enthusiasm for found materials which led to the creation of her sculptures: dynamic, enigmatic figures made from coiled wire. “I was working at a florist’s when I started playing around with the wire. I made a sculpture and we put it in the window. It sold and since then I’ve never stopped working,” says Ducker, who originally studied jewellery at Derby University. Twenty years on, her work is shown in galleries all over the UK, she’s made life-sized figures and public artworks, commissions for Rolls-Royce and counts fellow Oxford dweller Mark Haddon, author of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, among her collectors: “My sculpture sits between his Baftas.”Ducker works from home in the two-bedroom flat where she has lived with her son, Lucien, for 17 years. Her landlord is St John’s College and the 1930s block is ranged, collegiate-style, round a communal garden. “When we arrived, it was a white shell. Since then I’ve painted it different colours: vibrant, moody, white,” she continues. “It’s like an art project, continually evolving,” she says as we step into the once-drab kitchen, where walls glow with teal gloss, an “ugly” water tank is swathed in fabric and shelves are made from salvaged palettes painted white to house her collection of mismatched china.

A theatre chair came from the Everyman theatre in Cheltenham. A 19th-century sideboard was found on the street. In the bedroom, the Buddha was hauled back from the Himalayas by her fiancé, Tony, a software entrepreneur and “kindred spirit”. The Victorian brass bed was an eBay steal; “It came from India – what stories it could tell.” Another colonial relic, a sepia photo of her great uncle sporting a pith helmet and pipe, makes her smile: “I love the caption: ‘Myself and Maurice in Madras.’ So deadpan.”The book shelves are made from crates and lined with Homer, Orwell, Baudelaire and books about mindfulness. “I’m a great advocate of it.” Everywhere the walls resemble a mini summer exhibition with artworks by Lucien, now 18 (“an artist in denial”), Liza Dimbleby (daughter of David and Josceline) as well as drawings by poet Jamie McKendrick and photos by the late Rachel Owen. “I often swap sculptures for pictures. I wish the world was run on a barter system – it would be a better place.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Nice figure: some of her wire sculptures.

Faces are featureless, but the poses are based on “people watching – the tilt of a head, the angle of a hand or shoulder. The tiniest variation can convey a different emotion.” She still turns her hand to jewellery – a recent commission for a necklace for JK Rowling to mark the opening of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child found her on the red-carpet, surrounded by Rowling’s security guards.This prompts her to show another unusual find, a Berber purse, unearthed in a market in Marrakech. Inside the purse the couple discovered a piece of paper covered in closely written Arabic script. “The locals told us it’s magic. I find that wonderful, and scary.”
