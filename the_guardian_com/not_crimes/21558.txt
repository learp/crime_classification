The funniest standup I’ve ever seen There’s a great video that no longer exists of a guy called Nick Sun trying to perform to an empty dancefloor at two in the morning a festival where everyone’s completely high and wants him to leave. He abandons his material straight away and refuses to go off until he gets a standing ovation.The funniest person I know The guy who beat me to “funniest person” in our uni yearbook, Jordan Perry. He now works at the Foreign Office and I don’t hold grudges.The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Probably the one from Not The Nine O’Clock News where Rowan Atkinson keeps putting more and more toilets in the model bathroom. I’ve never seen anything else like it.The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funnyWhen Gordon Brown called Gillian Duffy a “bigoted woman”.The funniest joke I’ve ever heardWhen my dad tried to tell the panda eats, shoots and leaves joke, and said the punchline as eats, shoots and goes.The funniest word“Egregious”, but only in that League Of Gentlemen sketch.The funniest book I’ve ever readI suspect this makes me sound a total prune but I really did find Don Quixote incredibly funny.The funniest film I’ve ever seen      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Allstar/DREAM WORKSAnchorman, on condition that it has to be Anchorman the first time I watched it.The funniest meal I’ve ever eaten It’s more just sad but when I was 17 I decided to liven up a lasagne by putting bananas in it. I forced myself to eat it all so mum and dad wouldn’t come home and ask me what on earth I was thinking.The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever hadIn school I found my “thing” when I started washing my hair just before going to bed, which made it form a sort of wave shape the following day.
