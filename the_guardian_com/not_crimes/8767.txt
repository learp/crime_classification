Shake Rattle & Roll: 15 films   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Somewhere between The Twilight Zone, a Brazilian telenovela and a student special effects workshop, this Filipino anthology series has been going since 1984 but has kept things fresh by embracing ridiculousness. Part one, for example, relates the story of a haunted refrigerator while later instalments include a carnivorous Christmas tree and a woman whose monster baby strangles people with its umbilical cord. The series is an education in Filipino monster folklore: watch out for that aswang (a shapeshifting spirit) – or is it an engkanto (a nature spirit in human form)? Oh no, run! it’s a manananggal (a woman whose top half sprouts bat wings and detaches from her legs)!Jungle Jim: 16 filmsThe legendary Johnny Weissmuller was getting a little too long in the tooth and broad in the paunch to play Tarzan by 1948, so he switched to this safari-happy hero. The role presented some challenges – wearing clothes, delivering polysyllabic dialogue – but he sustained it over an eight-year series of luridly titled, virtually interchangeable jungle adventures involving beast-wrassling, marauding imperialists, ethnic stereotyping and swimming. By 1954’s Cannibal Attack, owing to a copyright dispute, they were not allowed to use the name “Jungle Jim” any more, so Weismuller’s character was re-christened “Johnny Weismuller”. That’s staying power for you.Uuno Turhapuro: 19 films   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Britain has Mr Bean, France has Monsieur Hulot, and Finland’s national idiot is Uuno Turhapuro, a slovenly layabout with terrible teeth, personal hygiene and dietary habits but the gift of the gab. He’s a constant irritation to his wife and especially her ambitious father. Part nine, Uuno In The Army, is still Finland’s most-watched movie domestically, apparently and sees Uuno drafted into national service, promoted to major on account of his father-in-law being defence minister, then nearly starting a war with Sweden. Actor Vesa-Matti Loiri is also a well-known singer and flautist, and even represented Finland in the 1980 Eurovision Song Contest. He finished last.Hercules: 23 filmsThis Italian sword-and-sandals series processed more beefcake than a drive-thru McDonald’s in the 1960s, even if it rarely moulded its slabs of man-flesh into credible actors. US distributor Joseph Levine described the 1957 original (starring ex-bodybuilder Steve Reeves) as “one of the worst pictures I ever saw”, with its diabolical effects and Greek salad of mythological borrowings, but it made millions at the box office and fuelled a craze. Subsequent Herculi included Mickey Hargitay (with his wife Jayne Mansfield), British Mr Universe Reg Park(Arnold Schwarzenegger’s mentor) and Peter Lupus, who went on to join the Mission Impossible team and pose nude for Playgirl – all sword and no sandals, you might say.Godzilla: 34 movies      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   King Kong vs Godzilla, 1963 poster Photograph: Everett Collection/RexResident evil: Godzilla made official Japanese citizen The king of the movie monsters and the longest continuously running franchise out there, Godzilla has survived everything that’s been thrown at him for 60 years, from rubber-suited monsters, military hardware, Godzooky, and even a Roland Emmerich reboot. As well as radioactive halitosis, Godzilla’s supremacy is down to his dual nationality: Ishirō Honda’s 1954 original was clumsily “Americanised” a few years later (snipping out nuclear references and re-framing the story around Canadian actor Raymond Burr), and somehow it worked. The big G is still stomping across pop culture: franchise-owner Toho is working on a Japanese reboot while Hollywood has him scheduled for a rematch with King Kong in 2020.Star Trek Beyond is released on Friday 22 July
