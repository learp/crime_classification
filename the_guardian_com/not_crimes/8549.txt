Chris Evans has confirmed the full presenting lineup for Top Gear including ex-Formula One team owner Eddie Jordan, Friends star Matt LeBlanc, motoring journalist Chris Harris and German racing driver Sabine Schmitz.Evans unveiled the team for the new-look Top Gear on his BBC Radio 2 breakfast show with a tongue-in-cheek reference to John Sturges’1960 classic western.“A magnificent seven sent from motoring heaven,” he said. “Well, six plus one. Six plus me.”The only previously unknown member of the lineup, which includes The Stig, was revealed to be a member of the public called Rory Reid. The BBC held open auditions for a spot on the presenting lineup, with car journalist Reid winning a place.“Rory was plucked from the public 30-second video auditions,” said Evans. “He’s knowledgeable, funny cool and warm. That’s not an easy combo. And he’s a brilliant storyteller. His audition stuck out a mile.”Car reviewer Reid has written for sites including Cnet UK, where he launched the popular Car Tech channel, and as a presenter has appeared on TV shows including Sky1’s Gadget Geeks.He looks set to bring a distinctive style to Top Gear. A video shows him reviewing a Rolls-Royce Series II using rap – or spoken word poetry.

In a sport that prefers to be hermetically sealed. He has more connections than Vodafone”.The 67-year old has been part of the BBC’s Formula One presenting team. However Channel 4’s move to snap up the free-to-air TV rights to Formula One freed up Jordan, a long-time friend of Evans, for a Top Gear role.“I’m giddy with excitement to be joining Chris and the team,” said Jordan. “I have such enormous respect for all my fellow presenters and I politely ask that they go easy on these old bones. Cars are in my DNA and although I’ve been fortunate enough to accomplish most things I ever aspired to in motorsport, presenting Top Gear is quite simply the icing on the cake.” Evans described Schmitz, who will be the show’s first female presenter in 15 years, as “very German and very quick. She’s a proven Top Gear favourite and world record holder several times over.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Moment Matt LeBlanc breaks Top Gear record back in 2012 - videoRounding up his view of the seven-strong team Evans said: “We really do have a bit of everything for everyone. “A fellow lifelong petrolhead from the other side of the pond in Matt; a fearless speed-demon in the irrepressible and effervescent Sabine; the encyclopedic, funny and wonderfully colourful character that is EJ; Chris, one of the world’s top no-nonsense car reviewers; and Rory, who simply blew me away in his audition and fully deserves his place on the team.”
