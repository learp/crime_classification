 The whole world is looking for her. But does she want to be found?’Robyn is the eldest daughter of the UK Prime Minister. Paparazzi are desperate to get a story on her all day, every day. Now they have the biggest story about Robyn that they ever could have hoped for – Robyn has been kidnapped by a group of terrorists trying to get another terrorist released from prison in exchange for Robyn. But maybe Robyn doesn’t want to be saved, maybe she’s against her father’s beliefs too. Maybe she’s on her kidnappers’ side…When I read the blurb of this book I was instantly draw in and desperate to find out what happened next. I wanted to know all about Robyn and her views and opinions, I wanted to know what her personality was. So when I got the book I was so excited and started reading it as soon as possible, although it was a lot shorter than I expected. I read this book really fast – firstly because it’s so short and secondly because I was really interested to know what was going to happen next – at the start of the book I was on the edge of my seat, it was so action packed and it was so thrilling. As the story continued however, it started to drag a bit and get a little bit less interesting. Close to the end it got action packed and thrilling again but the whole middle section (for me) had been really frustrating. Although Robyn was a unique and interesting character, I found myself really angry with her because I felt that she was being really stupid and behaving really irrationally. It was really unrealistic and it really annoyed me. Throughout the book there is an ongoing event that is in question and you’re not really supposed to properly know what happened or why it happened and as the book goes on you learn little by little the true story about that event and there were some moments when I was really shocked and surprised by the truth of the event – you know when you’re reading a book and then something that you weren’t expecting happens and you’re like Oh my god! I did not see that coming! There were some moments that were like that!I think Captive was a good and engaging book, but firstly, I think the book needed to be a bit longer and secondly, by the time you reached the end of the book I found myself thinking What was the point in that book? I mean, I know the point of books are to entertain you but I feel like most book have actual meanings as well; they educate you or they inspire you, they make you set a new goal in life or they make you aware of a real issue in life through using fiction. Another thing books do is let you live in a completely different world for a while but when I finish the book or the series I like to come out of the world and feel as though it’s developed me in some way, it’s changed me in some way or taught me a really important life lesson that only that book could have taught me and I felt as though although this book was enjoyable and I was compelled to keep reading, ultimately it was a bit of a pointless story. Bby the end of the book nothing changed, all the characters were basically in the exact same position as the position they were in when the book started. 3/5 stars.
