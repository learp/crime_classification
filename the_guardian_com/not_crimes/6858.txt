We all need strokes of luck and my first big one was my parents moving from Cheshire to Cornwall when I was young. Living there gave me a passion for sailing that has defined my life.I was a bit Jekyll and Hyde when I was younger. Very shy on land and then when I was out on the water I could really express myself. These days, I hope I am the same man on and off the water.There is nothing worse than pushy parents. The drive has to come from the youngster and then, if they have it, oh my God, you have to support them. I wouldn’t be disappointed if my daughter wasn’t interested in sailing. The America’s Cup is the Formula One of sailing. We will hit 50mph. In a 50ft boat that is quite something I used to get bullied a fair bit. I had a skin condition as a kid. It was tough at the time, but there came a point when I consciously said to myself I was going to prove myself in other ways.I like to use pressure to drive performance. I like it when it becomes a motivator. It’s a strange feeling. There’s almost something sadistic about it – if you can be sadistic to yourself.A lot of espionage goes into the America’s Cup. We all push the limit to get the best of our competitors.Marriage and having a child have been a massive change [Ainslie is married to former Sky Sports presenter Georgie Thompson]. I feel happier, more settled, but more responsible personally, which makes me more determined to succeed professionally.The America’s Cup is the Formula One of sailing. We will hit 50mph. In a 50ft boat that is quite something.I always need a big challenge. Winning four Olympic gold medals gives me great moments to look back on, but the current challenge – building a British team for the America’s Cup – is as big as any I have undertaken.I left my first America’s Cup early. I was in my 20s and didn’t feel I had a role. Being in a leadership position in my own team is a lot more rewarding. It’s a big, bold thing we are trying to do – to win the America’s Cup at the first effort against billionaire-backed teams.Team members don’t need to be best mates, but they must respect each other and the communication must be perfect.Say sailing to a lot of people and it’s still gin and tonic as the sun goes down. But it is not as elitist as people think and we have had many incredible achievements in recent times, from our Olympic teams to the likes of Ellen MacArthur. British sailing is not as respected as it should be.Steve Redgrave is our greatest ever Olympian. We met in 1996 when I was wheeled out with my medal as a “here are your team-mates from the Games” type thing. I don’t think he had a clue who I was. He is so bloody-minded. I respect bloody-minded people. They get things done.Alastair Campbell is the author of 12 books including Winners and How They Succeed and his latest Outside, Inside: 2003-05.
