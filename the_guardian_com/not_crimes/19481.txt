A posthumous portrait of the scientist Francis Crick, commissioned by James Watson, with whom he famously discovered the structure of DNA in 1953, has been revealed on Wednesday, the day that would have been his 100th birthday.The portrait by the Irish artist Robert Ballagh, who has previously painted Watson, will hang in the Francis Crick Institute, a new science centre named in his honour, when it opens in St Pancras, London, later this year.The painting shows Crick, who died in 2004, at his age at the time they announced the discovery, which is regarded as one of the most important in the history of science. He is portrayed standing in a lecture theatre in front of a blackboard with the words “DNA–RNA–protein”.

One is an academic paper on unravelling the genetic code, the other his Nobel acceptance speech. Crick, Watson and Maurice Wilkins, on whose work they built, were jointly awarded the Nobel in 1962.Ballagh is best known for his portraits of figures in politics and the arts, including James Joyce and Oscar Wilde, but he said it was an honour to add two great scientists – James Watson and Francis Crick – to his portfolio.Ballagh said: “Jim’s personal knowledge of Francis Crick was invaluable to me in creating the painting. He was of the firm opinion that Crick should be portrayed in his forties, when, Jim said, he was at the height of his powers. He also suggested that I should consider placing Crick at a lectern in order to represent his immense skills in scientific communication.”Sir Paul Nurse, the director of the Crick Institute, which is dedicated to research on human health, said the centre was delighted to have the portrait.He added: “Crick was noted for his openness to new ideas and his collaborations with scientists in other fields of expertise – some of the founding principles for our institute. In that spirit, we hope to provide some of the great biological revelations of the 21st century, and ultimately to improve human health.”The institute, which will be housed in a spectacular building beside St Pancras Station and the British Library, will house 1,300 researchers and hundreds of support staff.This article was corrected on 9 June 2016 - the credit for the image of the portrait above was originally credited to Paul Mulligan, rather than Paul Rattigan.
