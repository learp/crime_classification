Slapstick, BristolThe mechanics and dynamics of silent comedy didn’t die with the advent of the talkies – just look at last year’s Shaun The Sheep Movie. A breadth of remit allows this silent and classic comedy film festival to stray beyond the confines of early cinema, although it always manages to find more of that out there. New (re)discoveries this year include Mancunian comedies (from the studio once known as “Jollywood”), silent westerns and a Soviet menage a trois. In addition you get sound-assisted slapstick such as Cary Grant’s breakthrough The Awful Truth (introduced by comedian Lucy Porter), and guests including Stephen Merchant, Ken Dodd, Tim Vine (on Sgt Bilko), and Marcus Brigstocke in conversation with the makers of Shaun The Sheep. And if all else fails, you can’t go wrong with an orchestrally accompanied screening of Charlie Chaplin’s The Kid.Various venues, Wed to 25 JanHorror-On-Sea, Southend-on-SeaLooking for a low-budget horror movie about a woman with man-eating breast implants? Your quest is over at last. This grassroots festival might not boast the most prestigious titles out there (the breast-implant movie is called Killer Rack), but then horror is a genre where imagination, a sick sense of humour and a bucket of homemade gore can compensate for pretty much all other shortcomings. The fans clearly don’t mind: now in its fourth year, Horror-On-Sea has expanded to cover two weekends, with 60-odd shorts and features. Entries worth a punt include the self-explanatory Kill, Granny, Kill!, imaginary friend parable Banjo, and President Wolfman – an American political satire made from retro footage. Then there’s resident Essex horror auteur Pat Higgins, who presents a film-making masterclass, plus the world premiere of his latest, The House On The Witch Pit.Park Inn Palace Hotel & TAP Art Gallery, Fri to 31 Jan
