The problem is that a book called ‘The Code’ is making people do bad things like robbing banks and Darkus’ job is to solve the mystery and stop the villains.I do not have a favourite part because I liked all of this book so much. What I liked about this book is that the author makes it really exciting so you just want to keep on reading and cannot put it down. You will like this book if you like adventure and mystery and are aged nine or more. You should read this book because its really interesting. I would give it 5/5.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
