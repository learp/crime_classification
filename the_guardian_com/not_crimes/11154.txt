Nathalia’s dad is embarrassing, it says so in the title: Nathalia Buttface and the Most Embarrassing Dad in the World. But that’s a SERIOUS understatement. He’s been embarrassing Nathalia since before she was born by giving her his last name, Bumole! And that was the start of her dreadful nicknames like Buttface. It’s pronounced Bew-Mow-Lay! she would say everyday, but of course, the kids at school didn’t listen.This book starts with Nathalia’s first day of a new school, a new start, a new life. She sees it as an opportunity to rid her life of horrible nicknames and endless teasing. All she needed to do was prevent her classmates from seeing her dad and obviously her last name. But when she turns up for school 30 minutes late in her dad’s camper van full of trash that catches fire in the headteacher’s parking space, she realises it wouldn’t be as easy as she thought. Just as she thought she had gone through the worst with only a few scrapes ( and possibly quite a few burns ) things take a turn for the worst.But not all hope was lost. Natalia was determined to not suffer just because of her stupid last name. But what she strived to achieve was not to be accomplished without a few mishaps along the way.This book was an amazing read and I am so thankful that the Guardian children’s books site decided to send me it. It was so hilarious and made me laugh out loud. I would recommend this book to any reader looking for a great book. • Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
