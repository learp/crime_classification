Madonna and her ex-husband, Guy Ritchie, have resolved a custody dispute over their teenage son, Rocco.A court spokesman in New York said on Wednesday that Madonna and Ritchie had reached a settlement. Details have not been released, although Ritchie’s lawyer has said that Rocco will continue to live with his father in London.The dispute began when Rocco, 16, remained in London with his father after visiting the UK on Madonna’s world tour. He refused to return to the US with his mother for Christmas. Litigation was opened in New York and London. In December a judge ruled that Rocco should be returned to his mother’s custody, but decided not to issue a warrant to enforce the order. Rocco has since remained in London with his father and enrolled in a school in the capital.During a hearing in Manhattan this year, the state supreme court justice Deborah Kaplan implored Madonna, 58, and Ritchie, 47, to settle the matter privately. Judge urges Madonna and Guy Ritchie to resolve dispute over son “No one is disrupting his [Rocco’s] household other than the inability of the parents to reach a resolution,” Kaplan said. “If they cannot resolve this matter then eventually the court will.”Ellen Sigal, a court-appointed lawyer for Rocco, said in March that the dispute was causing the teenager stress. “It’s been a very difficult time for him,” she said in court. “We hope to put an end to this as soon as possible without exposing him to more litigation, press innuendo, any of that kind of thing.”Ritchie and Madonna divorced in 2008. They also have a 10-year-old son, David, whom they adopted from Malawi.
