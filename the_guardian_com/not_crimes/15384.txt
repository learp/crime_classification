It was funnier and more anarchic than anything else I discovered,” Reeves said.“And it didn’t always have to make sense.“Out of all the isms, movements and manifestos of the 20th century, it was the Dadaists who proved the most important – giving birth, not only to a lot of modern art, but also shaping comedy, music and political protest …” Reeves will restage an early Dada performance inside Zurich’s Cabaret Voltaire, where the movement first began, as part of the programme.Marking the 100th anniversary of Dada, the documentary, presented by Reeves and also featuring the likes of director Terry Gilliam and satirist Armando Iannucci, is one of a season of programmes on conceptual art.Another show looks at one of the most controversial pieces of 20th century art, Bricks by Carl Andre.The work – 120 fire bricks laid out on the floor of Tate Britain – sparked outrage when it was installed at the gallery 40 years ago. A century of Dada: from anti-war artists to mainstream con artists Other programmes include a documentary on eccentric British artist Bob Parks, who walked the streets of Los Angeles for a year in a string bikini, and Who’s Afraid of Conceptual Art? in which James Fox, an art historian who is not a fan of conceptual art, takes a looks at the art movement.The season, BBC4 Goes Conceptual, will air in the autumn and follows the success of BBC4 Goes Pop in 2015 and BBC4 Goes Abstract the previous year.BBC4 channel editor Cassian Harrison said: “With a series of films from a cast of brilliant talents, be prepared to have your brain bent, stretched and strummed as BBC4 Goes Conceptual this autumn.”
