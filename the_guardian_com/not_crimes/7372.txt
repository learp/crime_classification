It was the woman who exclaimed “it’s just so wonderful not having to take orders from prats any more” who inspired me to write this week’s chapter on retirement and joy.Another reader put it just as well. “I think I was born to retire,” she emailed to tell me. “I was a serious mum and a serious, professional woman, but I’m no longer a responsible adult. I can now feel the joyousness of youth.”Joy in retirement seems to depend on three constants: health, wealth and sociability. But people find joy in different places. There are the hedonistic older people who spend their retirement going from one holiday to another. Then there are those whose happiness is predicated on feeling useful and giving something back.This has been a lovely article to write: a break from the sadness and seriousness of the past few weeks. I hope it gives you as much pleasure to read as I had in writing it. AmeliaPS. I’m going to be looking at the Silver Economy soon: how our ageing population is impacting every market and industry, from beauty and leisure, to food, transportation, homes and insurance.
