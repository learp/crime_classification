Jonathan Jones’ fascinating piece about Holocaust memorials (War memorials have failed – we have forgotten the chaos of fascism, theguardian.com, 9 December) argues that they have failed to combat racial hatred in Europe and asks whether it could be that the works themselves are too modern or abstract to communicate with the public.#Wearehere: Somme tribute revealed as Jeremy Deller work At 14-18 NOW, we create contemporary memorials to engage people with the centenary of the first world war. Jeremy Deller’s work We’re Here Because We’re Here was a completely new type of memorial that saw hundreds of volunteers dressed as soldiers appear silently across the UK to mark the centenary of the Somme. Deller took the memorial directly to the public, with the soldiers appearing in shopping centres, car parks and on public transport; he avoided sentimentality, and instead brought home the scale of loss 100 years ago.In another example, Neil Bartlett and Kate Pullinger’s Letter to an Unknown Soldier created a literary memorial that thousands of people, including many schoolchildren, contributed to. The huge impact of these works shows that, while we can never capture the horror of war, there is a place in our society for art to help us remember and engage with the past.Jenny WaldmanDirector of 14-18 NOW • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
