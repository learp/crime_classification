Farewells in fashion come thick and fast in the current news cycle. On Thursday morning in Paris, it was the turn of Clare Waight Keller who showed her final collection for Chloé after six years as creative director.She went out on a high. For her final bow, Waight Keller was smiling and a glitter cannon – irresistibly cheery at all times – was let off at the end of the show. It felt like a conscious uncoupling rather than anything more sinister.The collection, soundtracked by the Human League, was equally upbeat – in fact the show notes said it was about “psychedelic optimism”. That translates to clothes that mismatched different eras – 60s, 40s, 90s, 70s – to create youthful clothes to have fun in. These included pinafore dresses over strong-shouldered silk blouses with wide bishop sleeves, slouchy trousers with strong chunky knitwear and a red velvet minidress with a heart cutout sure to get a lot of love come autumn.

That sounds like it’s veering towards bad taste, but it’s also the height of fashion right now. These looks will be the ones digital influencers and their followers will be after.Commercial appeal was straightforward in this collection at all times. If some shows feel like a selection of ideas rather than clothes to wear, many of these could walk straight off the catwalk and into the wardrobes of young women – those with deep pockets, anyway.

Instead, she said it was about “adding a different punctuation point at the end of what I have done here”. That meant a reassessment of the “elongated silhouette” that defined her time at the house: slouchy trousers, strong shoulders and “lots of leg”. She said a mix of references was also typical. “I dipped in and out of different worlds with this collection,” she said. “Nothing feels referenced from a specific era because it all comes into the Chloé world.”Founded in 1952 by Gaby Aghion, Chloé made its name with a kind of effortless femininity that had a no-nonsense eye on women’s lives. This is something that Waight Keller, previously at Pringle of Scotland, updated for the 2010s. In the last few seasons, Waight Keller hit her stride. There were collections of haute tracksuits, chic motorbike gear and, for spring/summer, La La Land yellow frilled dresses. All received critical acclaim and were central to trends like athleisure and frills making their way to the high street.

Richemont, the company that owns the house, reported good sales growth in 2016 with both ready-to-wear and bags selling well. Tallying with the current fashion of hiring within the industry rather than big names, it is widely expected that Natacha Ramsay-Levi will take the position of creative director. Known for her work with Nicolas Ghesquière, she is currently a senior member of his team at Louis Vuitton. Speculation suggests she will not renew her contract, which expires at the end of March, and instead take up the role at Chloé. If Ramsay-Levi is hired, a harder, more street-focused edge is likely to be brought to the house. With Waight Keller, Stella McCartney, Phoebe Philo and Karl Lagerfeld previously leading the design team, she will be in auspicious company.

In a statement, she said working at the house “has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career”. Although her name has been mentioned in connection with the open position at Givenchy, it is widely understood that her departure is for personal reasons. Waight Keller has three children and it has been reported that her decision was based on the commute between Paris and London becoming unmanageable.
