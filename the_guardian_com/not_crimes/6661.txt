Goto, a remote island off the coast of south-west Japan near Nagasaki is an unlikely birthplace for a model society. But with local industry struggling and a population in decline, it has been selected as a testbed for the region's new social and economic strategy.On the mainland, Nagasaki faces the social and economic problems that British former industrial strongholds such as Liverpool and Sunderland would recognise – problems writ large across the whole region. The city was once the nation's shipbuilding hub and although major players such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries remain, they offer fewer jobs than ever before.Just like tiny Goto, the city struggles to hold on to young talent as graduates seek employment in Tokyo or elsewhere. Its population (now 1.43 million) has been shrinking since the early 1980s, the workforce is ageing and land values are also heading south. There is an urgent need for economic growth.Yet, unlike many British cities, Nagasaki has a convincing vision for its future. Its prefectural government (comparable to a large county council or combined regional authority) has set out a ¥42bn (£295m) "green deal" for the region that links plans to increase tourism and improve its record on sustainability to its economic and industrial future.The plan is this: make up the population gap by encouraging tourism and use the tourist industry to spread sustainable behaviour such as driving electric vehicles (on Goto, for example, all hire cars are already EV or PHV vehicles). Then use this expertise in eco-sustainability to develop a new industry in green technology (Mitsubishi is already gathering expertise in offshore wind) to create jobs. If this "green deal" succeeds, it could convince the Japanese government to site a new offshore green energy hub within the prefecture, turning the region's fortunes around.As Takahiro Suzuki, director general of the Nagasaki prefectural government, says: "This is a challenge to create a new society model from the island region … harnessing Nagasaki's character and strengths to simultaneously promote twin goals of industrial development and job creation, and lowering carbon and going green."The strategy could solve many of the region's problems at a stroke. On Goto, the small-scale test of the approach, tiny electric mobility vehicles have been designed for older residents, reducing the number of cars on the island. Local energy powers these vehicles, with a floating wind turbine working just off the archipelago.The policy has not been without problems – there has been no true community engagement in its design and consultation with local business extends only as far as sharing information. In this respect Japanese councils could learn from some British counterparts.One obstacle is that Japanese society, based on a culture of hierarchy and respect for authority, precludes any genuine consultation for fear of causing offence. As a result, the work in Goto has focused almost exclusively on tourists and attracting new business, rather than changing the behaviour of households and developing existing local business – with more than one car per household on the island, no sustainable society can be built by tourists alone.There are lessons, in return, for British authorities from the bold vision of Nagasaki's senior officers and politicians. Imagining and believing in a different future for an area in decline takes strength.Of course, it is easier to think big when central government is still providing investment (two-thirds of the funding required for Goto's electric vehicles was provided centrally). But though tussles between the two power bases are still common, Japanese local authorities have a greater share of responsibility, autonomy and fiscal control than British councils. The message for Whitehall? Give councils their freedom and they could grant you that elusive prize: economic growth.• Hannah Fearn's travel expenses in Japan were covered by the Japan Local Government Centre
