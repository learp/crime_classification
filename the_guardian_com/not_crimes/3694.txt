TI has labelled Lil Wayne “embarrassing” following the rapper’s comments about Black Lives Matter. Lil Wayne has caused controversy in recent weeks by seeming to belittle the movement that started in response to the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012. Speaking to ABC Nightline, Lil Wayne said: “I don’t feel connected to a damn thing that ain’t got nothin’ to do with me. I’m a young black rich motherfucker. If that don’t let you know that America understand black fuckin’ lives matter these days, I don’t know what it is.”The rapper later said he had been angered by the interviewer’s tone. He told TMZ: “When the reporter began asking me questions about my daughter being labelled a bitch and a hoe, I got agitated. From there, there was no thought put into her questions and my responses.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Rapper TI performing at Madison Square Garden in New York.

In a lengthy Instagram message on 7 November, he posted a video of Lil Wayne’s interview with a caption saying: “Wayne I’ve known you over a decade. Our daughters grew up together practically … I KNOW you wired a bit different than most other responsible adults, but still n---- U TRIPPING!!!!”TI went on to say that Lil Wayne’s comments were “absolutely unacceptable”, writing: “You’re disrespecting yourself, bringing shame on your family name & tarnishing your legacy … You have sons & a daughter that depend upon your leadership. Bro if you don’t stand for something out here, all the money, jewelry, cars, mansions bandannas & hit records don’t mean shit!!!! “Our people are being oppressed!!! We are being hunted, captured & slaughtered out here daily!!!” he added, advising the rapper: “If you’re not prepared for a question in an interview, say No Comment Bro. But stop embarrassing yourself & everyone out here who’s been supporting you.”Lil Wayne has yet to respond to TI’s comments.
