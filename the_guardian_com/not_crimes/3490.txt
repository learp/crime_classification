What is it? A cottage garden classic that livens up the spring garden with its sprays of flowers “fluttering unconcernedly in the bitter winds of March”, as Margery Fish once wrote. Its pink, blue or white blooms offer valuable pollen and nectar to hungry bees, while the hairy, silver-patterned leaves are useful for brightening shady spots.Any good varieties? Loads: Pulmonaria officinalis ‘Sissinghurst White’ is vital for anyone hankering after a white garden. For heavily silvered leaves, try ‘Silverado’ or ‘Diana Clare’. The best of the blues is ‘Blue Ensign’, but you don’t get the silvery leaf markings; likewise, P. rubra ‘Redstart’’s pale red flowers are sweet, but the leaves are plain. P. saccharata ‘Leopard’ offers red flowers and spotted leaves.Plant it with? The leathery paddles of ruddy bergenia leaves (try the variety ‘Overture’) combined with dark-coloured heucheras such as ‘Obsidian’ make a harmonious mix.And where? Cool, shady moist corners are best for this woodlander.Any drawbacks? Lungworts can succumb to mildew if too dry, and the hairy foliage has a tendency to look coarse and unkempt later in the year, so tidy after flowering. Although the leaves sometimes persist through colder weather, most varieties die back, so it will leave a gap in the winter border.What else does it do? It’s one of the plants used in the production of vermouth. Cheers!
