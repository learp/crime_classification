Guardian leaders used to find it impossible to mention Michael Gove without referring to his courtesy. Then came his laughably self-important implosion after the referendum, and it seemed we’d heard the last of this invisible trait. But now here’s Anne McElvoy, describing Gove as “intellectually respected” (Opinion, 3 January).

Really? Sympathy out the window.Geraldine BlakeWorthing, West Sussex• Being ever playful with language, I don’t see why we shouldn’t allow a single kudo (Letters, 31 December). On growing my first ever crop of a single asparagu, I was delighted. It may even have engendered an applau.Sam CowenAmersham, Buckinghamshire• The postman wears shorts (Letters, 4 January) because he has to run to do his job – like everyone else in the now privatised but former public sector.Ailsa JohnsonPendeen, Cornwall • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
