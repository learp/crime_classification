Upscale Beverly Hills is among four California cities where water utilities have been fined for not forcing residents to conserve enough water during California’s unrelenting four-year drought, officials said on Friday.California city sends its water wasters back to school as drought deepens The wealthy Los Angeles area municipality was fined $61,000 on Thursday, making it the only community not located in a desert singled out for penalties, the California State Water Resources Board said.“Some urban water suppliers simply have not met the requirements laid before them,” said Cris Carrigan, director of the water board’s office of enforcement. “For these four suppliers, it’s been too little too late.” Californians are under orders from the water board and governor Jerry Brown to cut water usage by 25% over the levels used in 2013. As a whole, the state has met that goal for four months running, regulators said on Friday. From June through August, California residents and businesses have saved 253bn gallons of water, board chairwoman Felicia Marcus told reporters on Friday. But the cities of Beverly Hills, Indio, Redlands and the Coachella Valley Water districts have not met the standard, the board said. Beverly Hills, where some wealthy property owners continue to maintain bright green lawns despite orders to conserve, residents used about 169 gallons of water per person each during the month of September, compared to 68 gallons used by residents of Los Angeles. Beverly Hills residents have wasted 175m gallons of water since June, Carrigan said on the conference call. The city of Beverly Hills did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
