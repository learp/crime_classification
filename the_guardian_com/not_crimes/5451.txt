A court has ruled the government did not breach the rules governing consultation exercises when scrapping regulations that would have required more homes to undertake energy efficiency improvements, despite its own consultation revealing strong support for proposals that would have delivered significant emissions savings.Supporters of the so-called "consequential improvement" rules, which were also dubbed a "conservatory tax" by parts of the media, were yesterday told by High Court judge Mr Justice Nichol that they could not judicially review Communities Secretary Eric Pickles' controversial decision to scrap the rules.The Association for the Conservation of Energy (ACE) had led the campaign to overturn Pickles' rejection of plans to mandate households undertaking significant improvement work such as extensions to meet minimum energy efficiency standards, and had been seeking a judicial review over the government's handling of the official consultation on the proposals. The proposal was popular with the building industry and green groups, with 82 per cent of respondents to the government consultation supporting the idea.However, the judge ruled this was not relevant to the decision, arguing Pickles was entitled to rule in favour of the minority who opposed the measures, as long as he has "genuinely considered" all representations made through the consultation.In a statement, ACE director Andrew Warren expressed his frustration that "this most perverse of all decisions" would now be upheld."We are very disappointed that as a result the Â£11bn worth of extra construction activity which Mr Pickles' department originally identified as likely to be delivered by consequential improvements will not now be realised," he said. "Nor will the 130 million tonnes of CO2 lifetime savings be delivered. Nor will we see the extra 2.2 million Green Deals he forecast it would deliver."Under the ruling, Department for Communities and Local Government's (DCLG) costs were awarded against ACE.DCLG had not responded to a request for comment at time of going to press.
