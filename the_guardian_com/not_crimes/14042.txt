Robert Carlyle has suggested a third Trainspotting film may be on the way after saying he’s been “talking about that” with producers.Carlyle, who plays hardman Franco Begbie in 1996’s Trainspotting, as well as its soon-to-be-released sequel T2 Trainspotting, was speaking to reporters before T2’s premiere in Edinburgh. “We’ve been talking about that, I am up for doing it,” he said. “So maybe we ain’t seen the end of Begbie just yet.”T2 is based on Porno, the 2002 novel that Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh conceived as a sequel to his 1993 original; in 2016 Welsh published The Blade Artist, which focuses on an older Begbie, who has reinvented himself as a sculptor and is living in California with a new family.

There is something quite emotional about that. He’s capable of feeling something more than just rage, so I am pleased that that element of Begbie has been shown.“And maybe that sets up another film in fact, because Irvine Welsh has written The Blade Artist.”
