We believe that the Paris agreement represents a historic opportunity for the world to tackle dangerous climate change. But that opportunity will only be realised if we follow up the good intentions of Paris with delivery in every country of the world. Paris was significant because it set out the ambition to keep global warming well below 2C, and ideally to 1.5C of warming, and it accepted that the world must get to net zero emissions in the second half of the century, in accordance with our scientific understanding. In doing so, the agreement built on the commitments by businesses and cities of the world to net zero emissions. A move driven not just by science but by the ambition for a world with cleaner air, better homes, and an improved quality of life.The UK government deserves significant credit for having helped deliver the Paris agreement. Now we urge it to follow up its high ambition internationally, with high ambition here at home. Specifically, it can build on the momentum from Paris by supporting the idea of enshrining net zero emissions in UK domestic law, with the date to be advised by the independent committee on climate change.Just as the 2008 UK Climate Change Act, prompted by business and civil society, and passed with all-party support, sent a signal to the world, so we would do so again. A signal that every country must raise its ambition, that business and government need the certainty to plan ahead, and that we must be serious about the scale of challenge that faces us. We must build on the opportunity of Paris, not squander it. We urge the government to act.Ed Miliband MP (Labour)Tim Farron MP (Lib Dem Leader)Caroline Lucas MP (Green)Dan Poulter MP (Conservative)Graham Stuart MP (Conservative)Nigel Topping CEO, We Mean Business CoalitionHelen Cadbury Chair, Barrow Cadbury TrustLaura Taylor Head of advocacy, Christian AidJames Thornton CEO, Client EarthJonathan Gillett Chair, Polden Puckham Charitable FoundationJulian Richardson Managing director, SandbagCatherine Howarth Chief executive, ShareActionEmma Pinchbeck Head of climate and energy policy, WWF-UK• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
