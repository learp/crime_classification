Russian soprano Aida Garifullina makes a cameo appearance in Florence Foster Jenkins as star singer Lily Pons; a well-placed reminder of quite how glorious an opera singer should sound and a corrective to the wincingly tuneless arias of Ms Jenkins. Garifullina was cast by director Stephen Frears himself - apparently a fan of the singer’s, and her scene was filmed in London: Hammersmith Apollo was transformed into New York’s most famous concert hall, Carnegie Hall.

And then it was all done in one take, live to camera. I could hardly believe it was all over so quickly but the result looks and sounds amazing.” Aida Garifullina’s debut album, which will feature her performing this track and several other Lily Pons favourites will be released in 2017 on Decca Classics.
