Patricia Arquette has expressed her dismay at the omission of her sister Alexis, from the In Memoriam section of the 2017 Oscars ceremony, saying it was a “real slight to the trans community”.Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, Arquette said that Alexis, who died aged 47 on 11 September 2016, “was a great actor, and had 70 credits, and was really brave to live her truth as a trans woman, and they didn’t include her in the memorial”. Alexis Arquette obituary “I think that was a real slight to the trans community, especially at this time, when trans kids can’t even go to the bathroom in the United States of America at school. It says a lot about the lack of inclusion. Trans kids can really never look at anyone and see their heroes, and I think that was a big mistake.”Alexis’ first big screen role was in 1986’s Down and Out in Beverly Hills, and went on to make appearances in Last Exit to Brooklyn, Pulp Fiction and The Wedding Singer, but found it increasingly difficult to maintain her acting career. A 2007 documentary, Alexis Arquette: She’s My Brother, followed her preparations for sex reassignment surgery.Patricia Arquette said she was “not surprised” at the omission. “The reality is, trans people are ignored all the time in our culture and our community. They have their civil rights taken away. They’re a very disrespected community.”
