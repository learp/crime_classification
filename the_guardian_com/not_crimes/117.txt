Can’t be bothered with pedals when you cycle? Then the Kick Varibike is for you. You can push along as though you’re on a scooter or turn the cranks by the handlebars to increase upper-body strength on the move. It has a three-gear system and brakes on the front and rear. With a prototype recently on show at the Eurobike exhibition, commercial versions are expected to become available soon. But with an estimated RRP of €1,600 (£1,160) it’s wheely expensive.codingFarmers      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Learn coding via an old-fashioned board game.

There are optional longhand instructions to give you some back-up.With a retail price of $30, the game is set to launch on Amazon this November.
