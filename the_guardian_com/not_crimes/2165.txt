At the height of summer the single biggest job on my plot is no longer gently coaxing baby veg plants to grow but actively hacking some of the most vigorous ones back. While most Brits would simply relegate these cuttings to the compost heap, in other countries these offcuts are considered delicacies, just as good as (if not better than) eating the fruit itself. This summer you could get two crops for one and help save food waste – and be introduced to flavours you’ve never known before. Here’s my guide to three of the best...Pumkins and winter squashThese are crops with plans on world domination. Give them the water, fertiliser and sun they need and their trailing stems can grow at an astonishing rate, spreading out in all directions. Trimming the soft young tips of each stem back by 10cm will help keep their megalomaniac tendencies in check and provide tasty leaves for the table, too. A common veg across Asia, Latin America and Africa, squash tips have a crisp, mineral flavour with a slight bitterness much like kale or spinach, but with a fresher flavour and more satisfying crunch. They are particularly lovely sautéed in some olive oil, garlic and lemon zest.Vine leavesA quick minute or two of boiling in salted water will soften these leaves into the perfect wrapping for the stuffed vine leaves so popular across the eastern Mediterranean. Pack them full of rice, fried onions, minced meat and a generous squeeze of lemon juice and they make the freshest and lightest of summer starters served ice cold as the BBQ warms up. Containing large amount of tannins, the leaves have been used by home-pickling fanatics for their ability to preserve crispness by blocking the action of enzymes that can create soggy textures. Just crush a few leaves and add them to the pickling liquid for a noticeable difference.Broad beansNipping off the top 10cm of growth on broad bean plants just as the pods have set will significantly reduce your chances of getting infestations of black fly, which love the tender, sweet, pea-like flavour of these shoots. It also allows more light to the pods themselves and concentrates the plants’ energies on fruiting. These young leaves taste great just as they are, scattered in a mixed salad with plenty of olive oil and a generous sprinkling of salt, or cooked as delicate summer greens. I love mine stirred through a simple risotto five minutes before serving with a handful of peas, a bunch of chopped mint and a good few shavings of parmesan. Add a grating of nutmeg and you have perfection.Email James at james.wong@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @Botanygeek
