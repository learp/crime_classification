A trilling burst of notes, like high-tensile cables struck with sticks, came from low bramble in the wood. Then a brown whirr crossed my path from right to left, north to south. A wren, a tiny bird carrying a huge package of omens. According to accounts of old auguries, if the wren sings from the north, "bad people are coming whether warriors or clerics or bad women, and wicked youths are on the way" (RI Best, Prognostications from the raven and the wren, 1916). This wren was bad news. But then, there is no other kind of news now.The messages I get from those who care about the wren's world are increasingly panicky. Just as the harsh scream of a hawk sends little birds scattering through the treetops, shrill notes, horrified at the ground lost in conservation, bemoan the inevitable blighting of this and other landscapes for dubious gain, the renewed onslaught against inconvenient wildlife and wild places and the commodification of things we can barely describe properly. Another corner of a wood is flattened and another field is marked out for building. Another garden is lost under concrete; another road is widened and another deer lies dead on the verge.With the sound of a hundred chairs scraping a wooden floor, the quarry clan of jackdaws lifted from the field – up, sideways, down – then into the wind over the Edge until they looked like charred pages of a burnt book being blown around the sky. These may as well be black leaves from the bonfire of agreements, memorandums, guidance notes, regulations and laws which were hard-won protection for places such as this little wood with its wren, gone up in smoke.
