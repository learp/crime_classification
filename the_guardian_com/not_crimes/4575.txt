Party properly with a vintage up-do. It seems like every catwalk, from Dries Van Noten to Opening Ceremony, had a version of 1920s finger waves. Marc Jacobs’s were heavily lacquered with unfinished ends, while Stella McCartney’s were soft and infinitely wearable, worn with a little low ponytail. If you don’t have the electric tools, just add product to damp hair, then curl the front section with your fingers. Clip in place, then leave to dry for perfect party glamour.How to get the lookUmberto Giannini Crème De Curl £7 boots.comAveda Phomollient £16 aveda.co.ukEGO Getaway Wand £44.95 lookfantastic.comKMS California Hairstay Styling Gel £12.50 feelunique.comBabyliss Boutique Rollers £37.45 johnlewis.comJohn Frieda Frizz Ease Hairspray £3.99 superdrug.comRahua Defining Hair Spray £34 rahua.comEmail Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman
