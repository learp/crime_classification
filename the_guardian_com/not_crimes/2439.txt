The Gartan Mother’s LullabySleep, O babe, for the red bee humsThe silent twilight’s fall:Aibheall from the Grey Rock comesTo wrap the world in thrall.A leanbhan O, my child, my joy,My love and heart’s desire,The crickets sing you lullabyBeside the dying fire.Dusk is drawn, and the Green Man’s ThornIs wreathed in rings of fog:Siabhra sails his boat till mornUpon the Starry Bog.A leanbhan O, the pale half moonHath brimmed her cusp in dew,And weeps to hear the sad sleep-tuneI sing, O love, to you. Faintly sweet doth the chapel bellRing o’er the valley dim:Tearmann’s peasant-voices swellIn fragrant evening hymn.A leanbhan O, the low bell ringsMy little lamb to restAnd angel-dreams, till morning singsIts music in your breast. Sleep, O babe, for the red bee humsThe silent twilight’s fall:Aibheall from the Grey Rock comesTo wrap the world in thrall.A leanbhan O, my child, my joy,My love and heart’s desire,The crickets sing you lullabyBeside the dying fire.Joseph Campbell (Seosamh MacCathmhaoil) was a Belfast Catholic, born into a family of road-builders in 1879. He was a song collector before he became a poet and playwright, and he supported the Easter Rising as an ardent Republican. He later emigrated to the US, where he died in 1944. The Gartan Mother’s Lullaby is one of the most perfect of his collaborations with the composer and folk-song arranger Herbert Hughes, although perhaps less well known than My Lagan Love. I don’t know how much Joseph Campbell’s work is valued in his native land; he’s certainly not as well-known in the UK as he should be. His poems are alive, sinewy and original. I hope new readers will agree. Take a look at The Piper, for example, with its many richly specific details. (Who, by the way, is the piper celebrated in the poem? This wonderful gallery may give you some ideas – and at least a notion of what he might have looked like, “in proper black, whey-bearded, wan”.)There’s a further small but sparkling selection of Campbell’s work available on poemhunter. I was tempted by all of them. I finally picked The Gartan Mother’s Lullaby because I remembered owning once a much-loved recording by Scottish folk group the Corries. I learned and sang along to the lyrics without understanding a good part of them. It’s only since recently reading the text, with footnotes on the Irish words and references, that I’ve cleared up some of my phonetic confusion – and yet, at the same time, I’ve not lost the sense of skin-tingling mystery I felt at the first encounter. The lyrics are wonderfully atmospheric. As in The Piper, the use of proper nouns, though naming mythological characters in this instance, brings an unforced authenticity: they are presented without a flourish, merely as part of an intimately known if supernatural landscape. And Campbell’s gift for the small, tellingly-placed detail is immediately apparent in the reference to the bee’s colour. “The red bee” (a mason bee, perhaps?) is a powerful image. How much the poem may owe to an original set of folk lyrics is a pertinent question. I don’t know the answer. But it seems to me that the third stanza may be an attempt at Christianising a pagan cosmology. It’s less successful as poetry, and is omitted from some versions. It might suggest more than one hand at work. Liam Guilar mounts a trenchant and amusing argument in defence of Campbell on his blog. I don’t know if literature teaching is the deciding factor in Campbell’s neglect: a welter of trend-following and reputation-mongering affects the lives of the dead poets in unpredictable ways. Campbell’s poems are certainly a lot more than footnotes, and beyond technically competent. He stands out from the other minor writers of his time and place, finding ways to sharpen and re-present the matter of Ireland without falling too deep into sentimentality or tub-thumping. I hope that, whether you come to this poem familiar with its musical setting, or are reading it for the first time, you will share my enjoyment of Campbell’s language, and go on to discover more of his vigorous achievement. You can hear the poem’s musical setting here.
