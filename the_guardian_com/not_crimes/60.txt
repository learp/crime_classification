So, we're to have Chinese companies providing our nuclear generated electricity (Editorial, 17 October). Can the chancellor explain why it is OK to have companies owned by foreign governments – including by communist ones – controlling major chunks of the British economy (all Chinese nuclear generating companies are 100% state owned, while EDF, the principal partner in the new Hinkley Point power station, is 85% owned by the French government), while it is not OK to have companies owned by the British government participating in the economy (eg Royal Mail), except in emergency situations (eg RBS). What sort of ideologically distorted hypocrisy are we being subjected to here and what are its implications for the longer-term future of the British economy?And if Ukip is so concerned with the leaking of British sovereignty to foreign powers, which this development underlines spectacularly, how about parking your obsessions with the EU for once and paying attention to who owns the British economy?Jeffrey HendersonProfessor of international development, University of Bristol• The detrimental effects of the unnecessary and enormous borrowings by some companies deserve greater prominence than just the last sentence of an article about Thames Water (Ofwat to halt Thames Water 8% price rise, 17 October). It is not just the avoidance of tax but the increase in prices to pay the interest and to still provide a profit that are hurtful. It seems to me the acquisition of a UK company by private interests typically goes as follows. Using a large loan the private company or fund buys a UK company that has no substantial debt – for example a utility company or a football club – then causes the acquired company to take out a big loan, the proceeds of which are paid to the new owner as a dividend, or some such, thereby extinguishing the owner's original debt. The transfer most likely avoids tax in any country.The UK company now labours under a large debt, restricting its ability to borrow for genuine business purposes and requiring higher prices for its goods or services in order to pay the interest, which may be set against profit for tax purposes. Not only does the loan carry a high rate of interest but, the new owner may even have a beneficial interest in the lending organisation.Some private owners will state they have never done all of the above and, in any case, it is all within the law. So, it is shrieking out for the law to be changed so that this series of steps is thwarted.Barry NorthCobham, Surrey• George Monbiot (Comment, 14 October) is right that the proposed EU-US free trade deal (TTIP) is a "threat to the state", but it is more of a threat to the ordinary citizen of Europe. Deftly identifying "legislative burden" with "administrative burden" and renaming both as "red tape", the EU commission has long attempted to remove regulations and standards, seeing both as a threat to competitiveness. Creating a free trade area with the much less regulated US would require a convergence of regulatory standards in both economic areas. In preparation for this, the push is now on to accelerate deregulation as TTIP approaches. Hence Cameron's 30 proposals "to move faster to reform the way Europe regulates" and the German government's pressure on the EU to postpone any reductions in CO2 emissions from cars until 2024, at which time it will probably have been scrapped anyway if TTIP is already in place. This is a real threat to labour rights and to environmental, health and food safety standards in Europe.Gus FaganOxford• The government expects us to celebrate the drop in unemployment (Report, 17 October), and then we find out these new part-time jobs are in fast-food industries like Kentucky Fried Chicken. Is that really what young graduates expected to be doing after years of study and a mountain of debt? What a grim outlook for them after being promised so much by politicians. Of course, they'll say that any job is good for a young person but would Cameron, Clegg and media commentators really be proud of their children working in KFC? Of course not, and they'll do anything to get their kids into jobs with money and prospects. I wish someone would confront them with this when they crow over their "achievements".Ann ThomasBristol
