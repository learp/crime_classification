Photograph: AlamyThere’s an unexpected calm and gentleness to Europa’s wild ride on the back of a bull in this beautifully coloured baroque painting. To understand it you have to know that the bull in this Greek myth is really Zeus, king of the Gods. Reni makes the story a Christian allegory of the power of the divine, with Europa looking reverently heavenward.• National Gallery, London.Image of the week      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Edward Burtynsky’s Phosphor Tailings Pond #1.
