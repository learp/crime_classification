In the fast-moving world of television, zombies are very much “last season”. Currently it’s demons that are capturing the imagination of TV showrunners. This year alone we’ve been treated to hyper-violent comic-book adaptation Preacher, about a half-angelic, half-demonic man of the cloth battling evil forces in the deep South, and supernatural series Outcast, in which a drifter and a pastor exorcise possessed folk in rural America.Both shows saw British actors in prominent roles (Dominic Cooper in Preacher, Philip Glenister in Outcast), but they were very much born in the USA, wrestling with those recurrent American themes of guns, god and free will. Now, though, comes a very British addition to the demon genre.E4’s comedy horror Crazyhead stars Cara Theobold – best known for playing Ivy the kitchen maid in Downton Abbey – as Amy, a bowling-alley attendant who can see murderous demons invisible to the rest of us. When she encounters Raquel (Susan Wokoma, last seen in council-estate comedy Chewing Gum), who shares her gift, the two team up to hunt down the demon hordes lurking in our streets. The result is a mix of supernatural saga and odd-couple comedy, like if Broad City’s Abby and Ilana were tasked with battling the forces of darkness.

Much like that show, about a group of young offenders handed supernatural gifts then disappointed to learn that with great power comes great responsibility, Crazyhead uses its high-concept premise as a Trojan horse for tackling down-to-earth themes.“The show came from that classic phrase, ‘battling your demons’”, says Overman. “Throughout history, the idea of people being possessed talks to something very deep within our psyche. So here we have two girls who are battling the demons of living their lives and dealing with love and friendship … but also battling real demons.”As with Misfits, Crazyhead approaches the supernatural with tongue firmly lodged in cheek. Much of the humour derives from what Overman calls the “straight-woman, funny-woman banter” between the gobby Raquel and the reserved Amy. And, like Overman’s earlier series, it has a gleefully rude streak. One notable scene sees Amy attempting to kill off a demon by – how to put this delicately? – relieving herself on its face. Yet for all the piss-taking, Overman’s treatment of fantastical subject matter has always been affectionate. He sees the supernatural genre as the perfect avenue to explore issues pertinent to the young people likely to watch his shows.

If demons are the new zombies, and zombies are the new vampires, what might be the new demons? “I’m not sure yet. But it will emerge and everyone will pretend they knew it was going to be the next big thing, but the truth is, no one knows. My guess, though? Zombie mermaids.”Crazyhead starts on E4 on Wednesday at 9pm.
