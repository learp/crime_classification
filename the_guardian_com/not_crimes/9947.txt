“The Grepon has disappeared. Of course, there are stillsome rocks standing there, but as a climb no longerexists. Now that it has been done by two women alone,no self-respecting man can undertake it.”– ETIENNE BRUHL, 1929When we climb aloneen cordée feminine,we are magicians of the Alps – we make the routes we followdisappear.Turn aroundto see the swooping absence of the face, the undone glaciers,crevasses closing in on themselveslike flowers at night.We’re reeling in the sky.The forest curls into a fist.The lake is no more permanent than frost. Where you made ways,we will unmake:give back the silence at the dawn of things.Beneath your feet,the groundretracts its hand.• From No Map Could Show Them by Helen Mort (Chatto, £10).
