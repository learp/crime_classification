Under the Sun – DiivEcstatic summer dreampop from the talented Zachary Cole Smith. Totally uplifting and inspiring, this is the best single of the summer. Guitar heaven. A hit in my world – I love it!    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest All Things Must Pass – George HarrisonThis song, alongside Isn’t It a Pity and Beware of Darkness, was just about all I could listen to while convalescing with my broken back this summer. True spiritual music from a deep soul – thank you George.

Intense and beautiful.
