Their banking practices led to the creation of a middle class, making them unimaginably wealthy.”Spotnitz said the family used that wealth to challenge traditional thinking as arguably the greatest patrons of the arts of their age, commissioning work from Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. He added that the Medicis ushered in a new era of revolutionary art and science such as the world had never seen. It is a powerful story that resonates even now.”A second series has already been commissioned from Italy’s Lux Vide and Britain’s Big Light Productions, with the first to air in Italy at the end of the year.
