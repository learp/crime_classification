Cruise lines are among the travel industry’s worst polluters, notorious for dumping insufficiently treated sewage into oceans or producing as much soot as 1m cars per day.Now, cruise companies are seeking to offset that tainted image by offering “voluntourism” experiences. Passengers onboard Carnival Cruises’ Fathom line, for example, can expect to tan by the pool in the morning, build water filters in the Dominican Republic in the afternoon, then dance on the ship’s deck at night.How environmentally friendly is your cruise holiday? Other cruise lines have been offering these kinds of excursions on luxury voyages since 2011, but Fathom, which launched in May 2016, is the first to center its weeklong journeys entirely around volunteer work. The company offers “impact travel” exclusively to the Dominican Republic for now. In coordination with local nonprofits, Fathom passengers sort cocoa beans in a chocolate factory or tutor schoolchildren in English in the Puerto Plata region of the DR. There are educational, environmental and economic development excursions, all of which have received strong reviews.Yet, so far, it’s proven somewhat of a tough sell.“I wish I could say they were selling out, but they’re not,” said Heidi Allison, an executive at trip booking site Cruise Compete. “It’s been a rough struggle. People aren’t used to mixing their vacations with volunteering. We’ve had more sales recently, but the prices are so inexpensive… that means they can’t get people on them.”With its 700-passenger vessel sailing at well below capacity, Fathom has been forced to discount their trips from an initial starting price of $1,540 down to low as $199. And, while the company would prefer to focus on its positive statistics – like the 16,000 seeds its passengers have planted in a Dominican reforestation nursery, or the 730 water filters to benefit local families who don’t have access to clean drinking water – the question remains whether these projects are sustainable.Impact travel has received increased scrutiny in recent years as some voluntourism groups have been exposed lying about the profits they make on goodwill trips. Many organizations have been criticized for favoring exotic or uplifting experiences over actual work.International development experts also bemoan the amount of money spent transporting unskilled Westerners to poor countries, when that financing could make a stronger impact as a donation.These types of concerns made Julian Hatfield and Christine Williams initially hesitant to try Fathom. They both have a background in development work and co-author a travel blog, Don’t Forget To Move, that highlights responsible tourism options that respect local communities and the environment.“Tourist companies can really screw this up,” Hatfield said. “It just depends on how they go about it: what local partners they have on the ground and how they prioritize the needs of the community over the comfort level and experience of the volunteers.”Ultimately, the couple came away impressed by Fathom’s organizational partners, which convinced them the local community isn’t dependent on continued assistance, and therefore won’t regress if Fathom stops coming. There was a social impact that heartened the couple as well.“It was really moving to see how people reacted to witnessing the way these people lived, or to interacting with these children,” Hatfield said. “I think that has a huge impact on somebody who lives in the Western world.”As to the misallocated resources, Williams said: “People would have a greater impact if they came to the community and volunteered for a year, or if they donated $10,000 so [the local nonprofits] could hire somebody. But the fact is people want their cruise ship. They want to have that vacation. They want to be in the community and experience it firsthand.”Carnival Cruises, Fathom’s parent company, has marketed the trip to church groups, millennials and progressive-minded baby boomers interested in doing something other than donating to a good cause. Upon its launch, Fathom predicted that 40% of its passengers would be first-time cruisers. But many in their target demographic would rather seek adventure on their own, not aboard a luxury cruiseliner with a heavy carbon footprint.Murky waters: the hidden environmental impacts of your cruise Although Fathom scored an A in sewage treatment in the 2016 Cruise Ship Report Card by the environmentalist group Friends of the Earth, Carnival’s philanthropy line earned F grades in transparency and air pollution reduction. “It’s a good thing to volunteer on your vacation – that’s a wonderful thing to promote,” said Marcie Keever, the report’s author. “But cruise companies really need to do more to protect the places they travel to and improve their footprint around the world.”This comes in the wake of several Carnival incidents in the past few years, including a 2013 engine room fire that left more than 4,000 passengers and crewmembers stranded in the Gulf of Mexico, some without power or bathroom facilities. That and other mishaps followed the catastrophic 2012 Costa Concordia shipwreck that resulted in 32 deaths near the Italian coastline.“Maybe people are still getting over some of the bad publicity,” said Sevil Sönmez, a hospitality and tourism professor at the University of Central Florida. “The tourism industry is very interesting. Negative things happen – natural disasters, terrorism – and the activity dips, but in time it recovers.”Fathom is committed to sail through to 2017, but has started cutting back on its impact journeys to the Dominican Republic in favor of its more popular cultural exchange trip to Cuba. According to Fathom president Tara Russell, starting in November, the cruise line’s sister brands also began offering volunteer excursions when docked in the DR. Much like its competitors – Royal Caribbean and Crystal Cruises – Carnival’s other brands now promote voluntourism experiences along with their centerpiece luxury voyage events. “It takes time to build a market for an entirely new category of travel,” Russell said. “[This] appeals to people who love to travel, but also like the idea of making a difference. It’s not for the hardcore adventurer that goes to climb Mount Everest. It’s for someone who is looking for a way to bring authentic, impactful experiences into their daily life in a very accessible way.”
