“I don’t want to get my hopes up,” the singer Adele said in 2015 – just ahead of the release of her latest album, 25. “You can’t make assumptions. This new one could sell 100,000.”She need not have worried. Her third studio album has outsold any other in the UK for the second year running, it was announced on Friday.More than 13 months after its release, 25 has passed the 3 million sales mark in Britain, giving it a place on the Official Charts Company’s 30 bestselling UK albums of all time. The album has also sold more than 10 million copies in the US.Coldplay’s A Head Full of Dreams, which was also released last year, was the year’s second bestseller. The group’s seventh LP reached number one in February – achieving the same lofty chart heights as its six predecessors, which date back to Parachutes in 2000.
