Former Apple CEO John Sculley has revealed that he thinks Steve Jobs would have been mostly impressed with Danny Boyle’s Oscar-tipped new biopic.iSorry: Aaron Sorkin apologises to Apple's Tim Cook over Steve Jobs biopic The film, called Steve Jobs, stars Michael Fassbender as the Apple guru and Jeff Daniels as Sculley. Sculley met with the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin to discuss details of his relationship with Jobs and the inside track on Apple’s history.“[Sorkin’s] a brilliant screenwriter,” Sculley said. “While [the dialogue] may not have been the exact words that were spoken, it represented the kind of dialogue that said ‘yes, that’s that person’.”Steve Jobs’s widow 'begged' DiCaprio and Bale not to take biopic role Sculley was also impressed with his portrayal by Jeff Daniels. “I couldn’t believe how ... he actually captured how I was feeling going through some of the most intense scenes,” he said.But while he thinks Jobs would have been a big fan of the finished product, it wouldn’t be a universal rave.“I think Steve would see a lot of things about this film that he would like: first of all, it’s a perfectionist product,” he said. “Everything about it: the acting, the directing, the screenplay. But, I also think [he] would be a little bit hurt because many people who never knew the young Steve Jobs could go away from this movie and think, ‘well I know Steve Jobs.’ Well guess what? You don’t. Because that is not the complete Steve Jobs.”The film has angered Apple’s current CEO Tim Cook, who has branded the film “opportunistic”, and reports suggest that Jobs’s widow tried to “kill” the movie and begged Leonardo DiCaprio and Christian Bale not to take on the role.Steve Jobs is being tipped for Oscar success after a set of rave reviews from the festival circuit, with Michael Fassbender and co-stars Kate Winslet and Seth Rogen all praised for their performances.
