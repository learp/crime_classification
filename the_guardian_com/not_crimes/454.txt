I don’t know about you but when I think of the 1920s, I always think of The Great Gatsby with its large decadent parties, and when I first opened Wild Lily by Kathy Peyton, that’s what I thought I’d get – only set in England rather than Long Island.However, whilst the novel might start off detailing the life of a slightly spoilt rich kid called Antony Sylvester (hello, his father bought him a plane for his seventeenth birthday), it ends somewhat tragically.Wild Lily tells the story of Antony, a wayward boy who has grown up with everything and who has absolutely no idea what he wants to do with his life; through the eyes of Lily Gabriel. At thirteen, Lily is hopelessly in love with Antony and she will do anything for him, including falling out of the sky. From his daredevil behaviour to his scheme to host a wild party – to which he invites his disabled sister, Helena, to ride on a boat to the grotto in the family estate’s extensive grounds – Antony appears to be a hedonistic, spoilt child, who for those who have watched (or read) The Great Gatsby, may epitomise everything the 1920s was about.However, the novel is much darker than that and when his sister drowns at the party which Antony gave in her honour (without his father’s permission – he was in South America), Antony’s life begins a downward spiral which ends with Antony in a wheelchair, without the vitality that made him so enigmatic at the start of the novel.What begins as a light–hearted novel about his social life and adrenalin–junky pursuits ends as a tale about growing up without a mother; how having only an absent father affects Antony. Told through anybody else’s eyes, the tale might be a mocking one about the excesses of the rich and privileged, but through the eyes of the ever–watchful and caring Lily, it is a cautionary tale, about the great sacrifices that come with having such a gilded life. Whilst some authors might have chosen to end the tale with a bang, Peyton chose to simply let it peter out; like Antony’s life after his sister dies. Perhaps this is why the novel is as beautiful as a wild lily – because despite the excesses of Antony’s existence, the emotions of the characters are real and whilst at times they might be devastating, they are at least relatable for every human being.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
