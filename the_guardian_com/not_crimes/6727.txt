Jamie Lloyd, 35, is in the front rank of theatre directors. His productions at London’s Trafalgar Studios include Richard III with Martin Freeman, Macbeth with James McAvoy, and Harold Pinter’s The Homecoming with Gemma Chan. This month he opens Jean Genet’s The Maids with Zawe Ashton, Laura Carmichael and Orange Is the New Black star Uzo Aduba. In April he directs Game of Thrones’s Kit Harington in Doctor Faustus in the West End. Lloyd lives in Hastings with his wife and two young sons. He is vegan and teetotal.Genet’s 1947 play tells the story of two maids who fantasise about killing their mistress. Why revive it? It’s a play that chimes with our times – two people who are oppressed and repressed finding a voice. It feels like there are people all over the world discovering the need to be heard. The play also gives three powerhouse actresses a chance to get their teeth into roles that are messy, unconventional, by turns horrendous and unpleasant, witty and emotionally charged. There’s an energy of anticipation created when an audience is waiting to see some of the greatest actors around up close Was it a deliberate decision to cast black actors as the maids? Honestly, it was about casting two brilliant actresses who happened to be black. I wanted to work with Zawe again after directing her in Salome for Headlong Theatre. Then, watching Orange Is the New Black, I was struck by Uzo’s rich and soulful performance. I said to my wife, “I’ve got to work with that woman.” Of course, once you [cast non-white actors] in The Maids, it becomes a play not just about class, but about race. We have embraced the fact that Uzo is American and set the play in present-day America.How easy was it to get the double Emmy award-winner Aduba? Very, actually. A lot of those actresses [in OITNB] started off in theatre and use their time off between seasons to go back to their roots. It was always a dream of Uzo’s to perform in the West End. The language of the new adaptation is pretty ripe. We are seeing people in crisis, so they are not going to be polite. I think other translations have skirted around that.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It must have made a change for Laura Carmichael, who plays the maids’ mistress, after Downton Abbey…She leapt at the chance.Is it a calculated policy to cast well-known but credible screen stars in offbeat plays? There’s an energy of anticipation created when an audience is waiting to see some of the greatest actors around up close and personal in a studio theatre in very challenging roles. Inevitably these actors attract people to the theatre who don’t go to as a habit.On my radar: Jamie Lloyd You cast working-class male actors in The Homecoming, and are now staging an all-female, mostly non-white play. Do you feel obliged to redress imbalances in the entertainment industry? I do, actually. I think it’s our job as directors to take note of the discussions being had at the moment, in terms of diversity, and also to understand that if you want a more diverse audience, that has to be reflected on the stage in terms of stories and casting.How did your forthcoming Faustus with Kit Harington come about? He wanted to do a play. And again, the seductive power of introducing his particular following to a Marlowe play is a thrilling prospect. He’s a great guy, very humble and interested. Also he was named [though he shortens Christopher to Kit] after Christopher Marlowe.• The Maids is at the Trafalgar Studios, London from 23 February until 21 May. Doctor Faustus runs at the Duke of York’s, London from 9 April to 4 June
