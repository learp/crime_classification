The BBC has indicated it will cut the number of hours it will devote on its main TV channels to Glastonbury, this year featuring Adele, Coldplay and Muse.It said on Monday it would devote more than 25 hours of coverage across BBC2, BBC4 and on BBC1’s Friday evening magazine show, The One Show.It means viewers will have about five hours less to watch than in the previous two years, when the BBC put 30 hours of music across its four TV channels, from BBC1 to BBC4. Its youth-orientated channel BBC3 has since been closed as a TV channel and is now online only.The BBC later said the amount of TV airtime being devoted to the event was still being finalised. It said its coverage will also be available online and on interactive TV via the red button, as well as on BBC radio.Coverage will include live streams from six key music stages with a presenting lineup including Jo Whiley, Mark Radcliffe, Lauren Laverne, Steve Lamacq, Greg James, and Radio 2 DJ and new Top Gear presenter, Chris Evans.Announcing its plans on Monday, the corporation said the new BBC Music app would give users “access to more Glastonbury than ever before, allowing them to personalise their journey according to their personal preferences”.Michael Eavis urges Glastonbury fans to use their vote on Europe The four-day festival, which will also feature PJ Harvey and Jeff Lynne’s ELO, begins on 22 June. BBC2 will play host to the headliners on the main Pyramid stage, broadcasting Muse, Adele and Coldplay’s sets in full.Bob Shennan, the controller of Radio 2 and 6 Music, who is also the director of BBC Music, said: “Glastonbury promises to be a magical weekend especially this year with so many homegrown performers including Jeff Lynne, Adele, Muse and Coldplay. “If you can’t make it to Worthy Farm, BBC Music will bring you the cream of the festival, whether you’re at home or on the move.”.Last year, just under 19 million people saw some of the BBC’s coverage, with an audience of 1.8 million tuning in to Lionel Richie’s Sunday afternoon legends slot which will this year be filled by Lynne’s return as ELO. BBC4 will feature acts including Foals, New Order, PJ Harvey and Earth, Wind and Fire. The BBC will also broadcast more than 60 hours of content across its various radio stations.
