It’s Sunday afternoon on a bright spring day, and the foyer of the Lyric Belfast is stuffed with prams and families. In the main house, Cahoots NI’s production of Nivelli’s War, a stirring tale of wartime friendship and survival, has just finished. The studio is about to put on Replay’s Woofle, a daftly enjoyable performance with silly songs made by Dan Leith about his relationship with his much-loved dog. In the foyer, Children’s Books Ireland is holding a book clinic and there is face painting and workshops. Two toddlers dance together in the hubbub.This is what every theatre in the country should look like on a Sunday afternoon. Parenthood can leave even the most ardent theatregoers feeling unwelcome as theatres seldom court families, often seeing prams and young children as a burden not a blessing. Too often theatres present themselves as grownup spaces, cut off from everyday life, adding to the perception that theatre takes place in sanctified cathedrals and is not for everyone, only those who are already believers.

They already belong to us whatever our age, and can be conducive to play. If you fling open your doors and let people in regularly, regardless of their age, they will see the place as somewhere they feel welcome. Who knows, maybe after spending some time playing or taking part in a workshop in the foyer, some of those families might eventually venture into the auditorium. Making your own art and seeing art are intimately connected.Sadly, the Lyric isn’t like this every Sunday. But it is during Belfast’s brilliant annual Young at Art festival, which takes place all over the city. The over-sevens have been on a street-art walking tour in the Cathedral Quarter, meeting the artists and getting a chance to take part. Meanwhile, down at Mac, eight sessions of Baby Rave for parents and their children have sold out so quickly that mums and dads are telling fibs at the box office in the hope of being let in. Later in the day I’m at Mac watching Bob theatre’s Nosferatu, a cunning mix of comedy and horror, which explored the creative possibilities of tabletop theatre long before Forced Entertainment embarked on Table Top Shakespeare. There is a mix of locally made and international work in the festival: essential because artists need to know what is being made elsewhere in the world.Over the weekend I caught a number of works in progress, including a scratch opera about a grapefruit with an identity crisis and Oona Doherty’s stunning Hard to Be Soft, a dance-theatre piece that sings with the sounds of Belfast and is full of questions about gender and the representation of women as mothers. Belfast’s theatre ecology has been hit by funding cuts, but it refuses to lie down. Umbrella organisations such as Theatre NI are canny at finding ways to support not just Northern Ireland’s world-class performing arts organisations, but also the new and emerging. What’s interesting is how much of that emerging work is focused on children and young people. This is after all the city that in 2015 organised the world’s first Baby Day.It’s an encouraging sign, because a theatre culture that values the importance of creating work for children and young people is one that is looking to the future.
