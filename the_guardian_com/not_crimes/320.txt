In a recent article in the Guardian Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, suggests that engaging with fossil fuel companies is a more constructive strategy than divesting from them.Wellcome Trust rejects Guardian's calls to divest from fossil fuels Farrar explains that if after engaging with these companies, they do not “meet their environmental responsibilities” and “support a transition to a low carbon economy” then Wellcome would be prepared to divest. But what are Wellcome’s investment criteria and would any of the top 200 fossil fuel companies meet them?The “environmental responsibility” of fossil fuel companies is simple: they must commit to leaving 80% of their coal, oil and gas in the ground. To date, not a single company on the top 200 list has made such a commitment. In fact, the vast majority are going full speed in the opposite direction.When it comes to the fate of the planet, “trust me, Shell is secretly a good guy” is not going to cut it. Over the last decade, fossil fuel companies have expanded dangerous, extreme energy extraction, opening up huge new carbon bombs like the Canadian tar sands. In the meantime, they have spent millions blocking clean energy legislation and defeating politicians who support climate action. Not exactly the “impact” Farrar was hoping for, we assume.Shareholder engagement can – and does – work well to convince companies to pay their staff a living wage or to convince Starbucks to use recycled paper in their coffee cups. But it is not going to convince Starbucks to stop selling coffee – and it is certainly not going to convince Shell to leave their oil in the ground.Wellcome suggest that divestment from a list of companies based on their reserve size is not an effective way to proceed and that we should rather look at their approach to climate issues. Mr Farrar writes: We consider individual companies on their merits, including the extent to which they meet their environmental responsibilities, when we decide whether or not to invest or stay invested.Keep it in the Ground petitionThis is exactly the point, however. For major fossil fuel companies the “environmental responsibility” that really matters is whether they are willing to keep it in the ground or not. The rest is just window dressing. Packaging your cigarettes in a green container does not make them any less lethal. We know that Wellcome invests in fossil fuel companies that have expressly committed and restated their current business models and continue to explore for more fossil fuels. Shell for example have made it quite clear that they have no intention to leave their reserves in the ground. On the contrary, they are leading the charge for Arctic drilling now that the ice is melting. Yet, Wellcome continues to invest in Shell. It is unclear what institutional investors such as the Wellcome Trust are using their access to the boardroom for. Mr Farrar suggests that some fossil fuel companies are playing an important role in the low-carbon transition by investing “heavily in natural gas and carbon capture and storage”, neither of which are solutions to keeping global warming below 2C.While there is a short-term role for natural gas, this role must be kept short and must not distract from the implementation of real solutions in the form of renewables. Natural gas remains a significant contributor to climate change and half of the existing gas reserves are unburnable according to recent research by University College London.Even if carbon capture and storage was deployed under a best-case scenario, it would only extend the carbon budget by 12-14% and therefore have little effect.Mr Farrar also argues that fossil fuels in low and middle-income countries drive growth and therefore public health. This ignores the fact that climate change will hit the poorest and most vulnerable people hardest. It also does not account for the health externalities of fossil fuels that in fact hamper growth. The International Monetary Fund estimates that air pollution costs China 4% of its GDP for instance.Finally, Wellcome argues that fossil fuels will remain a part of the energy mix for years to come. Divestment campaigners are not arguing for an immediate end to all fossil fuel use. However, to keep the vast majority of fossil fuels in the ground, we need public investors like the Wellcome Trust to show leadership and take a stance. Instead of funding fossil fuels, public investors like Wellcome should drive a just transition to a low-carbon economyTim Ratcliffe is the European divestment campaigner at 350.org
