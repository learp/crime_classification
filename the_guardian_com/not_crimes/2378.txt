Ben Frost – SecantI first heard Ben Frost when I was in Mexico – we were both playing at Festival Mute. I was really impressed by his work and am still impressed by this whole record, Aurora – especially this piece. In a way this song is noise, but it has extremely interesting structures and sounds. And that’s why I like it.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Arca – FaggotMy next three picks are all records I have around at the moment and listen to because they are new; it is different to Ben Frost, in that he is something I discovered myself. I like Arca, he’s an interesting artist. He worked with Kanye West on Yeezus and with Björk, too. What he does is very strange.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Swans – Miracles of LoveSwans are a group I have known for quite a while and I just like them. My favourite album was To Be Kind, but this album … I just got it and listened to it. I really liked Miracles of Love; I like strange things, and this is very unusual.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Laibach – Eat Liver!Laibach are also a totally strange group. I like Eat Liver! because on the one side it’s such a Balkan expression, of being furious, but it is so funny at the same time. I like their kind of very sinister humour. Datenverarbeiter v Jaki Liebezeit – OperaI chose this track because whatever Jaki Liebezeit [of Can] does, I find extremely interesting. I am always fascinated by how he turns a very minimal structure into a very complex groove. He is one of the greatest drummers ever. His minimalism at the same time is so complex; his rhythms fascinate me.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Irmin Schmidt’s Electro Violet, a 12 CD box set, is out now.
