Hinds – Leave Me Alone (Lucky Number)Why you should listen: The Spanish four-piece – officially renamed Hinds since starting out as Deers – translate the clattering joy of their live show into this energetic debut of warm guitar-pop.It might not be for you if… You don’t think the world needs a continental European version of Best Coast.What we said: “They have bags of tunes – opener Garden is loaded with 60s soul hooks, for instance – and bags of charm, adopting the clatter of C86 but updating it with a riotous rush of freewheeling, girl-gang energy,” wrote Tim Jonze, in the Guardian.

RIP Starman. What we said: “It’s a rich, deep and strange album that feels like Bowie moving restlessly forward, his eyes fixed ahead: the position in which he’s always made his greatest music,” wrote Alexis Petridis in his lead Guardian review.Score: 4/5Pusha T – King Push: Darkest Before Dawn – the Prelude (Good Music/Def Jam)Why you should listen: Formerly one-half of the Clipse, Pusha T – or King Push, as he calls himself – straddles the worlds of braggadocio crack-rap and political commentary on this followup to 2013’s My Name Is My Name.It might not be for you if… You, like so many Guardian commenters below the line, aren’t entirely sure that rap is music.What we said: “Darkest Before Dawn – The Prelude sees Pusha T continue in the verbose, matter-of-fact style that he’s honed since his days as one half of Clipse, but this time – amid the tales of slinging and spending – he’s built his own personal fifth column,” wrote Lanre Bakare in the Guardian.Score: 4/5Cage the Elephant – Tell Me I’m Pretty (RCA)Why you should listen: The Kentucky band’s gutsy riffs have been given the Dan Auerbach production treatment, sanded down with a rough, 1960s garage-rock edge but maintaining their punch. It might not be for you if… You’re not dead set on hearing Dan Auerbach make another band sound like Black Keys.What we said: “There are Stonesy and Kinksy riffs and classic themes about worried parents, ruckuses, self-doubt and at least one visit to the doctor ‘cause I don’t feel right’,”wrote Dave Simpson in the Guardian.Score: 4/5Stacey Kent – Tenderly (OKEH)Why you should listen: Jazz singer Kent’s breathy voice leads the listener through a beautiful selection of reimagined classic American songs, in collaboration with Brazilian guitarist and composer Roberto Menescal.It might not be for you if… You don’t tend to gravitate towards jazz singing with this smooth and light a touch.What we said: “Deceptively simple, meticulously presented, each of the 12 tracks is a little gem,” wrote Dave Gelly in the Observer.Score: 4/5Last week also saw the release of new albums by folk-pop band Villagers and Fight Song-famous pop singer Rachel Platten.
