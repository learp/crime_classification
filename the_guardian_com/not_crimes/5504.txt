The Mystery of the Clockwork Sparrow by Katherine Woodfine is a wonderful and exiting book. A girl named Sophie is recruited to work in a new department store called Sinclairs. She is very exited but all the other girls that work there think she is useless and generally funny to laugh at. Then one cold night Sophie forgets something at the store and has to go back, leaving her cosy apartment behind. She gets what she was looking for and comes out. Then a nasty boy from the store comes up to her and won’t let her past.Suddenly Mr Sinclair’s assistant comes out and Sophie slips away. Then a strange person comes, takes the clockwork sparrow as well as shooting the nasty boy! Everyone now thinks that Sophie shot him because she was witnessed with him.I love this exiting book because it is full of mystery and astonishing cliffhangers. The way the book is written and all of the things that happen in the book are really fantastic. Katherine Woodfine is an awesome writer and an amazing storyteller. I love the whole atmosphere about it too because the book is set in a shopping plaza and then a crime happens in a place where beauty is nurtured. The plot and perspective is exceptional and everything about it is great. I hope you read this book and like it as much as I have done. • Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
