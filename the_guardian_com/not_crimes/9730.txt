Brooker has promised an even more shocking vision of the future than before.“Usually if something is so horrendous that people are staggering away, I’m kind of like, ‘Yay! Mission accomplished!’” he said to Indiewire. “We always want to elicit a response. Not all our episodes are just sort of bleak fests and the like. We’ve got a little bit more variety this time around. But certainly we want a response from the viewer.”Black Mirror premieres on Netflix on 21 October.
