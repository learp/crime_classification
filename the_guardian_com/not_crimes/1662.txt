This book is based on events that took place during the second world war and the experiences of the author’s father during the war.Bamse, the main character, lives in Denmark with his family. The story follows Bamse and his family throughout their terrible fight for freedom when the Germans invade Denmark. This emotional yet humorous story tells of a daring escape and the differences – even the smallest ones – that people can make.Our group’s favourite character was Marie, the mother, due to her optimism and ability to get her family out of many sticky situations with her excellent improvisation and acting skills. We all agreed that the characters felt very real to us, even though the story was set a long time ago and in a different country.We had lots of favourite moments, including humorous, tense and sad ones. Marquell thought that the cow dung taxi was really funny and Daniel liked a particularly intense and sad moment in which Tomas sacrificed himself to the Germans; so the rest of the group would not be captured.Most of The Lightening Readers really enjoyed this book. We felt lots of different emotions whilst reading it and some of the group felt gripped by the story all the way through. Those that weren’t too keen on the book commented that the foreign words, for example place names, made it difficult to follow. They also felt that it may have been a little long for them.The Lightening Readers would recommend this book to ages 10+ and award it 3 stars.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
