Barry Gibb has cancelled his tour of Australia and New Zealand, including his Monday-night headline slot at the Byron Bay Bluesfest.Touring company Live Nation said the former Bee Gee’s tour, set for next April, would not go ahead “due to a change in international commitments”.Stayin’ Alive by Bee Gees – embracing a very un-Australian anthem Live Nation also said it was “currently not possible” to reschedule the performances, so full refunds would be available to ticket holders for the shows.However, Gibb’s cancellation will come as a massive blow to Bluesfest, which recently also lost Friday night headliner Neil Young.Gibb, who found fame in the 1970s alongside his brothers Maurice and Robin in the Bee Gees, is the last surviving member of the band.He recently released In The Now, his first solo album in 32 years, written with his sons Stephen and Ashley, and he appeared on stage with Coldplay at this year’s Glastonbury music festival.Barry Gibb: In the Now review – fine continuation of the Bee Gee legacy Bluesfest is offering a refund for Byron Bay patrons who bought single days tickets for the Monday, from today until seven days after the new artist announcement for Easter Monday has been made.Tickets bought for Gibb’s solo shows will be refunded in full to all credit and debit card holders and Ticketek will be in touch to all those who bought tickets to advise how to process their refund.
