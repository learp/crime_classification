Dear Lindsay Lohan,Glad to hear that you’re coming to Kettering to turn on the Christmas lights. It was a very good idea by Kettering’s MP Philip Hollobone. There’s a lot of discussion surrounding the consequences of Brexit and Britain’s future at the moment: a lot of people are focusing on the economy, others on the rise in hate crimes, but Philip Hollobone is the only person to go into the Houses of Parliament during this crucial time in our country’s history and raise the important issue of a celebrity slagging off Kettering on Twitter. I’m proud to have him as my home town’s MP.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Kettering MP criticises Lindsay Lohan’s ‘offensive’ tweetHere are some things you should check out when you visit Kettering:Wicksteed Park: One of the country’s first theme parks. It recently got a log flume and is also home to the Pinfari rollercoaster. I used to work there so drop my name if you want discounts on Rollover hot dogs.Manor House Museum: This is where you can see ALL of Kettering’s past. There is a mummified cat there that they found in a wall, a mammoth bone and the boots that were worn on the first trip up Everest. If it wasn’t for Kettering no one would have ever climbed Everest.Kettering Town FC: The old ground is shut now but Kettering now share a football ground with Burton Park Wanderers. You can go and sing football chants in the stands. I can teach you a special football chant if you like, only for hardcore Kettering fans.The Weetabix Factory: Technically in Burton Latimer but you can’t visit Kettering without marvelling at the hub of modern-day breakfast cereal. I’m sure you have eaten Weetabix in the past and in Burton Latimer you can smell it always, no matter where you are.Boughton House: England’s Versailles. I hope you like landscaped gardens and water features because that’s what you get when you visit Boughton House, Lindsay Lohan. Be sure to check out Orpheus. It’s a big old spiral that leads to a pond. I love it.So there you are, Lindsay Lohan, my top tips for things to do in Kettering. I’m very sorry that Kettering upset you by voting Leave but as you can see they are blessed with an MP who is steering them safely through these uncharted waters and tackling the big issues first. Kettering has absolutely nothing to fear whatsoever.Yours, James AcasterIn 2014, James Acaster created the comedy-documentary series Sweet Home Ketteringa, in which he returned to Kettering to explore some of his old haunts and find out how much the town had missed him in the intervening years. The answer was: not much, they didn’t know who he was. The trip sparked a desire to explore Lahnstein: the twin town of Kettering and a place he had visited 15 years ago, as part of the volunteer fire brigade.
