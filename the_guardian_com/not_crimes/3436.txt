The natural world is being consistently degraded as a result of the pursuit of economic growth at any cost.While trillions of dollars are pumped into the financial system which powers this destruction, only a tiny trickle of money is directed towards the conservation and rehabilitation of our natural resources.This week a group of cross-sector experts from the worlds of business, finance, foundations, NGOs and institutions have been brought together by the Rockefeller Foundation and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the largest global environmental network, to come up with solutions for how to encourage the financial markets to become champions of nature.Join the experts for a live chatJoin us on Thursday 31 July from 12-1pm BST when we bring together a panel of experts taking part in the meeting in Bellagio to take your questions and discuss issues, including:• Given the vast need for conservation investing, what are the top barriers in channeling more impact money into conservation?• What initiatives are underway to develop vehicles for private sector investment in natural capital and how can these be scaled up?• How is it possible to create a return on funds invested in conservation work?• With a massive transfer of wealth from baby boomers to millennials, how can these wealthy individuals be encouraged to invest their funds in alignment with their values?On the panelFred Boltz, managing director of ecosystems at the Rockefeller Foundation.John Tobin, managing director and global head of sustainability at Credit Suisse.Charlotte Kaiser, director of innovative finance at the Nature Conservancy.Andrew Bovarnick, global head of the green commodities programme at the UNDP.Valerie Hickey, biodiversity specialist and practice manager of the World Bank's environment and natural resources global practice.Frank Hawkins, chief executive officer of the US office of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.Helen Crowley, conservation and ecosystem services specialist at luxury goods company Kering.Ricardo Bayon, co-founder of EKO Asset Management Partners, which manages a fund that invests in carbon credits and provides advice on a variety of other markets for ecosystem services.How to joinThe live chat is completely text based and will take place on this page in the comments section below, kicking off on Thursday 31 July, from 12pm (BST).
