Michael Jackson topped an annual list of the top-earning dead celebrities on Wednesday for the fourth straight year, far outstripping fellow musical icons Prince and David Bowie who passed away earlier this year. Jackson, who died in 2009, raked in a bumper $825m in earnings for the 12 months ending 1 October, according to estimates from Forbes. That came mostly from the Jackson estate’s $750m sale of the late singer’s remaining stake in the Sony/ATV music publishing catalog – which includes the rights to many Beatles songs – to Sony Corporation.Get rich or try dying – how musicians’ estates are the biggest earners in pop  Sales of Prince albums soared after the musician died of an accidental drug overdose in April.
