Greenhouse gas emissions from shipping should be counted in the UK's carbon targets, the government's chief climate change advisers have urged, because they will imperil efforts to control global warming if left to rise unchecked.Including emissions from shipping is controversial, however – shipping and aviation were purposely omitted from the United Nations negotiations on emissions reduction, because of the difficulty of apportioning them to particular countries.Changing the rules on the UK´s targets could mean Britain must cut its overall emissions at a faster rate than other countries, and will mean that other sectors – including road transport, agriculture and industry – have to cut their carbon by more than envisaged, to make up for the increase in emissions when shipping is taken into account.The call for a rule change came from the Committee on Climate Change, the statutory body set up under the Climate Change Act to advise the government on how to meet the UK's 2050 target of an 80% cut in emissions, compared with 1990 levels.The body – which some Conservative MPs wanted to axe – can only advise, but its advice is influential. This year, David Cameron was forced to face down opposition from some of his own party and sections of industry, in committing the UK to the stiff carbon budgets for the 2020s recommended by the CCC.David Kennedy, chief executive of the committee, said: "It is clear that shipping emissions could well be significant, and so cannot be ignored – they should be included under the Climate Change Act. It is also clear that there is scope to reduce emissions, which would reduce costs of inclusion. In order to ensure this, the government should proactively support development of new policies aimed at encouraging investment in cleaner shipping technologies and more efficient operational practices."According to CCC research published on Thursday morning, the UK's share of international shipping is likely to account for about 11% of the total carbon budget permitted under the Climate Change Act by 2050, representing about 18 megatonnes of carbon dioxide out of a total budget of 160 megatonnes, if the UK is to meet its government-set targets.This would mean that emissions from other sections of the economy would have to be reduced, to compensate. That is likely to be unpopular with some sections of business, and there is likely to be a fierce battle over the CCC proposals, which MPs must decide on by the end of next year.But the CCC insisted that there were many ways in which the shipping industry could be helped to reduce its greenhouse gas output. For instance, upgrades to engines and propulsion systems will improve efficiency, and new technology used to coat hulls can reduce fiction and cut fuel consumption. Ships can also be encouraged to travel more slowly, which would save fuel, while modern software can calculate more efficient routes, especially when combined with more accurate weather forecasts. Biofuels could also be used, though these are controversial.Some of the more novel technologies suggested by the CCC include a form of return to the age of sail, using kites or new forms of sail to harness the winds.One option to encourage the uptake of these technologies would be to include shipping in the European Union's emissions trading scheme, in the same way that international aviation is to be included from next year. However, that option has been put on hold by the European commission at present, in part because of the difficulties of pushing through the inclusion of aviation. The US, China and other governments are threatening a trade war with the EU over the issue, arguing that forcing airlines to buy carbon permits for what they emit amounts to a tax and is therefore illegal under international law.Environmental groups say that continuing to exclude aviation and shipping emissions from international consideration makes a mockery of efforts to stave off climate change.Another difficulty still to be resolved is accurately assessing emissions from shipping. The CCC suggested that including shipping in carbon targets could be put off until "progress has been made on a methodology to accurately reflect international shipping emissions." The shipping industry has been promising to cooperate on such an assessment for years, and to introduce voluntary initiatives to cut carbon, but to date these have had little effect.
