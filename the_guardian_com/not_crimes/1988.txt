Ryan McNaught was in his mid-30s when he sheepishly asked his mother if she had kept the Lego bricks he’d loved as a child.“Yes,” she responded, as though it wasn’t even a question. Don’t all good mothers keep their children’s toys for decades?It was 2008 and McNaught had just returned from a trip to the US, where he’d seen some epic Lego constructions in a shop window. They’d left him in awe and with a burning desire to have a go himself.Lego’s plastic wheelchair guy is a seismic shift in a toy box | Rebecca Atkinson Soon enough, the Melbourne man’s Lego collection had been dragged from the dark corner of a shed and he was labouring away on this and that, just as he had done as a boy.Since then McNaught’s constructions have grown in their sophistication and size. He’s now one of just 14 people in the world deemed a Lego grand master.As the only certified Lego professional in the southern hemisphere, he loves the fact that the toy company contracts him to build the kind of shopfront displays that reignited his love for the little plastic bricks.And when he’s not working for Lego, he’s playing with it anyway.

They include Michelangelo’s statue of David and King Kong atop the Empire State Building.McNaught and his team have even managed to perfectly capture the cylindrical profile of the Leaning Tower of Pisa from the straight-edged rectangular bricks.“We’ve been very busy. This whole exhibition is about 5,000 man hours, which is a very long time,” McNaught says.DC Comics in Lego: Batman, Robin and Superman hit Bondi – in pictures A reverent tone enters his voice when he describes the challenge of building Japan’s famed Himeji Castle, with its intricate and complex tiered rooflines. “It’s got some crazy angles on it. It was really, really difficult and I worked on that for the best part of six or seven weeks.”But he’s reluctant to call it his favourite. “Oh, that’s a hard one. It’s like trying to pick your favourite child.”He chuckles too about the street cred his job as a Lego wiz has bought him in the playground when he collects his twin boys from primary school.“Whenever I do school pickups, it’s like, ‘Hey, Mr Lego!’” he says. “And I have been dragged to show-and-tell quite a number of times.” • The Wonders of the World exhibition opens on Wednesday at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre, and runs until 14 December, before heading to Sydney, Melbourne and Perth
