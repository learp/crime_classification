I am moving house next month into my first flat by myself. (Fingers crossed: you never know until the keys are in your hand, etc.) But I really want all my bills - including phone, broadband, electricity, gas etc - to be ethical and ecologically sound. Is there a quick fix: a one-stop shop that provides all of these services? Or do I need to shop around? Also, any other tips in setting up an ethical and eco-friendly house would be appreciated.I have been researching effective recycling bins, window sill compost etc. Any help is really appreciated.Ed, by emailYou're right: moving home does provide a golden chance to interrogate the merits of each utility provider and then go with the one you feel best meets your own "ethical and ecological" criteria.I don't know of a "one-stop shop" that provides all these services. But, even if there was one, I would still want to do my own homework first before deciding. Don't take what you read on a leaflet or company website at face value: greenwashing is rife in the utilities industry. Put some hard questions to someone in customer services first, or seek advice from an independent organisation, such as Ethical Consumer or Which?.This column is an experiment in crowd-sourcing a reader's question, so please let us know your views, advice and experiences below (as opposed to emailing them). What utility companies have best answered your questions? How have you tried to 'green up' your own home?I will join in with some of my own thoughts and reactions as the debate progresses. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate too.â€¢ Please send your own environment question to ask.leo.and.lucy@guardian.co.uk.Or, alternatively, message me on Twitter @LeoHickman
