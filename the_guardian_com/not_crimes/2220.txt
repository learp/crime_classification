What does it take to run a marathon in under three hours? As someone painfully close to that target, I’d love to know a definitive answer. However, in the absence of a rock solid guaranteed-method, running-tech firm Strava has provided some interesting data about the training habits of runners. Looking at runs by 4,000 London marathoners last year in the 12 weeks leading up to last year’s race, it found some interesting trends. The bands analysed are pretty broad – there is a huge difference between a 3hrs 5mins runner and a 3hrs 55mins runner – but still follow rough patterns and highlight a few important points for all marathon-runners. Average mileage per week in that periodSub-3 runners: 42 miles a week over seven runs3-4 hour runners: 27 miles over four runs4-5 hours: 18 miles over three runs5 + hours: 14 miles over two runsPeak weeksSub-3 runners: four weeks before marathon, average 52 miles. 5+hour marathon finishers, six weeks before, average 20 milesDistance and frequencyUnsurprisingly, the faster the finisher, the more miles they put in, and the more runs they do. The average time spent running per week was:Sub 3-hour finishers: 5hs and 22mins3-4 hour finishers: 3hrs 51mins4-5 hour finishers: 3hrs 5- hour plus: 2hs 30minsThe interesting thing to note is how much more effort, relatively speaking, the long run in training will be for runners in the 5-plus group than those at the “sharper” end.This is one of the reasons many training plans will peak at something like 18 miles. Many people may consider that not very far in comparison with the 26.2 you have to do on the day, but in terms of recovery and in relation to the rest of that notional person’s weekly run, it represents a huge leap. Long runs v short runsAcross all finishing times, the breakdown of short runs versus long runs was very similar.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Long runs v short runs.

Mileage still remains pretty high until the last week, in fact. Sub-3 marathoners: 4 weeks prior to race: 51 miles (peak week)3 weeks prior: 49 miles (but more than eight runs)2 weeks prior: 36 milesMarathon week: 17 milesTotal distancesIn the 12 weeks leading up to the event, Strava runners collectively clocked up a total distance of more than 1,265,489 miles in the course of 181,797 hours running.
