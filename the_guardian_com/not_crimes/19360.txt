Exhibition of the weekRefugees: The Lives of OthersThis exhibition looks at German artistic émigrés to Britain – from Frank Auerbach, who came to Britain as a child to escape the Holocaust that killed both his parents, to the expressionist painter Ludwig Meidner, who fled Hitler as a mature and well-known artist. Eva Frankfurther, who has a parallel show until 18 June, came as a child, studied alongside Auerbach and painted immigrant communities in London’s postwar East End.• Ben Uri Gallery and Museum, London, until 4 JuneAlso showingConstable and McTaggartJohn Constable’s Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows (1831), lent by Tate, and William McTaggart’s The Storm (1890) are tumultuous masterpieces of English and Scottish landscape painting linked by their sense of nature’s power.• Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, until 25 March 2018Liber StudiorumLast few weeks to see JMW Turner’s series of landscape prints that map his vision of art in the town where he fell in love.• Turner Contemporary, Margate, until 7 MayPainting a CenturyModern British painters including Sandra Blow, Merlyn Evans and Victor Pasmore, shown alongside sculpture by their peers and contemporaries.• New Art Centre, Salisbury, until 30 AprilHouse StyleSee how the other half dress in this exhibition of aristocratic fashion in one of Britain’s most spectacular stately homes.• Chatsworth House, Bakewell, until 22 OctoberMasterpiece of the week      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Portrait of a Man (Léal Souvenir), 1432. Photograph: Print Collector/Getty ImagesPortrait of a Man (‘Léal Souvenir’), 1432, by Jan van EyckThis painting insists on its own power to preserve memory and record truth. The words Léal Souvenir – loyal remembrance – are engraved into a stone parapet, as they might be on a tombstone, under the lifelike portrait of an unknown young man. He must surely have died, and this is a memorial to him – or was he a merchant setting out on a voyage who wanted to be remembered exactly like this by friends and loved ones? Van Eyck has written the exact day on which the portrait was made: “Done in the year of Our Lord 1432 on the 10th day of October by Jan van Eyck.” Painting of this mirror-like accuracy was a new invention, a new technology. Van Eyck offers it as a way to preserve what otherwise will slip away. • National Gallery, LondonImage of the week      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Louis Vuitton’s latest artist collaboration, Masters With Jeff Koons. Photograph: Louis VuittonJeff Koons announced his latest artworks this week – a series of bags for Louis Vuitton emblazoned with old masters’ names and paintings. As I said in a comment piece: “Koons is sharing the art he most loves. The power of Rubens, the sensuality of Titian and the naughty painterly pastries of Fragonard clearly fascinate him, and he wants other people to see what he sees. This is not simply a line of luxury bags. It is an artist’s meditation on the masters, in handbag form. Picasso copied and reworked great paintings in his later years. Koons is offering a different kind of art lesson, and it is a joy.”What we learned this weekGraham MacIndoe told us about his best shot, of Quentin Crisp in his New York apartment – and about his heroin addiction and imprisonmentGillian Wearing will become the first woman to create a statue for Parliament Square, with suffragist Millicent Fawcett honouredA major Jasper Johns retrospective is coming to the Royal AcademyTania Bruguera has moved into theatre directing, with a production of Samuel Beckett’s Endgame – she discusses how it helps dismantle powerThe Observer’s Laura Cumming had mixed feelings about Tate Britain’s Queer British Art exhibitionOliver Wainwright explored the designs for Trump’s border wall with MexicoHe also spoke to the designer behind sous vide food to be cooked in washing machinesThe National Portrait Gallery has acquired Tracey Emin’s Death MaskNosheen Iqbal met Ekin Onat, the Turkish artist taking on ErdoğanA new exhibition of Eric Gill’s works asks: how far should an artist’s life affect our judgment of their work?A new book, Pics Or It Didn’t Happen, reclaims Instagram’s censored artWe showed off your photos on the theme of diversityShia LaBeouf’s latest art stunt is staying alone in a Lapland cabin for a weekOne of Henry Moore’s earliest works has gone back on display – a wooden honour roll for his schoolGet involvedOur A-Z of Readers’ Art series continues – please submit your artworks on the theme of S Is for Spray Paint.
