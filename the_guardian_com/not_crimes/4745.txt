Leslie Jones knows who she’s gonna call for her next red carpet dress: Christian Siriano.Last month, the pair struck up a partnership on Twitter after Jones lamented that no designers had offered to dress her for the Hollywood premiere of Ghostbusters.“It’s so funny how there are no designers wanting to help me with a premiere dress for movie. Hmmm that will change and I remember everything,” Jones tweeted.Siriano, a Project Runway winner and a fan of Jones, responded with a waving hand emoji to offer up himself for the job. Jones’s enthusiastic reply was simply: “YAAAAAASSSSSS.”At the premiere, the Ghostbusters star walked down the green and black carpet in a bright red, off-the-shoulder gown created by Siriano.

Congrats aren't in order, a change is.June 29, 2016The Paul Feig-directed film experienced its own fair share of criticism, both for the gender swap and for Jones’s character.Jones, who played Patty Tolan, a city train worker, is the only non-scientist in the new, all-female Ghostbusters. Some said her street-smart character was a racial stereotype, though Jones disagreed.Ghostbusters review: call off the trolls – Paul Feig's female reboot is a blast “Why even look at it like that? Back in the day, when I was coming up, the last page of Jet magazine was a guide to all the times black people were going to be on TV, because we were hardly on TV and we needed to see and support our people when we were,” Jones said in an interview with the Guardian. “So my thing is, my parents and grandparents would have been, ‘Woah! She is in a Big Movie! A superhero in a BLOCKbuster.’ Why wouldn’t you be dancing in the street?”Jones said she thought her character represented “the people” and that she was the best fit for the role.On Twitter, Jones seemed to respond to the controversy through her retweets of fans sharing their support after the premiere.“Those jerk designers feel dumb today!” one woman wrote, complete with a Beyoncé gif.
