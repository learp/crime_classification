Simon Cowell has returned to The X Factor’s original judges Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh in a bid to reverse a five-year ratings slump on the ITV show.Walsh and Osbourne, who starred in the first series of The X Factor in 2004, will return alongside Cowell and fourth judge Nicole Scherzinger, another former judge who appeared in 2012 and 2013.The new series will also feature the original presenter, Dermot O’Leary, who was replaced last year by Olly Murs and Caroline Flack in a wholesale revamp of the show that also saw Radio 1’s Nick Grimshaw and Rita Ora join the judging lineup.Rita Ora quits X Factor after one season But they failed to halt the show’s declining ratings, which last year ended with just 8.4 million viewers, its lowest in a decade and less than half the 17.2 million who saw Ben Cardle win in 2010.Osbourne, who recently announced her split from rock star husband Ozzy, appeared on the panel between 2004 and 2007 before returning in 2013.Walsh sat on the judging panel for 12 series before a break last year and said he cannot wait to return.Walsh said: “He’d say otherwise but I knew Simon missed me last year! I’m delighted to be back on the panel, especially beside my two favourite female judges Sharon and Nicole, and I’m looking forward to taking them all back to Dublin this year when we head there for auditions.”Kevin Lygo, who succeeded Peter Fincham as ITV’s director of television at the beginning of this year, said: “Simon, Sharon, Louis and Nicole – they’re a formidable judging panel by anyone’s standards. “With Dermot hosting and the return of the audition rooms, there’s a lot to look forward to this series, as we welcome back one of our biggest entertainment brands.”Osbourne said the thing she is most looking forward to is meeting Cowell’s baby son Eric.She said:” I’m overjoyed about going back to The X Factor, sitting with Lou, gorgeous Nicole and naughty Simon. But most of all, I can’t wait to meet baby Eric.”Former Pussycat Doll Scherzinger said: “I can’t wait to be back in the UK and on the show with the best judges sitting alongside me on the panel. I’m excited about discovering, mentoring and winning with an exciting new act this year. And having had winning contestants in the past, Simon knows I will do it.”The show’s biggest success was in finding One Direction, who appeared in the 2010 series (but didn’t win it). But in recent years critics have said the talent pool appears to have dried up.The show is now regularly beaten by BBC1’s Strictly Come Dancing, and ITV’s decision to buy the format to The Voice, previously on BBC1, even led to suggestions that The X Factor could be dropped altogether.But Cowell remains one of ITV’s biggest stars, and is also responsible for its other big Saturday night hit, Britain’s Got Talent. This year the judges’ auditions will begin on 20 June at Leicester City’s King Power Stadium, but the series will also mark the return of the smaller audition rooms.Talking about the new series, Cowell warned: “Be careful what you wish for!” Both he, and ITV, will be wishing for better fortune in the ratings with a new lineup that is heavy on nostalgia but whose biggest challenge will be to find an another One Direction – or anything like it.
