Daniel Craig has lent weight to theories he will return to the role of James Bond, following a year of intense speculation.Speaking at the New Yorker festival over the weekend, Craig, 48, told the audience: “I’ve got the best job in the world doing Bond. The things I get to do on a Bond movie and the type of work it is, there’s no other job like it.”His enthusiasm is in contrast to the sentiments expressed shortly after shooting ended on the most recent instalment. Asked then whether he would like to return to the part, Craig declared that he would “rather slash my wrists”. By contrast, Craig declared to the crowd in Manhattan: “I love this job. I get a massive kick out of it. And if I can keep getting a kick out of it, I will.”His words chime with those of Bond executive producer Callum McDougall, who told the BBC recently that franchise chiefs Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson were hoping for the return of the actor, who was “absolutely the first choice”. But Craig denied that he had been offered $150m for two movie instalments – a report already widely debunked. “There’s no conversation going on,” he said when questioned about the figure, “everybody’s just a bit tired.”
