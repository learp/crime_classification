The Imaginary is a story about a girl called Amanda who finds an imaginary boy called Rudger and they become best friends. Everything is fine until the mysterious Mr Bunting arrives at their door claiming to have seen Rudger, when the only person able to see the imaginary boy is Amanda. Rudger finds out that Mr Bunting wants to kill him to gain an extra year of life! What I like best about the books is the moment when a child starts to forget about their ‘Imaginary’, their Imaginary is brought to the library overnight to meet up with other homeless Imaginaries and find a new home. When reading Imaginary, I found it was scary at parts but the story shows a real friendship between a girl and her imagination.I would say the recommended reading age is 8 years old and above.
