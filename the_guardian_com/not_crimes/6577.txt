Your body is a temple under siege from advertisers lobbing promises of a smoother, leaner, healthier, less-likely-to-die-tomorrow you. But while you can go to town when touting a life-changing pair of trainers – or an unachievable vision for the future of a country – strict rules govern the advertising of pharmaceuticals. Go too far and there’s blowback from the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), as Reckitt Benckiser, the firm that makes Nurofen, found out this week.Nurofen TV ad banned over painkilling claims in landmark ruling Joint/backYou sell bananas and you want to sell more bananas, so you market a range of bananas: porridge bananas, sport bananas, travel bananas, pretend-gun bananas. Whack up the prices while you’re at it. That’s basically what Reckitt Benckiser has done by selling “targeted” painkillers for different ailments: period pain, migraines and headaches. This week, the ASA banned an ad for Nurofen Joint and Back because, despite appearances, the pills in the range have no specific targeting powers.FaceYou can’t advertise prescription-only drugs, as the deals website Groupon found to its cost in 2012 when the ASA banned an ad for Botox. The voucher for a “choice of facial injection treatments” at Bath Facial Aesthetics could have been used for non-prescription treatments including fillers, but tightened rules for online marketing led to a ruling that the ad implicitly referred to Botox. Groupon said it took the decision “very seriously”.StomachMore than 200 people complained to the ASA about a TV and YouTube ad for slimming pills. In the 20-second spot, two healthy young women, preparing for a holiday, exchange selfies and recommendations for XLS Medical slimming pills. They end the ad on a beach, looking basically the same. The authority ruled in February that the ad “presented an irresponsible approach to body image and confidence”. Last year, the ASA cleared a controversial “beach body ready” ad for Protein World. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, is trying to pull it from tube carriages.Nose/sinusesPrince Charles got a heavily diluted telling-off in 2009 when a Duchy Originals promotion email was found to breach guidelines by promising that a herbal tincture could treat a range of ills including colds. The company accepted the ruling and said it would take measures to stop such claims being made again.HairAustralian bowling legend Shane Warne threw his image behind a 2006 ad for hair-loss treatment only to be caught out for unwittingly breaking rules on celebrity endorsements for medicines. The ad for the Advanced Hair Studio showed the cricketer above the lines: “Advanced Hair, Yeah, Yeah!”, and the phrase: “Warnie, Warnie, Warnie.” The use of the medicine minoxidil in the laser treatment concerned the ASA, which had previously ruled that the “So where the bloody hell are you?” campaign by the Australian Tourist Board did not breach decency rules.Ovaries“For women who are trying for a baby, zinc contributes to normal fertility and reproduction ...” claimed an ad for Vitabiotics’ Pregnacare Conception vitamin pills. But two people pointed out that the assertions in the ad were not backed up by the EU register of nutrition and health claims for food supplements. Vitabiotics argued the toss, but the ASA requested the ad be pulled in its current form.
