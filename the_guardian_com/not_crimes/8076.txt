Now that winter is here, garden writing veers from celebrations of autumn to gloom and doom – all that talk of “battening down the hatches” and “tucking in the garden”. Yet there’s still much to do and enjoy. Whenever Christopher Lloyd, the great plantsman of Great Dixter garden and former Guardian columnist, was asked his favourite time of year in the garden, he would always reply, “Now.” So forget hibernating until spring: dress for the weather and get out into your garden or allotment. Here’s what you can get up to.Plant a potPerrone’s law of winter gardening runs like this – the amount of care you are likely to lavish on a plant is in direct proportion to its distance from your back door. So don’t hide winter-flowering treasures such as witch hazel (hamamelis), wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox), winter honeysuckle (Lonicera purpusii) and winter cherry (Prunus ‘Autumnalis’) away at the back of the garden: if they are planted in pots, bring them close to doors, windows and pathways so you can enjoy the colour and scent: if they are planted in the ground, cut generous armfuls of stems to display in vases indoors.

Winter bedding such as violas, pansies and Cyclamen persicum can offer a jolt of colour, but they are more susceptible to winter wet and cold, so put them in the most sheltered spot possible, such as a windowbox or in an unheated porch. Consider too that they only last a season: perennials may be more expensive initially, but will go on and on, especially if planted out in spring.Rug upWorking in the garden is so much more pleasant if you can keep warm long enough to get a few jobs done. I love my Dickies Redhawk overalls; no draughts can whistle up your back, and you can either wear thermals underneath or an extra layer on top. The key is keeping extremities warm: wear silk glove liners (£15 from Genus) under ordinary gardening gloves so you can still tie a length of twine and prune your apple and pear trees (another job that can be done this month: if you don’t know where to start, YouTube is a rich source of video guides). Keep your feet toasty with a pair of Wiggly Wigglers’ mohair goat socks (from £12.50).Watch the weatherAmid all modern life’s mess of screens and charger cables, you may feel as if a weather station is just another gadget, but it’s vital for gardeners to see whether temperature and humidity are rising or falling. Get a weather station with a couple of showerproof remote sensors and you can monitor conditions in different locations, keeping you abreast of conditions from indoors. Oregon Scientific has a good range: choose one with Bluetooth and you can connect it to an app on your phone. If you want something more involved, weather stations with a rain gauge and wind sensor start from around £100. For a budget option, maximum and minimum thermometers start from £11.95 at thermometerspecialist.co.uk. When a freeze is coming, add extra protection to vulnerable plants (try Harrod Horticultural’s fleece plant jackets, £11.95).Help wildlifeResist the urge to tidy up. I’m itching to cut back the unruly ivy in my garden, but I’m holding back until spring, because right now it’s providing valuable thick cover for wildlife: its flowers and berries are valuable winter food sources, too. Many creatures will be sheltering in leaf litter and the hollow stems of dead perennials. Hedgehogs should be hibernating in drifts of dead leaves and log piles, so avoid strimming or burning leaf piles. They may still venture out on mild evenings at this time of year: leave dog or cat food, or mealworms, out as an extra food source.

If you don’t have a pond, a water- and pebble-filled upturned dustbin lid dug in so it’s flush with the ground makes a fine watering hole for ground dwellers and birds alike. If you have spare bricks, rockery stones or rubble, pile them up into a mini cairn: toads and newts will use this as a place to spend the winter. Toads and hedgehogs may hole up in compost heaps, too, so take care if you are turning or emptying yours.Clear leaves from paths and patios where they’re a slippery hazard, and mow up leaves smothering grass on the lawn on a dry day. They can be bagged up and tucked away in a corner to turn into leaf mould, or gradually layered into compost heaps between nitrogen-rich green plant material. But let them pile up in flowerbeds, where they’ll form a weed-suppressing, soil-enhancing mulch. Just push leaves away from the crowns of silver-leaved plants such as artemisia and lambs’ ears so air can circulate.Finally, have a clearout in the shed, but take care – many beneficial insects such as lacewings, ladybirds and butterflies such as the peacock and small tortoiseshell may be treating your shed like a giant insect hotel, hibernating in nooks and crannies; don’t turf them out. If you want to do even more to help insects, treat yourself to a bug hotel for Christmas (wildlifeworld.co.uk has a good selection). Alternatively, make your own super-simple, thrifty bug houses by bundling up bamboo canes and placing inside a terracotta or plastic pipe; leave them in a sheltered part of the garden.
