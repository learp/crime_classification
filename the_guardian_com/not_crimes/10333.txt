My husband, Roy Foster, who has died aged 86, had already retired twice when he embarked on building a three-manual pipe organ for Holy Rood Catholic church in Oxford.From 2002, with fellow organ-builder Derrick Carrington, Roy combed Britain in pursuit of redundant organs, 22 in all, for parts. They found the right console in the living room of a house in Newcastle, previously the home of a retired GP. Throughout, Roy worked for love, with Derrick also putting in many voluntary hours. The organ parts were bartered, with remaining costs met from legacies to the church. Redundant mahogany pews in the gallery went to make the casing and the result is an organ with a 21st-century action, but which looks contemporary with the 1960 Grade II-listed octagonal building. Clive Driskill-Smith, then sub-organist at Christ Church, Oxford, gave the inaugural recital in April 2012.Roy was the youngest of the three children of Albie Foster and his wife, Lily (nee Porter). Albie had a maintenance and decorating business in Southgate, north London. The second world war disrupted Roy’s education and, for a time when Lily was an air raid warden, he was evacuated to Yorkshire.He left Southgate County grammar school at 15, briefly working for his father before going in search of work. Offered a job as an “organ-tuner’s boy”, he caught what he called the “disease” – his love of organs. So with Hill, Norman & Beard, one of Britain’s foremost organ builders, he graduated to a five-year apprenticeship as an organ builder, then undertook national service in the RAF.Now married to Daphne Goldsmith, whom he had met at a folk dance, and on return from a 14-month posting to Iraq, he got a job with NP Manders, another top organ builder, but could not support his wife and two young daughters, Jennifer and Susan, on his wages. He therefore spent the next 30 years with US companies, 3M and Xerox, in sales, marketing and training, latterly introducing early machines used in mammography.Roy had a strong Christian faith and volunteered to work with homeless people, on community church projects and in the revived Christian healing ministry at St Marylebone, London, where I worked in a counselling team with him and Daphne. Offered early retirement, Roy and Daphne made their plans, but she became ill and died in 1992.Roy retrained as a couple counsellor. I had also been widowed and we met up again, marrying in 1997 and moving to Oxford where Roy worked for Relate. Diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2003, he decided to retire “properly”, while working on the organ project for two or three days a week.Camping, walking, folk dancing had been passions since his youth, and continued into his 80s. When dancing became too strenuous, he took up yoga.Roy is survived by me, Jennifer and Susan, five grandchildren and his brother, Eric.
