Environmentalists will appeal against a federal court ruling giving the go-ahead to a mine in Tasmania's controversial Tarkine region.Save the Tarkine has filed the appeal in an attempt to stop Venture Minerals's Riley Creek iron ore project.Last month the group lost a challenge to the former federal environment minister Mark Butler's approval of the mine.It said the cumulative impact on threatened species such as the Tasmanian devil was not taken into account when considering three mines planned by Venture Minerals in the area."We remain of the view that the approval of this mine was unlawful," Save the Tarkine's Scott Jordan said on Friday.Tasmaniaâ€™s resources minister, Paul Harriss, called the action a last-minute attack on jobs."This is a disgraceful move driven by ideological opposition to any mining in a region that has seen industrial activity for more than 100 years," Harriss said.The commonwealth and Venture Minerals are reportedly seeking costs from Save the Tarkine, also known as the Tarkine National Coalition, of up to $200,000.The Tarkine is home to the last wild devils free of the deadly facial-tumour disease that has killed 80% of the species.Much of the region was recommended as a national heritage area but only a small section has been listed.The Tasmanian government has put the value of the Riley Creek project to the state's economy at $40m.
