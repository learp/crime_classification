Ah, late September is here. Furious networking, and reams of spin. Powerful males, scurrying from place to place – barely a female face in sight. It sounds like I’m discussing conference season, but of course I’m not. Late September is spider season, and invariably inches of column-space are given over to reports of their venomous bites, their enormous (and growing) size, and tips on how to get rid of them.You probably know that September is a time for spiders for one of three reasons. Maybe you’ve recently seen a four-inch spider run across your lounge floor or you’ve walked face-first into a thick, silky spiderweb at head height across your door. You’ve also probably seen someone on Facebook or Twitter post a picture of a monstrous long-legged spider that can only have crawled from the depths of Beelzebub’s belly-button.Let me be clear about something before we go any further. I am not a spider hugger. In fact, I am mildly phobic about spiders; an affliction that has come courtesy of a chance encounter, when I was five, with a house spider that ran up my T-shirt while I was wiping my bottom. (It’s ironic that seeing spiders now loosens my bowels.) I can’t pick house spiders up, though I can bravely coax a pint glass over them. I try to hold back the terror in front of my young family. I try to control my fear. I try to remain rational.As many readers may know, the spiders we see at this time of year running along the carpet are male house spiders (Tegenaria). They have a special pair of appendages that look a little like fangs (and are inevitably reported as such), but they’re actually a pair of special penis-like organs called palps. As well as being able to pump sperm into willing females, male house spiders can also use their palps to carefully “taste” for female scents on specially spun threads she leaves around the house (erm, your house) for him to follow.Male spiders are often quite active throughout the year, but when you turn on the heating at the end of summer everything changes. Your house is a spider’s world and by messing with the temperature you essentially became its god. He thinks it’s spring, and it was your fault. Your thermostat has given the spider a little hormonal flush. He’s horny. (You made a spider horny. Congratulations.)Far from being terrorisers of humanity, house spiders are by and large quite helpful. They eat a host of small and potentially troublesome invertebrates. Though no one can be truly sure how scared of us house spiders are, they certainly are scared of some things. For instance, I recently discovered to my shock that the daddy longlegs (spider), another house dweller, quietly ambushes house spiders and kills them in the dark of night. Are house spiders really something that we should get so freaked out about?If I sound like a spider hugger, like I said, I’m not. But I do think we need to suppress the impulse to yell “KILL IT WITH FIRE!” and to post endless pictures of the monsters found in the bath and under the bed. (Metro, I’m talking to you. The Daily Star, I’m talking to you. The Daily Mail, you too). After all, the spiders we see at this time of year are mainly house spiders. We need to take spider scare stories with a pinch of salt, instead of burning down our houses or shutting schools through unnecessary fear, which is what has happened in the past, and is quite likely to happen again.Though it sounds remarkably improbable, we may have to accept that nature occasionally has the audacity to encroach fleetingly into our lives. Crazy, I know! We may have to accept that, no matter how hard we try, we can’t sterilise every single aspect of our lives from spiders.And it was you who messed around with the thermostat, remember? It was you who hoovered up all of the female’s silken sexual messages, leaving the horny males running around completely lost. It was you who bought a house that accidentally doubles up as an ultra-comfortable cave for house (formerly cave) spiders.The spiders were around for millions of years before us, and they’ll certainly outlast our particular ape dynasty. Learn to love them, I say. Just from a distance if you must.
