Lockwood & Co: The Whispering Skull by Jonathan StroudReview by Liana This book is about sword-fighting, arguments and ghouls. This book has got it all. A mysterious grave has appeared and it’s causing trouble. Lockwood & Co have got to seal it! Join in on the adventure to find the murderer and the victim. Not only that! They are invited to the Fittes’ party!I liked this book because it has action with annoyance all mixed up! It gave me the spooks. This book is for energetic, curious and bold people, from 8-10 years.Bad Girls, by Jacqueline WilsonReview by AbbyThis book is about a girl called Mandy who gets bullied loads. Then she meets this really cool girl, Tanya, who is an awesome friend to her. Tanya also helps stop the bullying.I really like this book because it shows you that you can be brave and be your own person – nothing can stop you.I recommend this book for girls aged 9 to 10. Six stars.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by JK RowlingReview by AmelieHarry Potter and his best friends Hermione and Ron are about to start their third year at Hogwarts School. But when Harry gets to Hogwarts he finds out that a murderer has escaped from Azkaban. So the Ministry Guards of Azkaban must guard the school.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I liked it when Hermione was stupid. The book was very funny when Harry’s godfather kept talking weird and a witch predicted Harry would die! I have read some other books by J.K. Rowling like The Tales of Beedle the Bard and all the other Harry Potter books.I would recommend this book to someone who likes witches and wizards. My star rating would be ten out of ten!Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
