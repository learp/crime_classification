The charred shell of Clandon Park, still reeking of the blaze that gutted it last April, will be partly restored to its early 18th-century grandeur in a project costing “many tens of millions”, Helen Ghosh, director of the National Trust, has announced.The fate of the Surrey mansion has sparked controversy, with suggestions from Lord Onslow, whose ancestors built it in 1720 and generations later donated it to the National Trust to preserve it, that the building should be left as a romantic ruin and the money spent on more worthy concerns.Clandon Park House gutted by fire – in pictures However, Ghosh said that although his opinion had been considered, it was based on a misunderstanding: “If we did not rebuild and restore it in some shape or form, we would not get the insurance money,” she said.Standing on the cracked white floor slabs in the roofless, double-height Marble Hall, once one of the most celebrated rooms in England, Ghosh said that despite the apparent devastation, all of the room’s important furnishings and hundreds of fragments of the ornate plasterwork had been recovered. The two towering fireplaces, the work of the 18th-century sculptor John Michael Rysbrack, have survived almost unmarked.The hall, along with the grand suite of ground floor rooms built by a family closely involved in politics for centuries to entertain aristocratic and royal guests, could and would be faithfully restored.

Others were eerily partly untouched, including the Speakers’ Parlour, which held the portraits of three Onslows who served as Speakers of the House of Commons – all saved by being cut from their frames as the fire ripped through the house – which still has some 18th-century wallpaper and a pair of crimson velvet curtains still hanging from a blackened window.Although 80% of the contents were destroyed, curator Sophie Chessum, who knew every inch of the building from working on the inventory and guidebook, said many, including the 20th-century books in the library, would not be regarded as museum objects.The full scale of the destruction is still unknown: archaeologists are still working through the rubble, and objects being recovered. A pair of gigantic side tables from the hall, their marble tops shattered but complete, were only delicately extracted from the ruins last week.

It was given a gentle wash, but otherwise needed no conservation work.The fire, believed to have been caused by an electrical fault, broke out in the basement in the late afternoon of 29 April 2015, was initially believed to be minor and controllable. It spread with devastating speed, fanned by high winds and swept through previously unknown voids in the building which acted as chimneys, until the flames gushing from the roof were visible from miles away.As staff and volunteers gathered to help 80 firefighters battling to contain the blaze and recover as many contents as possible, priority was given to the objects regarded as most significant: most were recovered, including a painting by William Hogarth and his father-in-law James Thornhill saved from the library, the great state bed with its magnificent hangings which were older than the house itself, silver from the Speakers’ Parlour including pieces by one of the most famous makers, Paul Storr, chandeliers and carpets, gilt side tables from the state bedroom, and mementoes of generations who lived or worked in the house including a screen of Victorian and Edwardian Onslow family photographs and a silver christening mug, and the board of 18th-century rules for the servants’ hall.Since then thousands more objects, including hundreds of crates of plaster, carved wood, and ornate metalwork have been recovered. The conservation staff giving them an initial clean are working in head-to-toe protective suits as the objects are coated in toxic oxidised lead from the roof.One of the most serious losses – suspected though not yet confirmed, unless they still lie under a heap of uncleared rubble – was a magnificent set of Mortlake tapestries that lined the walls of one sumptuous room.

However, the more altered and less important upper floors will be given a modern treatment, and will become exhibition and event spaces. The years will be turned back even further in the gardens, recreating the 17th-century garden which already existed when Lord Onslow replaced his family’s Tudor mansion with something more modishly up to date.An exhibition on the fire and the conservation work is planned for next summer, but the restoration work will take years. The insurance will not cover the full cost, and a major public appeal is likely once architects and designers are appointed.“We are setting out a very exciting future for Clandon,” Ghosh said.
