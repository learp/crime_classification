The Walking Dead only leaves clues: towns and structures stand empty and ruined, marked by traces of the atrocities that happened there. Fear the Walking Dead leaves fire: Los Angeles ablaze, fighter jets dropping bombs to no avail. It’s awesome, in the classic, apocalyptic sense of the word.Strand and the extended Clark-Manawa-Salazar clan think they’ve found some safety on the Abigail, Strand’s luxury liner complete with food, a desalinization system, bourbon in crystal decanters, and bedsheets straight out of Beverly Hills. Strand sets course for San Diego, to look for refuge at the military base there, and though there’s some skepticism, nobody comes up with an alternative. If Strand is the Skipper of this three-hour cruise, with a millionaire and movie star on board, who’s Gilligan? Maybe Strand plays both parts.‘Just let me do this, please’As the boat heads to sea, everyone takes a job. Nick is Strand’s consigliere, and seems especially fit for the new world – at least by Strand’s standard of fearlessly chasing highs despite the risk of an overdose. When Chris decides to take a dip, Nick dives after him, shoes, old man clothes and all. Hector takes up fishing, and scores an eel. Travis assumes the role of team worrywart. Chris mopes and mumbles Smiths lyrics. Ofelia lurks somewhere off camera. Alicia, also looking for something to do, searches the radio and finds only bad news – the coast guard can’t help anyone – until she’s seduced by a David Bowie song and a mystery. The voice says it belongs to a man named Jack, and that he, his brother and sister-in-law are on a sinking ship. Jack lures her into his confidence, and tricks the oblivious Alicia into telling him all about their haven.And of course she doesn’t realize this is dangerous, which is partly what’s so frustrating about Fear the Walking Dead. We’re well versed in what the dangers of this world from watching The Walking Dead 1.0 – we know all about the cruelty and hijinks of desperate people in the new world order. Alicia doesn’t know hard lessons about trust. Chris doesn’t know that the first loss is the hardest. Madison doesn’t know that they can’t save every refugee at sea. I don’t know how not to feel frustrated and annoyed that these characters learn so slowly.Chris is the worst, though, all temper tantrums and teen ennui. It’s no surprise that he doesn’t listen to his father’s explanation about why he killed his mother, nor that the teenager lashes out. Luckily, Madison and Hector are there to talk sense, but Chris just goes swimming and puts everyone in danger.‘You can sleep. We won’t throw you overboard’No one trusts Strand except Nick. Though Madison knows his story has checked out so far, she still has a nagging feeling that he’s up to no good. Hector, always the mercenary, also reports that he’s been watching him and wondering what the man hides.Nor does Strand trust anyone, even to the point of refusing sleep. Perhaps the only clear thing about Strand is his code of self-preservation: he’ll do what he wants, and anyone who disagrees can swim back to the burning city. He’s clear about at least those intentions and what’s expected of his crew. It’s sort of hard to argue with that.‘It’s mob rule on land. What makes you think it’s better out here?’Of course the high seas are no safer than anywhere else, as the gang starts to realize when they find a ship peppered with bullet holes. Strand wants to get the hell out of there and away from the approaching craft, but Chris, stupidly, goes for his swim.The boat people are zombified, floating in the water and chomping for some brains. Our heroes face the two-pronged problem we so often see in both Walking Dead shows: the mortal dangers of the living and the dead. A third ship approaches and everyone braces for an altercation that could be their worst yet. At sea, there’s no way to escape.
