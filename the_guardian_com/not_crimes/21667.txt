The Hollywood director Oliver Stone has denied reports he planned a blockbuster film starring Sean Penn as the Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.Sean Penn on El Chapo interview: 'I have a terrible regret' Citing claims in a new documentary, the Daily Mail reported that Stone “orchestrated” Penn’s controversial meeting with the Sinaloa cartel leader, which led to the mobster’s arrest by Mexican authorities in January. The newspaper alleged the Oscar-winning film-maker was represented at the encounter by two Argentine movie producers, Fernando Sulichin and Jose Ibanez, with whom he has previously worked on films such as Alexander, South of the Border, Savages and the forthcoming Snowden.In a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, Stone said: “As the Daily Mail would know had it contacted me, the story is unfounded.”The Guardian reported in January that El Chapo may have been caught by Mexican marines because he hoped to make a biopic to rival Netflix’s hit show Narcos, about his Colombian counterpart Pablo Escobar. The TV documentary El Chapo and Sean Penn: Bungle in the Jungle alleges Stone was willing to pay $6m for the rights to the story.Penn, who wrote about his encounter with El Chapo in an article for Rolling Stone magazine, has repeatedly said he was in Mexico as a journalist and had no intention of pursuing a film featuring the drug lord. The Mexican actor Kate Del Castillo, best known for her portrayal of a cartel boss in the hit series La Reina del Sur (The Queen of the South), is said to have arranged the meeting between the pair.However, the documentary – which aired on 10 March on the US Reelz channel – claims Penn took no notes during their seven-hour encounter and that he was meeting with El Chapo to study his mannerisims and way of talking ahead of portraying him in the planned biopic.Sharon Waxman, editor-in-chief of Hollywood news site the Wrap, says in the documentary: “At the end of the day, he sat there with a fugitive drug lord for seven hours and didn’t interview him. They sat around and drank beers and ate tacos. The whole thing is very much through the looking glass.”Mexican authorities have said that Penn’s meeting with Guzmán helped lead them to the drug baron. The two-time Oscar-winning actor said in January that his biggest regret was having failed to start a conversation on the war on drugs via the interview.
