The elusive rock rat, last seen trying to get into a stockman's lunchbox in 1960, has been rediscovered in central Australia.One of Australia's rarest creatures, the critically endangered rat, which was not seen in the area for more than half a century, was found during a survey using remote sensor cameras on the Haasts Bluff Aboriginal land trust west of Alice Springs.Evidence was also found of the rare black-footed wallaby, which has not been seen in the area since 1991."The rock rat was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in the west MacDonnell ranges in 2002, but finding it in another area that isn't protected is huge news," Richard Brittingham, regional land management officer with the Central Land Council said."This species is obviously persisting in other areas outside of national parks, which is an important consideration in long-term conservation."He said Aboriginal lands had great conservation significance, and the find gives more meaning to Indigenous ranger programs which manage key threats, such as predation by feral cats and wildfires.Rangers had to access the site with a helicopter in gale-force winds, dashing out to set motion-sensor camera traps that they left in place for three months.But they weren't expecting to find anything.The shy little creatures were caught on camera, and rangers also found rat bones and fur in the scat of wild cats, which Brittingham said was a strong indicator of what lives in the area.Anangu Luritjiku rangers may have to look into setting poison baits for feral cats next year to cull their population and to protect native species.They will also survey other prospective sites for further populations of the rat.David Ross, director of the Central Land Council, said there were now more than 90 Indigenous rangers in 10 ranger groups in central Australia."Together they form an extremely skilled and valuable environmental workforce," he said in a statement.Brittingham said the discovery was a validation of their efforts."It's nice to find something for a change," he said.
