The latest research linking allergies and asthma to fast food is another important indication of the risk to child health posed by highly processed food (Fast food linked to surge in child asthma and allergies, 15 January).At the other end of the spectrum from unhealthy fast food, research in the Netherlands has shown that young children fed on organic dairy products, whose mothers also consume organic dairy products, had a 36% lower incidence of an increasingly common allergic condition, eczema.In addition, a meta-analysis of recent research published last year showed that organic dairy products contained significantly higher protein, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), and a significantly higher omega-3 to omega-6Â ratio than non-organic dairy products, all thought to be beneficial to human health.These benefits are now known to be linked to the high quantities of fresh and conserved grass eaten by cows reared under organic standards.Peter MelchettPolicy director, Soil Association
