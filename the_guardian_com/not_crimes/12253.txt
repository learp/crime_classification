8.58pm GMT20:58So that’s it for another week! Many thanks for keeping me company – I’ll be back next Wednesday for the final show in this series. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, so do come and say hello. Enjoy the rest of your week! HxFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.58pm GMT20:58And it’s GERI who wins the Star Baker apron – her tart was one of the best Paul has seen on Bake Off EVER. Praise indeed.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.57pm GMT20:57Time for judging! Paul liked Geri’s idea, but it looks more like a beach than a long jump. The biscuits taste good, however. In an unexpected twist, John’s biscuits are scrumptious, despite looking hideous. Louise’s football pitch looks great, and her biscuits have a lovely bake – the base is a bit cakey, however. Jermaine’s post-apocalyptic Wembley has a great flavour, but it isn’t a sporting moment and there weren’t 12 pieces. Still, he seemed nice.

Jermaine’s having a shocker, but Geri and Louise seem to be holding it together. Louise’s football pitch looks great, and I love Geri’s biscuit crumb sand. She offers to hold John’s up, and he perks up for a second. John’s just cracked open the champagne. This is the effect Geri has on him, clearly.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.50pm GMT20:50Jermaine is making a soft meringue, but looks thoroughly fed up with the whole business. Geri is painting Paul’s face onto a biscuit, but one of his legs has fallen off. Louise is drawing her football pitch, but doesn’t know where the lines go. I’m not even sure where to start.Updatedat 9.00pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.48pm GMT20:48Everyone has started on the decoration apart from Jermaine, who is struggling with his curvy biscuits. John’s latest grumble is that the recipe isn’t detailed enough. Wait, it’s YOUR recipe, John, you brought it.

Louise is making a football pitch, because her husband is a footballer. Jermaine is making a gingerbread Wembley, which is less of a sporting moment and more sporting monument. Maybe his ears need syringing. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.43pm GMT20:43Geri is recreating Greg Rutherford’s olympic long jump. She’s using ginger spice, because she’s hilarious.

Today’s brief is to make a 3D model of their favourite sporting moment. OR, a 3D model of any sporting moment that’s possible to render in biscuits, I’ll wager.
