My Father’s ShakespeareMy father must have bought it second-hand,Inscribed “To RS Elwyn” – who was he?Published 1890, leather-bound,In 1961 passed on to me.November 6th. How old was I? Sixteen.Doing A level in English Lit.,In love with Keats and getting very keenOn William Shakespeare. I was thrilled with it,This gift, glad then, as now, to thinkI had been chosen as the keeper ofMy father’s Shakespeare, where, in dark blue ink,He wrote, “To Wendy Mary Cope. With love.”Love on a page, surviving death and time.He didn’t even have to make it rhyme.On Sonnet 18“So long as men can breathe and eyes can see” –You don’t assume we’ll be around for ever.You couldn’t know that “this gives life to thee”Only until the sun goes supernova.That knowledge doesn’t prove your words untrue.Neither time nor the advance of scienceHas taken anything away from you,Or faced down your magnificent defiance.That couplet. Were you smiling as you wrote it?Did you utter a triumphant “Yes”?Walking round the garden, did you quote it,Sotto voce, savouring your success?And did you always know, or sometimes doubtThat passing centuries would bear you out?• Specially commissioned by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust
