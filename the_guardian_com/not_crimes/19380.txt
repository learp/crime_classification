Veteran broadcasters Fran Kelly, Margaret Throsby, Robyn Williams, Norman Swan and Geraldine Doogue have written to the ABC board condemning a plan to add another layer of “preposterously named executives” which would be at home in an episode of the ABC satire on bureaucracy, Utopia.Don't blame the ABC for problems of commercial media, says Mark Scott The restructure will see an effective management merger between the ABC’s five radio networks Radio National, Classic FM, Triple J, News Radio and local radio.The letter, signed by 17 of Radio National’s most senior broadcasters, expresses “profound concern” about a plan to restructure the radio division that could have “serious consequences” for ABC radio listeners if implemented.

Guthrie has already started at the ABC and is being shown the ropes by Scott for the next few weeks.“We ask the board to pause on this and not approve anything until there has been further consideration and the new MD has had a chance to get into her stride,” the staff letter obtained by Guardian Australia says.Last week the director of ABC Radio, Michael Mason, announced a major restructure of the radio division, including adding new titles and changing the way senior managers report across the radio networks.Radio sources say the division also has to find $10m in savings which will almost certainly lead to more staff cuts.Under the plan to make digital and broadcast platforms collaborate more the current title of manager of Radio National will be changed to “Ideas Network Lead”, removing the name of the station from the executive entirely.Other new titles include “Capital Local Lead”, “Head, Spoken” and “Classical Lead”, which replaces the old title of manager of Classic FM.“To meet the demands of a changing audio market, our digital and broadcast platforms need to collaborate more closely, both within the division and across the corporation as a whole,” Mason told staff.Coalition releases plan to end cross-media ownership laws “Moreover, our programming will migrate towards an audience-centric rather than a platform-centric approach. We also need to incorporate greater capacity for strategic partnerships and revenue generation.”An ABC spokesman confirmed changes to its radio executive had been announced. “The changes have been made to secure ABC Radio’s ability to meet audience expectations and respond to challenges in the industry such as the increasing number of digital platforms,” he said.“The restructure does not include any mergers between networks or stations, will not impact on any content, presenters or production teams and is funded within the current budget.”But the veteran broadcasters say the new structure is unaffordable and unnecessary and they have already adapted to digital broadcasting by pioneering podcasts and expanding their output to include text as well as audio.“You may have been told that staff and content makers are change-resistant but this is not so,” staff say. “We have moved with the times and continue to do so. We were the first to press for podcasting and on-line program availability and have adopted as standard delivery text-based online content.“The way we operate is agile and efficient but we are not happy with changes which divert resources upwards, away from frontline content-making into what can only be seen as a top-heavy management structure.”The ABC section secretary of the Community and Public Sector Union, Sinddy Ealy, says the plan will create a completely new tier of radio senior executives in Sydney at a time when the wider community is already concerned the ABC executive is too Sydney-centric. In a letter to Mason, obtained by Guardian Australia, the CPSU says the plan is hasty because the triennial funding outcome will not be known until 2 May.“It seems extraordinary that the ABC would be seeking to increase senior executive salary costs at this time,” Ealy said. “The feedback from radio members in the last few days is that the proposal appears rushed and sudden, and it has raised serious questions about whether due process has been followed.”The union says the ABC is facing the loss of $80m in non-recurrent news funding, has to find $25m for the new regional services division, and a shortfall in the money needed to invest in digital services.
