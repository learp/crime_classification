Grace and Tippi are twins who have a closer bond than most; they are conjoined twins. After a lifetime of homeschooling, funds have run out and they must go to a normal school with other children. Even when they have the most important decision in their lives lying ahead, Grace and Tippi embrace the situation and live their lives, together.As a huge fan of Sarah Crossan, I was excited to see that this novel had been written in verse like her debut novel, The Weight of Water. I found the story of Grace and Tippi inspiring and thought provoking, as they remain happy throughout their difficult situation. I expected this book to be quite sad and give a predominantly negative outlook of the time the twins spend in school, but it is awe-inspiring and uplifting in a way that only a beautifully written book can achieve. I love the fact that they make friends with Jon and Yasmeen at school and the positive view of the time that the quartet had together gave me the feeling not dissimilar to a great hug.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This book only took me a day or so to read but it is definitely one that will stay with me for a long time and it taught me that I really don’t have anything to complain about. Grace and Tippi are so believable and like real people. One is quite a quick read but it is guaranteed to leave you with a tear in your eye. A worthy Carnegie medal nominee for sure.
