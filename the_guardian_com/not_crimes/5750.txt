At last year’s Bafta Game Awards, the developer of Her Story, Sam Barlow, famously so struggled with his three awards that he carried them around in a champagne bucket. This year, indie developer Playdead went one better by winning four for their dystopian puzzle platformer Inside: artistic achievement, game design, narrative, and original property.After their previous game, Limbo, won none from four in 2011, the team at Playdead were delighted to take home so many this year: “We kind of expected to continue the clean slate, so we’re very happy.”Inside just missed out on the award for best game which went to Uncharted 4, continuing a tradition of big-budget titles walking away with the top prize (Fallout 4 in 2016 and Destiny in 2015). It was the second best game win in five years for Uncharted 4’s developer Naughty Dog after The Last of Us won in 2013. On stage, Naughty Dog director of communications Arne Meyer thanked the cast of voice actors including Nolan North (Nathan Drake), Emily Rose (Elena Fisher), and Troy Baker (Sam Drake) – but none of them took home the award for Best Performer.That honour went to Cissy Jones, the voice of Delilah in Firewatch, which also won the award for debut game. Jones appeared to fight back tears as she thanked Bafta for “recognising everything that goes into the video game industry”. After the ceremony she was still in shock: “I can’t even. I feel like I’m in a waking dream.”“Bafta raises the bar,” she said. “I mean, look at this event. There is nothing like this anywhere. I mean, getting game devs in tuxes, come on guys. They make it something that is not only mainstream but it’s acceptable. Everyone wants to be a nerd now, it’s great.”The team behind autobiographical game That Dragon, Cancer, which won the award for game innovation, also praised Bafta for accepting video games. Composer Jon Hillman referred to the speech given by Brenda Romero, who accepted the special award: “It’s the most prestigious award ceremony there is in games. Brenda was just saying that it made games art. They’ve accepted it as art. I think that’s what they’re doing. They’re elevating games to that level,” he said.Writer Amy Green said after the win: “We’d love to see more stories made by people who are just desperate to tell people what it’s like to be them in this world.”The award for British game went to Overcooked, which also won the family category, apparently to the surprise of the developers, who admitted to not having prepared a speech in either case. Perhaps they thought British game would go instead to the more artsy Virginia, which ended up with just one award for music. The audience cheered as composer Lyndon Holland shyly thanked his mum and dad.Other winners included The Last Guardian for audio achievement, Rocket League for evolving game, Overwatch for multiplayer, and last summer’s huge success Pokémon Go for mobile.Bafta games awards results in fullSPECIAL AWARDBrenda RomeroARTISTIC ACHIEVEMENTAbzû development team – Giant Squid/505 GamesDishonored 2 development team - Arkane Studios/Bethesda SoftworksWINNER: Inside development team – Playdead/PlaydeadThe Last Guardian development team – SIE Japan Studio, genDesign/Sony Interactive Entertainment EuropeUncharted 4 development team – Naughty Dog LLC/Sony Interactive Entertainment EuropeUnravel development team – Coldwood Interactive/Electronic ArtsAUDIO ACHIEVEMENTBattlefield 1 development team – DICE/Electronic ArtsDoom development team – id Software/Bethesda SoftworksInside Martin Stig Andersen – Playdead/PlaydeadWINNER: The Last Guardian development team – SIE Japan Studio, genDesign/Sony Interactive Entertainment EuropeRez Infinite Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Takako Ishida, Noboru Mutoh – Enhance Games, Monstars Inc., Resonair/Enhance GamesUncharted 4 development team – Naughty Dog LLC/Sony Interactive Entertainment EuropsBEST GAMEFirewatch development team – Campo Santo Productions/Camp Santo Productions, Panic Inc.
