Masterpiece of the week      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Dream object … ancient Roman Piranesi Vase, assembled by Giovanni Battista Piranesi in the 1770s. Photograph: The British MuseumThis stupendous object is a fantasy of ancient decadence created by the brilliantly imaginative architectural artist Piranesi using pieces of ancient sculpture that he found in the ruins of the emperor Hadrian’s villa.
