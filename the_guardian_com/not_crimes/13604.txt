The sparkles from fireworks last a few seconds but the air pollution can linger in our cities for hours.Firework smoke is rich in tiny metal particles making it very different to normal urban air pollution. These metals are used to make firework colours in much the same way as Victorian scientists identified chemicals by burning them in a Bunsen flame; red from strontium or lithium, blue from copper and bright green or white from barium compounds.Guy Fawkes 2015 was largely rained off – disappointing those of us that enjoy fireworks but averting the major pollution problems seen last year. Early Guy Fawkes parties added to pollution over much of England during foggy weather after Halloween, and fireworks pollution was also measured during the following weekend, but levels remained low.Scientists from King’s College London have found differences in the mix of pollution from Guy Fawkes and Diwali. These differences are due to the additional pollution from bonfires – the traditional way of marking Guy Fawkes.Diwali was traditionally celebrated with the lighting of ghee-burning lamps, but this changed with the opening of India’s first firework factory in 1940. Across India, Diwali fireworks have been linked to a 30-40% increase in recorded breathing problems and pollution can exceed the concentrations that catapult Chinese cities into the news. An Indian court petition is demanding better public safety information and restrictions on the sale and use of fireworks, but this was too late to help this year’s celebrations.
