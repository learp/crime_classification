With the news-to-you that that Green party presidential candidate Dr Jill Stein was the lead singer in a 90s alt-folk-rock band, it would be easy enough to speculate that her time as a musician could have a negative effect on her position at the polls.But the truth is that Stein’s hardly the only presidential contender to try her hand at making music. Bill Clinton was, obviously, renowned for his saxophonery, Barack Obama has often surprised the world with his musical stylings – and even Hillary Clinton once sang in public, despite admitting that she’s tone deaf.So the real question is: how does Stein stack up against other presidents and would-be presidents? The Guardian pondered this question extensively, and came up with this definitive ranking of presidential musicianship.Barack Obama   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest President Obama sings Let’s Stay Together.In 2012, at the Apollo Theatre, Obama surprised and delighted listeners with a soulful – if significantly abbreviated – rendition of Al Green’s Let’s Stay Together. Though he made more of an impact, emotionally and politically, when he sang Amazing Grace in 2015 at the funeral of Clementa Pinckney in Charleston, it was his earlier turn at the microphone that was truly unforgettable.Jill Stein<a href="http://somebodyssister-steinselcer.bandcamp.com/album/circuits-to-the-sun-somebodys-sister">Circuits to the Sun - Somebody&#39;s Sister by Jill Stein &amp; Ken Selcer (aka Somebody&#39;s Sister)</a>Jill Stein sang lead on this 1999 Somebody’s Sister albumMaybe alt-folk-rock isn’t your thing (not everyone was a teenager in the 90s), but Stein’s vocals on Somebody’s Sister are distinctly good. It’s hard to say whether it would have sold many copies at the time of its release – late 90s pop music had distinctly moved beyond Alanis Morissette, Jewel and Sheryl Crow – and the lyrics suggest that Stein and her bandmates were inspired by the lyricists of the 60s folk scene. But it’s still very listenable.Bill Clinton   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Bill Clinton on the sax.Speaking of the 90s, there was no escaping Bill Clinton’s jazz saxophone, which he played most memorably on Arsenio Hall’s show in 1992, during his first run for president. He was more than passable, and the bands with which he played were often kinder than they would have been had he hopped on stage under other circumstances, but he’s definitely better than many of the would-be sax players I went to high school with, and he has a sense of musicality.John Kerry   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest John Kerry’s band, the Electras.Oh, yes, the 2004 presidential contender (and Purple Heart recipient) had a very brief career as a bass player in 1961 in the New Hampshire-based rock band the Electras. It’s very surf-rock – which is, perhaps, a little strange given that the band got together in Concord – and it’s hard to say that Kerry was the world’s most creative or technically proficient bassist, but it won’t make you run screaming to turn it off.Mike Huckabee   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Capital Offense does Free Bird.One-time Arkansas governor, perennial presidential candidate and erstwhile Fox News host Mike Huckabee used to play (including on the campaign trail) with his band, Capital Offense. And while the vocalist’s efforts at Free Bird are a bit off-key and the selection of the song Free Bird is a bit of a dad-rock cliche, Huckabee on bass does a pretty passable cover band sort of job, even if the band’s name is a cringe-inducing reference to the death penalty. (He did, in fact, carry out the death penalty while governor.)Bernie Sanders   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Bernie Sander’s folk music album.Maybe spoken-word renditions of folk music classics aren’t your thing – though, then, you probably don’t appreciate William Shatner’s work, either – but there’s at least some sort of market for it. A small one, sure, but a market. But one suspects that Sanders went with the spoken word format because his voice leaves a bit to be desired.And if he’s not going to get on the Green party ticket with Stein, there’s always the potential that a musical collaboration could be worked out.Mitt Romney   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Mitt Romney’s version of America, the Beautiful.Mitt Romney caught a lot of flak in 2012 for his rendition of America, the Beautiful, which is arguably one of the easiest patriotic songs to sing, but it holds up pretty well in retrospect. It’s not that off-key, though it’s unlikely to win any awards, and we can all agree that we’re glad he didn’t attempt the national anthem.Hillary Clinton   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Hillary Clinton sings ‘The Telephone Hour’ from the musical Bye Bye Birdie.Hillary Clinton is renowned for playing it safe … but that wasn’t always the case. In 1997, while first lady and after admitting that she was a terrible singer, she joined Rosie O’Donnell for an abbreviated version of The Telephone Hour from the musical Bye Bye Birdie.The song, blessedly, is designed to be mostly spoken; Clinton admitted that it marked the sole time she was cast in a musical production during her school days and she made the cut only because she promised not to actually sing during the show.John McCain   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest ‘Bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran.’The senator’s brief rendition of the Beach Boys tune Barbara Ann made headlines in 2007, when McCain suggested that the often-misheard song was actually calling for the bombardment of Iran by US warplanes.Warmongering aside, it also wasn’t very tuneful.Donald Trump   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Donald Trump sings the theme to the television show Green Acres.Many Americans have pronounced themselves horrified by the things that come out of Donald Trump’s mouth in the course of the 2016 campaign.Most of them probably haven’t heard him sing the theme song to Green Acres.
