Angelina Jolie said on Monday she was “very disheartened” by the US response to the global migration crisis, particularly from Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.The actor and special envoy for the United Nations refugee agency said she feared countries would adopt increasingly isolationist policies instead of acting together to tackle the challenge.“I have been very, very disheartened by my own country’s response to the situation,” she said at a London event on migration organised by the BBC.Referring to Trump, who suggested a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the US in the wake of attacks by extremists, Jolie said: “To me, America is built on people from around the world coming together for freedoms, and especially freedom of religion.Angelina Jolie Pitt: ‘I’m on fire inside’  “And so it is hard to hear that this is coming from someone who’s pressing to be an American president.”Jolie said worries about uncontrolled immigration had given a “false air of legitimacy to those who promote politics of fear and separation”.“It has created the risk of a race to the bottom, with countries competing to be the toughest,” she said.Jolie said nations needed to pull together to deal with the world’s 60 million displaced people by rebuilding a coordinated and orderly system for dealing with refugees and migrants.
