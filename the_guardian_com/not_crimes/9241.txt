While marriages rates have fallen generally, over-65s are bucking this trend. Data from the Office for National Statistics found a 47% increase in the opposite-sex marriage rate (the number of people marrying per 1,000 unmarried persons) among over-65s, during a five-year period when the wider marriage rate fell. (Same-sex marriage only became possible in the UK from 29 March 2014.) We want to hear from those who found the love of their life when they were 65 or over. How did you meet your partner? How does this relationship compare with those you had earlier in your life? Do you regret the fact that you met later on in life, rather than when you were in your 20s or 30s? And are you planning to follow the trend – whether an opposite-sex or same-sex couple – by getting married? If so, what kind of wedding do you have planned? We’d like to hear your stories.
