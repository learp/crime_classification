The BBC will look to retune its national music stations Radio 1 and Radio 2 to focus on emerging homegrown talent in a bid to counter government criticism that they are not distinctive enough.The changes are likely to mean more Jake Bugg and less Jay Z on the station where more than half of the top tier of its playlist – the songs it plays the most – is made up of overseas artists.Current and regular Radio 1 acts from North America include Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, The Weeknd and Beyoncé. Favourite UK acts on the station include Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, Skepta and Calvin Harris.The BBC said it would have more new homegrown talent on Radio 1 and Radio 2 as part of a robust defence of the distinctiveness of the two stations published on Tuesday, saying around 90% of their music output was not played on any other station.A review document said the BBC would “ensure that Radio 1 and Radio 2 have a strong commitment to new and UK music so that a strong proportion of the new music in daytime on Radio 1 and Radio 2 should be from the UK”.Radio 1’s 15-strong ‘A list’ currently includes six American and six British acts, two from Australia and one from Canada. Radio 2 is more homegrown, with more than half of its ‘A list’ acts from the UK.The BBC later said the new commitment would not necessarily mean fewer American tunes. A spokesman added that Radio 1 already exceeded quotas for new and British music and it would be up to the BBC’s new regulator to decide what the revised quota will be. The BBC went on to say it would also extend social media activity on Radio 1 and strengthen the arts and “high-quality speech content” on Radio 2, which would broadcast a minimum of four seasons a year covering “arts and social action”.Radio 1 and Radio 2 have been criticised by their commercial rivals for not being distinctive enough, and the two stations’ output was also criticised in the government’s green paper on the future of the BBC, published last year. A white paper on the future of the BBC is expected to be published by the government in May.Radio 1 has more than 10 million listeners but has recently seen its audience fall as it attempts to reach a younger audience, with Nick Grimshaw replacing Chris Moyles in the breakfast slot.Radio 2 remains the UK’s biggest radio station by some distance, with an average of 15.5 million listeners a week.There are currently around 50 different quotas governing output on the BBC’s music stations, and the corporation said it would cut these quotas and introduce lighter touch regulation.Exactly how much new UK music will be played on the two stations is yet to be decided and will be discussed with the BBC’s new regulator, expected to be Ofcom, which is likely to replace the BBC Trust next year.A BBC spokesman said: “The BBC has never had such an important role in supporting new British music and this new commitment reflects the importance we place on bringing our audiences the best British acts.”
