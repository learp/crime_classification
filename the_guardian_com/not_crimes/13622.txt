Weather Report – Black Market John Eriksson: A very summery track from the masters of jazz fusion. Just listen to Joe Zawinul’s synth solo. Eerie sounds were important when he made music. If I could have been in a band other than Peter Björn and John, I would have picked Weather Report.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Niki & the Dove – So Much It Hurts JE: I keep adding this track to playlists because I can’t stop liking it. I seldom find a new favourite song, but this one definitely is. Love the Prince-vibe of Malin Dahlström’s vocals and the steamy 80s production. High five.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Sigue Sigue Sputnik – Love Missile F1-11 Björn Yttling: An old favourite and a real classic. Got the seven-inch when I was a kid, and I still play it a lot.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Swimming Pool – Emmy the GreatPeter Morén: This is one of the best songs I’ve heard all year. Featuring Wild Beasts’ Tom Fleming, it has great lyrics, and I like the storytelling and production.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Eggstone – Like SoPM: Per Sunding who produced Gimme Some was the singer in my favourite Swedish band of the 90s, Eggstone. Their last album came out in 1997 and now out of the blue they release a new single that sounds as if it was recorded at the same sessions. Maybe it was. Maybe they are cheating. Either way, it is still great.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest
