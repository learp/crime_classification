This is a sad, complex, haunting novel which raises huge questions about family, memory, exploitation and ‘othering’. At its heart, however, is the simple story of a girl growing up to become a woman, and her relationship with her best friend and eventual lover. Like The Buried Giant, the clarity and poignancy of the way these relationships are portrayed is arrestingly powerful, and lingers unsettlingly in your mind. I was driving along not long after finishing this book when a song lyric invoked the novel, and I felt a sudden, unexpected, almost physical stab of pathos for Cath, Tommy, and Ruth.The story is split into three parts: one describes the characters growing up in a country boarding house called Hailsham; one recalls the time they spent at the Cottages; the last third is about their splitting up and final coming back together, as adults. I was reminded of the way the goddess of magic, Hecate, is sometimes pictured as having three aspects: a youthful maiden in the morning, a matron at midday, a withered, ancient crone in the evening. This echoes the loss of innocence Cath undergoes in the story, although she is also sympathetic precisely because her destiny in this nightmarish, dystopian world precludes the possibility of becoming a mother or growing old naturally. Kazuo Ishiguro also draws on ideas of rebirth which challenge this simplistic structure. Another subtle and interesting feature is that the ‘Cottages’, though the shortest section of the book, and in one sense merely a transition or buffer stage, do represent something separate from both just Hailsham and being a ‘Carer’, just as true adolescence is not just a souped-up childhood or undeveloped maturity…Many aspects of the story will be convincing for anyone: the casual, unthinking cruelty of children in the playground; the fleeting way alliances are made and abruptly severed between young people; how sex changes dramatically as a topic several times in our lives. One of Ishiguro’s strengths as a writer is his ability to write clearly and unpretentiously about these. The novel is frightening and disturbing at many levels – Kazuo Ishiguro continuously drip-feeds the reader small details which are cause for disquiet (although events or characters with particularly sinister significance are often introduced innocuously). This technique works like introducing sinister music in a film a little before the moment of horror. For this reason, like the characters themselves, the reader always has a creeping realisation of what is really going on, sometimes long before the story really catches up – Cathy’s long, meandering memories, which brilliantly and subtly convey both her stream of consciousness and the random association of ideas (you get the sense constantly that she is trying to impose meaning, a pattern, a narrative, onto fragments of recollection) both contextualise things for the reader and serve as titbits to delay reveals or to throw the reader of the scent. They also strangely seem to mirror the processing of writing a novel itself, in a similar way to how some of Simon Armitage’s poems reflect the process of writing poetry.  Perhaps the most sinister aspect of the novel is the way it reflects ourselves back at us. In this world, the cost of a world free from cancer and diseases is, in human terms, catastrophic, but, as one character asks, how can we go back to a world where these diseases cause so much suffering and indignity? In the same way, our trade off for the luxury of development and the necessity of ending poverty seems to be locking us into a cycle of dependency on fossil fuels. Let alone the thought of where our cheap clothes, technology – and the raw materials which build them – come from.  I’ve never quite encountered such a well-written fictional account of cognitive bias – the way we modify our beliefs or our behaviour to avert the guilt or discomfort at holding two self-contradictory beliefs in our mind at once – at society’s level. This alone makes this a precious book indeed. The spike in anti-migrant and anti-Muslim hate crime in a post-Brexit Britain, not to mention the rise of Donald Trump in the US or the far right in Europe, has been a salutary reminder of the need to always avoid ‘othering’ human beings; this book is full of such compassion for humanity it must surely be a worthy antidote.  The idea of letting the technological or medical genie out of the bottle without considering the full moral, social and environmental implications is as relevant and haunting today as it has ever been.Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop
