Nine deer found dead in Dorset woodland may have been the victims of hunting with dogs or illegal poaching, police have said.Seven carcasses were found at the bottom of Randalls Hill, Lytchett Minster, and two on a bridle path near Upton in the last week of April. All nine had dog bites on their rears, their insides removed and their throats cut.Sgt Jane Mooney said: “I am appealing to members of the public to come forward if they have any information regarding these killings. These cruel wildlife attacks appear to have been carried out for fun as there are no signs of butchering.“I would also like to appeal to local walkers and dog owners who might be out and about in rural areas to keep their eyes and ears open and report any suspicious behaviour. All calls will be treated in strict confidence.”Insp Steve Marsh, wildlife coordinator at the force, said: “We have noticed an increase in this kind of wildlife crime in our rural areas. Deer are being slaughtered by dogs as part of an illegal sport or poached for their meat.“I would like to reassure the public that, together with partner agencies, we are taking these crimes extremely seriously and will prosecute offenders accordingly. We currently have robust patrols in targeted areas and can only ask that the public remain vigilant to such crimes and come forward with any information.”
