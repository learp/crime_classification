Game of Thrones and Star Wars star Gwendoline Christie will join Elisabeth Moss in the second series of Jane Campion’s critically acclaimed BBC2 drama, Top of the Lake.Christie, who plays itinerant warrior Brienne of Tarth in HBO’s fantasy drama Game of Thrones, will take a leading role in the six-part sequel alongside former Mad Men star Moss.Christie starred as stormtrooper leader Captain Phasma in JJ Abrams’ record-breaking Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Although she was barely on screen and unrecognisable under her character’s chrome armour, she has confirmed she will return in the next episode of the rebooted sci-fi epic.Oscar-winning Campion will return as co-writer and co-director on the new series, Top of the Lake: China Girl, which begins four years after the end of the first, when an unidentified body of an Asian girl washes up on Sydney’s Bondi Beach.Christie said: “Jane Campion has been a major creative influence throughout my life and I could not feel more privileged to be working on the next instalment of her unique and enthralling drama, alongside the brilliant Elisabeth Moss.”Filming began this week on the new series, which will also feature David Dencik (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), Alice Englert (Beautiful Creatures, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell) and Ewen Leslie (The Daughter). A global co-production with partners in the US, New Zealand, Australia and France, it will air on BBC2 next year.‘I don't take acting that seriously.
