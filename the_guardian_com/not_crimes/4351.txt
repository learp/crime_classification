This book is a sequel to The Crew and continues to explore the lives of teenagers who experience many problems and daily find themselves in sudden and unpredictable situations, most of which are negative. The book is like a survival guide for anyone living in the ‘Ghetto’.In the estate you’ll find; schools and relationships but also run-down shops, gangs, drugs, separation, promises of protection and a battle to be the best gang. These issues allow you to connect with these characters and it teaches you many life lessons while you read the book. It shows you the dangers of getting involved in things teenagers may view as ‘cool’, for example being in a gang, getting money illegally, taking drugs and not staying loyal to one person.This book shows the truth; it shows you how the consequences of your actions have an effect on others. Throughout the book we see how the choices made by a group of teenage boys leads to fear, discomfort, and disconnection for Billy from his friends and family. We also see a beloved character lose their life.I recommend this book as it teaches you a lesson and you will be intrigued and hooked by every word. • Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
