Jennifer Lopez deleted on a tweet on Tuesday that contained the hashtag #AllLivesMatter.The tweet also included the hashtag #LoveMaketheWorldGoRound, the title of her Orlando benefit song co-sung by Tony winner Lin-Manuel Miranda of Hamilton fame, as well as a photograph of the pair performing the track on Good Morning America.Jennifer Lopez and Lin-Manuel Miranda team up for Orlando benefit song The phrase #AllLivesMatter has been used as a counterargument to #BlackLivesMatter, though the latter phrase was inspired by the fact that the disproportionate numbers of black people killed by police in the US suggests black lives are less valued. #AllLivesMatter has been used by a range of people including those who profess themselves opponents of America‚Äôs new civil rights movement. Twitter users were quick to call out Lopez for including the phrase in the post, probably prompting the quick removal of the tweet.
