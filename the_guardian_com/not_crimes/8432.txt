When I was in training, every chef in the kitchen became known for something they did well. Apple-peeling knife skills, or perfectly balanced vinaigrettes; filigree crepes or beautifully blistered and bubbly pizza dough. I had a reputation for making feather-light almond cakes and not-too-sweet, but still very flavourful ice-creams and sherbets.At one point I worked with a wonderful pastry cook called Blake Brown who came from New Orleans. She made perfect fruit pastes and had a way with puff pastry. She often spoke about the mythical cakes of the American south with names such as Doberge (pronounced dough-bash), king cake, and Lady Baltimore. A lily-white cake filled with rum-soaked dried fruits and nuts, covered with boiled icing, the Lady Baltimore cake captured my imagination and has been on my mind ever since.With Mardi Gras coming up this month, it seemed like the ideal time to revisit the Lady Baltimore and delve deeper into what makes it so delicious. I found some wonderful dried green figs and dried sour cherries and combined them with some plump sultanas for my fruity filling. I chose spiced rum and added a little almond extract to bring out the cherry flavour mimicked by bitter almond. Boiled icing is one of my most beloved icings, sometimes referred to as 7-minute icing – or as we call it at Violet Bakery, marshmallow icing – because it is the exact same process as making marshmallow, but without the gelatin to make it set. This cake has an unusual combination of textures, but it really works. Fluffy, chewy, crunchy and soft, it is definitely one of my greatest hits.

Mix together the figs, sultanas, cranberries (or sour cherries), almond extract and rum (or brandy). Cover and set aside for an hour or overnight, to allow the fruit to soak up the alcohol.Claire Ptak’s recipes for honey chocolate cake and almond macaroons | Baking 2 Preheat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3½. Grease, flour and line a 20cm round tin. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. Measure the milk and vanilla into a jug.3 Beat the butter with half of the caster sugar until pale and fluffy. Slowly add a little of the milk and then a little of the flour, mixing after each addition to ensure the mix is smooth. Continue until all of the milk and flour have been added.4 Whip the egg whites with the remaining half of the caster sugar until the mix comes to soft peaks.5 Fold the egg whites into the flour mix gradually, starting with half the whites mixture and then adding the rest.6 Transfer the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 60-65 minutes. Allow to cool completely before assembling the cake.7 To make the icing: put all the ingredients into a heatproof bowl (if you are using a stand mixer, use that bowl), whisk together and place the bowl over a pan of simmering water. Stirring constantly, heat the mixture until the sugar completely dissolves and is starting to turn opaque. If you have a sugar thermometer (which makes this easier) take the temperature to 70C for 2 minutes or until it reaches 75C: whichever comes first.8 Return the bowl to your stand mixer, if you are using one, or put on the counter and use an electric hand whisk on high, then whisk for around 10 minutes, or until the icing has cooled and doubled in volume. It should hold a stiff peak.9 Assemble the cake: combine the chopped walnuts with the soaked fruit and any remaining soaking liquid. Stir half the icing through the fruit-nut filling mix.10 Carefully split the cooled cake into three even layers with a serrated knife. Put one layer on a serving plate and cover with half of your filling. Place the next layer on top and cover with the remaining filling. Place the last layer on top and cover the cake with the remaining icing. You can cover the sides too, or leave them exposed. Decorate the top with additional dried figs.Claire Ptak is a pastry chef, author and food stylist and owns Violet Bakery in London.
