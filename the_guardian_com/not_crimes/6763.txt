Downing Street has played down calls for a ban on Chinese or paper lanterns as firefighters continued to extinguish fires at a recycling plant in Smethwick, West Midlands, where they believe a lantern may have caused millions of pounds worth of damage in one of the biggest blazes in the region for years."The actual number of fires caused by Chinese lanterns is very small," a No 10 spokesman said. "It is important that we always ensure that there is a proportionate response to any event and we always look at safety matters and make sure they are kept at the top of our concerns."The intervention of the prime minister's office comes after attempts by other government departments to dampen expectations of a review of the fire hazard posed by lanterns or a ban. However, senior fire officers appealed to the public not to use the lanterns, which they see as a safety risk as well as a threat to property and animals.Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, echoed concern in rural groups and animal charities about the lanterns, which the Women's Food and Farming Union has called "far more dangerous than fireworks".He told BBC's Today programme that it had taken a major incident in an urban area in which it was "extremely lucky" that no one was killed to bring home the dangers of the lanterns. "It is laudable for governments to take their time and be cautious about banning things but the evidence now very strongly points towards that ban."This could be repeated again and it could have a loss of life attached to it, which would be an absolutely appalling tragedy", said Farron. "I think all of us would feel utterly, utterly appalling if we had failed to take action when we had the chance."They are spectacular things so I am loth to ban them or to seek to ban them. But they are immensely dangerous. The Spanish, who are a pretty fun-loving group, have banned them in recent years as well because of the impact on livestock, on crops and indeed property and potentially the threat to life."West Midlands fire service said 10 fire engines and 60 firefighters were still trying to break up molten plastic to get to the root of some fires at the Smethwick plant run by J&A Young (Leicester), which trades as Jayplas. The blaze started on Sunday night and at its peak was attended by more than 200 firefighters and nearly 40 appliances.Ten firefighters are reported to have been injured, none seriously, although four were taken to hospital.
