A day bright and spirit-lifting, sandwiched between leaden skies as depressions follow hard on each other's heels, drew us to the coast. We survey the fossil beds at Highcliffe from a safe distance. They are saturated. Many of the shelves that we have wandered when fossicking in the past have slumped. There are fissures everywhere and the dark-grey clay that carries a rich haul of smaller fossils is akin to quicksand. Even in a dry year, it can steal the wellingtons from the unwary.These eocene Barton Beds are generally regarded as family friendly, for introducing children to fossil collecting, with care, so when friends sought ideas to entertain their grandson during a forthcoming holiday, I took them to Highcliffe to show them what to do. Equipped with a small trowel and a bag for their finds, they climbed with me up the lower levels of the cliffs until we came to a suitable shelf. I had brought along some specimens collected on previous outings – including shark's teeth – so they would know what to look for.The husband asked where to start and I replied that here would be as good as anywhere. He bent down and prodded the ground. There was a clunk as his trowel hit something hard. "Is that a fossil?" he asked. "Probably just a stone," I replied, "but tease it out gently. Only then will you know." He worked away for a minute or two while we watched, and lifted out a large intact specimen of the oyster Pycnodonte gigantica – about 40m years old. Oh, for that luck next time we go fossilising!With that memory and buffeted by the wind, we battled our way to the car park in a torrential squall. On reaching the top, we looked back at the cliffs. To our delight, there was a double rainbow with its feet resting on the beach just where we had been standing.
