This year's spring drought in southern Britain has had a profound influence on the natural world. Butterflies have been out in force, with many species sighted several weeks earlier than usual. They have subsequently thrived as a result of the fine, sunny weather: a welcome revival in their fortunes after a series of poor years. Warm, dry weather is generally good for breeding birds, too. It enables them to find food more easily, and avoids their eggs or chicks becoming chilled.The early arrival of spring was especially helpful to migrant birds, with fine weather across Europe allowing species such as pied flycatchers to return more than a week earlier than usual. Swallows too arrived early, and have already successfully raised their first brood of chicks, thanks to a plentiful supply of flying insects. But for the swallow's close relative, the house martin, the picture is more mixed. The British Trust for Ornithology says house martins have struggled to find mud – the material they need to make their nests under the eaves of our homes – because of the drought.Other garden birds such as the blackbird and song thrush are also struggling, this time to find food, as rock-hard lawns make worms hard to get. If the dry weather continues, birds that breed on wet meadows, such as the lapwing and redshank, will suffer too. Their chicks must find food almost as soon as they have hatched, and with many fields bone-dry, invertebrates are hard to find.
