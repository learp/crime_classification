The funniest TV show I’ve ever seenTim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!. I saw it after series one of Limmy’s Show and it inspired me to speed things up a bit.The funniest film I’ve ever seenFateful Findings by Neil Breen.

People laughed at me, but then they wanted to wear it, because it was funny.The funniest standup I’ve ever seenDes Clarke. He used to do this thing where he’d stumble over his words. I saw him do a spot at The Stand and I was in hysterics.The funniest book I’ve ever readI don’t think I’ve read any comedy books, so I’ll say the story 1922 by Stephen King. A corpse gets its jaw kicked off by a cow.The funniest heckle I’ve ever hadI was chatting about something on stage, and I heard somebody in the audience say: “So what?” I wasn’t supposed to hear it but it made me laugh inside.The funniest sketch I’ve ever seenA Tim & Eric one where they go from talking about old men to this video-editing beatbox thing. Makes no sense unless you see it.The funniest wordTragic.The funniest numberEight. It looks jolly and up for a laugh.Limmy is touring his second book, That’s Your Lot, 7 May to 28 June
