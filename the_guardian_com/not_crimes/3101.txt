Update: check our suggestions – and a round-up of some of your plans – here It’s 400 years since the bard’s death this weekend and it’s also his 452nd birthday – as, legend has it, his birth and death were on the same day of the year. Hundreds of events to mark the occasion will be taking place in the UK and around the world – from Shakespeare’s Globe projecting 37 short films across London, to walks in “Shakespeare suburb” Shoreditch, to Shakespeare-inspired baking workshops, via late-night karaokes, promising-sounding “human sonnet jukeboxes” and hip-hop at the British Library, a Shakespeare parade in Stratford-upon-Avon and a fireworks display in Chicago.But how will you be celebrating? Whether it’s by attending an organised event or staging school productions or parties, reading or anything else – let us know in the comments below, or by clicking on the blue “contribute” button, where we’d love for you to also share your pictures. We’ll publish a selection on the Guardian site.
