Queensland faces a “dramatic escalation” in carbon pollution that guarantees Australia will fail to meet even its “weak” greenhouse targets unless the commonwealth sets a price on emissions, the state’s environment minister, Steven Miles, has warned.A state government report shows that Queensland, Australia’s single largest polluter, is on track for a 35% rise in carbon emissions by 2030.Queensland’s high emissions are due to its heavy reliance on coal for electricity, heavy use of fuel for transport, gas processing for export and a recent surge in land clearing.Exclusive: land-clearing surge in Queensland set to wipe out Direct Action gains – report And after clearing laws were relaxed under the former Newman government, it accounts for 90% of Australia’s emissions from deforestation.In 2013-14 its land clearing doubled to 300,000ha – half the annual rate of deforestation in the Amazon in Brazil – and a similar result is expected for 2014-15.In the same year power stations began to switch back to higher-emitting coal because exporting gas was more profitable than burning it for electricity, thanks to a new export pipeline to Asia.Miles said the state government’s pending bill to limit tree clearing was the “most important lever” it could pull to limit carbon pollution, which had been falling in Queensland between 2005 and 2011.But the new pollution projections, at what the report said was “the very time emissions need to be reduced”, showed this alone would not be enough.“This new modelling shows that emissions in Queensland, if we do nothing new, will escalate dramatically,” Miles said.“This is the effect of Campbell Newman’s LNP government dismantling successful climate-change programs that were in place in Queensland.“But it also demonstrates what happens when the national government has no effective climate mitigation programs.“How can [the federal environment minister] Greg Hunt and [the prime minister] Malcolm Turnbull honestly say that they will achieve a 26% to 28% increase with no new climate policies when Queensland, their highest emitting state, is going to increase its emissions by 35%?”Miles said Australia was “the only developed country to go backwards on climate policy” by repealing a carbon price.“The targets [the commonwealth] has set are not high enough and we should be doing our fair share, but even their weak targets will be impossible to meet with Queensland on its current trajectory,” he said.

The national government needs to bring in an appropriate policy mechanism to achieve the targets they’ve set.“We’ve always said the way to address carbon emissions here in Australia is with a market-based mechanism, a cap-and-trade mechanism, that puts a price on pollution and allows the economy to accommodate that price.“We had a carbon price. The fact it’s not there means emissions are continuing to increase, particularly in Queensland where we have the legacy of not just a failing national policy but also a state government that wilfully and recklessly objected to the community transitioning away from carbon pollution.”Wilderness Society Queensland’s campaign manager, Tim Seelig, said 18 months of land clearing in Queensland was enough to wipe out $670m worth of carbon abatement through tree planting and preservation by the Turnbull government’s emissions reduction fund. “This is a national tree clearing crisis that requires immediate action,” Seeling said.“The Queensland parliament must urgently fix the state’s tree clearing laws. The Turnbull government must also step in to ensure a strong national plan is in place to control tree clearing and make sure Queensland cannot revert back to weakened laws at any stage in the future.”
