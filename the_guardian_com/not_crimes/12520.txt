The UK's chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, has said there is a "limited public health risk" if the drug phenylbutazone, known as bute, is found in beef products that contain horsemeat.In her first public statement on the horsemeat scandal, Davies reiterated the message of ministers that there was no health risk and sought to allay concerns over any potential harm from bute, an equine anti-inflammatory medicine that is banned in food.The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has ordered further tests and said last week that consumers should not eat Findus beef lasagne bought before it was removed from shelves because it had not been tested for bute.Meanwhile, Romania denied any part in the growing scandal after being implicated by France, and butchers reported a spike in business as concerns mounted over processed meat.Romania's prime minister, Victor Ponta, told a news conference: "From all the data we have at the moment, there is no breach of European rules committed by companies from Romania or on Romanian territory. I am very angry, to be honest."The UK environment secretary, Owen Paterson, who has already warned that thousands of tests conducted this week may find "there is a substance which is injurious to human health", told BBC Breakfast: "The FSA's clear advice is to continue buying and eating all the products for sale."Should evidence come forward of any serious threat to health, obviously we will react very swiftly, and that could mean action on imports. But at the moment, all the evidence is that these products are entirely safe and people are open to eat them if they are advised so by the FSA – and they are."Davies said: "We are working closely with the FSA and Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] to investigate how horsemeat got into the UK food chain. There is nothing to suggest a safety risk to consumers who may have eaten the products. All of the retailers involved so far have removed potentially affected products from their shelves."Phenylbutazone is used in some people who suffer from ankylosing spondylitis, a type of arthritis. However, there are international checks to prevent phenylbutazone from entering the food chain because there is a low risk of serious effects – such as aplastic anaemia [bone marrow failure] – in some people. As such, it presents a limited public health risk and CMO supports the FSA advice that it should be excluded from the food chain."With the health department saying Davies's statement was intended to put concerns over bute "in context", the chief medical officer said there was "currently no indication" that bute was present in any product so far identified in the UK."It's understandable that people will be concerned, but it is important to emphasise that even if bute is found to be present at low levels, there is a very low risk indeed that it would cause any harm to health," Davies said.Brindon Addy, chairman of the Q Guild, which represents 130 butchers across England, Scotland and Wales, said: "There has definitely been a spike in sales for the high street butcher in recent weeks, some are saying by as much as 20-30%."It is obviously great news for those butchers who have found it difficult to compete with the big supermarkets in the past. People slip into the convenience of supermarket shopping, but whenever there is a scare – be it horsemeat or BSE – they always come back."
