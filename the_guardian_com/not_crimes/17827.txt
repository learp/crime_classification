A story of “poetry, danger, and darkness” according to the man himself, Bruce Springsteen’s autobiography, Born to Run will be released internationally on 27 September – a few days after his 67th birthday.According to publishers Simon & Schuster, Springsteen has been privately writing the autobiography for seven years, beginning work in 2009 after his performance with the E Street Band at the Super Bowl’s halftime show. Springsteen describes growing up in Freehold, New Jersey and according to the publisher recounts “his relentless drive to become a musician, his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park, and the rise of the E Street Band”.“Writing about yourself is a funny business,” Springsteen writes. “But in a project like this, the writer has made one promise, to show the reader his mind. In these pages, I’ve tried to do this.”A spokesman for the publisher called it “the book we’ve been hoping for. Readers will see their own lives in Bruce Springsteen’s extraordinary story, just as we recognise ourselves in his songs.”Simon & Schuster, which will publish Born to Run in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and India also published Springsteen’s illustrated book Outlaw Pete in 2014.“If you were to ask any publisher to name a cultural figure whose autobiography would provoke the greatest enthusiasm, Bruce Springsteen’s name would be on every list,” said Ian Chapman, CEO of Simon & Schuster UK. “Beyond being one of the most admired individuals in the world, he is a captivating storyteller with a unique way of expressing himself.”Born to renovate: The house where Bruce Springsteen wrote Born to Run goes on sale Born to Run will also be published by Editions Albin Michel in France; Mondadori in Italy; Heyne in Germany; Natur & Kultur in Sweden; Spectrum in the Netherlands, Politikens in Denmark; Cappelen Damn in Norway; Otava in Finland; and Penguin Random House in Spain.In a 2014 interview with the New York Times, Springsteen revealed his own favourite authors were Cormac McCarthy, Philip Roth and Richard Ford. “I love the way Richard Ford writes about New Jersey,” the musician said. “The Sportswriter, Independence Day and The Lay of the Land are all set on my stomping grounds and, besides being poignant and hilarious, nail the Jersey Shore perfectly.”
