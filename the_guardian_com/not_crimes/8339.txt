The online mocked-up poster of Gillian Anderson as “Jane Bond” is lighthearted but I hope no actress is ever offered the role of 007 (Report, 25 May). Any film adaption of a book takes liberties – all the James Bond actors have played the character in different ways – but one thing remains the same: Bond is a male, heterosexual spy. A loner with a Scottish background. He wears tuxedos, not dresses, and has a passion for women, not men. Call that sexist if you want, but that’s the way it is. Ian Fleming would have sued any film company that dared make his 007 female. Will we see a Bridget Jones film in which she becomes Barry Jones? Or see Disney remake Sleeping Beauty into Sleeping Handsome? There’s being liberal and there’s being ridiculous.Emilie LamploughTrowbridge, Wiltshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
