Restrictions imposed on the movement of poultry after an outbreak of bird flu have been lifted, the government has said. Some 6,000 ducks were culled on a farm at Nafferton, near Driffield, east Yorkshire, following the identification of “highly pathogenic” H5N8 bird flu last month.The disease was the same strain as that confirmed at a chicken farm in the province of Utrecht, in the Netherlands, and in Germany. In a statement, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: “On Sunday December 21 all restrictions following the outbreak were lifted. This means that all poultry-keeping farms within the 6.2 mile (10km) surveillance zone around the infected property are now allowed to move poultry and other animals without restriction.”Chief Vet Nigel Gibbens said: “Protecting our country from animal diseases is important for our economy and our robust and thorough approach to tackling this outbreak means we are able to lift these restrictions at the earliest possible point allowed by EU law.“This outbreak should serve as a reminder for the poultry industry of the importance of maintaining strict biosecurity to minimise the risk of infection and I would urge keepers to remain vigilant for any signs of disease and report suspicions to their vet immediately.”The Yorkshire outbreak was the first serious case of bird flu in the UK since 2008 when the H7N7 strand was found in free range hens near Banbury, Oxfordshire.
