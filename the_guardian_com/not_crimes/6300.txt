Removing capital invested in fossil fuel companies is one way of working towards this – but is it an effective method?On Tuesday 26 May 7-8.30pm, Guardian Sustainable Business will be hosting a free event, in partnership with the British Academy and the Doen Foundation, when we will discuss the Guardian’s divestment campaign and debate what it means for the business and investor community.The event will be chaired by the Guardian’s editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger and will feature a guest panel of Nick Stern, president of the British Academy; Meryam Omi, Legal & General investment management; Steve Howard, head of sustainability at Ikea; Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity; Lisa Ashford, CEO of Ethex; and David Blood, co-founder of Generation Investment Management.Each panel guest will give a short introduction to their positions, followed by a Q&A including questions from the audience.The event will be filmed, with footage and highlights published on the Guardian.Key themes for debate will include:Can divestment be a catalyst for change or is it just a political protest?Is it a viable strategy on its own or does it need government to act first?Can investors still make above-market average financial returns outside of fossil fuels?Are there any alternative options for investors?Are there lessons to be learned from other campaigns, such as the divestment campaign during South Africa’s apartheid regime?
