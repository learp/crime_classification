Could there be a more brilliant way of introducing a book about becoming a refugee, claiming asylum in an alien country and attempting to assimilate into it, than by quoting Isaac Newton’s Laws of Motion? Every body preserves in its state of rest ... unless it is compelled to change that state by forces imposed thereon ... the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts. It would be impossible to spend this entire review dissecting the relevance of these elegant seventeenth-century axioms. The main characters are torn in two by their decision to leave. The main character’s quest to achieve something which is never actually specified, can seemingly not be deflected. She Is Not Me begins with a family, two parents and their young daughter, who flee from Iran to Sweden. The parents are both political activists. From the beginning, the novel is permeated with a sense of failure, of not doing enough, of giving up, which the life of their daughter echoes; they have failed to bring about the revolution which they have been working towards. Among the many groups which she will encounter, from those who zealously reform themselves as Swedish to those who hold themselves proudly and hopelessly aloof, this theme recurs again and again. Unusually, each of the main characters is only ever referred to my an anonymous proper noun, or a personified abstract concept: ‘Mama’, ‘Papa’, ‘The Girl’, ‘Dearest Sister’, ‘Torn Sunbeam’. This lends the entire narrative a disconcerting, almost hallucinatory atmosphere, and suggests the characters are emblematic of particular groups of people. Since each of these names are relative, either because they depend on their relationship with another person, or because they depend on how another character, the Girl, sees them, it also introduces a theme of appearance being all-important, which becomes sinister as the Girl sees herself as a ‘troll’, and later develops an unnamed eating disorder, probably bulimia. The novel is full of these intricate patterns. Words and phrases like ‘Cheshire grin’ and ‘Factory Town’ are repeated again and again, subtly accruing new significances and meanings. To begin with, the references to Alice in Wonderland reinforce the disorientating process of becoming part of a new culture, and the sense of a world seen through a child’s eyes.Later, they start to feel more uncomfortable, manipulative and sinister. ‘Factory Town’ is sometime a springboard for dreams of freedom, and then a way of dividing the successful from the left behind. Likewise, “numbers don’t lie” originally seems a positive way of standing up to discrimination in the Swedish education system, but when applied to calories, fuels the Girl’s disordered thinking. Colours are also used extensively, from Papa’s “honey eyes” to the “coal-black eyes” of a soldier at the border, and the Girl’s own “liquorice pastilles”, again giving the narrative a kind of universal truth, and beautifully allowing the reader to see the world through a child’s eyes, without having to use the first person narrative. As Marcus Sedgwick has recently put it, many novels with young protagonists fail to miss being absurd when their twelve-year old narrators sound as though they’ve just swallowed a psychology textbook. Initially, when the author allows an insight into Mama’s head, via letters to her relatives into Iran, it is not only an incredibly poignant realisation of when reality doesn’t match up to dreams: “Yes, my heart pounds just as loudly as it used to”, but also, by then jumping into the Girl’s perspective, reveals the gulf between how adults see children and children see the world: “If only we could be as unaware and innocent as she.”Top 10 political books to inspire action  Words in their native Iranian are also used throughout to express a depth of feeling which doesn’t need translation. Azizam (‘my darling’). Dokhtaram (‘daughter’). Residim (‘We have arrived’). Interestingly, though, the word ‘freedom’ is not translated back into Iranian. It is left for the reader to decide whether or not that is appropriate. A lot of She Is Not Me is deeply uncomfortable to read. Golnaz Hashemzadeh skilfully represents a dysfunctional family dynamic, in which a young child is trapped between her parents’ warring (“She learned Swedish words through Papas textbooks...and Persian melancholy from Mama’s cassette tapes”), and comes to feel responsible for protecting her mother against her father’s abuse). An impossible responsibility thrown into even starker relief when she simultaneously nominates herself as her younger brother’s guardian. It is difficult to read about Papa’s manipulation of Mama, which prevents her realising her dream of studying to become a doctor. The descriptions of the Girl’s eating disorder are visceral: “She ran her finger along her concave stomach...Touched her half-baked breasts unconsciously”. She Is Not Me at times can feel like a feminist roller-coaster. There are few issues to do with the liberation of women which are not explored, from domestic abuse to body image. Golnaz Hashemzadeh’s novel also considers how sexism is often bound up with other forms of prejudice and discrimination. At school, despite being bright and literate, the Girl and her ‘Dearest Sister’, a fellow refugee, are infantilised by being taken out of class to do simple exercises. “Damn Arab bitch!” is one term hurled at the Girl, who finds herself a victim of both racist and sexist abuse as she struggles to become head student at an elite school. This book has made me think twice about the use of the number of female executives in FTSE 100 companies as an indicator of social progress, given the enormous personal costs the Girl has to shoulder – at some points it feels as though her very identity has been swallowed – and the sheer elitism and disassociation involved in rising to the top of what we might in the UK call “the establishment”.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? Despite the savage harshness of the content, She Is Not Me is beautifully written, and the imagery is startlingly effective at refreshing your view of the world, even in translation: “they lived in that ice-bound silence for some time”; “shards of...words”. Needless to say, any voice which shuns simplicity and is willing to embrace complexity with regards to refugees and asylum seekers is invaluable at the moment (is there ever a time when they aren’t?)
