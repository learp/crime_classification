The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) – a federal US agency that administers and enforces civil rights laws against workplace discrimination – looks likely to take legal action against major Hollywood studios. According to Deadline, the body is currently in talks to resolve charges that studios systemically discriminated against female directors. A source is quoted as saying: “Every one of the major studios has received a charge contending that they failed to hire women directors.”The commission began an investigation into possible legislation contraventions in October 2015. They are currently in the settlement phase but, according to the source, if unable to come to a resolution “may file a lawsuit”. During contract negotiations last December, the Directors Guild of America (DGA) urged producers to adopt a variation on the NFL’s Rooney rule, which encourages teams to consider candidates of colour when hiring coaches. The DGA urged for this to embrace other minorities – such as women – as well. Seven per cent of the films made last year were directed by women, down by 2% from the previous year. Behind the scenes roles – such as cinematographers and sound editors – are yet worse represented. This year, Ava DuVernay is the only female director with a film in contention for an Oscar, for her documentary about the US prison population, 13th.
