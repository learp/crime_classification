The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with Beyond The Wizards Sleeve: Delicious Light RN: Some widescreen kosmiche expansion from our album featuring premier tub thumper Leo Taylor.The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor Bonnie St Claire: I Surrender    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest EA: One of the ultimate BTWS DJ tracks, a mod stomper of the highest order. Every time we play it, the room ignites. It’s one of my favourite ever records, I love the way the rhythm loosens up in the chorus; it’s an incredibly clever arrangement.The track that currently gets the most rewinds The Avalanches: Subways    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest RN: Manages to both fit in and stand out among our northern soul, garage stompers and unhinged freakbeat. The crowd seemed to levitate the last time we played it.The track that’s been unfairly slept on this year Be: One EA: An absolutely beautiful record which uses the drones made by 40,000 bees as its foundations, expanded upon by Kev Bales and Tony Foster of Spiritualized and other musicians.The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding Stevie Wonder: You Are The Sunshine Of My Life    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest EA: You need to make sure there are no underlying negative messages in a wedding set. I once played Band Of Gold which is probably the worst record you could play. I’ve spent a lot of time putting a collection together; You Are The Sunshine Of My Life is a great set opener.The track I’d play at sunset in Ibiza Midlake: Roscoe (Beyond The Wizards Sleeve Re-Animation)EA: The original song is brilliant and we turned up the melancholy level to 11. The best remixes seem to write themselves, and this came about really fast. I met Midlake at a festival and they said most of their fanbase prefer our version, which was strange to hear but also rewarding to feel that you’ve contributed in a positive way.Beyond The Wizards Sleeve play Bluedot festival, Jodrell Bank, nr Macclesfield, Fri to 24 Jul
