If only I had not listened to the pieceon the morning radio about the former asylumwhose inmates were kept busyat wooden benches in a workshopmaking leather collars and wristbandsthat would later be used to restrain them.And if only that had not reminded me,as I stood facing the bathroom mirror,of the new state prison whose bricks had been setby prisoners trucked in from the old prison,how sweet and free of static my walkwould have been along the upland trail.Nothing to spoil the purity of the ascent – the early sun, wafer-white,breaking over the jagged crest of that ridge,a bird with a bright-orange chestflitting from branch to branch with its mate,and a solitary coyote that stopped in its tracksto regard me, then moved on.Plus the cottonwood fluff snowing sideways and after I stood still for a while,the coyote appearing again in the distancebefore vanishing in the scrub for good.That’s the kind of walk it might have been.• From The Rain in Portugal by Billy Collins (Picador £9.99).
