Kiersten White seemed to pour her mind into And I Darken. The words and plot flow as though they didn’t even need editing!I find each new person introduced in this book extremely charismatic – whether they were written to be daunting and fearless or sweet and sappy. Every personality is unique and realistic. I wouldn’t be surprised if the characters were at least partly based on real people.The thing I mainly enjoyed about this book was that the author shared her views on important political issues through the voices of her characters. Matters discussed in it include feminism and the social acceptability of homosexuality. What is most surprising is that it deals with modern issues, yet it’s set over six hundred years ago. The clever subtleness of these things hint at a story much larger and with many more opinions than we are being told.In conclusion; I need a sequel! There are too many things left unexplained, and too many characters with a completely different view on the story. I have a feeling this will be hugely successful – it always will be for me.
