Corey Feldman has said he is too scared to leave his home after his performance on the Today show on Friday went viral over the weekend.The former child star, who is best known for his roles in The Goonies and Stand By Me, was on the morning show to perform Go 4 It, a new song from his fifth studio album Angelic 2 the Core. The performance, which saw him don an all-black outfit and dance in a “Michael Jackson-inspired” manner, led some outlets to suggest he’d lost his mind and became a viral hit.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest During a now deleted Facebook Live video Feldman said the past 24 hours had been “really painful” and that he’s “never had such mean things said about me” during the aftermath of the performance. “We can’t get out of bed right now. We’re petrified to even go out,” he said. He continued: “I’m sorry if it’s not good enough for you, but you don’t have to beat us up. I just want to say that, like, why is it OK to, like, publicly shame us?”“It’s, like, not PC to, like, say somebody is fat or somebody is white or somebody is black or somebody is yellow or green or if they have a short leg or if they have a missing finger,” He added. “But it’s OK to bash Corey Feldman and the Angels.”Feldman recently spoke about how he felt threatened by child abusers in Los Angeles in the 1980s when he was a rising child actor. He said he was “surrounded” by abusers, with around 15 older men “leching around like vultures”.
