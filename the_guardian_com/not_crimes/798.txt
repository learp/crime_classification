“We were flying above a huge , immense desert,” says photographer, Alexander Heilner. “It was a monochromatic, rusty red colour as far as the eye could see, but in the middle was this jewel of blue and white.”It was neither oasis nor mirage. Part of the Intrepid mine, the vivid azure lagoon, so at odds with the surrounding Utah desert, is a potash evaporation pond, vital for fertiliser.Potash is a potassium-rich substance originally obtained by soaking ashes in pots of water, the process that gave it its name. But today a different method is used to obtain the commodity. Water is pumped underground to dissolve buried potash ore before being pumped into the evaporation ponds. The water is dyed deep blue to absorb heat and evaporate more quickly, leaving behind the potash and salts.Bernhard Lang's best photograph: the 'Sea of Plastic' greenhouses from the air Obsessed with “the interaction of natural landscapes and man-made structures”, Heilner goes to great lengths to capture these images. To take this shot his hired plane took sweeping circles around the potash ponds, while he leaned out of a window with his camera.Aerial shots are not just dramatic, they are also informative, Heilner explains, saying he is often asked if his landscapes have an environmental stance. “I’m not interested in dictating what’s good and bad, but I am extremely interested that people be aware of what’s happening and therefore have a knowledgeable basis of decision-making,” he says.And with Heilner’s striking images mirroring the patterns of the agricultural land the potash helps to create, he offers plenty of food for thought.
