Imagine a world where a moral or ethical mistake will be your ultimate downfall, you’ll be despised and isolated by society. You will receive a painful brand of “F” for Flawed and be forced to live life as a second class citizen, a situation enforced by a powerful but respected Guild.This is the world that Celestine lives in. Her boyfriend is the son of Judge Crevan, the head of the Guild with the power to decide whether someone is Flawed or not. She strives for perfection every day but one decision may bring her life crashing down.  We all know Cecelia Ahern can write; you don’t sell millions of books and have your novels turned into films without being extremely talented. What I was unsure of, however, was how she would cope with a change in audience and a pretty ambitious concept. It soon became clear that Flawed is one of the best written dystopian novels around.  When writing anything with a complex plot, there are so many holes you can fall into. If one book has an amazing and fully-formed concept, it probably lacks a little bit in character development and vice versa. However, Cecelia’s experience writing many novels means Flawed is close to flawless! There isn’t a single aspect of this novel that feels weak and that really sets it out from the masses of YA fiction flooding onto shelves at the moment.  Although the concept of being ostracised from society is common in YA, what sets Flawed apart is the particular emphasis on Celeste’s emotional journey, dealing with the awful consequences of being publically shunned; this makes it seem all the more real and powerful. From start to finish, Flawed grips you and holds you there right until the end, at which point I was desperate for the story to continue. I’m so glad that there is a sequel on the way as I’d love to find out how Celeste and Carrick’s stories play out. Pick up Flawed if you’re a fan of awesome YA dystopia or just if you appreciate really well written fiction.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
