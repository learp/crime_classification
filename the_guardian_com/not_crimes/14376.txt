More than 10 years ago the government instructed every local authority in England to plan for climate change. This was partly aimed at alerting councillors to the increasing dangers of river, sea and flash flooding and was also making sure planning decisions took this into account. Shortly afterwards by coincidence there was severe flooding in many parts of the UK.A recent study of 11 local authorities from the south coast to the Tees, taking in city and rural councils, has shown that over the past decade councillors have largely ignored the advice. Eight out of the nine councils in danger of river or coastal flooding have increased development in areas most at risk, and in four the rate of building in the most vulnerable areas was faster than elsewhere in their boroughs.On the coast three-quarters of local planning committees were allowing development where the coast was tumbling into the sea or sea walls likely to be overwhelmed. In urban areas five out of six local authorities are concreting over green spaces making flash flooding more likely and increasing the urban heat island effect.The government's Climate Adaptation sub-committee says local authorities are "locking in" costs for the future without any idea how the problems they create are going to be dealt with. The only bright spot in the report was that many developers had got the message. Some were building in defences, like raising the electrics above likely flood level.
