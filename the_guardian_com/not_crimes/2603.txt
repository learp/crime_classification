Laughter, fights, gossip ... So many things happen around the kitchen table, and eating is the fuel for all of it. I remember the day I moved into my house in London; the only request to the landlord was a table that could seat 10 in an otherwise unfurnished property.During my childhood in Crete, I spent most evenings in our family seafood restaurant. Rather than playing hide-and-seek with the other children, I’d usually be out back peeling a sack of potatoes or gutting fish. By day, I would go around with my blue notebook and write down all the recipes I wanted to prepare for my family.It all began with the wisdom of “the grannies”. In the summer months, when schools were shut, I would wake up in the morning and go downstairs to thia (aunt) Koula’s house. She always got her food started in the morning. We would sit in the kitchen at her large wooden table covered with a plastic tablecloth and fake lace and sip on Greek coffee with sweet sesame biscuits and plan the day’s cooking.She cooked the purest food I have ever known. She had animals, a garden, olive trees, grape vines and she knew all there was to know about wild food in Crete. Everything on her kitchen table was grown by her or made by her hands – I realise now what a luxury that was.She taught me how to make dolmades (stuffed vine leaves), how to keep greens green by rubbing them with salt while you are washing them, how to search for snails in the wild, how to eat carobs straight from the tree and how to love artichokes. I would often go tomato picking with thia Koula. Planted in long rows in the garden, the plants were firmly assisted by thick sticks and pieces of string trying to stop the heavy fruits from touching the ground. She was very particular about her tomatoes; one basket would be for the ones she used for cooking and the other for the ones she used for eating – or those she kept to eat raw in salads.When the sun was hot and the tomatoes tasted like honey, we would make the best tomato fritters. I still remember the first time I tasted them. The tomatoes, which you could smell before you even saw them, the fresh mint, the wild oregano ... the whole kitchen seemed to burst with the sweetness and aromas of summer.I also loved having a fresh tomato salad with fried fish. Sometimes, I would pinch a few lovely anchovies or sardines from the bucket of almost alive fish that Dad would use for bait, then fry them. They were the best snack in the early evening after a long day on the beach.Dad had a lot of small and strange fish in that bucket he brought home. They were intended for kakavia – the fisherman’s fish soup – which was my worst nightmare, as I had to clean dozens of tiny fish, sometimes covered with horrible spikes. When an eel was included, even though it was long and slippery – so harder to prepare – the soup came out perfectly. Kakavia is all about the gelatin; the more gelatinous the fish the better. So, you either use a variety of small fish or a lovely big one, such as a turbot (like below).We would sit around the table with the big pot in the centre and ladle it out. I remember making my way through the fish slowly, eating every bit of meat attached to each one, then sucking all the lovely flavours from their heads. We would crush barley rusks into the broth and sit there picking for hours, indulging gradually in this simple, traditional creation of Cretan fishermen that has been passed down through the generations.Fisherman’s soupServes 41kg medium potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters1 turbot (around 1.5-2kg), scaled, gutted and cut into 5 pieces, including the head300g tomatoes, chopped2 celery sticks4 bay leavesSalt400ml extra virgin olive oil600ml waterJuice of 2 lemonsParsley leaves4 langoustines or prawns1 Use a saucepan that will fit the potatoes snugly in a single layer at the bottom of the pan. After adding the potatoes, add the fish, followed by the tomatoes, celery, bay leaves, salt, olive oil and water. The liquid will partly cover the fish, but not entirely.2 Put the saucepan over a high heat and bring to the boil. Cover with a lid and continue to boil for another 20 minutes. Shake the pan every so often, but never stir the contents. Before you turn the soup off, make sure the potatoes are soft. Add the lemon juice and parsley leaves, then give the pan a final shake. Turn off the heat, add the langoustines or prawns and let it sit for 15 minutes before serving.3 To serve, use a slotted spoon or fish slice to transfer the fish to a platter very carefully. Divide the soup and potatoes into bowls. Add a langoustine to each plate. In Crete, we serve this soup with barley rusks, but lovely toasted sourdough will work perfectly too.Tomato and oregano frittersServes 4500g fresh red ripe tomatoes (ideally Raf or bull’s heart)2 red onions2 tbsp wild oreganoSalt and black pepper1-2 handfuls of self-raising flour – enough to finish up with a thick but not stiff mixture4 tbsp fresh mint, choppedVegetable oil, for frying1 Finely dice the tomatoes and red onions, then put in a bowl. Add all the remaining ingredients and check the seasoning. The mixture should be thick, but not stiff.2 Fill a frying pan with oil to a depth of at least 2cm. Heat the oil over a medium heat. When hot, add a spoonful of the mix into the hot oil. Lower the heat and cook the fritters on both sides until golden. Transfer to kitchen towel to drain. Repeat with the remaining mix. Eat while hot.Fried anchovies with lemon, potato and chopped herb saladServes 4500g Cyprus potatoes1 small bunch each of parsley, mint and dill, choppedOlive oil, for dressing and fryingSalt and black pepperJuice and zest of 2 lemons, plus extra cut into wedges to serve500g fresh anchovies, cleaned and kept whole (trim the head if preferred) Zest of 1 orangeFlour, for dusting the fish1 Wash, peel and cut the potatoes into halves, then put into a pot of salty water. Cook gently over a medium heat until ready. Remove from the water and drain in a colander. When cool enough to handle, cut into discs and put in a bowl.2 Chop all the herbs finely, season with salt and toss them in 2 tbsp olive oil. Heat a pan over a high heat and, when hot, but not smoking, add the herbs for 1-2 minutes, or until wilted. Remove from the pan and add to the potatoes. Season to taste with olive oil, some lemon juice and extra salt, if needed.3 Meanwhile, fill a pan with at least 4cm olive oil. Season the anchovies generously with salt. Add the lemon and orange zest to the anchovies and dust them in the flour.4 When the oil is hot, fry the anchovies, carefully, until golden – do this in batches if necessary. Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate lined with kitchen towel to absorb any excess oil.5 Season the potato salad with more lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper, then serve immediately with extra wedges of lemon on the plate.Marianna Leivaditaki is head chef at London mezze/tapas bar Morito
