TVStranger Things (available 15 July)This fun supernatural thriller is an ode to all things 80s, from Stephen King to Steven Spielberg. For ultimate nostalgia points, it also stars Winona Ryder. She plays Joyce, whose son Will goes missing from small-town Hawkins, Indiana, in creepy circumstances. As she becomes convinced she can converse with her son via ouija board, the town decides she’s unhinged – until monsters start to show up in the shadows. Meanwhile, Will’s friends set off on their bikes with rucksacks full of snacks, ET-style, to track him down. They’re helped by their new friend Eleven, a mysterious arrival with telekinetic powers that mean she can break a baddie’s neck with just a thought, make bullies wet themselves, make trucks fly – and talk to Will via walkie-talkie. Looks set to be the TV event of the summer.Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (available now)Finally, someone in the UK has picked up the brave, brilliant, goofball musical romcom that won Rachel Bloom a fully-deserved Golden Globe.

There, she gets a job at a strip-mall law firm and vows to win Josh’s heart.
