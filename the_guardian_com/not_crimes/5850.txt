Somebody Stop Ivy Pocket is Ivy Pocket’s second adventure. She now lives with a pair of coffin makers who treat her like a maid. But then she discovers a way of using the Clock Diamond (a priceless diamond necklace that came into Ivy’s possession in the first book) to reach her friend, who is trapped in another world!While all this is happening, Estelle Dumbleby asks Ivy to help her find her missing brother, Sebastian. Will Ivy be able to solve her friend’s troubles, as well as her own?I like this book because it is very funny and exciting. The best bit is a surprise discovery Ivy makes near the end of the book, but I can’t reveal that or it will spoil it! I love how rude Ivy is and the way she speaks. I can’t wait for the third book to come out!Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
