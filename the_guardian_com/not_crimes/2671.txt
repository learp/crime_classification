For those who enjoy the “posh bingo” of book awards, this is an unusually bleak midwinter. A year ago, denizens of the Westminster lobby and the book world gathered in London’s giant Imax cinema for the Paddy Power political book awards, and a week later the Folio prize shortlist was unveiled. Neither will take place in 2016 because the sponsors have respectively come to the end of their agreed term and pulled out (among those disappointed will be Lord Ashcroft, also a backer of the Paddy Power awards, whose David Cameron biography has been denied its chance of silverware). Organisers talk hopefully of reviving both awards under different names, but there are few precedents for a comeback after such a hiatus.Another winter casualty appears to be the Hatchet Job of the Year prize, last given in February 2014, but the thinning out is happening in the warmer months, too. The Independent foreign fiction prize will also disappear as a name and separate entity, as it is being incorporated into the Man Booker International prize. Jim Crace, the 20th winner of the €100,000 International Impac Dublin literary award in 2015, could well be the last as Impac and its trust fund are no more (though the prize retained the same name last year, Crace’s cash was from Dublin alone). “There is absolutely no sign of a [new] sponsor whatsoever,” said a city councillor at the time of the ceremony.Reflecting the same mood the Samuel Johnson prize found itself seeking fresh funding last year and did eventually come up with a replacement backer (as the Booker, Whitbread and the Orange prizes had all previously managed), though details of how it will work as the Baillie Gifford prize have yet to emerge. Not so successful have been two prize-givings previously backed by Specsavers: the televised Crime Thriller awards, bringing together books, films and TV series, and the once-mighty National Book awards, AKA the Nibbies (after a Nibbies-free 2015, the latter’s website talks of “negotiating an exciting TV deal” for 2016).Despite this gloomy context – and notwithstanding the peculiarity of its much-mocked format, and regime changes at its sponsor – one winter prize remains a fixture, and it reaches its climax on 26 January, when the Costa category winners compete against each other for the £30,000 book of the year award. Perhaps surprisingly, the first novel winner, Andrew Michael Hurley’s The Loney (only able to be entered at all because the award’s administrators agreed to loosen their rules on publication dates), is currently the short-odds favourite at 6/4, followed by Kate Atkinson at 3/1, Andrea Wulf at 4/1 and Don Paterson and Frances Hardinge both on 5/1.
