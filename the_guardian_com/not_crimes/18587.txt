7.58pm GMT19:58So that’s it for another Strictly week! We’ve made it past the half way point of the series, and things are starting to hot up on the Strictly dancefloor. I’m sorry this weekend has been a bit...alternative, but I’m in the liveblog chair every week now until the very end. So that’s pre-Blackpool, Blackpool, post-Blackpool, quarter-finals, semi-finals, Grand Final. Thank you as ever for joining in, have a brilliant week, and I’ll see you at 6.55pm next Saturday!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.57pm GMT19:57Laura and Giovanni take to the floor to shaggy-haired 80s crooner Michael Bolton’s ‘How Am I Supposed To Live Without You?’ Think of the lie-ins, Laura.

I’m sad to see them go, they had amazing chemistry and gave us a filthy Tango to remember. Their goodbye speeches are oddly polite and formal, like for some reason they don’t want to reveal that they really, really fancy each other. Either that, or they’ve had a row.Updatedat 8.01pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.53pm GMT19:53Laura and Giovanni’s dance was much better too – although it’s still too much about Giovanni. Still, they were hardly going to change the routine for my benefit. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.53pm GMT19:53Also, those white trousers.

Also I’m a sucker for a plastic day-glo palm tree. If anything I’d say this time is better, and the lifts still look pretty impressive.

FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.43pm GMT19:43So the Ed, Greg and Rinder fandom trains rumble on, which means two of them at least are going to Blackpool. I know Louise and Danny are technically better dancers, but I’d rather watch these three any day - they’ve all made such huge progress, and it’s such a pleasure to watch. Is 2016 going to be a big underdog year, I wonder?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.42pm GMT19:42So who is up against Ore and Joanne in tonight’s Dance Off? Louise and Kevin are safe, along with Ed and Katya (YAAAAAAS), Judge Rinder and Oksana and Claudia and AJ!Which means LAURA AND GIOVANNI in the bottom two! This one could go either way, to be honest. I mean, clearly I know which way it goes, but if I didn’t know I’d be wondering which way it was going to go, you know? Oh forget it.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.37pm GMT19:37Time for Len’s Lens. You’re about to see something that will make you like Kevin From Grimsby. Brace yourselves.

Some of those actual ladies are singing on the steps, which I thought was rather fabulous. Meanwhile the pro dancers are doing some barefoot contempo-wafting whilst dressed as sunflowers. I find myself torn re. Gary Barlow. Is it possible to be a tax-dodging Tory and still be a really nice man? It’s so confusing. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.29pm GMT19:29So who is in safely through to next week (AKA not-quite Blackpool), and who is the first couple in the bottom two? Danny and Oti are safe, along with Daisy and Aljaz (OMG) and Greg and Natalie!The first couple in the bottom is…ORE AND JOANNE! There was an audible gasp when this was announced last night, what an absolute shocker. Of course we couldn’t vote because they took our phones away, which means you guys HAD ONE JOB AND YOU ENTIRELY FAILED.

You can’t help but look, don’t judge me.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.25pm GMT19:25Last night on Strictly – too many firework metaphors (DRINK) and some brilliant dancing, at least from where I was sitting. My highlights: Judge Rinder’s Quickstep, Ore’s Salsa shimmy, Natalie snubbing Greg on the chaise longue, Ed’s footwork, Chas & Dave, and the double prop whammy of both Strictly Lamppost and Café Table in Louise and Kevin’s Argentine. Lowlights: Daisy and Aljaz’s sugary Viennese (bleurgh), Claudia and AJ’s Pop Paso (stop it), Giovanni’s shameless limelight theft and Tess’s awful one-shouldered polyester pantsuit, which I can attest looked no better close up.Couldn’t get excited about either Danny and Oti’s Jive or Louise and Kevin’s Argentine Tango – although I’ve watched both again today on YouTube and there’s no doubt that both have partners who bring out the best in them. Also the music for both was fab-u-luss.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
