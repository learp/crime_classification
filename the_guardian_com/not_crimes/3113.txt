Poem With Two EndingsSay ‘death’ and the whole room freezes –even the couches stop moving,even the lamps.Like a squirrel suddenly aware it is being looked at.Say the word continuously,and things begin to go forward.Your life takes onthe jerky texture of an old film strip.Continue saying it,hold it moment after moment inside the mouth,it becomes another syllable.A shopping mall swirls around the corpse of a beetle.Death is voracious, it swallows all the living.Life is voracious, it swallows all the dead.Neither is ever satisfied, neither is ever filled,each swallows and swallows the world.The grip of life is as strong as the grip of death.(but the vanished, the vanished beloved, o where?)In a review of Jane Hirshfield’s recent essay collection, Ten Windows: How Great Poems Transform the World, in the New York Journal of Books, Larry Smith writes that the poet is “a practising Buddhist, but she is not confined by this and speaks to the largest audience of poetry lovers.” Hirshfield’s popularity is no doubt founded on the desire for poems that investigate large ideas in plain language, often through imagery from the natural world, and, without seeming to preach, offer the psychological or ecological insight often miscalled “spirituality”.Hirshfield herself has noted the importance of compassion, expressed by the reader as, “Someone else has felt as I felt.” This is a factor in her appeal, certainly, and it’s part of what drew me to this week’s poem. At the same time, a writer may freely share her suffering and other experiences with the reader, and leave the latter cold. Technique is important, tone only a little less so. Perhaps a stronger clue to the appeal of Hirshfield’s work comes in the same interview when she refers to “window moments” – points in the poem at which it changes focus, and seems to look out at a new, illuminating view. This is, perhaps, the larger-scale equivalent of the “cutting word” in the haiku, a form highly valued by Hirshfield. For all the Zen-like intensity of their gaze and simplicity of means, Hirshfield’s poems are touched by a polytheistic imagination. They’re alert to the numinous and often allude to “the gods” and to an idea that the gods are fickle and may take back a portion of the generous gifts bestowed. The titles she favours for poems and collections are often a microcosm of her major theme. Life and death are pitted in an endless cycle, and there is no victor, no reconciliation, no redemption. As in Kelly Grovier’s recently featured poem The Three Rs, language takes a central place in Poem With Two Endings. This time, it’s a word, not a phrase, and the specific word is “death”. The difficulty of uttering the word serves as metonymy for the difficulty of the experience itself. The difficulty embraces psychological and philosophical resistance: death is a concept life finds indigestible. Time ought to be stopped, but clearly, for the survivors, it goes on, raggedly but inexorably: “your life takes on / the jerky texture of an old film strip”. The poem initially presents an icy stasis – “even” the couches and lamps have stopped moving (were they moving earlier because swimming in tears?) like “a squirrel suddenly aware it is being looked at”. It’s the repeated uttering of the awful word that gets time’s engine restarted, and this involves defamiliarising it by repetition, bereaving it until it’s a meaningless syllable. This is all quite ordinary – until Hirshfield delivers her master-stroke – the image of the corpse of the beetle, itself a tiny word, with the pitiless ecology of the “shopping mall” evoking polysyllabic noise, clustered living bodies and magnified iridescence. Each death, it suggests, each corpse, can be immensely insignificant, and as immensely significant at the same time.

Much more than a stanza break, it suggests a whole absent stanza. So it might better be compared to an unfurnished room, a room where there should be many things but where there is nothing but the recognition of loss. And, almost while that shock is registering, the last line, gentled by parenthesis, utters its unanswerable cri de coeur, “(but the vanished, the vanished beloved, o where?)” This is a new but wholly authentic voice in the poem. It doesn’t obliterate the sturdily stated paradox of the two endings: “Death is voracious, it swallows all the living. / Life is voracious, it swallows all the dead.” It simply adds the insatiable, tremulous, desolate human note.Poem With Two Endings is from Jane Hirshfield’s Each Happiness Ringed by Lions: Selected Poems. Hirshfield has published several collections, since, most recently The Beauty, but the Bloodaxe “Selected” remains an excellent introduction for new readers.
