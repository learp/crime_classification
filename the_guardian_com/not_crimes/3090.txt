The filming of Colin Firth’s forthcoming disaster movie Kursk has been delayed after the Russian defence ministry failed to provide a permit on time.Colin Firth to star in Russian submarine disaster film Kursk According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Thomas Vinterberg-directed submarine drama was planned to begin shooting start next month but the review process has taken longer than expected.“We haven’t yet received a permit from the defence ministry,” producer Andrei Sigle told local radio station Radio Baltika. “They probably have other things to take care of.”Rather than move production to another country, such as Norway, Sigle aims to wait for a green light from the Russian government, who had initially promised cooperation. There have been suggestions that the defence ministry grew concerned over giving the crew access to classified locations and information.Kursk, which is also being produced by Luc Besson, will tell the true story of a 2000 accident where a torpedo exploded inside a Russian submarine. Matthias Schoenaerts also stars.It’s set to be Vinterberg’s most large-scale project yet, following up Thomas Hardy adaptation Far from the Madding Crowd and last month’s 1970s-set Danish drama The Commune.
