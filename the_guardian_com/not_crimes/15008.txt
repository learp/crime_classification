Its huge natural amphitheatre and expansive green fields have arguably made the Glastonbury festival as famous as the bands it puts on. But according to its founder, this summer could be the last time in its current dairy farm location. Michael Eavis, who started the Glastonbury festival on his farm in 1970, told a crowd at Oxford University that the festival is “looking to potentially move in 2017”, according to the Twitter feed of the Oxford Union, the debating society that hosted his speech.Oxford Union (@OxfordUnion)Eavis: #Glastonbury is so big, we're looking to potentially move in 2017, it's a huge operation and the site might not be suitable any moreMay 2, 2016The festival’s location has often seen 175,000 attendees battling the mud at Worthy Farm.
