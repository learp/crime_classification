Andrew Michael Hurley’s slice of Lancashire-set gothic horror The Loney has beaten some of the year’s biggest-hitting novels to be named book of the year at the British Book Industry awards.The Loney by Andrew Michael Hurley review – a gothic masterpiece First published in a limited print run of just 300 copies by independent publisher Tartarus Press, The Loney tells of a pilgrimage to the Lancashire coast, “that strange nowhere between the Wyre and the Lune [where] the neap tides would reveal the skeletons of those who thought they could escape its insidious currents”. Word-of-mouth success with the small Yorkshire publisher meant it went on to be acquired by John Murray, and to win the Costa first novel award in January.The British Book Industry awards, for “books that have been both well-written and brilliantly published”, called The Loney a “true British success story”. “A debut novel suspended between literary gothic and supernatural horror, it was written by an unknown author in his 40s, who worked part-time for 10 years to be able to write,” said organisers of the awards, which are run by The Bookseller magazine. “[The Loney] quickly became the hot literary novel, with almost 100 times its original print run.” The Loney beat titles including Paula Hawkins’s international hit The Girl on the Train, and Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchman to the top prize at the British Book Industry awards this evening. The award for non-fiction book of the year went to Lars Mytting and Robert Ferguson’s guide to wood-chopping, Norwegian Wood, a title which organisers said “demonstrated great publisher faith and vision”, while best children’s book was won by David Solomons’s My Brother is a Superhero.Andrew Michael Hurley: how the north made The Loney a gothic horror Hanya Yanagihara’s A Little Life, which was shortlisted for the 2015 Man Booker prize and is shortlisted for this year’s Baileys prize, took the fiction book of the year, ahead of shortlisted books by authors including EL James and Hawkins.“It’s been a fascinating process to consider so many brilliantly published books and think about what it is that makes a book catch fire,” said chair of judges Cathy Rentzenbrink, a contributing editor at The Bookseller. “All our judging meetings were lively and opinionated as we looked at the stories behind the stories. From A Little Life, Norwegian Wood and My Brother is a Superhero to overall winner The Loney, these books tell an important story about British publishing – that originality and individuality really count.”
