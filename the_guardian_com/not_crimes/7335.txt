Mose Allison, the influential jazz and blues pianist and singer, died on 15 November aged 89.The artist, whose hybrid southern style won him fans across the world for over six decades, died of natural causes, his wife, Audre Allison, confirmed.Allison grew up in the Mississippi Delta region of the States, and his music draws on jazz and the blues he was surrounded by in those formative years, along with with a dash of country. Overall, however, his sound was triumphantly difficult to define.  “I’ve always had a category problem, that’s for sure,” Allison told the LA Times in 1991. “There’s a lot of blues in what I do. It’s still primarily jazz, but there’s a lot of influences thrown in there.”The musician, whose songs have been covered by Van Morrison, the Who, the Clash, Elvis Costello and the Yardbirds, received the prestigious National Endowment for the Arts jazz masters fellowship in 2013. As a child, Allison picked cotton and worked in the fields, but started taking piano lessons at school.“There was always a piano in the house,” he told the Sacramento Bee in 2003. “My dad was a stride player, playing ragtime-type stuff. My mother sent me to a good piano teacher in the Mississippi Delta, and I took lessons for a few years. But as soon as I realised I could pick out things by ear, I quit taking lessons.”After soaking up blues and boogie-woogie during his teens, he studied at the University of Mississippi for a year, then joined the military in 1946 and played in the army band. In 1956 he moved to New York, where he embarked on a career that would see him performing with jazz legends such as Stan Getz and Gerry Mulligan. A year later he released his first album, Back Country Suite, on the Prestige label – the first of over 30 he would record.Allison is survived by his son and three daughters, including the singer-songwriter Amy Allison.
