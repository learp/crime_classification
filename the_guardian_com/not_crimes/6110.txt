A boy sings to the bird.He carries a blue gas canister.Where shall I go? I have no home. I had a placebut guests cameand they remained. Where shall I go?He leads us through the village. One cockerel. A pile of shoesoutside a curtained door.We sit on orange cushions. Children bring us tea and bread.I wish we had brought gifts. I hope we know when to leave.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Guest Room______________________The First Shot      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest One daya shot rang through the mountains. It rang and rang.Children from the villageran from their housesto claim what was left.Todaytheir eyes stare through usto vast light. They draw closecalling to each otheras they gather at the side of the roadcarrying slingsto stone us.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest ______________________The Hand      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest People pass the hand. There are sounds of car horns and music. People pass the hand that begs. Three boys in hoods fold their armsand swerve away from the hand, the hand that begs in the rain. A woman in blue will not lookat the hand that begs,stretching out in the rain.People come and go, looking at their phones.Nobody takes the handstretching out, shining in the rain. In the hollow of the handis a folded squareof paper, but nobody looks twice at the white paperthat gleams in the hand that begs, stretching out and shining in the rain.

His white stick taps the groundforever. Above the rooftopsa solitary dove sings three notes over and over:spare some change, spare some changeover the roof of the shopping mall, spare some changeover the roof of the government building, over the roof of the Supreme CourtThe earth yawns and turns its face a millimetre.The moon holds up an empty plateabove the corner of 1st and D, above the gathering of men and women.
