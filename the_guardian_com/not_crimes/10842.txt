9.02pm BST21:02WHEW. Okay, good chat people. This was fun. Thanks for the comments everyone! Batter week looks like great fun. Things can only get, etc.If anyone wants to tweet vile abuse or unsolicited breadsticks at me, I’m @whatsamadder, and here is where all my Guardian inanity resides. Gonna plunge my fingers into a pool of water icier than Paul Hollywood’s eyes now. See you next week!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.59pm BST20:59Star Baker crowned- Tom!Doughsaster for Michael, but Tom proved himself a worthy winner. There’s only room for one babyface. Andrew better watch himself.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.58pm BST20:58Everyone looks shell shocked. Because Tom won with a giant set of bread genitals. Now that IS peak Bakeoff.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.57pm BST20:57Michael goes out! Draped, not literally, in the flag of his people. And his mum. I actually feel quite emotional about this. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.56pm BST20:56A sight for Thor eyes! It’s hammer time! Imagine saying that if Tom wasn’t the winner. (It was Tom.) But who’s going?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.56pm BST20:56Kate and Tom in the running, plus Eddie. I mean Tom. Candice is in trouble! What is happening. I can’t watch. Which professionally speaking is a problem.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.55pm BST20:55Ooh, Kate’s corn maiden is glorious in every way. Can’t believe she made horses look like that as a child.LorraineCandice has made an ambitious go of it, but not quite pulled it off. She looks ready to self-combust with frustration. Oh Candice. Send in Selasi, I say. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.53pm BST20:53Benjamina impresses on all counts- where did that come from? I wasn’t paying attention. Paul calls BS on Selasi’s Bedouin confusion, and Mary asks Michael if he’s trying to bribe the judges with alcohol. ‘I’ll drink mine afterwards.’ All back to Mary’s!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.52pm BST20:52A catchphrase for our timeBlonde (@Blonde_M)Totally using that when I want to turn up drunk at work. "I'm not a mess, I'm informal." #GBBOSeptember 7, 2016FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.51pm BST20:51Tom has actually done well, and Andrew’s harvest basket looks like the Arc de Triomphe and is beautifully flavoured. Mel and Sue make him wear it on his head and he shuffles off like a maid from a politically incorrect Mikado.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.50pm BST20:50Judging time. Jane impresses with her chorizo and pesto loaves. Val’s ark is ‘informal’ according to Berry, ‘raw’ according to Paul. It’s oversalted ‘like the sea’. The sarcasm is strong with this one. Who knew? FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.49pm BST20:49Lot of votes for Candice as Lorraine Chase. People are saying Andrew looks like Frank Spencer? I’m looking at him now and I can’t see past Eddie Redmayne. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.48pm BST20:48Tension. Val has cut her finger. Selasi is going to bake until the last minute. Andrew looks on the edge of a panic attack. Hollywood is pacing the perimeter. Pace softly Paul, for you tread on their dreams. *Paul straps on Doc Martens*FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.46pm BST20:46They all seem to be trading proofing time against baking time. It’s bad math whichever way you cut it. Michael seems confident though.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.45pm BST20:45I apologise, but I didn’t start this- Tom has woven a gigantic cock and balls from his bread plaits. ‘It’s a T for Tom, or Thor,’ he insists to a gobsmacked Mel. Cannot wait till Paul has to eat that. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.45pm BST20:45I’m keeping an eye on this iPhone launch. It also launches with Super Mario Run. I mean WHO CARESFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.44pm BST20:44Everyone seems to have a better handle on proofing now. Plaiting bread braids is challenging the boys, except Andrew. In true Andrew style, he’s engineering a three dimensional lattice that can no doubt take the weight of twenty men. Kate also has prior- ‘I used to do this with my pony’s tail.’ She has surely got this sewn up.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.42pm BST20:42More guess the smell! It’s got legs!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
