A golden lion on red silk once thrown over a king’s horse, a pair of gold and silk slippers peeled from the mummified feet of a bishop when his tomb was opened after 600 years and a lute being played by an angel on horseback are being gathered together at the V&A museum – precious survivors of an art form in which England once led the world.The V&A’s autumn exhibition Opus Anglicanum: Masterpieces of English Medieval Embroidery, will be the first in more than half a century devoted to this beautiful embroidery work, coveted by kings and popes – and for the first time in decades, the museum has dared to use Latin in an exhibition title. It means “English work”, and curator Glyn Davies said it demonstates how across Europe, people associated the dazzling skill and luxurious materials with English needle-workers.

Others, from cathedral treasuries including Toledo, show how far the fashion spread through direct commissions and diplomatic gifts. Vestments from Reykjavík in Iceland were possibly commissioned as a gift to the church by some fabulously wealthy merchant with a guilty conscience – the thread, glittering as if new, proved to be almost pure gold.

Photograph: Victoria and Albert MuseumThe sheer opulence of the materials, including little pearls and gems stitched into the fabric, doomed many of the items when they fell out of fashion or favour after the Reformation and there were bonfires of precious fabrics to recover the gold and silver from the thread.The secular pieces are particularly rare, Browne said. “Ninety percent of what survives today comes from churches where pieces were often carefully stored, but the secular pieces were worn out or cut up.”Some items, such as the bishop’s slippers, survived by being buried with their owners. Others were recycled: a panel of embroidery that probably came from a magnificent set of bed curtains was chopped up and stitched on to a priest’s chasuble, made from carefully pieced-together fragments of a woman’s gown of magnificent Italian patterned silk. A tunic of crimson and dark blue velvet survived for centuries, hanging over the tomb of the Black Prince in Canterbury Cathedral.Elizabethan tapestry map to be displayed at University of Oxford's Bodleian library The musical angel was once part of a cope – a ceremonial priestly cloak – which became an altar cloth for the small parish church of Steeple Aston in Oxfordshire. As early as 1844, it was recorded as “a very valuable relic of the olden time”, but nothing in the parish records indicates any patron rich enough to give such a precious item to a comparatively modest church. It has been on loan to the V&A for safekeeping for more than a century.Most charming of all, said Davies and Brown, are the lively animals, including lions sticking out their tongues, horses rolling their eyes, a potbellied dragon, a goat scrambling to reach greener shoots and a shepherd’s dog barking furiously to try and alert its owner – as he sits playing a bagpipes made of a cat’s skin, complete with head – to the angel in the sky above him.
