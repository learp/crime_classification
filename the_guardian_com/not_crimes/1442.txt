Now, listen kids. When a man offers you a white pill and tells you it’ll definitely make everything so much better: JUST SAY NO. Even if the man is your husband and you have been sneezing and your eyes are streaming because your allergies have gone mental, and it’s just an antihistamine. Don’t do it, ok? Or don’t do it unless you can then retire to bed for about eight hours. Or at least before you read the packet that warns it will induce drowsiness and you shouldn’t drive after taking it. And definitely, definitely don’t do it if you are about to go on an 18 mile run. Good, glad we cleared that up, then. So, tell me about your weekend running, folks. Did it, like mine, involve a sort of weird hazy run through foggy treacle before you finally sweated out the drugs, which was pretty much the exact point you realised that, in said haze, you had managed to drop the gel you had bought with you? No? Just me then. So, share your tales of triumphs, PBs, PWs, injury woes and physio-prescribed exercises (the Clam, right? it’s always the Clam. Physio rule one: give them the Clam) below the line as always. And someone bring me a caffeine drip.
