The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with Tabu Ley: Haffi Deo   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It’s my signature tune, I’ve played it to death on the show. I think I’ll start bringing a bit of showbiz glam to my shows by having someone come out and put this on to set the vibe right and build the anticipation before I come on from just behind the monitor.The track that got me out of bed this morning Prefab Sprout: Looking For Atlantis   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I love Paddy: turbo joy, yearning and a mention of Atlantis. Keeps me sane and happy.The track I wish I’d signed to my label Harry Case: Carry Me Home   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Incorporating the holy trinity of what I look for in music: tropical, joyous and slightly wonky. I’d have put this on one side and a 15-minute extended version with extra whistling on the other.The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding Joe Bataan: Continental Square Dance   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Weddings can be stressful, families can be stressful. I’d get the standard Angels request and reply with Joe Bataan instead.The track I wish I’d never played John Coltrane: Naima   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I remember once, back in the day before audiophiles and cocktail makers synergised and one had to play in pubs full of ingrates, I played this and someone came over and said when are you going to stop playing shit nursery rhymes and start playing proper music. Very saddening.The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor Prince: Uptown   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Sometimes there’s no saving somebody from their iPhone so I’d rescue myself with the best track about the best party with the best people.The track I’d play at sunset in Ibiza Donnie & Joe Emerson: Baby   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I could easily have answered every question with this song but I have learned to control the urge to play it constantly.The best track by my favourite new artist Dog And Fox: Who Gets The Cows?This one sends me off into space. My label is forthcoming; this will be the first release.Charlie Bones presents The Do!! You!!! Breakfast Show, Monday to Friday, 9am, NTS Radio
