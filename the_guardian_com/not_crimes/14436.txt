BP has declared itself "back on the right path" following the difficulties of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill with annual profits bouncing back from a $3.7bn (£2.3bn) loss to a $25.7bn profit.A 14% increase in the dividend to eight cents per share for the final three months of 2011 was a clear signal of management confidence although net debt still lies at almost $30bn."BP is on the right path," said Bob Dudley, the chief executive who took over from Tony Hayward following the Deepwater Horizon accident."2012 will be a year of increasing investment and milestones as we build on the foundations laid last year. As we move through 2013 and 2014, we expect financial momentum will build as we complete payments into the Gulf of Mexico Trust Fund, restore high-value production and bring new projects on stream," he added.The dividend hike was the first since the company resumed payouts last year and had been eagerly anticipated by the City.It came as the oil group reported a fourth quarter profit of $7.6bn, boosted by higher oil prices. The group increased its oil and gas reserves by 103% over the last 12 months through new discoveries although this did not take account of any asset disposals.BP said it had won "unparalleled" access to new exploration prospects in 2011 and is now increasing spending for the new financial year – from $19bn to $22bn."We believe this resulted in more new net acreage than accessed by any of our peers in 2011," said Dudley. "We now have a robust pipeline of opportunities with exploration prospects that will generate new resources and projects well into the next decade. We will see a continued ramp up of exploration over the next two to three years."BP expects to drill 12 exploration wells in the coming year, twice the number during 2011, and will have eight drilling rigs operating in the US Gulf where an oil spill from the Macondo well in the spring of 2010 caused 11 deaths and devastated beaches.The London-based energy group has already sold off $20bn worth of properties to raise money to pay for liabilities flowing from Macondo and intends to dispose of a further $18bn by the end of next year.BP will face the beginning of a key legal trial in New Orleans into the spill later this month but Dudley said he was still hoping some out-of-court settlement could be arranged with the US department of justice."As I have said before, we are prepared to settle if we can do so on fair and reasonable terms, but equally, if this is not possible, we are preparing vigorously for trial."Shares in BP rose 2p to 492p in early trading.
