Big Brother is to be investigated by Ofcom after more than 600 people complained to the media regulator about sex scenes shown on the Channel 5 reality show.Big Brother, which is regularly one of UK television’s most-complained-about shows, prompted another Ofcom inquiry after contestants Laura Carter and Marco Pierre White Jr were involved in some of the most explicit sex scenes in the show’s 16-year history.The celebrity chef’s son was shown putting his hand down his fellow housemate’s knickers, pulling up her top and asking her to “choke” him with a belt.Miss Great Britain loses title after having sex on ITV2's Love Island Ofcom said it had received 634 complaints about the scenes which were broadcast on the 9pm show, just after the watershed, on 12 June.A spokesperson for the regulator said: “We’re investigating whether sexual scenes in this episode of Big Brother exceeded generally accepted standards for its time of broadcast.”Viacom-owned Channel 5 declined to comment.White, who became the first housemate to be evicted from Big Brother on Friday, said he had “no regrets” about his on-screen shenanigans despite being engaged to fiancee Kim Melville-Smith.He said he had been given a “hall pass” by his fiancee to do what he liked in the Big Brother house but said the pair would “just be friends for the moment”, suggesting there will be no nuptials any time soon.“The arrangement we had was that I was given a hall pass. Basically a free pass to do anything I wanted, or what I believed,” he told ITV’s This Morning on Monday.“Maybe I did push it too far and take full blame. I’m in contact with her at the moment and just spoke to her now and I think we’ve decided to see how it goes over the next couple of weeks and just be friends for the moment.”“I think Kim’s a great person. I don’t regret anything to do with Laura, I think she’s a great person as well, but I do feel guilty … I feel bad,” he told the ITV programme.“Did I forget she’d be watching? No, I knew she’d be watching, but when you are in the Big Brother house you do forget the outside world sometimes, it’s crazy in there.”He said it was “once in a lifetime to go on Big Brother and you’ve got to make the most out of it and have as much fun as you can in there because the house does get really boring … so I don’t regret anything I did”.Big Brother, which began on Channel 4 in 2000 before being axed after a decade and later switching to Channel 5, is regularly among Ofcom’s most-complained-about shows. It is made by Initial, part of the Endemol Shine group which is part-owned by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox.
