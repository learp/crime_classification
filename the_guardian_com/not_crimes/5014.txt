Reports have suggested there is renewed support at the very top of government for an airport in the Thames estuary – an idea floated by Boris Johnson, whose support led to it being nicknamed "Boris Island". But what would the mayor's fantasy island actually look like?Where would it be?Various proposals have been put forward in the four decades since the idea was first mooted, including man-made islands in the estuary. But the latest focus has been plans drawn up and unveiled last November by architect Sir Norman Foster to build on the edge of the Isle of Grain – the easternmost point of the Hoo peninsula, opposite Sheerness in Kent.How big would it be?The airport could carry 150m passengers a year – double the current number passing through Heathrow.How would you get there?It would be a hub big enough to take connecting flights from Scotland and elsewhere in the UK for transfers to long-haul flights. But most passengers would arrive via high-speed connections – a new rail link straight on to the current London-Folkestone route and HS2, which should appear before Boris Island does.What else might you need?A new Thames flood barrier to keep the planes intact. New connecting roads. A new nature reserve to move the abundant birdlife to – and to hope the birds stay out of the way of the planes. Also to work out how to make the SS Richard Montgomery safe. The US warship sank in the area during the second world war with explosives on board equivalent to 2,800 V1 flying bombs, a problem no one has quite yet dared to tackle.How much would it cost, who would pay?It would be a snip at £50bn, allegedly. While the taxpayer is busy forking out £32bn for high-speed rail over the next two decades, there is optimism from Boris Johnson that sovereign wealth funds will step in, possibly China.Will it happen?Don't bank on it. Nick Clegg's opposition within the coalition and the RSPB may be vanquished, and BAA may sound relatively relaxed, but the birth of this airport would kill Heathrow – something that might prove politically unacceptable, despite the opposition to third runways.
