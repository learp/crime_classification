Yet again, we hear of gargantuan profits made at the cost of terrible quality of essential goods and services ("Revealed: how UK water companies are polluting our rivers and beaches, News").What happened to the model of capitalism where the quality of the goods and services was the essence of the business? Profit followed in the slipstream of that focus. Now, it is profit that is the arrowhead of attention and the goods and services are mere flotsam and jetsam in the slipstream.History is littered with precedents where corruption in the service of greed leads to disintegration of civilisations yet this is the model championed by our government as it next puts out to tender our NHS (Andrew Marr: "There's nothing in the world that beats the best of the NHS").Pat McKennaCardiffNick Cohen's excellent piece on the private water companies struck a chord with me ("Water companies and the stench of exploitation").In September 1989, during the passage of the privatisation legislation and when I was shadow trade and industry secretary, I was asked by Ann Taylor (who was leading for the opposition in the standing committee) to write a piece for the Financial Times setting out Labour's position. The aim was to give potential investors pause when they came to subscribe for shares in the flotation to come.I duly did so, explaining (as I recall in my subsequently published memoirs) that an incoming Labour government would expect a privatised water industry to see "its first responsibility to investment in a safe and efficient industry, and secondly, to maintaining fair prices to consumers. Only once these two needs had been met would there be any room for private dividends".I refrained from saying anything about returning the industry to public ownership, since it was clear that this commitment was being quietly dropped.I subsequently made a similar point in an interview and was astonished to find myself repudiated by Neil Kinnock the following day, and the subject of some vitriolic press treatment, apparently engineered by the Labour party's press office, including a half-page article in the Sunday Times, portraying me as a Jekyll and Hyde figure, complete with drawings showing my face being transfigured under the influence of a full moon!It is little comfort to find that my recommended order of priorities has been vindicated by subsequent experience.Bryan GouldOpotikiNew ZealandNick Cohen claims Thames Water is "asking the government for money to build a new much-needed super-sewer through London" because it is "too enfeebled by debt". This is simply not the case. Thames Water's ability to invest has never been stronger.We are currently spending £1bn a year on essential upgrades to our pipes, sewers and other facilities – more than any water company ever has – including building the £635m Lee tunnel, the water industry's biggest single project since privatisation in 1989.We are not asking the government to fund the Thames tideway tunnel. Instead, the government has proposed a support package for exceptional risks during construction, acting in effect as an insurer of last resort against risks that are uninsurable in the private sector.This will reduce financing costs and, in turn, the cost to Thames Water customers. Paying for the project from company reserves would neither reduce the cost to customers nor remove the requirement for government support.Stuart SiddallChief finance officerThames WaterReading
