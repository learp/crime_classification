The number of visitors to Bradford’s National Media Museum has plummeted by 40% since the recession, raising concerns over its future.The museum had 441,000 visitors in the year to July, compared with 737,681 in the same period in 2008, according to analysis of government statistics by the Yorkshire Post.The MP for Bradford South, Judith Cummins, said the museum, which came close to closure in 2013, was a “northern cultural treasure” and she had sought assurances about its future from the new culture secretary, Karen Bradley, last month. “Encouragingly, she offered her written assurances that the future of the National Media Museum remained bright under her watch,” Cummins said. “I and others believe it will continue to deliver outstanding cultural experiences for the people of Yorkshire, provided central government continues to invest in its future.”In February it emerged that a world-famous photography collection was being moved from the Bradford museum to the V&A in London. The move was condemned by local politicians as “an appalling act of cultural vandalism”.The museum’s board opposed the move but was overruled by the museum’s London-based owner, Science Museum Group. SMG receives about £40m a year in funding from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.A spokesman for the National Media Museum said its most recent annual figures showed an 11% increase in visitors year on year. Visit England recently described it as the sixth most-visited attraction in Yorkshire and the Humber, the spokesman said.He added: “In February we had one of our most successful half-terms in recent years when we partnered with Horrible Science. In 2017 we will be unveiling a new brand for the museum along with our £1.8m Wonderlab gallery, which we’re very confident will be a major draw for us and increase visits.”Susan Hinchcliffe, the leader of Bradford city council, said: “In 2016 visitor numbers increased for the first time in years but from speaking to the museum they still have plans to do more. The new gallery opening early next year will boost visitor numbers further. People need to see constant investment and new activities and exhibitions to keep coming back for more.”The headline on this article was amended on 6 September 2016 to better reflect the article.
