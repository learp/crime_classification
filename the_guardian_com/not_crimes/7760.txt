The northern outlier of Carrock, 2,168ft (661m), is a craggy dumpling, like its old Cumbrian and Norse name “Rock Fell” suggests. En route to visit Doug Scott I drive past Carrock fell boulders jumbled by the Mungrisdale to Hesket Newmarket road. As abrasive as an angle-grinder, these big gabbro rocks, more akin to the Cuillin of Skye than Lakeland, become as frosted in winter as glacier mints. It is apt then that Scott, 74, has such an electrifying mountain so nearby.Barrel-chested and busy – one minute telephoning Kathmandu where his charity Community Action Nepal (CAN) raises money for Sherpa families, the next forking his garden – he tells me over instant coffee how Carrock gives cliffhanging winter ice climbing. I heft one of the two short ice axes he wields on steep ice. Perfectly balanced, it swings like a tennis racket, arcing overhead. Next I feel the front points of his crampons. Sharp! Clipped under his plastic winter boots – rigid like ski boots – crampons and boots are clamped together by a toe bar and heel clip.Country diary: Blencathra, Lake District: Himalayan heroes blow away their winter cobwebs on Scales Fell He points above his garden to Carrock’s crags. “Up there, youth,” he says, his Nottingham accent discernible (he calls people “kid” or “youth” a lot, no matter their age). “Trough Gully! It’s as good as a Scottish ice climb.” Given that the Highlands are where Britain’s Alpine-style winter climbs are found, here’s praise indeed. “I’ve climbed the Trough a dozen times when it’s choked with ice,” he continues. “Sometimes with Chris (Bonington) who lives nearby.”Descending Carrock’s snow slopes after a night climb when the ice is coldest reminds him of being on Everest’s summit with the late Dougal Haston in 1975, a story he has recently written about in his book, Up and About: The Hard Road to Everest. Then, he saw “over a sweep of 400 miles, the perfect curve of the earth”. The view from Carrock, by way of contrast, “is a freezing Eden Valley beneath with the Cross Fell and the Pennines far beyond.” Heady stuff still. Especially when bright moonlight casts shadows on the snow and there is no need for a headtorch.
