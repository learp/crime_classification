Terry Pratchett, who died in March 2015 at the age of 66, left behind 41 novels set in his Discworld universe, loved by millions of fans around the world. He also left behind an unfinished autobiography, which provides much of the source material for a new docudrama to be broadcast on BBC2 on Saturday in the UK.When we published a news story about some of the themes in Terry Pratchett: Back in Black, readers provided thoughtful, and often emotional perspectives and tributes. In a discussion that largely focused on what the writer called the “haze of Alzheimer’s” in his later days, you talked about what he meant to you, and also some of your personal experiences with the disease and the dementia it can cause. There are also revelations about his earlier life that fans may not have known and will be keen to see on screen.

I have a signed copy of one of Pratchett's books, bought when I was a kid, that he's signed "In your heart, you know it's real", and it's one of my most treasured possessions, even if I haven't read one of his books in over a decade.I remember feeling absolutely devastated when it was announced that he would no longer be doing personalised signings as his illness started to take hold, and just thinking that no other kid would get the joy I got from that sort of kind-hearted dedication, or from this - to me, then - larger than life figure seemingly treating you, out of the hundreds queuing for a few moments spent with him, as if you were the most important person in the room.   xtrapnel 03 February 2017 9:59amGod I miss not having a new Terry Pratchett to read.....a great writer, who brought pleasure to millions, and possibly under the cloak of humour taught them a little about the world and of the value of kindness above all.As it airs, this is your opportunity to discuss the docudrama, which the BBC describes as “poignant and humorous” but which will perhaps again provoke strong emotional response.
