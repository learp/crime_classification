It’s not often that one comes across a book which encapsulates perfectly the fear, angst, jealousy and excitement that can define the teenage years, and even less so when this is combined with a thrilling murder mystery, but in V for Violet, Rattle has accomplished this with flair.Set in the 1960s, with the novelty and beat of the decade humming beneath the narrative throughout, we see the world through the eyes of Violet White. A surprise baby, her childhood was shaped by jealousy for her elder brother Joseph who went missing whilst working in the airforce during the second world war, an emotion amplified by her parents’ distance and preoccupation. The story follows Violet as she weathers the shocks and joys of her teenage years, gradually moving apart from her best friend Jackie, and dealing with the grief that comes with her shocking murder, as well as experiencing the fires of first love with Beau, a Rocker who sees beneath her lack of self confidence to her true personality. The relationship between Violet and Beau is portrayed with empathy and a sweetness often lacking in fiction, making this an even more compelling read. With glimpses of the party scenes and excitement of the 1960s contrasting with the empty horror of the murders of local girls, Rattle creates a scene interwoven with emotions, ensuring that the plot continues to surprise the reader. However, above all this is the growth of Violet’s character as she views the changes in her own personal life as well as those in her society, creating a truly relatable and enjoyable read. Incorporating themes such as love, death, homosexuality and how this was viewed in the 60s, and above all hope, there is never a dull moment in the book, ensuring that it makes perfect entertainment for a free afternoon!Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop
