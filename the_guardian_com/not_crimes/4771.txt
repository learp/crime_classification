“Never give up on true love,” reads the tagline for Raanjhanaa, a 2013 Bollywood hit starring the Tamil film star Dhanush. Its plot is standard fare, particularly for Kollywood, the Chennai film industry: boy meets girl, falls in love, gets rejected – and pursues her anyway.But activists in southern India, home to the country’s largest Tamil communities, now argue that plotlines such as Raanjhanaa’s are not just cliched: they are dangerous.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Trailer for the film Raanjhanaa.“These films show a patently criminal act as something pretty harmless,” said Iswarya V, a drama researcher whose petition against “the glorification of stalking” is gathering momentum.Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, is still reeling from the murder in June of a 24-year-old IT engineer known as Swathi. She was hacked to death with a sickle, surrounded by hundreds of bystanders at a busy suburban railway station, by a man who had been stalking her for weeks. Such crimes are reported every day in India, including two this week in Delhi alone, and eight in Tamil Nadu in recent months.Iswarya argued that, in part, “it’s a cultural thing”. “There are several areas of Tamil Nadu where you don’t have sex education, and there’s a lot of restrictions about men and women interacting,” she said. “So boys are forced to turn to popular media to try to understand how to interact with women.”She pointed to a 2015 American study that linked media portrayals of stalking as romantic to “an increase in stalking-supportive beliefs”. Iswarya said: “I am entitled to a woman, and if she turns me down, I can react with violence: this is the sort of general script these movies have been peddling.”Jennifer Gnana, a 25-year-old business journalist from Tamil Nadu, agreed. “It’s disgusting and disturbing,” she said. A victim of stalking several times herself, she said films such as Dhanush’s reflected broader patriarchal forces. “Dhanush’s films are all about ‘taming’ proud girls, usually rich, upper-caste women, or ‘foreign educated’ women,” she said.The birth of India's film industry: how the movies came to Mumbai “It’s seen as a good thing, to make these women behave, teach them a lesson, show them proper Tamil values.”Iswarya’s petition asks directors and actors involved in the Tamil cinema industry to refrain from producing or appearing in films that depict stalking as “a playful and acceptable way to woo a woman”. She and other activists are also contacting colleges to help run gender sensitisation classes. Changing old attitudes towards men and women is a big task, but recasting one of Kollywood’s most beloved tropes as criminal behaviour is “the first baby step in the right direction”, Iswarya said.
