On 21 July 2007, it was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that readers were ready to queue for hours to get their hands on: would the boy wizard survive? Or would his nemesis Voldemort?Nine years later, on 31 July 2016, it could almost be 2007 again: midnight on Saturday sees the release of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the script of the new play being performed in London’s Palace theatre. Billed as the “eighth Harry Potter story” by author JK Rowling, Potter fever is at frenzy level yet again: bookshops all over the world are planning out-of-hours openings and pre-orders are smashing records (records previously held, of course, by Rowling).Harry Potter and the Cursed Child review – duel of dark and light carried off with dazzling assurance Based on a new story by Rowling, director John Tiffany and writer Jack Thorne, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is set 19 years after the events of the last novel, and ages Rowling’s characters to adults. The play has received rave reviews in the first press previews, before its official release on Saturday. The Guardian’s Michael Billington called it “a thrilling theatrical spectacle”.According to booksellers, the play script has received the most pre-orders since Deathly Hallows was released in 2007. “It’s our biggest since Harry Potter seven,” said Gareth Hardy, head of commercial at Blackwell’s. “Our biggest new book last year was Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchman, and pre-orders [for Cursed Child] are nearly three times that.”Kate Skipper, buying director at Waterstones, said the chain was “expecting this to be the biggest launch since Harry Potter seven” and that it had “passed the six-figure milestone on pre-orders.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Fans queuing outside Waterstone’s Piccadilly the day before Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows went on sale in 2007.

US book chain Barnes & Noble announced on Tuesday that the story is its most pre-ordered book since Deathly Hallows, and it expects it to be its biggest-selling book of the year.Just as they did for Rowling’s Potter novels, which have sold more than 450m copies worldwide since 1997, hundreds of bookshops around the UK are holding midnight openings on Saturday to celebrate publication of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. There will be midnight parties at 140 Waterstones bookshops on Saturday evening, with events at the chain’s largest stores in Edinburgh, Manchester Deansgate and London Piccadilly already sold out. Foyles is holding a midnight Harry Potter “extravaganza”, while Blackwell’s will be putting on Saturday evening events in stores in Manchester, Oxford and Cambridge.“There are few events in the book world as big as the launch of a new Harry Potter story, in fact it’s thanks to the original series that we started midnight openings. The first generation of JK Rowling’s fans has now grown up, but their love of the books hasn’t changed. With reviews of the play published this morning, excitement levels are reaching fever pitch and the pre-orders are flooding in,” said Simon Heafield, head of marketing and brand development at Foyles.Embargos around the book’s content remain as strict as ever, with booksellers yet to receive copies from publisher Little, Brown. “It’s very reminiscent of [security around] previous Harry Potters,” said Hardy, who refused to reveal when copies would be arriving in stores.“There are no books in the shops yet but our very excited booksellers have stringent security measures in place for when the deliveries do start to arrive,” said Waterstones head of events and PR Sandra Taylor.Harry Potter and the curse of middle age: should fictional children ever grow up? As millions of Harry Potter fans around the world were not able to attend a performance of the play in London before the book launch, there has been an official plea to the lucky few who have seen it to “keep the secrets” of the new story. Badges with #keepthesecrets have been handed out to audiences since the first performances in June, when Rowling appealed to fans to “let audiences enjoy Cursed Child with all the surprises we’ve built into the stories”. Despite the furore around the play since preview performances began in June, fans have been praised for doing just that, leaving some surprises for those lining up in the dark on Saturday night.
