A concoction of meat, chips, cheese and sauce in a styrofoam container has become an unlikely social media phenomenon, sending revenue at some takeaway shops – and cholesterol counts – through the roof.The halal snack pack has long been a staple of Australian takeaway shops, if a little overshadowed by the kebab. But a Facebook page dedicated to the delicacy, the Halal Snack Pack Appreciation Society, has attracted nearly 90,000 members since December – tens of thousands in the past month alone.

The rhetoric used by critics of the 'halal racket' will be familiar to Jews | Jeff Sparrow The warm, somewhat wry embrace of a takeaway food explicitly billed as halal is at odds with the way Islamic religious certification is often portrayed by the media and in politics, as something shady or alien to Australian tastes. Last year the Liberal senator Cory Bernardi channelled discontent around halal in rightwing circles to secure an inquiry into the $13bn industry, which heard from a range of government agencies there was “no link” between Islamic certification and terrorism.
