I’m here to gain knowledge, basically. I got to a point where I’ve done 92 movies – I am not going to stop – I’m going to continue doing movies and producing. I want to direct more but there were other things in my life that I was interested in.”In the 1990s, he launched Antonio Banderas Designs which specialised in perfume and glasses.
