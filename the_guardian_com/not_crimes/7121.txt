Last week you carried a news item (Report, 14 January) in which prominent authors called on publishers and writers to boycott festivals that don’t pay them. If they mean events where no writers are paid, I wholeheartedly support them. If, however, they want a boycott of festivals where some writers are paid and others not, all they will achieve is a decline in the number of opportunities for established and new authors to present their work.Philip Pullman states that “only the authors … are expected to do it for nothing”. In most cases, this is patently not true. Those who actually do it for nothing – indeed often contribute financially – are the organisers and supporters. If an author has a “name”, they are bound to attract an audience, which means that relative unknowns are able to enjoy an equal degree of publicity on the strength of their colleagues’ prominence. It is only fair to pay the well-known authors more since, without them, there would be little or no audience at all.Ed TonkynKing’s Lynn Literature Festivals• This weekend Robert Burns will be celebrated “the world o’er”. While it is well known that Abraham Lincoln always carried a book of Burns’ poems in his pocket, maybe Burns was more widely appreciated at his death in 1796 and shortly thereafter than we realise, for example by the great German poet Friedrich Schiller? Burns penned his great tribute to the brotherhood of man in 1795. Schiller originally wrote his Ode to Joy in 1785, but amended it in 1803 specifically to include the line “Alle Menschen werden Brüder” which closely reflects “When Man to Man the world o’er, shall brothers be for a’ that”. It was the 1803 version which Beethoven included in his Ninth Symphony. Could a Schiller (or Burns) expert advise whether he might have read Burns, either in the original or translation?John BirkettSt Andrews, Fife• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
