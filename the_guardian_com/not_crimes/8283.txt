Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from your suggestions after last week’s callout. Thanks for taking part.  about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece.You can’t define the inhabitants of Britain in 13 songs, but we wouldn’t be British if we didn’t have a go...   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The YouTube playlist.We write satirical songs about hipness called Cool Britannia, but give our musicians daft names like the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band. It’s fair to say we Britons like a laugh and a joke – that we’re irreverent and humorous. We also like a song and a dance, like the pogo, Morris dancing, a knees-up or Hi-Tension’s British Hustle – in which we make a foreign style our own. In fact, we often seek inspiration from other cultures: Dreadzone’s Little Britain (vocal version) combines the classical of Germany’s Carl Orff with some Jamaican inspiration to celebrate this “green and pleasant land”. My passport says I’m a citizen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Each of the four countries in that political union are dedicated a verse in Aztec Camera’s Good Morning Britain. It acknowledges British history as “steeped in shame” but tomorrow as “fair game”, while asking us to “stand tall” and “worry about things later”. It cleverly uses cliches about Britishness to call for a fairer Britain. But why the shame? Well, to be honest, British military prowess (we are excellent at warring) has led to destructive political and cultural interference, a fact acknowledged in Elvis Costello’s Oliver’s Army. Costello is also self-aware enough to admit that: “My mind goes sleepwalking while I’m putting the world to right.” He’s not the only Brit to have that fantasy. But the world is often beyond our control as when the DJ kept calm, carried on and avoided the subject of Chernobyl’s radioactive cloud over the British Isles, infuriating the Smiths into writing Panic – we’re quite good at being irate. The Smiths used deadpan humour and singalong tunes and merry British children singing “hang the blessed deejay”. Though I often wonder why shy and seemingly sensitive Britons can hold essentially pointless and murderous grudges. How does the international community see us? Are we bothered? Elliott Smith’s Beatles-referencing Baby Britain has lines such as “You put yourself apart”, “Fight problems with bigger problems” and “You got a look in your eye when you’re saying goodbye, like you want to say ‘hi’”. Smith also nails our liking for inebriation and leaving important matters “unspoken”. I think the cheeky so-and-so means we’re a bit standoffish, choose unwise battles and are repressed – until pissed. After a token foreign contribution, let’s extol Britain a bit more. Wordsmiths – we have them. Engineering feats and inventions – oh yes! Efficiency – absolutely. Public unity – strong. For proof, listen to WH Auden’s poem, Night Mail, set to music by Benjamin Britten and narrated by John Grierson with rhythmic precision. I had to include a British rapper spitting bars.Auden’s poem mentions differences in wealth – the same issue explored in Ultramarine’s Kingdom, which features Robert Wyatt adapting Song of the Low by Chartist activist Ernest Jones. Wealth and class issues are an ever-present tension in British society: “We’re not too low the cloth to weave but too low the cloth to wear.” Social protest and mercantilism run deep in British society, we are good at both – they’ve helped Britain remain a strong trading nation.There’s a darkness to unchecked mercantilism, though. Stiff Little Fingers’ rasping Fly the Flag has the lyrics: “Give me freedom to screw you before you screw me … Gimme a Britain that’s got back the Great / A race of winners not cramped by the state / And only the helpless get left at the gate.” Not exactly promoting the British way of fair play and a level playing field, is it? And into that gap between Chartism and the free-marketers stepped the anarchic, sullen and angry Sex Pistols with their electrifying creative energy, John Lydon declaring on Anarchy in the UK that he’s his own man – and “no dogs body” – how very British.Punk was eventually commodified like other radical art, fashion, entertainment and youth culture from the UK – commodified, exported and yet winning admirers worldwide. Anarchy for the UK? Maybe it is best represented by Hulgeikur Dagsson’s cartoon of man refusing a cup of tea. We’re essentially conservative and change slowly over time – like the weather. And talking of the weather, Overseer takes the shipping forecast, with an elegant repetition of Richard Binge’s Sailing By, and coalesces them to make Heligoland. Its poignant emotional heart results from letting the stiff upper lip occasionally slip: “South Shannon. South-westerly 6 to gale 8, occasionally severe gale 9. Nerves shattered. Self-reproach. Rain or showers. No change.” So very British: the BBC, harsh weather, emotional difficulties, ships at sea … We are a maritime people, we have been curious about the world and explored it; we imposed our will on it and made fun of it and maintained a monarchy while making social advances, bewildering and charming foreigners in equal amounts, and we celebrate that process in Henry Woods’s Fantasia on British Sea Songs, which mixes the bawdiness of sailors with patriotic pomp and arrogance to make lovely and stirring pieces of music. Oh yes, we’re very good at making sweet music.Not all songs appear on the Spotify playlist as some are unavailable on the service.New theme: how to join inThe new theme will be announced at 8pm (GMT) on Thursday 13 April.
