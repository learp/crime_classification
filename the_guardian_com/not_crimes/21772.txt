A boy is pulled from the river Thames. The patient’s diagnosis is amnesia and he remembers nothing about his past. When a doctor trying to unlock his memories stumbles upon a new idea something starts to come out. He’s been given a pen and paper and now what only seemed to be scribbles on paper turn out to be an alchemy sign for everlasting life. This triggers a wave of curiosity on social media and now the boy nicknamed River Boy is attracting news reporters from everywhere. Will he discover his past or is he doomed to be shrouded in mystery forever? Helen Dennis has created this wonderfully written book with its sublime descriptions and an intricate web of mystery and intrigue woven throughout the words. This is a book for ages 10-11 as it has a lot of raw emotion as well as a rather complicated plot. In conclusion I would say definitely try to read and recommend to friends.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
