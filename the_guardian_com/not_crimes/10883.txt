It details a real scandal from Bologna, in 1858, after a young Jewish boy was taken from his family to be raised Catholic because he was secretly baptized as a child. “The fate of this one boy came to symbolize the entire revolutionary campaign of Mazzini and Garibaldi to end the dominance of the Catholic Church and establish a modern, secular Italian state,” according to Kertzer’s website.Tony Kushner, the writer behind Spielberg’s Lincoln and Munich, will write the script and Rylance will play Pope Pius IX, who regarded the kidnapped boy as his own child.
