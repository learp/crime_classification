Oscars new members: eight things we learned from the 2016 invite list The 2016 membership invite list for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is 46% women and 41% people of color, the most diverse intake yet, according to the organization’s figures.The list of the class of 683 new members invited – including America Ferrera, Tina Fey, and Kate Beckinsale – to join the organization was released on Wednesday, a substantial step in addressing critiques over the Academy’s lack of racial diversity, following a furor in January after no actors of color were nominated for any major awards for the second year in a row.

The entire academy would grow to 7,789 members.The controversy led to criticism from leading civil rights figures such as Al Sharpton that actors such as Idris Elba and Michael B Jordan – who are included in the 2016 list – Will Smith had been snubbed. It was followed by a campaign which organized around the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite.Emma Watson, Freida Pinto, Ice Cube, Eva Mendes, John Boyega, Marlon Wayans, Mark Rylance, Ken Loach, Daniel Dae Kim, Sam Taylor-Johnson, Rachel McAdams, Patti LuPone, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Michelle Rodriguez, Ryan Coogler, Brie Larson, and the Wachowski sisters were all among the invitees.

The conversation is continuing. I think there is going to be a lot of positive energy that will pollinate and make more.”In January, Isaacs promised that the Academy would double its minority and female membership by 2020, but unfortunately, the road would still prove rocky; Isaacs was forced to apologize again after two dozen Academy members published an open letter complaining about “tasteless and offensive” skits playing on racial stereotypes at the ceremony.In response, Isaacs appointed several new governors with diverse backgrounds to the Academy’s board.
