I was pleased to read Peter Tyzack’s paean to Severn Beach (Letters, 11 April). However, he neglected to mention Adge Cutler’s 1968 song Aloha Severn Beach which begins “There’s a little corner of heaven/Down there, by the River Severn” and includes the romance that can be found in Severn Beach: “I’ll meet my sweet in her finery/Down by that oil refinery” and “We’ll dine on chips, I’ll touch her lips and she will hold my hand”. Sadly the Blue Lagoon swimming pool that is mentioned in the song has gone but my childhood memories of day trips there from Bristol live on.Paul SampsonSalisbury, Wiltshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
