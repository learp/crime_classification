They have the ultimate in seasonal jobs spreading festive goodwill. But working in a winter wonderland means Santa and some of his helpers are having to sign up to zero-hours contracts.An advert for elves at Center Parcs Whinfell Forest site in Cumbria offers the opportunity to be to be one of Santa’s elves, greeting guests and serving customers from early November until Christmas Eve, with a small number on a zero-hours basis. Santa Claus is also being employed on a casual basis, at a rate of £10.53 an hour.“Becoming one of Santa’s elves is a truly magical task,” the advert reads. “It’s not just about helping children feel at ease with the wonderful experience of seeing Santa, it’s about keeping the spirit of Christmas alive which means goodwill, fantastic customer service and making people smile – whatever their query or request.”The advert makes it clear there are no guaranteed hours. “This is a zero-hour contract starting 2 November 2016 to 24 December 2016. You will be contracted to work on an as-and-when basis to cover busy periods.” Asked about its use of zero-hours contracts generally, the holiday firm said it used them to supplement full- or part-time contracted employees during its busiest periods. A Center Parcs spokesman said: “There are a very small number of zero hours contracts offered for these positions out of the overall Christmas recruitment across Center Parcs as a whole (8 positions out of a total of 110). “These roles were advertised alongside fixed term contracts and offer greater flexibility to suit individual’s circumstances. In fact, employees often return to work for us on this basis, in this type of role, at this time of year. Obviously due to the seasonal nature of the roles, they are offered on a fixed term basis.”
