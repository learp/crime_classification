Three robbers with pump-action shotguns have raided a Chanel boutique in central Paris, fleeing with a large haul of luxury goods, a police source said. The source said the stolen goods were valued at “several hundreds of thousands of euros”. The robbery took place on Thursday in the city’s chic Avenue Montaigne, home to many luxury stores and just off the Champs-Élysées. The robbery was confirmed by staff at the shop, where windows were smashed during the raid. “I saw some guys come out wearing masks,” one witness told AFP.“Without thinking, I put myself in front of their car. Then I saw one of them was carrying a gun so I left.”Another Chanel boutique on the same street was raided last month by thieves who rammed the storefront with a 4x4 car in the early hours of the morning.In that incident, the robbers escaped by scooter after stealing several luxury handbags, police said.
