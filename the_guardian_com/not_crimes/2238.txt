Prince had prescription painkillers on his person and at his home when he died, according to NBC News. The US TV news service says its information comes from sources in federal law enforcement.Prince's former band the Revolution announce reunion in his honour However, the sources did not say whether or not the drugs played any part in Prince’s death. Although officers told NBC that the county sheriff investigating Prince’s death had called for assistance from the Drug Enforcement Administration, whose role will be to check where the drugs came from and what prescriptions Prince had, Carver County Deputy Sheriff Jason Kamerud has since informed Associated Press that he these reports are incorrect.“We have not asked them for help, or asked them to be a part of the investigation,” Kamerud said. “We might contact them to help us, but that hasn’t happened. We don’t have the medical examiner’s report yet. We don’t know to what extent pharmaceuticals could be a part of this.”Although an autopsy was conducted last Friday, the results are not expected for some weeks. On 15 April, Prince’s plane had to make an emergency landing at Moline, Illinois for him to have medical treatment. The celebrity website TMZ has claimed this was so he could receive a “safe shot”, normally administered to those who have overdosed on drugs, though this has not been officially confirmed. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune, the paper of Prince’s hometown, reported that it had seen a redacted version of the records released by fire and ambulance services in Miline, Illinois, where the plane landed. The documents contained very little detail, but the paper said sources with knowledge of the investigation into Prince’s death said he had been given a shot of the opioid antidote Narcan, to counter an opioid overdose.Prince in private: lascivious, relentless, exacting, remote Prince was believed to have been in need of a double hip replacement, an operation he rejected because it would have required him to accept a blood transfusion, which conflicted with his beliefs as Jehovah’s witness. TMZ claims “multiple sources” have said Prince had developed an addiction to the powerful painkiller Percocet to cope with the pain.On Wednesday, an administrator was appointed to oversee Prince’s estate. The singer died without leaving a will, and on Tuesday his sister, Tyka Nelson, asked the Carver County probate court in Minneapolis to appoint Bremer Bank, National Association to handle the estate, saying it “has provided financial services to the Decedent for a number of years and has knowledge of his personal financial and business financial affairs”.The court acceded to the request and Bremer Trust will now manage Prince’s assets and determine who the heirs to his estate – estimated at $300m (£206m) – should be. Neither of his parents are alive, he has no children, and was unmarried at the time of his death.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Prince: a look back at his extraordinary career
