The funniest standup I’ve ever seenTony Law is probably the one who makes me laugh the most without knowing quite how I got there, which is a big part of what standup is about for me.The funniest sketch I’ve ever seenIn 2010, Sheeps did a sketch about using onion-ring glasses – as in glasses made of onion rings – to help you cry in auditions. It was of course quite bad, but it was my kind of thing and I was easily influenced at that age.The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funnyWhen bus drivers pass each other going opposite ways on their routes; watch out for the huge mimed inside jokes and spontaneous moments of empathy between them.The funniest person I know The tall one in Sheeps as well as the other two in Sheeps.The funniest book I’ve ever readThe First Bad Man by Miranda July. Heartbreaking, beautiful and completely mad. The funniness in this book comes in the form of the accidentally uttered laugh, as July’s characters are so quirkily real.The funniest TV show I’ve ever seenBurning Love: watch it on Netflix. It’s the perfect combination of the best comedy writing and improvisation with the holy form of reality TV. It’s my heaven, with the comedy of actual reality TV show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in second place.The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever ownedJack Wills trackie bottoms. I tried to be that girl for a few days in sixth form and it turned out that I am not that girl.The funniest meal I’ve ever eatenIt was called “Monk, hot fish, cold chip”. No further explanation and at quite a posh restaurant. Let’s just say it was what it said on the tin: weird and crap. One cold chip and a thin line of “fish”.The funniest wordPrestidigitateur. It means magician in French. I mean, come on.Emma Sidi: Telenovela is at Soho Theatre, W1, Thu to 18 Mar
