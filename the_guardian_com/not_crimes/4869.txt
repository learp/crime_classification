The founder of fashion chain Reiss has banked a £100m-plus windfall after selling a majority stake in the upmarket brand, which is a favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge.David Reiss, who took over a single gentleman’s outfitters in London’s Bishopsgate run by his father in 1971 and built it into an international empire, has struck a deal with American private equity firm Warburg Pincus that values the business at £230m. Reiss, who owned 90% of the business, will get the bumper payout and also retain a significant stake in the business. He is also staying on as chairman and chief executive. The management team, who share the remaining 10% stake in the business, will also remain in place.The retailer said teaming up with the US investors would enable Reiss to step up expansion in North America, Asia and Australia. Reiss has previously said he wanted to turn the brand into a “luxury Topshop”.The business, which only began selling womenswear in 2000, now operates 160 stores in 15 countries. It also sells online via its own website and recent partnerships with Asos and Zalando. The company made a profit before financial charges of of £24.4m from sales of £146m last year.Sales were given a major boost by the Duchess of Cambridge, who started wearing Reiss clothes in 2010. She brought international attention to the brand when she wore a white £159 Reiss dress for her official engagement portrait and another Reiss dress when she met the Obamas. The chain credits the duchess for “sending the brand to stratospheric new heights”.

Reiss said he thought: “Why don’t I do it myself?”But the firm has been looking for an investor to help fund overseas expansion for over a year as none of his three children wanted to run the business. Son Darren sits on Reiss’s board as a non-executive director but runs his own property investment business after years working in banking. Daughter Debra, who worked as a brand director for Reiss in the US, died last year aged 34 after suffering from a long-term illness. Reiss is an upmarket departure for Warburg Pincus, which is best known in the UK for its investment in discount chain Poundland.“As long-term growth investors, we look forward to partnering with David and his team and supporting the global expansion of Reiss,” said Paul Best, managing director at Warburg Pincus. “The business has built an enviable position in its core UK market, with a broad and loyal customer base, and we believe there is a significant opportunity to build on this success and accelerate development internationally.”
