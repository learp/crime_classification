As 2016 withered away, our readers saw in the new year in a most underwhelming manner. Below are some of the themes that emerged from the truly average photos you sent in.Happy new year.1) Watching tellyBuffering in the New Year...Sent via Guardian Witness By guardianUser10260692  31 December 2016, 21:45 2) Being illAt home, ill.Rounding off a thoroughly underwheming year with sinusitis (just a couple of weeks after I had to cancel plans for my 40th), I didn't feel up to joining my family on a trip to my in-laws'. Really missing my children, but glad to have the cats for company. Happy New Year, Sula and Teddy.Sent via Guardian Witness By ID478689  1 January 2017, 2:18 3) Hanging out with petsSunflower Watched Project Runway with some MalbecAvoiding crowds 5 subway stops from Times Square.Sent via Guardian Witness By Marlene Ginader  1 January 2017, 9:55 Prosecco ðŸŽ†Sent via Guardian Witness By ti1gerv  1 January 2017, 6:35 4) Eating crackersFire CrackersCelebrating in style.Sent via Guardian Witness By ID4448832  1 January 2017, 11:47 5) Meh fireworksHow I travelled 3000 miles to spend NYE in Sydney watching a train...I travelled from London to spend Christmas in Western Australia with my expat family, and then travelled to Sydney to spend NYE with one of my best friends who lives in Sydney...We couldn't be bothered to camp out all day and night to secure a 100% decent place, as the beach was far more tempting in the Aussie heat. We headed down after sunset, and got what we thought was an alright spot.... we'd still be able to see the fireworks despite the bridge. They're usually HUGE. We waited a few hours, and the crowds behind us surged, the atmosphere was amazing! Then, the fireworks began. As did an endless stream of DOUBLE DECKER TRAINS! I live in south London, so train related anger is somewhat normal. But this was unreal, the trains kept pulling up at the exact moment bursts of fireworks sprung forth from the bridge... and to add further disappoint the other fireworks were completely blocked by tall buildings, a girl in front started manically trying to capture the best selfie with double decker train, and spares fireworks winking at us from, behind THAT BLOODY TRAIN.A NYE we will never forget, we could only laugh!Sent via Guardian Witness By walshlette  1 January 2017, 10:57 London fireworks from Primrose HillMy partner and I (and about 10,000 others) went to Primrose Hill to get a view of the spectacular fireworks happening on the Thames. I guess the Thames is a long way from Primrose Hill; the effect was a little... diminished.Sent via Guardian Witness By Max Byrne  1 January 2017, 14:04 6) Jigsaw puzzlesMind numbingly dullSent via Guardian Witness By Jonathan Silverman  1 January 2017, 8:38 Jigsaw, cat + wineStrangely satisfying New Years spent jigsawing with the cat.Sent via Guardian Witness By kate donovan  1 January 2017, 0:56 7) Hanging out with your parentsMy parents, shortly after midnightAfter watching the fireworks on TV, my parents spent the next few minutes checking their Facebook messages on their phones and replying to texts. My sister and I, both 20 and back home from uni, were more interested in watching Jools Holland. I now have this picture saved for every time my dad talks about me being glued to my phone.Sent via Guardian Witness By Eva James-Phillips  1 January 2017, 2:51 8) TilingTiling the backsplash NYE.
