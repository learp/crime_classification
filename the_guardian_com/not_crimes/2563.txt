In our view, this was a personal critique that was balanced by comments from other judges, and was justified by the context.”Celebrity Big Brother’s biphobia shines a light on a deeply damaging problem | Ruth Hunt During the judges’ houses phase of the show, Cowell told 17-year-old Samantha Lavery to “peel away the mask” during her performance.Cowell was roundly criticised by Spice Girls Emma Bunton and Mel B who were helping him narrow his seven acts into a final three, after his comments to the teenager.He told Lavery: “I kind of wish we had met without what you think is your pop-star image. I think that with you we have had a bit of a mask put up. All I’m saying Sam is I want to peel away the mask.”Cowell then turned to Mel B and Bunton and asked if his remarks were “bad”, with Bunton telling him the youngster was “allowed to experiment” and Mel B adding: “It is bad... that’s what kids do.”
