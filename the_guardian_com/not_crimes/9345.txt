Charlotte Riley, 35, was born in Stockton-on-Tees and studied English and linguistics at Durham University before training as an actor at Lamda. Her breakthrough role was in ITV’s 2009 adaptation of Wuthering Heights, where she met her husband, fellow actor Tom Hardy, with whom she has a child. She’s since appeared in Hollywood blockbusters and TV dramas, and now plays Kate Middleton in writer Mike Bartlett’s TV adaptation of his Olivier award-winning play, King Charles III.Did you audition to play Kate Middleton?Yeah, it was bizarre because I was on holiday in France when I got sent the script and asked to film a try-out of Kate’s soliloquy scene. I had a tan, so I plastered on my palest makeup to look like an English rose. I managed a nod to her hair and covered up with a scarf so I didn’t look like I was in summer clothes. Then I leant the iPad against the window and talked straight to the camera. You don’t often get to break the fourth wall on screen. I’ve never looked down a camera lens before. It’s powerful. House of Cards-esque.How did your family react to you getting the gig?They all howled with laughter and said: “What are they doing, employing someone from Teesside to play Kate Middleton?”Is it fair to say the character is a Lady Macbeth type?To an extent. But I also see her as the CEO of a business, Windsor Corp perhaps, and she’s just being pragmatic. She’s saying: “Come on, guys. It’s shit that the only way I can connect with the public is by being a bloody clotheshorse, but if I have to do that for the monarchy to stay relevant, then so be it. Let’s suck it up. And I’m sorry, Charles, but we’re relevant and you’re not any more.”Do you think the real Kate’s like that?I like to think she’s a powerhouse behind closed doors. I love Mike Bartlett’s idea that she’s accepted being “the queen of column inches” for now because that’s how she can communicate.Did you research the role?I watched the cheesy documentaries and naff American dramas, which were horrendous but weirdly enjoyable. Then I dived deep into YouTube. I became obsessed with finding people’s phone footage of her, to see her slightly more relaxed and unguarded. Although she’s always on public display to some extent. She must be acutely aware of being watched the entire time.Kate sneaks out for a cheeky fag in the drama too…When I read that in the script, I was like: “Yes! Of course she has a smoke!” Everyone likes a cheeky fag now and again, especially at times of crisis. She can’t get through to her husband any more, he’s burying his head in the sand, so she’s like: “Fuck this, I’m going for a cigarette”. It’s one small thing that says a huge amount.You’re the same age as Kate. You’re also a mother with a famous husband. Do you feel affinity with her?As a parent, I do. She must be fiercely protective of her children. William grew up with all that scrutiny but she didn’t. It must be hard having to share your kids with the nation. I keep my family very private but I’m not under a fraction of the pressure she is. People have understandable problems with the royals but I wouldn’t want to live even a day in their shoes.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Watch the trailer for King Charles III.How do you think Kate will react to your portrayal?I feel queasy thinking about it. I doubt they’d watch but hope if they do, they’d see it as a piece of theatre. A what-if history play.Tim Pigott-Smith, who plays Prince Charles, sadly died last month. How will you feel when the play goes out?It’ll be so strange without him. Tim had a real sense of ownership over this piece and was such a big part of it. He’d done the play 400 times, so I came in feeling like an outsider but he made me feel part of the family. It was my first job back after becoming a parent and he was full of wise counsel. He led from the front. A good man.What did you make of William and Harry speaking out about mental health recently?When you consider their childhoods, they’re both pretty incredible. If that had happened to me, I’d be hiding under a rock somewhere. Now they’re making really important waves and thank goodness somebody is, especially of their stature. I hope it reduces stigma and improves the state of mental healthcare.You’re back in period gangster drama Peaky Blinders this autumn too. Your character, May Carleton, is a racehorse trainer. Are you horsey in real life?Fuck no! My sister used to ride when I was a kid. I sat on one of her horses once and it bucked me off. Never rode again. Thank God I just lead them around in Peaky Blinders and don’t have to get on.You’ve said you always get cast as “posh birds”. Is that true?May and Kate are pretty posh I suppose. But I’m doing a film soon called Swimming With Men, based on a Swedish documentary about a male synchronised swimming team. I play their coach and get to use my own accent for once, which I’m relishing. It’s hilarious seeing the boys – Rob Brydon, Thomas Turgoose, Daniel Mays and Jim Carter – lined up in their Speedos, all different shapes and sizes.What’s your view on social class in the acting profession?You can’t deny the demographic of people who are doing well at the moment, but these things go in phases. In 1996, it was fashionable to be working class with a regional accent.Is it true your husband bought you a dog to help you overcome your fear of them?Tom has an ability to collect animals wherever he goes. He’s like Doctor Dolittle. If he’s shooting a film somewhere, he’ll go to a rescue shelter and volunteer to walk dogs or foster one while he’s there. He’s always “finding” them and bringing them home. So no, he just fell in love with Woody. Now Woody’s a star in his own right. He got a part in Peaky Blinders. And on CBeebies.Tom’s a regular reader of the CBeebies bedtime story. Does your child tune in?Yes, but our toddler is way more excited seeing Woody on screen. Tom’s apparently a treat for the mums, but Woody is the real draw.Tell us about your campaign for better childcare on film and TV sets.Me and [fellow actor] Sarah Solemani have a project called Ready Set Play, where we’ve designed an on-set childcare bus – a double decker that opens out to create a fully Ofsted-checked nursery. I also work with a charity called Raising Films, which did a survey where 79% of people in our industry said becoming a parent had negatively impacted on their career. Goldman Sachs has figured this out and got nurseries in its buildings. Our business needs to get up to speed.Tom’s had extreme haircuts and facial fur for roles. What’s been your favourite?In 2010, before going off to do a play in Chicago with Philip Seymour Hoffman, he locked himself in our bathroom for ages, then came out with purple hair and a purple beard. It was horrendous. Everything had to get shaved off. I couldn’t go to bed with a Ribena berry.King Charles III is on BBC2, Wednesday 10 May at 9pm and on digital download and DVD from Monday 15 May
