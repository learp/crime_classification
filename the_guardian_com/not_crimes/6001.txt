The most recent writers to have worked on the script were Andrea (World Trade Center) Berloff and Charles (The Big Short) Randolph. Funding is coming from Megan Ellison’s Annapurna outfit, which also has Kathryn Bigelow’s Detroit riots drama and Bennett Miller’s adaptation of A Christmas Carol in the works. Wong Kar-Wai’s films have long been praised for their keen visual panache, as well as moving narratives. Movies such as In the Mood for Love and 2046 were especially well-clad. His most recent feature was The Grandmaster, about Ip Man, trainer of kung fu film star Bruce Lee.
