Such cars, similar to Formula One and rally cars, always feature sponsor logos.“The hiring and use of the car is in accordance with the BBC’s editorial guidelines and protocols around undue prominence.”Indeed, there have been branded Formula One cars on Top Gear in the past.Red Bull F1 car on Top GearBut the BBC will be hoping the stunt – and subsequent handbrake turn – will not be a sign of things to come, otherwise the BBC2 show risks becoming a load of Red Bullocks.
