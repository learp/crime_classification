The Avengers director and Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon is taking on Captain America for Marvel Comics this month, writing a new story to celebrate the character’s 75th anniversary.Captain America appeared in the first issue of Captain America Comics in 1941, when his alter ego Steve Rogers took a super-soldier serum “to become America’s one-man army” and fight the Nazis. The mantle of protecting America has not only fallen to Rogers, however: Sam Wilson, AKA the superhero Falcon and one of the one of the first African-American superheroes, took on the role in 2014.The 75th anniversary issue of Captain America: Sam Wilson, will see Whedon work with Astonishing X-Men artist John Cassaday on a new story about the character, Entertainment Weekly reported. The issue, out on 30 March, will also feature stories “celebrating the legacy and legend of Captain America throughout history”, Marvel said, from writers and artists including Greg Rucka, Mike Perkins and Tim Sale.As well as Whedon’s contribution, said Marvel, the issue’s main story will see Rogers “asked to wield [his red, white and blue shield] one last time, against a foe so deadly he knows it could very well be his final stand”.Whedon and Cassaday have previously worked together on the Astonishing X-Men comic series. Cassaday, who has illustrated Steve Rogers’s adventures before, announced on his Facebook page last week that he was working on a new short story featuring the character with an unnamed writer.Marvel recently announced that Steve Rogers would return as Captain America to celebrate the character’s 75th anniversary, meaning there will now be two Captain America’s, as Sam Wilson will also retain the title.
