I was interested to read about the Institution of Engineering and Technology (Report, 8 December) highlighting the problem of girls not being given toys that might lead to an interest in science and engineering. The report blames the marketing of toys. However, pressures exist elsewhere. As a male former scientist I have made attempts to encourage people to buy toys for girls that are gender neutral, educational and linked to practical exercises. In every case I have been thwarted by various female adults and told for example: “She is a ‘girly’ girl, she must have a pink toy, dress or something relating to cooking.” It seems to be the practice in many cultures that the pressure for girls to behave or dress in a certain way or to become a mother comes not from men but from older women. It is they who need to change.Dr Nigel Long Keynsham, Somerset• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
