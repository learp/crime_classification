Leeds Young Film festivalJust in time for Easter, the largest family film event in the land is a pick-and-mix of trusted names and new work aimed at the over-fives, with animation to the fore. Disney’s Zootropolis opens proceedings, and there are workshops, masterclasses, free activities and previews involving Minecraft, Lego, Clangers, Bob The Builder and Adventure Time (a special first look that includes a new stop-motion episode). For older viewers there’s new anime such as Studio Ghibli’s Oscar-nominated When Marnie Was There, a Salma Hayek-produced version of Kahlil Gibran’s The Prophet, plus live-action features old and new. And, at Leeds Town Hall, there are immersive screenings themed around The Shawshank Redemption (where you’re literally a captive audience) and Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory (where you’re literally a kid in a candy store).Various venues, Thu to 31 Mar, leedsyoungfilm.comEssay film festival, LondonEssay film: a daunting term for a loosely defined genre of self-reflective cinema, the proponents of which would really be unclassifiable otherwise, such as Chris Marker, Agnès Varda or Patricio Guzmán (whose The Pearl Button is out this weekend). Guest of honour this year is Kidlat Tahimik, pioneer of Filipino film and possibly the least classifiable of them all. His work, such as 2015’s Balikbayan #1 – Memories Of Overdevelopment Redux III (pictured), is neither strictly fact nor fiction, playfully ignoring all film-making rules. His 1977 film Perfumed Nightmare contrasted developing and developed worlds and was championed by the likes of Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola and Susan Sontag, with the latter writing that it “reminds one that invention, insolence, enchantment – even innocence – are still available to film”. Elsewhere, there are films by Mark Rappaport, Manoel de Oliveira, Eric Rohmer and Miranda Pennell.Various venues, to 24 Mar, essayfilmfestival.com
