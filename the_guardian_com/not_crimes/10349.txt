The Labour Party is considering pre-empting Tim Yeo's plans to table an amendment to the Energy Bill that would impose a decarbonisation target on the power sector, as MPs prepare for today's second reading of the Bill.Yeo yesterday confirmed he would table an amendment to the bill that would feature a target range for the electricity sector requiring emissions of less than 100 grams of carbon dioxide per kWh of electricity by 2030.The Conservative MP, who is also chair of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, maintains the target would be crucial to meeting the UK's strict carbon budgets and boosting energy investor certainty.Launching a thinly veiled attack on Chancellor George Osborne and his plan to delay a decision on a decarbonisation target until 2016, Yeo said he would instead propose a more "acceptable" decision date of 2014, designed to coincide with the government's review of its commitment to the Climate Change Committee's fourth carbon budget that will cover the period up to 2027."It does seem very strange to me that when they're looking at the period up to 2027, they're reluctant to have a target for 2030 because the dates are so close," he said.Yeo is likely to propose the target at the end of February during the Bill's report stage, when any MP can propose an amendment.However, BusinessGreen has learnt Labour's Shadow Energy and Climate Change team are considering tabling their own amendment backing a decarbonisation target at an earlier stage in the Bill's reading.As a result of his vocal criticism of Osborne's energy strategy, Yeo is unlikely to be appointed by the Tory whip to review the Bill during its Committee stage, which is expected in a few weeks time.However, Labour will be able to appoint seven MPs to the Committee reviewing the bill, and Shadow Energy and Climate Ministers Luciana Berger and Tom Greatrex are both expected to be put forward, offering them the opportunity to push a decarbonisation target amendment.A Labour spokesman told BusinessGreen that Berger and Greatrex could introduce a similar amendment to Yeo's at that point."We're un-dogmatic about how we do it," said the Labour spokesman. "We support the target. Ed Miliband and Caroline Flint have both been clear that they want it in the Bill, and if it was down to us we would include it."An amendment from either Labour or Yeo would seek the support of a cross-party groups of MPs, including backbench Lib Dems and Conservatives and several influential MPs on the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee. Speaking to BusinessGreen, the Committee's Barry Gardiner, the Labour MP who also serves as Ed Miliband's special envoy on climate change, said he would "absolutely" reject the Energy Bill in its current form, and accused the government of being split over energy policy, which he says is creating uncertainty for investors.Arguing there were "fundamental flaws" in the current Bill, he said that if Labour were to win the 2015 election, it should move to limit gas capacity by tightening the Emissions Performance Standard (EPS) on power plants to a level that gas plants without carbon capture and storage technology could not comply with, such as 200 grams per kilowatt hour.He also said gas plants should receive "capacity payments" for when they are switched on to provide back up power, rather than payments for simply existing."Three to four gas plants should be offered high payments for the times when they need to come online to balance intermittent renewables, rather than receiving payments as baseload capacity," he argued.He also maintained that Labour needs to set out its energy plans as soon as possible to help long term investors understand what its policies would be in 2015."For baseload we do nuclear and renewables... and for the tweaking of the system, we pay a good return on capital to make sure three or four gas plants have a good return and investment certainty," he said."But that investment certainty does not go opening the floodgates to gas."Gardiner's proposed scenario would deliver significantly less new gas capacity than the 26GW envisaged by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) last month.He also defended Miliband's stance on climate change since he became leader of the opposition, which has prompted criticism from some green groups over the leader of the opposition's perceived reluctance to address the issue and his failure to mention climate change in his keynote speech at the party's conference.However, Gardiner insisted Miliband has spoken out on a few key issues, and was right to try and avoid becoming labelled "a one-trick pony"."As leader of the opposition, Ed has to be pound for pound - and more - beating Cameron on issues from education, health, benefits, the economy," he said. "All of those things are uppermost in people's minds, but he also has to be coming out with decent policy on areas that he knows about and cares about."The shadow team have launched strong criticisms against the Green Deal, energy security, and fuel poverty... But Ed has not fronted those up because he doesn't want to be labelled a one-trick pony."He added that his own role as Miliband's envoy demonstrated Labour would not be weak on energy and climate policy if they were to regain power. Since being appointed in 2010, Gardiner travels around the world meeting key political figures and reporting back to Miliband's team of advisors on the latest developments in climate policy."If Labour come back into government in 2015, as there is every indication we may well do, depending on the electorate, then I am absolutely confident that you will not see an inactive Ed Miliband for four years on climate change and the environment," he said. "That I will guarantee you.""But he has to become prime minister and you don't become prime minister by simply focusing on climate change and environment."
