She hopes that people appreciate the portraits with the sense of relaxed fun with which they were taken.” Olins, who has worked on advertising campaigns for a host of high street and designer fashion brands, said the duchess was “a joy to work with, a natural”. The royal family are no strangers to being photographed by the world’s best fashion photographers – the Queen was recently pictured in separate images with her beloved corgis and the royal children by Annie Leibovitz for her 90th birthday. The latest photos of the duchess were styled by British Vogue fashion director Lucinda Chambers and a colour image of the duchess in a brown Burberry coat and fedora will adorn the cover of the magazine’s June centenary issue.
