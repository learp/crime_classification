When we wrote about it in September, Brexit – and its numerous derivatives – had not yet made the cut, but this week the Collins Dictionary made good, naming Brexit the word of the year, ahead of Hygge and Trumpism. It’s a word further down the list that caught my eye: “sharenting” – the oversharing of pictures of offspring on social media by proud parents. Like Brexit, it carries a a big social load, the consequences of which are likely to be felt far into the future by those over-sharented kids. It set me thinking about “big” and “little” words - the trivial and ephemeral versus those that will become significant cultural markers.

Social workers do standup: ‘A good laugh makes you feel better’ | Norman Miller But is it important that those creating this sort of comedy have personal experience at the sharp end? (Brand worked for many years in psychiatric nursing.) Can any decent writer wring comic gold from a difficult subject through imagination and a bit of research alone – or is that the route to an offensive comedy pig’s ear?

Alan Howard 04 November 2016 2:53pmAs an educator with 39 plus years of experience I would say the amount of homework assigned in the uk,is excessive. Way to much no need for,it. Just as the constant testing and exams are over the top. One never has time to,teach. As the saying goes, weighing the baby all the time leaves no time for feeding   Matthew I 04 November 2016 2:48pmOnly homework at primary school should be learning spellings and times tables. 5 days a week is long enough to teach.   Knowles2 04 November 2016 2:38pmWhat make me laugh sometimes is how forgetful people around my age are, 29, some of them seem to think their little one is getting more homework than they did but I member at 6/7 get spelling lists to memories 20 to 30 words, maths worksheets to do, 2 or 3 books a week to read those little one sentence a page books and then at secondary school homework was pretty much unending. If I can do it with no long term effects and as a person who is hard of hearing and has speech difficulties, I'm sure my friends perfectly healthy kids will cope just fine.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.50pm GMT14:50The 10 household chores you need only do once a yearTim DowlingEarlier in the week I wrote a piece about the Good Housekeeping Institute’s claim that there are 10 household chores you need only do once a year. They made it sound as if they were cutting us all some slack, but there were chores on their list I simply hadn’t heard of - who wipes down their lightbulbs? It turns out my lightbulbs are pretty dirty, but I was happier not knowing. Given the comments, it seemed a lot of people felt the same way - that if you can get away with not doing a chore for a whole year, then it can probably wait another year, or ten. Just last night I went to see a stand-up who quoted one of her ex-husband’s frequent criticisms - “I’ve never seen you wash a door,” he said. Before that, the idea had never occurred to her. What household chores have you escaped through sheer ignorance of their existence? Come and spoil it for the rest of us. The 10 jobs you have to do only once a year – can you do them all in a day?

A 2012 found that Spanish 15-year-olds have 6.5 hours of homework a week, nearly one-and-a-half hours more a week than the average. And children from the ages of three to six in the country are apparently doing half an hour’s homework every day. Parents are being given letters to send to schools by a campaign group, urging headteachers not to set homework.It is a touchy subject for parents. I don’t remember having any homework until I was in secondary school, but my seven year old daughter has a “homework menu” which she can choose to do some things from each half-term. She’s also expected to do reading at home nearly every night. It isn’t over-burdensome, but it does sometimes take a chunk out of our weekend when we could be doing things that are perhaps a bit more fun for all the family.We asked readers from around the world what they thought of the amount of homework given to their children. Craig in Romania told us “My son often stays up until midnight finishing off homework” and Zainab from London said “My son is constantly stressed about work and no longer sees learning as fun.”What do you think? Do children get too much homework? Does it impact on family life too much? Or should kids just knuckle down and get on with it?Updatedat 2.08pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.46pm GMT13:46Caelainn BarrOn polls, here’s something from data journalist Caelainn Barr. Donald Trump has been gaining ground in the polls since the announcement by the FBI that it has discovered new emails that may relate to Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server during her time as secretary of state.One of the problems with many of the polls we’ve seen this week is the margin of error, or by how many points the polls could be wrong. In most cases this has been greater than the lead taken by either candidate.As Trump and Clinton make their final campaign push in key swing states what now ultimately matters is who goes out and votes next Tuesday and the narrowing polls could help boost turnout.Updatedat 1.47pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.30pm GMT13:30Are you worried about the US election?James WalshBut how about something that could make make a lot of people very unhappy?

My husband is the opposite, which makes for problems sometimes in winter when he accuses me of being crepuscular, verging on the nocturnal. However, I once visited the Lofotens (beautiful) and the continual half light did eventually become a little depressing, so I can see how this could be a medical issue and a serious problem for some people.

But what happens when we don’t get enough light? One answer seems to be seasonal affective disorder, and readers had an interesting discussion beneath this piece looking at therapy lamps that aim to halt it. Therapy lamps tested: ‘The optical equivalent of freezing cold shower' ‘Winters have made me ill since I was a small child’   Oneiroi 01 November 2016 6:59pmWinters have made me ill since I was a small child. I am fine in other countries that have clear days with bright sunlight, just shorter hours of it, but the endless grey halflight of the UK is unbearable.I have been using one of these sunrise alarms clocks for over a decade, through most of which I had such long working hours I had to survive on 4/5 hours sleep. Even when you are exhausted these lamps work, waking you up gradually rather than jolting you awake with loud noise. I also have a SAD desk lamp at my office. It has transformed winters for me. Arriving at work in the dark, leaving in the dark and sitting away from natural light would previously make me feel more and more run down, even when going out to get some quick natural light at lunchtime and making the most of opportunities to get out in sunshine at weekends (few and far between!). I cannot recommend these lamps enough to anybody who struggles with the incessant greyness of the UK.  Guardian Music writer Tim Jonze with one of the SAD lamps tested. Photograph: Rob Greig for the Guardian‘Using a light box is a good way to go’   streetphotobeing 01 November 2016 5:11pmA large study in the Netherlands found that sunlight hours correlated to levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) - low in winter high in summer - which is very important to neurogenesis and found to be low in many mental illness. So it seems using a light box is a good way to go.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3487856/‘Even better if combined with a bit of light exercise’   72degrees 01 November 2016 6:40pmI have a 'LitePod' standing on my desk next to my computer while I do a morning check of emails etc. Light therapy works best in the early morning. Works for me. I also get out in natural daylight as much as I can, even better if combined with a bit of light exercise sweeping up leaves in the garden. Then I'm lucky enough to have a garden that I can go out in to and a large greenhouse that I can sit in the end of having a cuppa (with the door open so that I get direct sunlight in to the eyes). Low sunlight levels during the winter also coincide with cold air and wet roads or I'd indulge more in the equally beneficial "RAM" treatment (Riding A Motorcycle).What do you think?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.57am GMT11:57Welcome to our socialSarah MarshHello all, and welcome to our weekly social, where we discuss the best of the week in terms of news and comment with our readers.
