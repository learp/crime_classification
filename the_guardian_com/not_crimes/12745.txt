One of Australia’s biggest mining battles could be drawing to a close, with the enormous Shenhua Watermark coalmine looking set to be stopped by the state government after relentless community pressure.In a major victory for the uneasy coalition of environmentalists, farmers and conservative politicians and commentators, the New South Wales government said it was moving to stop mining in the fertile farming soils of the Liverpool Plains.State buys back controversial BHP mining licence on Liverpool plains The NSW premier, Mike Baird, said mining under the most fertile soils in the country “poses too great a risk for the future of this food bowl and the underground water sources that support it”.It came with two announcements late on Thursday afternoon.First, Baird announced the government was paying $200m to buy back BHP’s licence to build a huge underground coalmine at Caroona.Second, the government also revealed it was negotiating with Shenhua to excise parts of its licence that encroached on the “strategic agricultural lands” of the Liverpool Plains.The statements were grand, but also carefully hedged. The government avoided saying they were moving to end coalmining in the Liverpool Plains more generally. Rather, it was just the “fertile black soils” and the “strategic agricultural lands” that would not be mined.But the distinction seemed like a strange one for the government to make.These interventions were driven by a vigorous community campaign. And that campaign will not settle for Shenhua’s mine merely being shrunk to avoid falling on one type of soil rather than another.“The only solution that the people will accept is that the Liverpool is preserved, like a national park for agriculture,” says Tim Duddy, a farmer from the region and head of the Caroona coal action group.Jeremy Buckingham, the NSW Greens mining spokesman, said the distinction between the two soil types was meaningless.“No one believes them for a minute that slightly reducing the footprint of the mine will in any way ameliorate the impact that a 20km long, 200m deep open-cut coalmine will have on an incredibly sensitive and interconnected water and agricultural system,” he said.“The expectation in the community is that that mine will be bought out too.”And it wasn’t just the locals and mining opponents who were not fully on board with Baird’s language. BHP denied that any of its mine was actually going to occur under the fertile black soils.“We carried out extensive planning to ensure there would be no mining under the black soil plains, consistent with the conditions contained in our exploration licence,” BHP Australia’s president, Mike Henry, said. They “accept the government’s decision” but insist the the mine could have proceeded sustainably.Doubts over future of Shenhua's $1.2bn Watermark coalmine in NSW – reports And for the Shenhua mine, despite categorical community opposition to mining anywhere on the Liverpool Plains, a spokesman for Baird told the Guardian the negotiations with Shenhua were focused only on excising those areas of the title that are on the strategic agricultural land.Shenhua was not willing to comment. But commentators have speculated the mine could not go ahead without encroaching on the black soils of the region. And now with the Caroona mine gone, it will not be able to share any infrastructure, and all the community’s energy will be focused squarely on them.The state government has been walking a thin line between supporting a declining coal industry and recognising the need for a transition. And the hedged language could be a way of managing that manoeuvre – moving to end coalmining in the Liverpool Plains while saying it is doing something slightly more limited.Unusually, neither the Minerals Council of Australia nor the NSW Minerals Council were willing to comment. “It’s a matter between the government and a private company,” a spokesman for the NSW Minerals Council said.A financial analyst, Tim Buckley, from the Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis, said both projects are commercially unviable. I think BHP has taken the NSW government and taxpayers for a ride demanding $220m compensationTim Buckley, financial analyst “To me they are clear stranded assets,” he said.“I think BHP has taken the NSW government and taxpayers for a ride demanding $220m compensation.”Buckley said it also meant the government had shown its hand to Shenhua, before it had a chance to close negotiations with it, having paid out 1.8 times what BHP paid for its licence. If it followed the same path with Shenhua, it would be up for more than half a billion dollars.“Shenhua has spent the last 18 months closing coalmines in China to reduce Chinese oversupply,” Buckley said. “It’s highly unlikely Shenhua will turn around and invest over $1bn to build yet more greenfield capacity when they have excess coal coming out their ears and Chinese national coal demand is down over 5% this year after a 4% decline last year and a 3% decline the year before.“China passed peak coal in 2013 and as the largest coalminer in China, Shenhua totally understands this.”Buckingham said the government needed to confront the reality of a declining industry. “The NSW government have today woken up to the reality that new coalmines are unviable and the Greens are calling on Mike Baird to commit to a transition plan away from coal,” he says.And while the Liverpool Plains might be the first place in NSW to see coalmining stopped, the Greens are pushing to see it spread around the state.“The next step must be the cancellation of the neighbouring Shenhua Watermark mine which continues to threaten the Liverpool Plains, as well as KEPCO’s Bylong project and Hume Coal’s Berrima proposal.”Duddy said the writing was on the wall for Shenhua, and that the focus on one type of soil could just be a way for the government to minimise the amount of money it will have to pay the company to pull out.“It may come to a point where they’ll say ‘Well the mine is no longer viable’ and they can gracefully back out of it,” he said.
