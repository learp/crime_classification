It’s bizarre to think of a time when Pokémon Go didn’t exist (last week), and how we ended up obsessively following a game that uses your phone’s GPS to chase imaginary creatures around real locations, using it to commit crimes, run around a US Holocaust Memorial Museum and cure global obesity. But that’s life. Like most children’s games, the Nintendo game’s emphasis is on the visual. The same can sometimes be said for fashion, but as it happens, the two overlap. Again, though, that’s life.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Snorlax This guy is known for being greedy, fat and narcoleptic. Still, its updated nautical colour scheme and oversized silhouette are very Philip Lim 3.1.

The colours – mustard and mushroom – make little sense, except when compared to Valentino SS16, and only because it’s broken up with a mid-colour shirt. Something to think about, you weird.

Still, the colour scheme of three shades of green is refreshingly simpleand reminiscent of Richard James’ SS16 catwalk show.

Visually, he’s a bit basic except he’s not, because he’s pre-referencing Vetements’ corporate logo DHL chic, 2016’s most referenced bit of kit. Composite: Rex
