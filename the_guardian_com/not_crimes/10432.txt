Hasbro has reported its biggest jump in quarterly revenue in nearly five years, driven by demand for toys based on the Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Jurassic World movies. Revenue from toys targeted at boys, which include action figures based on the two blockbuster films released last year, surged 35% to $569.8m (£395m) in the final three months of 2015. Industry-wide sales of Star Wars-licensed merchandise totalled about $700m in the US in 2015, according to retail researchers NPD Group. Larger rival Mattel reported a surprise rise in quarterly net sales this month as sales of Barbie dolls recovered and demand rose for Hot Wheels toys, driven by Star-Wars-licensed items such as the Millennium Falcon Starship.
