Late Night Woman’s Hour is to become a permanent fixture on Radio 4 with a regular show airing once a month, hosted by Lauren Laverne, starting this Thursday. In a bid to attract younger female listeners it is also launching a special online video feature.Last summer an eight-part series was trialled, fronted by Laverne and long-term Woman’s Hour presenter Jane Garvey.It proved a success, although some listeners were a little shocked at some of the language, and Laverne had to apologise after Guardian journalist Hannah Jane Parkinson let an expletive slip out in a discussion about Tinder. The late night show will complement the daily series of Woman’s Hour, which is gearing up to celebrate 70 years on air this October, and discuss the issues raised in more depth.Its first programme will feature Laverne and guests discussing the issue of purity in food, sex and religion. In a further new departure, Late Night Woman’s Hour will also feature a pilot online video series called The Green Room using familiar BBC faces such as Claudia Winkleman. The Green Room will look at “the everyday lived experience of women and include short, shareable films and celebrity interviews” as well as “bespoke location pieces, for example on a BBC film set”, plus “repackaged existing BBC content”.It will all be available on the corporation’s new ideas website BBC Taster. Woman’s Hour editor Alice Feinstein said: “For 70 years Woman’s Hour has been at the cutting edge of women’s experience of the world and it’s clear that now, perhaps more than ever, young women are engaged and interested in these issues. I’m excited that the launch of Late Night Woman’s Hour with Lauren Laverne and The Green Room adds to our offer for our audience.”Although Garvey presented the final two episodes of the month-long run, and said she loved it because Late Night Woman’s Hour allowed for “the sort of revealing, intimate conversations it’s difficult to have at 10am, however hard you try”, she will not be returning but will continue as a regular host on the daily show. A BBC spokesman explained: “Lauren Laverne presented most of the short run of Late Night Woman’s Hour when it launched last summer and will continue in this role now that the programme has been given a monthly slot on Radio 4.“Late Night Woman’s Hour complements the daily magazine programme giving more time to discuss individual topics in-depth, and we’re delighted to be welcoming Lauren into the team, alongside Jenni Murray and Jane Garvey.”
