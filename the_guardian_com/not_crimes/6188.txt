To Disney’s Beauty and the Beast movie, an adaptation that doesn’t seem to be being taken nearly seriously enough by its principals.According to Dan Stevens, who plays the Beast, he was captivated by co-star Emma Watson’s speech at the UN in 2014, where she called for men and boys to join the drive for women’s equality. As Dan tells the Daily Beast (no relation): “You need to engage masculine energy, and grapple with what that balance is, what that entails, what are the elements of the patriarchy that need walking down and which are just elements of masculinity that need to be balanced with femininity … All of these ideas are very much at play in Beauty and the Beast and they’re also very much at play in Emma Watson’s mind.”To which the only reasonable response is: is this story still the one about Stockholm syndrome? Yes. Yes it is. Elsewhere, I am pleased to also note a photospread of Dan paying a visit to the new Beauty and Beast attraction at one of Disneyland’s Anaheim theme parks, where I hope he had a chance to discuss fourth-wave feminism and masculine energy with the Mouse while eating a 24in churro.Even so, has there ever been a more anxiously earnest era of actor interviews to promote blockbusters that frequently feel like thinly disguised financial products? There is a whole generation of actors who never read a comic book until they were cast in a superhero movie, and their attempts to elevate the form in interviews about their roles consequently tend toward the excruciating. The form does not require elevating: it is the actors themselves who betray a self-regarding unease at not being involved in serious enough work.As for the movie’s historic “first exclusively gay moment”, Stevens will only be drawn on the matter “begrudgingly”, according to the Daily Beast. “I presume somebody somewhere thought it would drive a lot of traffic to their site,” he remarks, “that’s usually how these things start.” Well quite. Disney’s Beauty and the Beast is a complex and shaded feminist movie, not a groundbreaking gay rights one. Please adjust your records accordingly.
