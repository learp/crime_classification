A biography of the 19th-century explorer Alexander von Humboldt, who has “faded from collective memory” despite being dubbed “the Shakespeare of the sciences” by his peers, has won the £25,000 prize for the best science book of the year.The Invention of Nature: The Adventures of Alexander von Humboldt, the Lost Hero of Science by Andrea Wulf – review Andrea Wulf’s The Invention of Nature, which lays out the life of the Prussian explorer and naturalist Humboldt, was named winner of the Royal Society Insight Investment science book prize on Monday evening by chair of judges Bill Bryson. Humboldt, who lived from 1769 to 1859, inspired scientists and writers including Jules Verne and Charles Darwin in his day. He has more things named after him than anyone who has ever lived, including an ocean current, a six-foot squid and a breed of penguin.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Andrea Wulf .

His interdisciplinary approach puts paid to the ridiculous notion that science and the arts are separate entities. We should be taking our cues from Humboldt – be curious and be informed by science on the big issues.”
