At school I joined in with as many sports as possible – netball, athletics, whatever was on. Just after my GCSEs, some people from a talent identification initiative came and tested the sporty people in my year. I got a letter saying I’d been selected for flat-water kayaking. I’d done a bit of kayaking on holiday, but I’d never heard of it as a competitive sport. I went along, picked it up fairly quickly and was soon entering races. It was really exciting.There are quite a few strands to kayaking. From leisure paddling, where people go out on a plastic kayak for a picnic, to slalom, white-water racing and canoe polo. Flat-water kayaking, in which I compete at national level, takes place anywhere with a long stretch of water, much like the Olympic rowing events. In a sprint, you line up in one of nine lanes, then go as fast as you can in a straight line for either 200, 500 or 1,000 metres.I race with the Burton Phoenix canoe club. The racing kayaks are long, sleek and about the width of your hips. They’re also unstable – it takes good core strength to stop them capsizing. Paddling is demanding on the whole body, not only your arms and shoulders. Most of the power is actually generated through your legs, by pushing against a footrest on the inside of the boat and twisting your hips. Your arms are just a lever for the paddles.Apart from wanting to win, the main draw is the social side. You see the same faces at regattas, and I’ve made friends with people from all over the country. Being on the water allows you to see a different side of a place. When you’re walking around a city, everything feels so cramped. But as soon as you get on the water, you’re surrounded by greenery, the banks of the river disappear into the distance and suddenly the place feels more natural, fresher. Training early on a winter’s morning with the fog rising off the water is a very special place to be.My workout: Ameet Palahe, 28, CrossFit devotee – ‘It’s addictive’ My weekend workoutYears kayaking? Seven.How often do you train? Once or even twice a day, for 60-90 minutes.Favourite place to kayak? Loch Awe in Scotland.Five ways to get started1 The first thing to master is getting in and out. For the former, hold on to the front of the cockpit with one hand, the bank with the other, put both feet in and sit down. To get out, don’t hold on to the bank – hold on to the front of the cockpit with both hands, bring your feet into your bum, pull yourself up and step out.2 To find the right position for your hands, hold the paddle horizontally above your head, then shuffle your hands until your elbows are at right angles.3 When paddling, you want to stick the whole blade (the paddle head) into the water at a steep angle, as close to the boat as possible. Pull it out before it goes past your hip, or you’ll start turning.4 If you capsize, don’t try to clamber back in – swim to the side and wait for someone to grab the boat.5 A lot of activity centres and clubs run free sessions for beginners. As with any outdoor sport there’s an element of danger, so they’re a good way to learn the basic techniques in a safe, supervised environment.
