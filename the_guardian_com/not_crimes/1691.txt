I grew up in a nice little working-class council house in Blackheath, south-east London. Dad was a wiry little Protestant Glaswegian and Mum was an Irish Catholic and they were bizarre. It was as if they didn’t like one another. He only spoke when he was drunk. Otherwise, he was hung over or at work. When he left the army he became a builder, then he worked a long while for Wall’s ice cream. He was an introvert who liked the pub but he was out of his comfort zone being around a lot of people.As the youngest of five children I was Mum’s little surprise. There was a 10-year gap between me and my next oldest sibling, John, and I remember feeling loneliness. I was the little kid and I grew up in the box room. I can’t remember being unloved, although I never really cuddled my dad till I got drunk when I was older and instigated it myself. I was a bit of a latchkey kid.Jim Davidson: Comedy is no longer a laughing matter | Victoria Coren I remember one Christmas when all the family had turned up, listening to the terrible rows and fights downstairs, but I never saw any violence. I never saw my dad hit my mum. Later in life, my mum would phone my brother Bill and say, “Come round, Jock has hit me,” and he’d go round there and Dad would be battered in the corner. Mum had bashed him up.I always thought Mum was better than anybody else. I had a feeling she thought she was as well. One of the greatest moments in my life was when I’d won New Faces in 1976 and I said, “Mum, you’ll never have to work again as long as you live.” She never did. I gave her seven grand to buy their council house and they both died there as homeowners. That was probably my proudest moment, although it was embarrassing as Mum stuck a wagon wheel outside to make it not look like a council house.Mum outlived Dad by six or seven years and when he died of emphysema, aged 79, she started to write a book about her life, which I read for the first time last year and I was in floods of tears. You don’t really look at your mother as a person. You just look at them as your mum. So to read that she was put in a home because her own mother couldn’t afford to look after her, and that she was beaten by the nuns, was heartbreaking. She never told me any of that. Dad would have been so proud that we're not the kids from Glasgow any more I got married for the first time [to Sue Walpole] when I was 17. I would have been happily married for ever if I hadn’t been famous. It was just too tempting suddenly having all these available nice-looking women. I’m still friends with wives one, two and four but wife number three [Allison Holloway] was the one who accused me of being a wife beater. But it is funny how three of the ex-wives got together and wrote a joint letter to the papers – which no one wanted to print – saying, “How come he’s never laid a finger on us?” My current wife [Michelle Cotton] is 45 and I’m 63 this year. She’s a good wife. Will there be a wife number six? I don’t know. I never know what’s going to happen round the corner. There could be a six and a seven and an eight. Please God I live that long.I’ve got five children and one granddaughter and I’m a much better father than I used to be. I put the last four through private school; they’re bright as hell and have university degrees. Dad would have been so proud that we’re not the kids from Glasgow any more. My family gives me great pride, but it also teaches me that I can’t govern the way adult people are. They need to find their own way. Family gives you a duty, not a duty to control, or to overprotect, but a duty to let them out of the nest and let them come back. And in fact that’s what happened. • Jim Davidson, 40 Years On, tours the UK until 18 February. For tickets visit jimdavidson.org.uk
