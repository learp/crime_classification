Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from your suggestions after last week’s callout. Thanks for taking part.  about how our weekly Readers recommend series works at the end of the piece.Recovery is a tricky subject to pin down as people’s ideas of what it means are so personal. A lot of you mentioned struggles with mental health, and I’d like to wish you all well with your own personal recoveries. For others, it can be digging yourself out of a financial hole – as in the first song on our list this week.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The YouTube playlist.Your knowledge of the lyrics to The Only Way Is Up by Yazz and the Plastic Population may have been tainted grey by hazy memories of a million office parties, but it describes a couple in pretty dire straits looking to recover. “If we should be evicted from our homes / we’ll just move somewhere else and still carry on” is a line that’s become all too familiar again in these troubled times. Let’s hope everyone who is suffering a similar fate in the housing crisis has someone to help them. AC/DC’s Back in Black is the band’s cathartic tribute to fallen frontman and friend Bon Scott and, let’s face it, a banger. Scott’s successor, Brian Johnson, managed to pull off something life-affirming and powerful in what could have been an awkward position, and the band went from strength to strength. There is a spiritual theme in the subsequent couplet, Get Up Off Our Knees by the Housemartins and Jens Lekman’s Evening Prayer. The latter especially explores a rather leftfield way to deal with trauma – making a 3D model of a tumour and taking it to a bar with you. Whatever works, I guess.Hot Chocolate’s I’ll Put You Together Again is a beautiful song about being the best pen-pal in the world. More seriously, it’s about reaching out to someone who is at rock bottom and feels they have nowhere else to turn. On A Better Son/Daughter, Jenny Lewis of Rilo Kiley sings beautifully about fighting depression and alcoholism. PJ Harvey sings of the struggle not to lose yourself in the big city, and mostly winning, on the wonderful Good Fortune. And Resurrection by Terence Trent D’Arby completes a brilliant and varied trio of songs by bona fide heroes.I couldn’t resist On the Improve by John Williamson because its story of collective recovery is a nice break from the slightly claustrophobic feel of all the tales of intensely personal struggles. And Fighting My Way Back by Thin Lizzy underlines my intention to tackle this subject head-on and not reject songs others may think a little “on the nose”.The penultimate song is one I hadn’t heard before. Quite a few people nominated Start Over Again by Emily Maguire, and it’s clearly a song that means a lot to many of you. I’d like to express my solidarity with one particular contributor – we’re all with you..Finally, any playlist about recovery must surely end on a beautifully positive note. So I was very grateful for the suggestion of Get Happy by Judy Garland. I sincerely hope that if you are on your way back from a tough time, you are able, even for a short time, to take solace in all the wonderful music in the world. Good luck.
