Donald Trump has been struggling to find a musician willing to perform at his inauguration in January, with the likes of Elton John, Gene Simmons and Garth Brooks declining his offer. Now one group – a band who in many ways embody the spirit and themes of the American dream – have confirmed that they are considering their offer to perform at the event.“The Beach Boys have been asked to perform as part of the inauguration festivities,” a spokesperson for the for the group told Billboard. “But no decision has been made at this point as to how or whether they will participate. We will let you know as soon as a decision is final.”A representative has confirmed that Al Jardine and Brian Wilson would not be involved in this event. The group have a chequered history when it comes to their political affiliation. They have been enlisted for a number of political events throughout their career, performing for George HW Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, who dubbed them “America’s band” in 1983.Mike Love, a longtime Republican, performed a fundraiser for John McCain in 2008, at which the politician infamously modified a line of the Beach Boys 1965 hit Barbara Ann: “Bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran.” In 2012, Beach Boy Bruce Johnston was asked whether he liked the democratic leader: “Obama? Unless you’re interested in never having any money and being socialised.”So far only one name has been confirmed for Trump’s inauguration: 16-year-old opera singer Jackie Evancho. Announcing her role in an interview with the Today show, she confirmed she would be singing the national anthem.“It’s a little nerve-racking, but I’m honored,” she said. “I get to perform for the office. I’m very excited.”• This article and the photograph were changed on 23 December 2016 to clarify that Al Jardine and Brian Wilson are not in the Beach Boys touring lineup considering taking part in the inauguration ceremony.
