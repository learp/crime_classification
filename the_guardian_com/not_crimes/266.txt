“See it with someone you love” is a line marketing folk frequently haul out to trumpet the cosy romantic virtues of a relationship movie, be it a comfortingly snuggly romcom or the supposed aphrodisiac of Fifty Shades of Grey. Watching other people fall in love, the line implies, makes us feel more sweetly secure in our own real-life romances: you may not look as good as the on-screen lovers, and your dialogue may not be quite as cute, but you essentially have what they have at the happy fadeout.The Lovers review – Debra Winger impresses in nuanced tale of infidelity You don’t see the opposite advice plastered across many posters, but the “maybe don’t see it with someone you love” genre is a rich and varied one: as long as there is Hollywood romance, there will be more jaded film-makers out to dismantle its illusions. And while brittle marital dissections and breakup dramas will never be advertised as date movies, they can be just as comforting or even cathartic for the audience – reflecting as they do the imperfection of every relationship, acknowledging real life after the happy ending. Azazel Jacobs’ The Lovers, which opens in the US today, follows in this noble, thorny tradition. Starring Tracy Letts and a resurgent Debra Winger, it tells the story of a middle-aged husband and wife on the verge of divorce, having each maintained long-term extramarital affairs – only to find their love unexpectedly rekindled by the possibility of permanent separation.That complication alone makes The Lovers a warmer entry than many in the canon of marital-strife studies, the best of which range in approach from elegiac sentimentality to all-out emotional assault. Perhaps no film-maker has covered the tonal bases quite as comprehensively as Woody Allen, whose own romantic failings have long bled into his work – never more scarringly than in Husbands and Wives, an exhilaratingly acidic anatomy of two bourgeois New York couples in crisis, as the breakup of one exerts an anxious domino effect on the other. With the film released in the immediate wake of Allen’s cataclysmic separation from Mia Farrow, it’s now impossible to see their rancorous onscreen arguments as pure fiction; six years on from the more gently good-humoured projection of their romantic estrangement in Hannah and Her Sisters, it plays as a scorched-earth goodbye.Allen learned from the best, of course. He has been openly in thrall to Ingmar Bergman throughout his career, and Husbands and Wives is his smaller-scale answer to the searing emotional nudity of Scenes From a Marriage – Bergman’s painstakingly detailed, decade-spanning map of middle-class marital disintegration, drawn from his own past relationship with the leading lady, Liv Ullmann. If Allen’s film presciently anticipated a parting, this intimate epic (nearly five hours long in its original, broadcast TV form) is coloured by the acute wisdom of hindsight; after it nettled audiences in its native Sweden, the national divorce rate saw a significant surge.

The third entry in an ongoing relationship chronicle that began as a breezy boy-meets-girl escapade, Linklater’s deceptively sun-splashed, Peleponnese-set talkathon culminated in a hot, steaming release of pent-up fury leading into guarded, still-uncertain rapprochement – to watch it was the discomfiting cinematic equivalent of being caught in a spontaneous row between dear friends.Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie: a marriage that started – and ended – on screen It wasn’t, of course, the first film to use a seemingly idyllic summer holiday as the window through which to view a fractured marriage: Roberto Rosselini’s groundbreakingly modernist Voyage to Italy cast his eventual ex-wife Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders as a frostily drifting English couple coming apart under the Neapolitan sun – Italy’s romantic reputation only coming to their rescue, perhaps, at the eleventh hour. The south of France, meanwhile, is the backdrop for the fractious marital friction between Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney in Two For the Road, which skitters slyly back and forth across their twelve-year relationship, finding fault-lines at all stages – an elegantly tricksy structure that influenced the undiluted scotch of Blue Valentine’s far bleaker survey of two beautiful people slip-sliding away from each other. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are exquisitely doomed, while Finney’s and Hepburn’s is a flawed but sporadically joyful pairing. You’d certainly rather be mired in their marriage than Finney’s far more toxic one to Diane Keaton, years later, in Alan Parker’s scorching, sorely underestimated Shoot the Moon, in which a husband’s infidelity and his paranoia over his wife straying land them in a cold, cruel deadlock.The above titles represent but a scant sampling of cinema’s bad-romance playlist, which runs the gamut from the unvarnished emotional honesty of John Cassavetes’ Faces to the frisky game-playing of Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice, from the polite, anguished reconciliation of Ozu’s Early Spring to the ambiguous sexual healing of Antonioni’s La Notte, from the heightened hipster lyricism of Sarah Polley’s Take This Waltz to the deliberate, magnified alienation-by-degrees of Andrew Haigh’s 45 Years. There are as many ways to pull two people apart in a film as there are to have them meet cute, while watching a relationship dissolve on screen can be as heart-bursting as watching it come together – and not necessarily depressing. Even love in the movies doesn’t always go to plan; we needn’t hold ourselves to the fairytale.
