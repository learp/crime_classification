When we took the road over Windwhistle Hill, between the old towns of Crewkerne and Chard, we did not stop to test the claim that from its highest points, more than 700ft above sea level, you can sometimes see both the Severn estuary in the north and the English channel in the south.But when we got to Chard we admired the two clear streams that ripple in the gullies on either side of Fore Street, which are said, when they leave the town, to connect eventually with both coasts, one flowing north and the other south. And the loud cry of a seagull reminded us that we were not far from Lyme Bay.Across the street, a fine gabled and mullioned house, the home of Chard school since 1671, is built in a distinctive mix of materials, chert and hamstone, which gives it particular character. Chert is a flint-like quartz in blue and whitish greys, and these walls, made of courses of chert in small, squared blocks, makes for mottled effects which are effectively set off by the golden hamstone in mullions, doorways, and ornaments.Hamstone, something of an aristocrat among Somerset building stones, is still quarried from Ham Hill, which we had passed on our way. On Fore Street, you pass hamstone pillars, pilasters and pediments, indicators of pride and status in the houses they embellish.Then down one narrow alleyway a tall, functional brick factory building takes you by surprise. It would look more at home in Lowry's Salford, but was formerly Holyrood Lace Mill, when mechanical lace making was one of the industries that created the wealth reflected in Chard's fine houses and bold Guildhall with its two-tiered portico and ranks of Tuscan pillars. A few steps on, a notice for the flower festival with cream teas at the Methodist church drew us into a cool, quiet, and hospitable space.
