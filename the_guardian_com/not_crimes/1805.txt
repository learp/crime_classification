Disney is the worst performing of the “big seven” Hollywood studios when it comes to hiring black directors, according to a new report.USC Annenberg’s Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative collected data from the top 100 films at the box office every year for the last decade, and found that 5.1% of directors were black – and none of their films were made or distributed by Disney.The figures were just as dispiriting when it came to gender: only 4% of the top 100 films were directed by women, with the worst years being 2013 and 2014. The study found that there was a male-female director ratio of 16:1 over the 10-year time period. Only three of the 612 directors were black women: Ava DuVernay, Gina Prince-Bythewood and Sanaa Hamri.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Tyler Perry’s Boo! A Madea Halloween. Photograph: Daniel McFadden/APWhile Disney failed to promote black film directors (and hired five for its 101 entries in the 1,000-film sample), Lionsgate had the best record for employing African American film-makers – principally through its association with Tyler Perry, with whom it has released a string of successful films, mostly centring Perry’s cross-dressing comedy character Madea. Warner Bros tops the list of female director hires, with 10.In a statement, the report’s lead author, Stacy Smith said: “Our research consistently shows that behind the camera, directing is predominantly an occupation held by white males. When the lens is this skewed, it offers a tilted view of society to audiences – one that lacks the perspective of women and people of colour.”
