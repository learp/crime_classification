Filmic 2016, BristolElectronic music in film is key at this event, and if your knowledge of the subject extends little beyond that Daft Punk cameo in Tron: Legacy, it’s a chance to brush up on a history that goes right back to the mid-1930s. Sunday brunch screenings this month include key examples, such as Bride Of Frankenstein and Hitchcock classics Spellbound and The Birds (next month: John Carpenter), and theremin queen Lydia Kavina gives a concert – performing her music for Tim Burton movies such as Mars Attacks! – and introduction to the instrument at St George’s Bristol. Other highlights include a screening of Suede’s new film Night Thoughts accompanied by a Q&A, maverick composer and one-time Pink Floyd collaborator Ron Geesin in conversation, 20s Ukrainian silent film Arsenal with a live score, and a new Frank Zappa concert film.Various venues, Sun to 29 MayKinoteka, LondonPolish cinema is alive and well, as the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2015 win for Ida indicated. But although there’s new talent to spot, as always the real draw at this annual festival is the older talent – in particular, retrospectives of three Iron Curtain veterans who helped put the country on the map. First up is Jerzy Skolimowski, former Polanski collaborator and purveyor of vintage British classics such as The Shout and Deep End, who presents his latest, the formally innovative 11 Minutes. Also in town, and still in business, is Agnieszka Holland, a former arthouse fixture who’s moved on to directing TV such as The Wire and House Of Cards. And then there’s Andrzej Zuławski, best known for his deranged horror Possession, who sadly died in February. The UK premiere of his final film, the typically offbeat Cosmos, is followed by a panel discussion.Various venues, Thu to 28 Apr
