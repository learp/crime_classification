Britain's loudest bird, the bittern, is enjoying its best year since records began, thanks partly to a new penchant for nesting in disused and working quarries.The bittern – a relative of the grey heron – was classed as extinct in the late 19th century, and as recently as the late 1990s there were thought to be only 11 males left belting out their distinctive booming call.But this year more than 100 breeding males have been recorded at 26 sites across England, 15 of them at working or former quarries.A partnership between the RSPB and the government advisory body Natural England is aiming to encourage the sustainable restoration of quarries. The partnership, which is called Nature After Minerals, works with industry, local councils and conservation experts to try to create new habitats for wildlife.Darren Moorcroft, head of species and habitats conservation at the RSPB, said: "It's fantastic news that all the effort that has been put into restoring quarry sites around the country has provided a home for this rare and unique bird. Catching a glimpse of a bittern as it takes off from a reed bed and hearing its amazing booming call are the real rewards for this vital work."Members of the Mineral Products Association manage or control areas adding up to the equivalent of a small national park.Among sites where the bitterns are doing well is Needingworth quarry in the Cambridgeshire Fens where Hanson Aggregates is working with the RSPB to create one of the largest wetland habitats in Europe.Along with the bitterns, it is hoped new reed beds in the Fens will help secure the future of marsh harriers, snipe, reed buntings, bearded tits and warblers.The bittern was common in western and central Europe until the 19th century. In the UK it was hunted for the dinner table and also suffered because its watery homes were drained for farmland.The species was judged extinct in the UK by 1885 but then made a comeback so that by the 1950s there were some 80 males with full voice. The loss of further reed beds led to the bittern declining once more.It remains difficult to be precise about how many bitterns there are because they are secretive, living most of their lives among dense reeds. But the male's call, which it makes by filling its gullet with air and then releasing it, gives it away. It can be heard at a distance of several miles, enabling scientists to count the number of birds.
