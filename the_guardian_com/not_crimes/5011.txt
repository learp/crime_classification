The actor Tom Hardy has confirmed interest in playing James Bond – by refusing to discuss the matter. Speaking to the Daily Beast, Hardy was keen to express enthusiasm at the interviewer’s suggestion Inception director Christopher Nolan take over the franchise. “Oh, wow, Chris would be amazing!” said Hardy. “Wow, that would be cool. That would be so cool.”When pressed, Hardy ducked the question of his taking over the mantle from current 007 Daniel Craig by making reference to a conspiracy of silence among contenders.“There’s a saying amongst us in the fraternity of acting,” said Hardy, “that if you talk about it you’re automatically out of the race. So I can’t possibly comment on that one!”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Dunkirk trailer: Christopher Nolan’s epic second world war filmHardy continued: “But Chris Nolan, what a fantastic director for a Bond movie. Because Daniel [Craig] is so good, and what [Sam] Mendes and Barbara [Broccoli] have done has been so impressive, that it would be a very hard reimagination to follow.“I wonder what the next instalment of that franchise would become, and I think when you mention someone like Christopher Nolan, that’s a very powerful figure to bring into that world who could bring something new and create something profound – again.”Craig’s continuation in the role has yet to be confirmed. The actor, now 48, is still suspected to be the producers’ first choice. Rumours of a $150m payday for the next two films have been debunked. Craig’s assertion, while promoting Spectre, that he’d “rather slash my wrists” than make another Bond movie – has led to intense speculation about who might replace the actor. Along with Hardy, Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Jamie Bell and Tom Hughes have been mooted.
