Rapper Lil Wayne has clarified his comments on Black Lives Matter, putting his claims that the movement “had nothing to do with [him]” down to being agitated by a line of questioning about his daughter.The New Orleans rapper was interviewed on ABC’s Nightline on Tuesday night when he said: “I don’t feel connected to a damn thing that ain’t got nothin’ to do with me. If you do, you crazy as shit.”In a statement released less than 24 hours after the interview, Lil Wayne said his response was born out of annoyance at questions the interviewer asked about his daughter, Reginae Carter. “When the reporter began asking me questions about my daughter being labeled a bitch and a hoe, I got agitated,” he told TMZ in a statement. “From there, there was no thought put into her questions and my responses.”He added: “Apologies to anyone who was offended.”In September, Wayne said “there is no such thing as racism” on Fox Sports, a statement he also clarified later, when he explained he made the comment because his life had been saved by a white police officer when he was 12.Fellow rapper A$AP Rocky was criticised in July when an old interview resurfaced where he distanced himself from Black Lives Matter and the protest movement post-Ferguson. He said: “I don’t wanna talk about no fucking Ferguson and shit because I don’t live over there. I live in fucking Soho and Beverly Hills. I can’t relate.”He later apologised for his comments, putting them down to being in mourning over the death of A$AP Yams, his close friend and fellow member of A$AP Mob.
