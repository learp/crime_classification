Sometime in the mid 1990s, probably unnoticed by anyone, a region of the Pacific that is home to more than a dozen nations experienced something known as a “climate expulsion”.That was the point in time when the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere pushed temperatures higher than anything that natural climate changes alone could have delivered.The finding comes in a new study from scientists at Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology and published in the International Journal of Climatology.Scientists examined temperatures between 1953 and 2010 in an area of the Pacific that includes the Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.The study analysed data from weather observations in that west Pacific region and found temperatures have been rising by about 0.15C per decade. To find out what was behind the temperature increases the researchers ran a series of climate models to try and reproduce those real world temperature observations.Dr Scott Power, senior principal research scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology and one of the study’s authors, told the Guardian: “The only way these models can replicate the warming that has been observed is if they incorporate the increases in greenhouse gases. It is clear as day that that part of the world has warmed up.“What’s also interesting from the study is that you can see that after about the mid-1990s, every year has been warmer than it was prior to the early 1970s. We looked at this in the models and they tell similar stories. At a certain point the temperatures in this part of the world have exhibited what we would call ‘climate expulsion’ – the greenhouse gases have forced the temperature variability beyond the earlier historical experience.”The study also used the same climate models to try and get an idea of what will happen to temperatures in the region in the future, depending on how much or how little the world does to limit emissions of greenhouse gases coming mainly from fossil fuel burning. The study found: “The magnitude of projected warming is directly and strongly linked to future global emissions of greenhouse gases, with greater emissions leading to greater warming in the Pacific.”Even under the most ambitious scenarios to cut emissions, the models in the study suggest the region will still experience between 0.5C and 1.7C of extra warming by the end of this century. This is based on where temperatures were in the period between 1961 and 1990.If the world keeps on emitting at similar rates to now, then the bad news obviously gets much worse. The region would be between 2C and 4.5C warmer by the end of this century. What would this mean for those countries? Power said: “With these temperature rises you would expect a greater incidence of heat stress issues among humans, especially the young, the elderly and the sick, and during heat waves a likely increased pressure on hospitals and potentially increasing death tolls.“This would also put stress on plants and animals as well, including agricultural crops and wild plants. You would expect an increased risk of coral bleaching and also a higher risk of fundamental change to reef-based ecosystems.”The health of reef-based systems are especially important to island nations, because those are the places where they catch their key food supply – fish.While these island nations have contributed almost nothing to the problem of rising greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, they will be among the hardest hit.Many of these islanders fear that as the world continues to warm, sea levels will be pushed progressively higher – swamping their ancestral and cultural homes and making their islands unliveable. The study findings will give these island nations another reason – as if they needed one – to push for an ambitious new deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions to be agreed at the United Nations climate talks in Paris in December.Unless greenhouse gas emissions are cut steeply, and soon, then it seems that if the rising seas don’t push these island nations to the brink, then the temperature increases probably will.
