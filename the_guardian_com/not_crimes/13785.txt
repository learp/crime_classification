Colin Farrell is set to join the cast of Sofia Coppola’s remake of 1971 drama The Beguiled.According to Variety, the actor is in talks to star alongside Nicole Kidman, Elle Fanning and Kirsten Dunst in the Lost in Translation director’s take on the civil war-set film that originally starred Clint Eastwood.The plot centres on an injured soldier who takes refuge at an all-girls boarding school, where he becomes the object of sexual desire. The original was directed by Don Siegel, known for Dirty Harry and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and was a commercial misfire but a critical hit.It will be Coppola’s first full-length film since The Bling Ring in 2013. She had been attached to direct a live-action version of The Little Mermaid but dropped out of the project last year due to creative differences. Farrell is coming off some of the best reviews of his career for Yorgos Lanthimos’ dystopian dating satire The Lobster. He is set to reunite with the director for psychological thriller The Killing of a Sacred Deer, which will also star Kidman. Later this year, he’ll be seen in JK Rowling adaptation Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
