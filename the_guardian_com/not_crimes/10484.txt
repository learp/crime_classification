In the 12 years since a Guardian journalist first coined the term in an otherwise unremarkable tech column, podcasting has evolved into a global industry, not to mention a singular art form – one in which the intimacy and abstraction of radio meets the flexibility of the web. Along the way, it’s given rise to a number of orthodoxies, perhaps the most prominent being the one favoured by a handful of US shows including This American Life, the long-standing radio institution whose podcast consistently charts among the world’s most popular.The show and its contemporaries – outfits such as Radiolab (which covers science), Invisibilia (anthropology) and Reply All (tech) – specialise in a kind of folksy, zigzag storytelling that’s effortlessly absorbing and warmly reliable. The cult-like aura that surrounds such shows (and their chummy, identifiable hosts) borders on the fanatical, with figures like This American Life’s Ira Glass inspiring the same kind of feeling in your average podcast listener that Jim Jones did in the members of the Peoples Temple. At their best, though, these podcasts tell their stories with a degree of economy and precision only possible when you dedicate yourself to doing one thing, and doing it well.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Of course, it’s 2016 and everything popular must now horizontally integrate into dynamic new media landscapes, so doing one thing and doing it well is no longer an option. This American Life is currently involved in at least five film adaptations of its stories; Radiolab’s last tour visited 21 cities; and every single podcast mentioned above contributed in one way or another to Cast Party, a group stage show broadcast live from New York to cinemas across the US last summer. This week, it showed up on Netflix.For all its logistical ambition, Cast Party is sadly most successful as a demonstration of what happens when you take a winning formula and add to it: more often that not, you end up taking something away. Here, the propulsive conversational style of Reply All is reduced to the spectacle of two men reading awkwardly from lecterns while a third sits behind a laptop. The inventive use of music common to many US podcasts is reduced to an excruciatingly protracted performance by a brass quartet. And each evidently well-meaning host is reduced to a wannabe comedian, desperately trying to impress at the end-of-year talent show.Worst of all, Cast Party shines a glaring spotlight on the artistic liberties at the heart of these shows – the feigned naivety of the hosts, the micro-managed “spontaneity” of the storytelling. I doubt Radiolab listeners ever really believe the show’s presenters when they gasp in surprise at a story they themselves are telling, but it’s especially hard to suspend your disbelief when you’re watching them read out their reactions from neatly ring-bound scripts.
