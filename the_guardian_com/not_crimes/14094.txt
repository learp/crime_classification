Up until his death in December 2015, Lemmy Kilmister continued to front those thunderous titans of rock’n’roll, Motörhead. “For as long as I can walk the few yards from the back to the front of the stage without a stick,” he told the Guardian in August last year. “Or even if I do have to use a stick.”In November 2015, UDR Records made the decision to record Motörhead’s two sold-out shows at the Zenith in Munich, Germany; footage that would turn out out to be the last documentation of the group performing live. Following Lemmy’s death on 28 December, two days after he was diagnosed with an extremely aggressive cancer, drummer Mikkey Dee confirmed that without their frontman and bassist, the band would no longer continue.Scheduled for a June release, Clean Your Clock – a live DVD, CD, Vinyl and Blu-ray album – captures the bone-rattling impact of the Motörhead live experience and features a career retrospective, including Stay Clean, Metropolis, When the Sky Comes Looking for You, Ace of Spades and Bomber, an exclusive video of which you can watch below.• This article was first launched on 29 April 2016 and temporarily removed because of a rights issue with the video.
