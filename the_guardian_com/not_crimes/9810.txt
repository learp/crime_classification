Dr Dre faces the prospect of a gruelling lawsuit after a California appeals court allowed a former hedge fund manager to go ahead with his case against Beats Electronics over royalties for Beats headphones.Steven Lamar first brought his case two years ago, arguing that he was “the founder of Beats headphones, its design and corporate identity”, and that he had done the preparatory work on setting up Beats and demanding a cut of royalties on future sales of headphones derived from the original design, instead of just the 4% he gets on past models.Beats, Dr Dre and his co-founder Jimmy Iovine had sued Lamar in 2006, accusing him of failing to meet contractual agreements and intending to launch his own Beats range without Dr Dre involved. In the resulting settlement, Iovine and Dr Dre agreed to pay a 4% royalty.In June 2015, Lamar’s claims were rejected by a judge in the Los Angeles superior court. On Monday, California appeals court judge Roger Boren overturned the original ruling, deciding the royalty agreement made between Lamar and Beats co-founders Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine was “ambiguous” enough that it should go before a jury.Dr Dre and Iovine have insisted the royalty agreement was a one-product deal, which did not cover subsequent designs, not least because they did not know if there would be any. Lamar gave evidence that other models had been discussed, and pointed out that the 2006 suit against him discussed a “line of headphones”.“Based on the extrinsic evidence presented and the language of the contract, we find that it is equally, if not more, plausible that the parties contemplated the interpretation for which Lamar advocates,” said Boren in his ruling. “There is no language in the contract limiting the agreement to a single model or product. Instead, the focus of the agreement is on the patented design on which the parties collaborated. Lamar has presented evidence that other headphone models, such as the Solo, were protected by the same patent granted on the headphones design illustrated in Schedule I of the Royalty Agreement. He has also presented evidence that the parties, including Brunner, contemplated that a wireless model based on the headphones design would be covered by the Royalty Agreement. Thus, the agreement is certainly reasonably susceptible to an interpretation that it covers more than just the original, Studio, headphone model.”Last month, Dr Dre and Iovine won another case that had been brought against them. Noel Lee, of the video and audio cable company Monster, claimed Dr Dre and Iovine had arranged a sham deal with another company to terminate their arrangement with him. The central claim was dismissed in a Los Angeles court.Dr Dre and Iovine have faced the lawsuits since Apple bought Beats for $3bn in 2014.
