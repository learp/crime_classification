It may be a musically unlikely pairing, but Mumford & Sons and Little Mix have told their fans to “stand up” to rip-off ticket touts.The rock and pop stars, using the hashtag ToutsOut, have called on music fans to sign a petition so that tougher penalties for touts can be debated in Parliament.They are hoping that public support will give them 100,000 signatures for a debate to be held about tougher sanctions for resale websites and to force ticket resellers to reveal their identities. So far, more than 12,000 people have signed the petition.Mumford & Sons issued a passionate message on their website that links to the petition: “If getting onstage is one of the best things about being a musician, seeing your audience get ripped off is undoubtedly the worst.“At M&S HQ we try hard to ensure that true fans have the best opportunity of getting into shows, at the right price, but are often powerless when faced with organised industrial-scale ticket touting.“At the moment, the law makes it easy for these shady operators to hoover up tickets and profit at your expense – so we are joining with others across the music and creative communities to support a petition that demands politicians tighten up consumer legislation.“If 100,000 of you sign it, then the government will be pressurised to consider the issue for parliamentary debate.”Little Mix tweeted: Little Mix (@LittleMix)Touts get in the way of music fans getting fair tickets 👎 Stop them & sign the petition https://t.co/0Bwnx4eaXa 🚫 #toutsout xx the girls xxMay 8, 2016The petition is headlined Enforce the Consumer Rights Act to protect music, arts and sport fans from touts.It states: “On a commercial scale, touting deprives the Treasury of VAT, and performance copyright holders of royalties that should be paid on the mark-ups. It also denies artistes the ability to ensure their events are priced so anyone can attend.”A Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokesman said: “In the Consumer Rights Act, the government committed to an independent review of online secondary ticketing.“The review has been considering a wide range of stakeholders’ responses to consider how best to represent consumers’ interests. We are expecting the review report in late May 2016.”
