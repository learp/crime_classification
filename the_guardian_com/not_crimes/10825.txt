Moonlight and Arrival emerged triumphant from the Writers Guild of America awards, with the former winning best original screenplay and the latter best adapted screenplay.Why Moonlight should win the best picture Oscar Moonlight, the heartrending tale of a gay man’s coming of age in Miami, is directed by Barry Jenkins and won the original screenplay award for Jenkins; however, because of a difference in eligibility rules it has been nominated for a best adapted screenplay Oscar, as it is based on an unpublished text by award-winning playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney.At the Academy awards Moonlight will be competing against the WGA’s other major film laureate, Arrival, which took best adapted screenplay for Eric Heisserer, whose script was based on Nebula award-winning short story Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang.A WGA award is considered a reliable predictor for Oscar results – but the fact that Moonlight will shift categories is likely to skew its bellwether potential. The films it defeated here – Hell or High Water, La La Land, Loving and Manchester by the Sea – will still consider themselves in with a decent chance.The WGA also gives out a number of TV writing awards, with Atlanta winning best comedy series and best new series, and The People v OJ Simpson: American Crime Story taking best long-form adapted programme.Oliver Stone, who received the Laurel award for screenwriting achievement, took aim at what he called the “military industrial money media security complex” in an anti-war acceptance speech. “In the 13 wars we’ve started over the last 30 years and the $14 trillion we’ve spent, and the hundreds of thousands of lives that have perished from this earth, remember that it wasn’t one leader, but a system, both Republican and Democrat ... It’s a system that has been perpetuated under the guise that these are just wars justifiable in the name of our flag that flies so proudly.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Amy Adams in Arrival, which won best adapted screenplay for Eric Heisserer at the WGA awards.
