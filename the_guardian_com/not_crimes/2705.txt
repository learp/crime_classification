The leader of Norway’s Liberal party, Trine Skei Grande, was seen playing the game during a meeting on national security back in August, at the height of Pokémon Go-mania.

None other than Grande herself.Trine Skei Grande (@Trinesg)@eivindtraedal @erna_solberg hun hørte nok hva jeg sa 😉 vi damer klarer to ting samtidig veit du.October 5, 2016Grande seemed amused by the news, tweeting: “She heard what I said, we ladies can do two things at the same time you know.”According to Norway’s TV2, Solberg said: “I think that Trine will like that I opened the game while she was at the pulpit.”
