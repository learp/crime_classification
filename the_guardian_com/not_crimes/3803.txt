How many paintings are there in the Royal Collection, described in its own blurb as “one of the largest and most important art collections in the world, and one of the last great European royal collections to remain intact”? Lost in Showbiz has to ask after it emerges that the one Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge chose for a particularly conspicuous spot on their drawing room wall was prominently entitled The Negro Page.The belated realisation of this by staff is reported to have seen a potted fern placed strategically in front of its title plate shortly before the room was used to entertain Barack and Michelle Obama last Friday night. Photographs documenting the engagement certainly show the nameplate thus obscured.Inquiries to the Royal Collection reveal that it includes more than 7,500 paintings. For the naturally inquisitive, then, the question must be: what drew the couple to The Negro Page? A work by the 17th-century Dutch landscape painter Aelbert Cuyp, its title is obviously the product of its age, though given the thousands of other options some might have found said moniker faintly jarring for a receiving room. Yet in the course of a report on the figleafing of its title for the Obama visit, the Mail on Sunday’s art critic is reported as having explained that it “would particularly appeal to a history of art graduate such as Kate”.Mmm. I am reminded of a Victoria Wood As Seen On TV sketch, in which the presenter of a household economy show smiles that a lamp made out of a brick would make “a marvellous and inexpensive present for a newlywed … or a blind person”. I can’t help feeling that a painting entitled The Negro Page would particularly appeal to a history of art graduate or a … well, Kate is a history of art graduate, while William himself studied the subject before switching to geography. So no other possibility need detain us.Perhaps it was their interior designer who matched it to the chintz – yet even that hardly means they had to stick with it. A relative once passed on a racist light to me – I believe the formal antiquarian term for such yesterarse furnishings is “blackamoor lamp” – which I left outside a charity shop under the cover of darkness.Indeed, all this has me thinking. The shop in question was actually only a few hundred yards away from Kensington Palace and, in light of new information, I now wonder whether that lamp was snapped up by a local newlywed keen to avail themselves of the last few bits and pieces to complete their new home. After all, it is always stressed that the taxpayer only forked out £4.5m for the interior redecoration of the Cambridges’ flat – the couple themselves bought the fittings.Perhaps, even now, the “blackamoor lamp” is sitting just out of shot in that same drawing room, in pride of place – except, of course, on the enormously rare occasions when a visitor’s ethnicity requires the dear little chap to hide behind some foliage. The lamp’s craftsmanship was really very fine indeed – I expect it would particularly have appealed to a history of art graduate.
