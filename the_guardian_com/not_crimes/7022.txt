1 Alien: Covenant (15)(Ridley Scott, 2017, US/UK/Aus/NZ) 122 minsFinding an Earth-like planet that’s too good to be true is never a good sign in an Alien film, and sure enough, a crew of would-be settlers (including Michael Fassbender and Katherine Waterston) is pitched into an altogether deadlier mission than anticipated – thanks to lax exploration protocols and some familiar local fauna. More exciting and less messy than Prometheus, this feels like a “proper” Alien movie.2 Frantz (12A)(François Ozon, 2016, Fra/Ger) 114 mins   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Watch the trailer for Frantz.The ever-versatile Ozon crafts a stately, suspenseful interwar drama.

Florence Pugh is outstanding as a teenage bride installed in an austere country home, whose patriarchal confines she soon starts rebelling against.5 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 (12A)(James Gunn, 2017, US) 136 mins   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 trailer starring Baby Groot.Fewer surprises, but still plenty of bang for your buck with Marvel’s space odyssey sequel, whose mix of colourful sci-fi spectacle and wacky ensemble comedy still works a treat.
