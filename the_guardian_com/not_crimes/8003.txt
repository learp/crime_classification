Do you remember that TV channel, Trouble? In the late 90s/early 00s, it was a colourful graveyard for American teen and young adult shows of the recent past, repackaged for young British eyes. It brought me TV shows no other channels would have thought to – and is how I came to watch The Parkers, and fall for the comedian and actor Mo’Nique.The Parkers, a sitcom about a mother and daughter attending college together, was a nice break for Mo’Nique, now 48, but it was hardly her first outing in the business. She was doing stand-up before the siren call of TV, and if you haven’t watched her (filthy, hilarious, repeat: filthy) sets, particularly her turn on The Queens Of Comedy, I urge you to. Her jokes can be uncomfortable, but then they come from uncomfortable situations, and I appreciate that edge; her riff on “skinny bitches” will always make me laugh. Her raspy voice is like a shot of something strong and oaky, and her laugh is contagious, even when you’re semi-scandalised at the joke.Why I love... actor Andrew Lincoln She has branched out from straight comedy, too: her stunning portrayal of Ma Rainey in the TV film Bessie shook me up; before that, she won an Oscar for her astounding performance in the 2009 drama Precious. She’s an agile dancer, too (her Instagram is a delight) and her little inspirational quotes about love and life give off the vibe of a woman who is happy with her lot.But comedy’s still her main thing: earlier this year, she released a special, Mo’Nique’s Something Different, and her new family comedy, Almost Christmas, just came out. With that infectious laugh, she’s the best thing in it. Of course.
