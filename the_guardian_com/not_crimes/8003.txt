Wildlife lovers have the chance to spot both the rarest ever British butterfly and the commonest as part of the biggest butterfly count in the world, which starts on Friday. There is only one snag: the extremely unusual scarce tortoiseshell and the far more familiar small tortoiseshell look almost exactly the same.That both have appeared in unusual numbers in recent days is a sign that the summer of 2014 is shaping up to be a golden season for butterflies but scientists will not know how good it is without sightings submitted by the public.The charity Butterfly Conservation hopes that thousands of participants in the Big Butterfly Count will spend 15 minutes in gardens, parks and countryside over to next three weeks to log 1m butterfly sightings – beating last year’s record of 800,000.The closely-related tortoiseshell species have set lepidopterists’ pulses racing in recent weeks. Until a few days ago, there had been just one record of the scarce tortoiseshell in Britain, in 1953, which was probably the release of a captive-bred insect. A rare native of eastern Europe, the scarce tortoiseshell, distinguished by its yellow legs, has never flown to Britain in such number before. After 40 sightings in the Netherlands earlier this month, several have crossed the North Sea and the butterfly has been seen in Norfolk, at Minsmere nature reserve in Suffolk, at Sandwich in Kent, and in Lincolnshire.

This year, the butterfly has bred successfully and is all over garden buddleias in numbers not seen for decades. It is the most recorded butterfly on Butterfly Conservation’s free butterfly app.“The signs are very good this year,” said Richard Fox, surveys manager for Butterfly Conservation. “Many species in Britain did well last year and generally in Britain we’ve had good weather this year so we’ve seen successful and big emergences. As long as the weather plays ball this could be even better than last year.”Another thriving butterfly is the peacock which is also emerging in numbers not seen for several decades this summer.These species are booming because fine weather last autumn enabled large numbers to approach hibernation in a healthy condition. A mild winter saw many more survivors successfully breed this spring and their offspring are now filling parks and gardens.Despite benign conditions, other common species, particularly the large and small white – which topped the Marks & Spencer-supported Big Butterfly Count charts last year with 130,000 and 150,000 sightings respectively – are faring badly this year, probably because of parasitisation.The Big Butterfly Count provides an online identification guide to help people recognise common species but the scarce tortoiseshell could cause confusion because it is very similar to the large tortoiseshell, another rare migrant, as well as the small tortoiseshell. “Anything that people see which is tortoiseshell-like is most likely to be a small tortoiseshell,” said Fox.Separately on Friday, the National Trust said it would be reintroducing the heathland-dwelling silver-studded blue (Plebejus argus), one of the country's rarest butterflies, at Black Down in West Sussex.
