I have found out recently that my wife had an affair that lasted six months (although they only had sex three times) that ended last summer. Her feelings for me had been a bit cold for a few months before that, but I had been trying hard to make our relationship work at that time, through doing all the chores in the house, buying her gifts, always being there to listen, etc. She finished the affair before I found out and is trying hard to make things work, but while I still love her, I am struggling to get over the hurt. I had only wanted to be with her, having saved myself till we got married, and I have always been kind, given her attention and had not got complacent. I am just not sure what more I can do. I can’t help thinking we have got like this because her mum died when she was young and she has always bottled her feelings and sought to blame others for anything that goes wrong. How do I get past this hurt?• When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
