Dream on, Sydney: the luxury houses you can buy in other capitals for $1m “Australians need to be more modest in the space they’re taking up,” says architect Andrew Maynard.“Culturally, Australians have quite an introspective attitude to space – we want a pool, a tennis court, a garage, this, that and the other – but do we really need it? How much space do we really need to live in?”It’s a good question, especially as Australia has been home to the world’s largest houses for the past decade or so.The Australian Bureau of Statistics says the average floor area of new houses built in 2012-13 was 241 sq m. That’s pretty big when compared with other developed countries. The independent research group Shrink That Footprint (which puts Australia’s figure at a more conservative 214 sq m) says Australian homes are more than triple the size of the average new home in China (where the figure sits around 60 sq m), and more than double the size of new builds in Japan (95 sq m), the UK (76 sq m), and Italy (81 sq m).The only country that comes close to a similar footprint for houses is the United States, where new houses are an average 201 sq m. Australians need to see that having a family apartment … is a really good thingAndrew Maynard Given that Australia is the world’s sixth largest country but has one of the lowest population densities (with the population only just topping 24 million), it’s perhaps unsurprising that its houses take up so much space. But a new report from the Urban Development Institute of Australia (Udia) says it’s unlikely that Australians will be able to live in such big houses for much longer.Its 2016 State of the Land Report (pdf) says prices of land and housing are rising in cities. For example, prices in Sydney are rising faster and reaching higher amounts than any other Australian city, with median land prices rising by $100,000 between 2014 and 2015, and median lot sizes decreasing year on year.In fact, lot sizes continued to fall in 2015, with all five major markets recording average lot sizes below 500 sq m.For Maynard, the director of Austin Maynard Architects, the answer to building for space-constrained cities is apartments, such as Melbourne’s Nightingale apartments, which are planned to be “environmentally, socially and financially sustainable”. “There has been amazing apartment living in Barcelona, Rome and New York, for example, and Australians need to see that having a family apartment, sharing community and resources in an apartment is a really good thing,” he says.“Apartments are wonderful places to live if you design them well. But the reality is that so far there haven’t been great quality apartments being designed. We can’t deal with affordability and density in freestanding houses in a meaningful way.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   An artist’s impression of the Nightingale apartments in Melbourne, due to be completed next year.

Building on the success of the first variant (a two-storey home that covers 120 sq m), the new, one-storey version consists of a one-bedroom unit and a studio.The house takes up just 65 sq m, can sleep up to five people, and can be built for $100,000 when attached to an existing house (without adding land content), or $120,000 when freestanding. And that includes furniture.Costs have largely been kept down by limiting the number of rooms built (some beds fold into walls), and therefore the number of installation steps needed, as well as by choosing lightweight materials such as cladding, instead of brickwork.The project director, Kevin Doodney, chief executive of L J Hooker land marketing and founder of the Future Housing Taskforce, says the house is ideal for filling in city space, for housing families, for renting out as a holiday home, and as an affordable aged-care housing solution.“I passionately believe that current aged care is age apartheid,” he says. “We separate people into communities that they don’t necessarily want to go into. If we can create a housing solution off their own block, they can still maintain their own interest without having to leave their relationships and friends. So that’s why we designed it. It also means that they can rent out their existing home and receive rental income.”The design has already been recognised for its role in providing more affordable aged-care housing, having won an Australasian over-50s housing award in 2015, as well as an urban design award from Logan city council.For Doodney, it’s this type of home – a small house that can help bring in income – that will play a big part in making housing more affordable, space-efficient, and sustainable.
