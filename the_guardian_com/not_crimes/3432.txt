I love origin stories. I love to look at a person and trace a line right back to their roots, seeing how they became the person they turned out to be. Superman’s a fictional favourite, but I love the real life kind, too. Remember the one about the 21-year-old black woman who sold a novel in 1997, based on a mere 80-page manuscript, for a reportedly six-figure sum? It’s an origin story that is equal parts simple and fantastic, and I still enjoy the work of that author – Zadie Smith.Her debut, White Teeth, was a rambling multi-generational story of London families that I fell in love with as a teenager: here was a novel that looked like parts of London I knew, telling complex and funny stories. Her third novel, On Beauty, is my favourite, and A Perfect Thing. The character of Kiki, a black woman with depths and fears and a realism rarely portrayed in fiction, moved me intensely.Why I love… Oprah Winfrey Smith, now 40, is a confidently quiet writer – sly and witty and acid sharp – who always draws a world that looks like the real one; it’s a welcome skill set in the often monochrome world of UK publishing. Away from long-form, Smith also writes short stories, interviews and journalism (I urge you to read her warm profile of comedians Key and Peele). But it’s her essays – covering ground from familial loss to comedy, advertising and city living – that I love the best. She’s smart, and she doesn’t hide it.Her last novel, NW, will soon be adapted for television (as White Teeth was, back in 2002), and she has a new one out later this year, Swing Time, about “two brown girls who dream of being dancers”. Zadie’s writing for our future – and I can’t wait to get there.
