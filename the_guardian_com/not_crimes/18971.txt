The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences – the governing body whose duties include voting on the Oscars – now has three-and-a-half years to revolutionise its membership.The year in flops so far and Demolition reviewed – the Dailies film podcast The aim is that by 2020 women and ethnic minorities will make up half its number, as part of a “sweeping series of substantive changes” following criticism over the lack of non-white people among the acting nominees over the past two years. Some measures have already been mooted to fast track new hopefuls by removing voting privileges from current members. Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs’ proposed introduction of a 10-year limit on ballot casting abilities – requiring members to prove active credentials, in order to renew their rights – has met with a mixed reception. The new initiative appears to be an extension of these measures: a form sent on Monday requires members of the public relations and members-at-large branches – whose work falls outside the recognised disciplines of actor, casting director, visual effects, etc – to fill out an “industry involvement form”. This, the membership department explained, was because such professionals “do not typically receive traditional on-screen film credits” and the Academy is eager to ensure “members receive full credit for all of their achievements”.According to the Hollywood Reporter, several members said they had never been asked to prove their credentials since completing their initial application to the Academy. The closing date for relevant members to complete the forms is 6 May. All 18 branches of the Academy will be informed about their voting status in July.
