At 3.50am last Monday, British engineer and cyclist Neil Phillips was second over the finishing line in Çanakkale, Turkey, at the end of the world’s most gruelling bike race, the Transcontinental. He’d set out nine days, 17 hours and 43 minutes earlier from Geraardsbergen, Belgium, riding 3,203km on his supply-laden Genesis Datum bike without any support, choosing his own route, often sleeping by the roadside or being chased by packs of wild dogs. Aside from vast stores of strength, energy, resourcefulness and willpower that were required, one factor that had a supporting role in his journey were the retro-reflective materials featured on the clothing provided by his sponsor, Rapha.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Neil Phillips talks about his experience of riding the Transcontinental Cycle Race“When you are wearing the same kit for almost 10 days straight, riding 20 hours per day, it needs to fit well, but also have the small reflective accents/details that ease the mind during the long pre-dawn/post-dusk hours that you have to race,” says a recovering Phillips via email from Turkey. Unlike hi-vis garments, the retro-reflective material can look like stylish items of clothing during the day At Rapha’s London HQ, Graeme Raeburn, the company’s lead designer, explains to me how advances in retro-reflective materials are enabling gains to be made in cyclists’ visibility. A retro-reflective material is made up of millions of microscopic glass beads held in resin. When a light, such as a car headlamp, is directed at it, instead of diffusing and scattering the light, it reflects the energy directly back at the source, resulting in an intense brightness. The result is that retro-reflective materials appear to light up in the dark, a bit like a cat’s eyes if you shine a torch at them (although this is not recommended). Although retro-reflective materials have been around for a while, in such places as the stripes on builders’ high-visibility bibs, for example, recent advances in their durability, breathability and flexibility have enabled them to be employed in a wider range of garments and increasingly innovative ways.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Reflective and hi-vis elements on Rapha’s cycling wear.“In the past, retro-reflective materials were quite fragile, prone to cracking or peeling after washing and wearing,” says Raeburn. “One area that’s greatly improved is allowing stretch – for instance in overshoes or gloves.” Raeburn shows me some prototypes for Rapha’s collection for next season: overshoes that shimmer under the light; jackets with reflective polka dots and a jumper made with retro-reflective yarn. “All of these products weren’t possible a few years ago,” he says.Unlike hi-vis garments, the retro-reflective material only comes alive when placed in bright light during otherwise dark conditions, so during the day they can look like stylish items of clothing. “These small improvements in stretch, breathability and so on open up design options to us,” says Raeburn. “Safety wear was often non-stylish. Now visibility is there by merit of good design and materials, which is much more appealing. These garments can transition from bike to office. You’re not just designing garments for 40 minutes of commuting.”The high-tech battle for cyclists to stay visible on the roads | Peter Walker Of course the goal is to make cyclists more visible to other road users. “The eye is attuned to picking out the human form, so if you can highlight arms, gloves, the head, the movement of feet and knees with retro-reflective garments, you can build-up the impression of a human silhouette – which is very attention-grabbing,” says Raeburn.And retro-reflective options are available in bike form too: the Mission Bicycle Company from San Francisco produces the Lumen, a retro-reflective bicycle; Fiks of Pittsburgh produce retro-reflective strips for wheel rims; and many firms are producing reflective bike tyres.While retro-reflective and indeed hi-vis will be around for the foreseeable future, other technologies enabling cyclists to stay visible are emerging. Lumo produces a jacket with a strip of 14 LED lights on the front and back. Brompton has prototyped a bike coated with electroluminescent paint – in effect an LED frame-coating that is powered by a small battery or even a dynamo. And Garmin’s Varia Radar system is a set of lights that detects oncoming cars and changing light levels and will react and warn the cyclist accordingly.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Brompton’s concept bike.Radar hints at technologies to come. As autonomous vehicles begin to traverse our roads, your visibility to the human eye may become less important – instead, being visible to a car’s computer brain will be key. Autonomous cars currently use a mix of radar, laser and ultrasonic sensors, and image recognition technology to navigate the streets and traffic, which could have implications for cyclists’ clothing.Professor Peter McOwan, of Queen Mary University of London’s School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, explains: “In the future clothing will be filled with embedded technology. Among other things, these could be used by smart cars and other systems to detect us, when lighting is poor, we’re in shadow or the weather makes visible wavelength computer vision hard.” So visibility may evolve to mean a broader spectrum of qualities. However, we’re a long way from new technologies that would save Neil Phillips from being attacked by dogs.
