The BBC has announced the names of five amateur ensembles who will compete in the inaugural Great Orchestra Challenge to win a place at the Proms – with teachers, doctors, social workers, students, a cheesemaker, a funeral director and a lupin grower among their number.The conductor Paul Daniel will judge the orchestras for the series, to be shown on BBC4, with the final airing on BBC2. He said: “I’ll be looking for the orchestra that goes beyond technical excellence. They’ll have to capture the spirit and excitement of British amateur music, they have to really engage us musically and emotionally and connect with their audience.”The winning ensemble will appear on stage at BBC Proms in the Park, in Hyde Park in London.
