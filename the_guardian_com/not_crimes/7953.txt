The Rolling Stones are set to play Cuba this Easter, the band have confirmed.The Stones will perform in Havana at Ciudad Deportiva, a sports complex built in 1957. The news was announced in the country’s official newspaper Granma, which said the concert would be “a historic moment that will open the doors for other great bands to arrive in Havana”. It will be the first open air concert in the country by a British rock band. In a statement, the group said: “We have performed in many special places during our long career but this show in Havana is going to be a landmark event for us, and, we hope, for all our friends in Cuba too.”Rumours that the band might play have been growing ever since Mick Jagger visited the city in October 2015. He was believed to be scouting out venues, as well as treating himself to a tour of the local nightclubs.The Stones are currently touring Latin America on their Olé tour, which is currently due to end in Mexico City on 17 March. The Cuba dates will now follow that.
