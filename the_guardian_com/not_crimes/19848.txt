People queueing have drawn up a list of names to ensure the trainers are given out on a first-come-first-served basis.One trainer fan, Abdul, said: “I came from London, I’ve been here since Saturday. The weather’s been up and down, so I’ve just had to deal with it.” He added: “We have a rota, so every four hours, we change and someone camps there.”Meanwhile, Danish police are reportedly searching for a group of thieves who robbed a truck as it delivered the coveted trainers. The theft took place on Wednesday during an attempt to deliver shoes to the Rezet store in Copenhagen, with an estimated four containers of Yeezys stolen.
