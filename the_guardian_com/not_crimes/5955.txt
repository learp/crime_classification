8.59pm BST20:59So that’s it for Week 2 – thank you everyone for joining in and being very funny as ever, make sure you come back for Bread Week next week. I’m actually off on my holidays next Wednesday, squeezing in a break during what’s known as the ‘Strictly Gap’. So somebody else will be liveblogging Bake Off for the next three weeks. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, or Instagram if you have any interest whatsoever in pictures of Spanish/French vistas and tipsy selfies. See you on Saturday for the Strictly launch show liveblog (6.50pm BBC1), or back here in a few weeks! Cheers, Hx FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.58pm BST20:58It’s between Candice and Andrew for Star Baker – I want Andrew to win because he’s adorable. Val to go home, surely?Star Baker this week is…CANDICE! And going home is…LOUISE! Oh, really? Should have been Val, surely? Poor Louise, the falling-down church was her downfall.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.56pm BST20:56Candice needs a hand getting her gingerbread pub to the table, so asks Mel to carry her jugs. Poor Sue, missing innuendo treats like this. It looks brilliant, down to the ginger cake carpet. “Who wants to eat some carpet?” Asks Mel. “I’ll eat some carpet”, says Mary. This week’s GBBO is pure filth, and I love it.Updatedat 9.23pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.54pm BST20:54Kate’s looks lovely but her gingerbread doesn’t taste of ginger. Jane’s gingerbread is too soft, and Rav’s tastes a bit burned (hmm). Michael piping is less Santa’s workshop and more Satan’s cottage, but his gingerbread is the best yet. Selasi’s design is excellent, but needed more gingerbread. Louise’s bombed-out church looks terrible, but tastes good.

However Val’s sister Susan tastes lovely, according to Paul *Harry Hill side-eye to camera*. Benjamina’s showstopper was a bit messy, but Tom’s tastes good.Updatedat 9.08pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.50pm BST20:50Andrew’s punting showstopper is rather lovely, and his gingerbread reminds Paul of his mum’s, which is apparently a good thing. Yay for Spreadsheet Andrew.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.49pm BST20:49Louise’s church has now completely collapsed, as has Val’s cityscape. To make matters worse, the bakers have to carry their gingerbread stories to the front of the tent.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.48pm BST20:48So much broken gingerbread going on right now, and I really hope Louise’s church isn’t a metaphor for her future marital happiness. Andrew’s and Selasi’s look pretty good, whilst Val’s New York looks like a scene out of Independence Day.Remind me to never, ever attempt a gingerbread house.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.46pm BST20:46“Fear is the mind killer. You’ve just got to go for it, and trust”, says Tom, who is clearly one of those terrible people who puts motivational quotes on Facebook. “You can practise as much as you like, but one little slip and your structure can just collapse” adds Michael, ominously. You’re making a house of biscuits, Michael, this isn’t open heart surgery. Meanwhile, Candice’s walls have caved in. Updatedat 8.46pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.45pm BST20:45One hour to go! Kate is making caramel to glue her bits of gingerbread together, whilst Michael is making grey royal icing, which should never be a thing. Mel is apparently trying not to put the wind up Val, whilst pursuing her around the tent and reminding her how much she still has to do. Val looks like a meltdown might be incoming.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.44pm BST20:44Paul and Mary are worried about Val. We’re all worried about Val, to be honest.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.44pm BST20:44I love that Selasi is making stained glass church windows out of boiled sweets. Andrew is ticking stuff off a list, and Louise can smell burning. It’s one of Rav’s gingerbread trees, which appear to have been in a forest fire.I feel like we need to know more about the story of Tom and Pod getting lost up a mountain. Is it like Uncle Bryn and Jason’s fishing trip in Gavin & Stacey?Updatedat 9.16pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.43pm BST20:43If I did this challenge, I’d make a shack of baking despair floating on a lake of my own tears, sprinkled with my crumbling self-esteem.

Golly. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.39pm BST20:39Kate is making a gingerbread brownie camp, because she’s entirely wholesome and lovely. Mary is trying to remember the brownie promise, while Val’s gingerbread is already too short for the template she’s made. I fear Val is not long for this tent.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.38pm BST20:38Candice is making the pub she grew up in out of three different types of gingerbread, because she’ll never learn. Meanwhile Michael is making the day he met Santa in Lapland, bless him.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
