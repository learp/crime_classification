Music Venue Trust is a registered charity that acts to protect, secure and improve grassroots music venues in the UK. We have been fighting for nearly three years to stop venue closures (Closure of Fabric raises fears for the future of nightclubs, 8 September). We’ve achieved changes to the law, planning guidance and developments. We’ve fought back on behalf of venues to tackle the real reasons behind why they are closing.On 18 October at The Roundhouse, London, we are going to stage a benefit concert. The event is called Fightback – but as of right now, we don’t have any bands, backline, or crew. We’ve announced a gig with no acts, and we’re going to try to make that event happen in just four weeks’ time. By the music community, the fans and the musicians acting together, we can put a stop to these closures. Your support, whatever you can do, for our event would make a genuine difference to music venues.Mark DavydCEO and founder, Music Venue Trust • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
