Voters have received a newsletter boasting about environment minister Josh Frydenberg’s commitment to green army projects just days after a report the program will be axed in December.On Monday the Australian Financial Review reported the green army would be abolished in the budget update on 19 December, after a decision by the Coalition’s budget razor gang, the expenditure review committee.Senior government figures including Frydenberg, prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce refused to confirm or deny the reports the program was set to be axed.But in Frydenberg’s most recent Kooyong community newsletter the minister said he was focused on delivering election commitments including green army projects along the Yarra River and Koonung Creek. Residents received the summer 2016-17 issue of the newsletter this week.
