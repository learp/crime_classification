They join previously announced headliners Muse, Adele and Coldplay, as well as PJ Harvey and Jeff Lynne’s Electric Light Orchestra.The Texan blues rockers ZZ Top – who sparked rumours of a Worthy Farm appearance in January – have also been confirmed, as have Beck, Foals and Earth Wind & Fire.The lineup is a typically diverse mix of established and newer artists. Disclosure, Ellie Goulding, Skepta, the 1975, Grimes, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Mac DeMarco, Savages, Floating Points, Stormzy, Bring Me the Horizon, Chvrches and Ezra Furman will all play sets alongside festival veterans and musical pioneers such as Art Garfunkel, New Order, Underworld, Ronnie Spector, Cyndi Lauper, Saint Etienne and Carl Cox.The Syrian National Orchestra are also scheduled to perform at the festival in June.
