Far, far away at the western end of the Irish “universe” a battle has commenced between rebels determined to save a small corner of their planet and the all-powerful empire.An Taisce, the National Trust for Ireland, has accused the Irish government of “going to the dark side” by handing over once more a remote island off the coast of Kerry, home to bird species including puffins, peregrine falcons and guillemots, to the Star Wars franchise.Sequences for episode seven – Star Wars: The Force Awakens – were shot on Skellig Michael last year. On Monday the filmmakers will return to the island – around 7 miles off the Iveragh peninsula – to shoot scenes for Episode VIII. The conservation body said it was not ruling out an eleventh-hour legal challenge this weekend, in order to thwart the return of the film crew to the Unesco world heritage site inhabited only by birds.“The return of Star Wars to Sceilg Mhichíl is another win for Ireland and the Irish film industry, which is a growing and dynamic sector of our economy,” said arts minister, Heather Humphreys, in a statement this summer.But An Taisce heritage officer, Ian Lumley, accused the government and tourism industry of exaggerating the role Star Wars could play in bringing more visitors to the remote islands in the Atlantic. “False expectations are being created about this film project,” Lumley said.“Only 180 people per day are allowed onto the island to visit it – weather permitting of course. And these visits are very well controlled and supervised with a dedicated pathway for the tourists while more sensitive areas are closed off to the public. So how can any more tourists be attracted to the Skelligs if there are restrictions on numbers?“As for our environmental concerns, there will be no tightly controlled areas for the film crew of up to 100 people. There will be helicopters flying overhead near the roosting birds on the island and we don’t actually know how many flights have been allowed over Skellig Michael.”Where is Skellig Michael?Lumley said that other film projects have been denied access to the protected island, and claimed there was a lack of transparency about the nature of the Star Wars filming. “In terms of transparency the government has gone over to the dark side.” Down on the Kerry peninsula, however, locals who make a living from tourism take a different view. Gerard Kennedy, owner of the Moorings guesthouse and restaurant, disputed claims by the environmental pressure group that the presence of film crews would cause damage and distress protected wildlife.“I can’t understand what An Taisce are worried about,” he said. “What is all the fuss about? The puffins left Skellig Michael at the end of July, and last summer when the Star Wars crew were here there were no complaints from any locals.“You ask any locals what they think of Star Wars being down here and they will tell you they think it’s great for advertising this part of Kerry all around the world. Our bookings were well up this year and I can tell you many new people who stayed with us said they wanted to go to the Skelligs after reading about Star Wars being filmed down here.”In the neighbouring peninsula of Dingle, the local tourist industry is still benefiting from the publicity surrounding David Lean’s epic 1970 romantic drama, Ryan’s Daughter, which was was shot in the area.According to a survey for Irish tourism body Fáilte Ireland, up to 500,000 tourists who came to Ireland in 2014 said that watching films like Ryan’s Daughter and John Wayne’s The Quiet Man first attracted them to the country.“For many people, a compelling film or memorable movie gives them an emotional ‘pull factor’ and creates a curiosity about Ireland that may not have previously existed,” said Alex Connolly from Failte Ireland. “Obviously, something like Star Wars with its incredibly loyal and committed fan base would raise Ireland’s profile further.”The tourism body is hoping the Star Wars connection to Kerry will replicate what Game of Thrones has done for Northern Ireland’s tourism industry – with fans of the cult series flocking to locations familiar from the television epic.Northern Irish entrepreneur Stephen Gray has even bought a golf course and holiday resort because it is beside the Dark Hedges – a road of tangled, gnarled trees that has become an iconic trail for tourists inspired by the HBO hit.“We’ve even put up a 24/7 camera to stream pictures of the Dark Hedges to Game of Thrones fans all over the world. We bought Grace Hill golf course and the estate in the main because the road has become such a tourist trap,” Gray said.Back down on the Kerry peninsula overlooking the ocean towards Skellig Michael, Kennedy is coy about which of the Star Wars cast have popped in for a meal or a pint while filming.“We are not allowed to talk about who was in here from the film at this stage –but come back to me when the filming is over and I’ll tell you which of them came in for a drink!”
