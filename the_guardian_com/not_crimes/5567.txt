From Alexander Skarsgård’s cameos at fashion week to Mads Mikkelsen’s immaculate style, Nordic chic has been having a moment in men’s style. This is mirrored by the emphasis on clean lines and understated functionality of go-to brands like Filippa K, H&M, Cos and Acne. Andreas Löwenstam, head of menswear at H&M, offers five tips for anyone wanting embrace the quiet minimalism of Scandinavian design.Refresh wardrobe essentials A bomber jacket, a coat and crew neck are the three winter staples for every man. Our challenge is to update them every season with new and interesting qualities, structures, silhouettes and colours to make the product relevant to the current fashion of the season. For the Studio AW16 collection, we have done a subtle stripe bomber in dark reds, a longer-line bomber and dark khaki belted coat. The collection is about classic pieces. Again this season, sportswear is one of the most important menswear trends, so I would mix these pieces with sportswear-inspired fashion. The track suit trousers look great in combination with more formal pieces.

The Swedish have never been first with fashion, but we’re open-minded and willing to try things – be that technology, food, or fashion. I think it is this combination that makes Swedish men look good. The style of something classic but with a twist.

When fashion trends go loud and decorative it’s harder for us, and with sportswear and the strong retro streetwear trends at their peak, all eyes are on the British guys at the moment.

Our focus is on silhouette, cut and details, and quality fabrics like cashmere and merino mixes. Some of the jackets and knitwear pieces are made from recycled wool. You will see a lot of hairy yarns and heavy textures within the collection.

We have interpreted it as monochromatic dressing, a dark urban colour, for a modern uniform with modern essentials in mind.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Monochromatic dressing for AW16.
