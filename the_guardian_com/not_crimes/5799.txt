Standing ovations don’t come along that often in fashion but there was one on Wednesday afternoon in Paris as Dries van Noten celebrated his 100th show.It was much deserved. This was a blockbuster of an event in a huge sports stadium with 750 guests. Supermodels including Alek Wek, Liya Kebede and Nadja Auermann, all of whom have appeared in Van Noten shows in the past, came out of runway retirement to appear again. They mixed with women who had been in the first show, back in 1992, and newer faces from the last show, in September 2016.

The show notes said that the collection was about “celebrating without nostalgia and with little artifice”, so this was a greatest hits of his 25 years in fashion. Vivid prints from the archive – collected in a book on each guest’s seat – dominated. They covered velvet jackets, dresses and skirts, mixed with jeans, flat shoes and the excellent coats that the label is known for.

The Piña Bausch-influenced freeform music – sounds of the street complete with beeping horns and a dog barking, but with stirring strings on the top – felt apt, as did the a cappella version of David Bowie’s Heroes at the end. These are clothes that work for real life, but make it better.“I feel like what we all want now is something very personal and human,” Van Noten told the New York Times, “a real show, in a real room, in front of real people, who experience it together.” How right for a post-truth world.Van Noten’s company remains privately owned, but estimates place its worth at between €30m and €50m (£26m and £43m). Based in Antwerp, it sells to around 500 stores around the world.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A model during the Lanvin show in Paris.

The tailoring was the strongest element, with sharp jackets with peplums and a vinyl trouser suit. Ultra-feminine chiffon dresses were less successful, some resembling bridesmaid frocks. Afterwards, Jarrar played up the romantic heritage of the house, founded in 1889. She said she wanted “to give grace. I also want to give poetry, because I have so much of it I can’t keep it to myself.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Another Lanvin creation in Paris. Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty ImagesLanvin was implicated in a model scandal this week, in which casting director James Scully namechecked the house for only using white models – a controversy that the house, trying to rebuild after the departure of Alber Elbaz in 2015, could do without. In vehemently denying the accusation, a representative for the house described the comments as “a serious allegation and completely untrue.” There were four models of colour on the catwalk here – hardly globally representative, but pretty typical for many Paris brands.It is rumoured that the brand, currently owned by Shaw-Lan Wang, could still be bought by Mayhoola, the Qatari investment group that owns Balmain and Valentino. Lanvin is expected to post £8.08m in losses for 2016.
