I have recently joined the ranks of composer/conductor after a career as an opera singer. I am currently conducting my own opera, The Butt, in Vienna. When I made my career change I received superb training from David Parry. I know I am good at my job because my players and singers are responsive and happy. I also learned a lot from Barry Wordsworth at the Royal Ballet in terms of working with musicians. The truth is that modern conductors need to be human beings, not patriarchs. Many players in an orchestra, and singers, could get up to the podium and do as good a job. The conductor needs to be egalitarian, a nurturer, a poet and a mother, not a dictator. Music is all about creating dynamic relationships between notes and human beings. Some male conductors I have worked with could benefit from adopting this new approach. It is time to bring in parity now. The BBC Proms is an obvious place to start; they have blatantly favoured the “old boys’ network” for far too long. We have a female prime minister again, so there is no cogent excuse to refuse.Susie SelfLondon• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
