The mannequin challenge is the internet’s current fad. It involves a group of people standing very still, like mannequins, while someone films them, sometimes to the tune of Black Beatles by Rae Stremmund. Post-Y2K, it’s not exactly a groundbreaking meme, so it’s been confusing to see the world quite as rapt as it has been by something that is, unequivocally, very tame. Still, there’s something cheering about watching the BBC newsroom “take five” from the Autumn statement to create a tableau vivant with 46 people so we’ll stay open to the concept.

Ever-benevolent, fashion has created the Balenciaga bag Challenge. This challenge sees people climbing into next season’s Balenciaga jumbo bag. Or attempting to. The bag is only knee-high, so this is no small feat. And because it’s not available, this game is still in an embryonic stage – it’s a spring/summer bag and we are still in autumn/winter. It also doubles up neatly as a humblebrag because the bag is only available as a sample – and you have to be relatively small to fit inside. But mark these words: as soon as the bag is available, people will be climbing inside it. Or trying to.
