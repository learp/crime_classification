Through the open window comes the sound of a mistle thrush singing. Its tune is wilder than that of a song thrush and is flung with urgency from the top of an ash tree. Below me in the garden other birds are calling: blue tit, great tit, robin. A pair of wood pigeons court on the drystone wall close to last year's nest. Jackdaws look beady-eyed at a chimney pot. For this frost pocket in the north Pennines it's unusual behaviour for January.In the garden borders, winter aconites sport bright green ruffs under yellow cupped flowers. Daffodil spears pierce the mulch of last year's sycamore leaves. Snowdrops have milk-white buds on the cusp of opening out. Everywhere there is fresh foliage, on geum, brunnera, violet, valerian. Hart's tongue ferns are glossy and lush; semi-evergreen, they are normally streaked with brown and looking ragged by late winter. The first of the lungworts, Pulmonaria "Redstart", has so many flowers that I pick a bunch to put in a jug. If frosts come hard now, many of these plants will be damaged.This mild winter has resulted in some strange juxtapositions. Self-seeded Californian poppies sprinkle the gravel, a blue-green fuzz next to pale yellow primroses. Bells still hang on Cerinthe major while dark red hellebores shine in the thin sun. Garlic spears show in the vegetable garden, yet we can still pick big bunches of pungent coriander. Against the house wall there are even some lingering sweet peas.For the many voles that live in the garden walls it has been an easy time after a long summer and a fruit-filled autumn. They in turn provide food for heron, tawny owl, kestrel and buzzard. Yesterday four buzzards spiralled over the garden, rising high with mewing cries. Now, as I stand looking up, there is one right over my head. Its wide wings show pale with dark splayed tips. Suddenly it folds back its wings and is plummeting in a fearless courtship display before soaring up again. It's a spring-like moment in winter.
