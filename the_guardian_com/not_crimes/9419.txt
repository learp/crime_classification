“Where are the brown people?” asked novelist Nikesh Shukla recently, kicking off a season of soul-searching about the lack of diversity in publishing.“In publishing circles, I’m often the only person of colour in a room and I’m made to feel very aware of that. If we are to tackle this problem, people like me need to feel welcome,” said Shukla. “Everyone keeps saying ‘I am not prejudiced, or racist’, but they won’t say it is my responsibility as well to try and do better.”In a move to track down this missing talent, we have teamed up with publisher 4th Estate to launch a new short story prize.The Guardian and 4th Estate BAME prize will be open to black, Asian and minority ethnic writers aged 18 and over and based in the UK. It will be judged by Shukla, Buzzfeed culture editor Bim Adewunmi, Waterstones head of books Melissa Cox, writer Bernardine Evaristo, 4th Estate editor Anna Kelly and Guardian women’s editor Nosheen Iqbal.Stories can be entered from 29 January at http://www.4thestate.co.uk/B4ME/, with the shortlist announced on 9 May and the winner on 20 June. The winner will receive £1,000 and have their story published on the Guardian books website.Man Booker-longlisted novelist Tash Aw welcomed the prize, saying, “We live in a rapidly changing world, one which produces new stories all the time. But it’s never been harder to break into the publishing world, and we risk losing the diversity and complexity of those voices. This prize is a small but hugely valuable step in in supporting writers from minority backgrounds, and helping them gain the visibility that their work deserves.”Candice Carty-Williams, from 4th Estate, added: “It’s increasingly important that we run initiatives like this, both for prospective authors, and for the industry. We are constantly looking to broaden the scope of voices that we publish, and within the team there is a great deal of excitement for this new prize.”
