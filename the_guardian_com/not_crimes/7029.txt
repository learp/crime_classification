I have been seeing someone for the past 12 months whom I love very much. Parts of our relationship are incredible: we make each other laugh, have similar views on important issues, but we also challenge each other in a good way. He got divorced 10 years ago, and has a 16-year-old son. I have never met the son, nor any of my partner’s friends.He is speaking to a counsellor as he is getting over his feeling of guilt for having an affair and walking out of a loveless marriage. His relationship with his ex is good and his son very strong; he sees him at least twice a week. The issue is that I don’t feel validated, I have asked about meeting his son, and some of his friends/family, and he says I will in time. I feel as if I am having an affair, but the other person is his son. I am not jealous, I just want to be in his life properly. I also recently discovered texts from another woman on his phone. He says she’s an old ex, but she has texted twice since. He denies anything has happened, but I don’t trust that he is telling the truth. We have a 10-year age gap. I don’t know whether things will change and if I should give it more time.• When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
