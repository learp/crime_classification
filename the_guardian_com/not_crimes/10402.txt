“Dated” and “unfashionably sedate”: some of the judgments on JB Priestley’s writing style in the postwar period were harsh. The author and playwright once celebrated for his bold storytelling was instead largely dismissed as the voice of a bygone era.But now the work of England’s famous “grumbling patriot”, Joseph Boynton Priestley, who died in 1984 at the age of 90, is enjoying a remarkable renaissance. Throughout 2016 his plays and short stories have been revisited and his son, Tom Priestley, has revealed that the trend is to continue in the new year.As the literary executor in charge of his father’s estate, Priestley Jr is receiving more inquiries than ever from producers, including a new plan to bring the play Dangerous Corner to a new audience.“For me, of course, he has never been away,” he said. “But this has been a particularly good year. We had a very good touring production of his 1930s comedy When We Are Married, which finished this month, and a new production of a little known work, Benighted, which was one of the few times he wrote about his wartime experiences. That has really intrigued people.”The new version of Benighted, originally a novel and freshly adapted for the stage by Duncan Gates, had its world premiere at London’s Old Red Lion Theatre this month. It tells of a young couple who are forced to abandon their car on a stormy night and take shelter in a forbidding mansion. A 1932 film version of the story, The Old Dark House, starred Boris Karloff.Also back in London is the award-winning Stephen Daldry production of one of Priestley’s best known plays, An Inspector Calls. A melodrama of social conscience, it has just extended its West End run for seven weeks, despite already being the longest-running revival in theatrical history. Among the other revivals this year was a production of an early play, The Roundabout.“There is a small selection of his plays which are more often done, including When We Are Married and Time and the Conways, but this one I had never even heard of myself,” said the playwright’s son, who is 84 and lives in Notting Hill, London.“It was a great surprise that someone wanted to put it on. There was a time going back several decades that he was no longer flavour of the month, but now when his plays are put on people say to me that it is extraordinary how topical he seems.”Tom Priestley believes the key to the enduring adaptability of his father’s output is that it was so widely varied. Since Benighted was staged this month, he revealed, he has discovered a letter in the archive that the playwright wrote to a friend.“I think it shows how he always wanted to be doing something new,” he said. The letter reads: “I hope Benighted interested you, but it was not really my style. I should do more in the comic line, rather than the tragic line.”Priestley Jr said: “My father always liked to try his hand at a different kind of work. He didn’t reach a plateau and then just try to stay there, as others did. As he once said of his writing, he had to entertain himself, as well as the reader.”JB Priestley and the return of elegant grumbling The publication of a collection of Priestley essays, Grumblings at Large, this year provoked news headlines because his son was said to have vetoed the inclusion of an essay that opposed Britain’s place in the common market. His son says the essay was not worth reviving because it was written before the referendum of 1975, which rendered redundant its main objection that the British people were not being asked what they wanted in relation to Europe. Priestley, always an advocate of the “common sense of the common man”, was born in Bradford in 1894, the son of a schoolmaster. He worked as a junior clerk in a wool office before serving in the infantry during the first world war. He went on to study at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, then moved to London in 1922, establishing himself as a journalist and critic. He was celebrated for his early novel The Good Companions, the story of the friendships that develop among a band of concert party performers between the wars.“It is wonderful for all his family to find this new interest,” said Priestley Jr, adding that he still turns down approaches from producers if he thinks their proposed projects are “inappropriate”. “There was a plan once to do An Inspector Calls with a woman as the inspector, which I know is a very fashionable idea at the moment. But it was written as a man. And there was an earlier version of Benighted with a silly camped-up idea, that I said was not right. I also did not like an idea for a musical based on Lost Empires, but I suppose I just don’t really like musicals.”Among several meetings with publishers and producers in his diary for 2012 is a discussion about Dangerous Corner, Priestley’s first play, written in 1932. Like An Inspector Calls, it centres on the hidden secrets of middle-class life and how a chance remark can result in a series of dark revelations.Once Priestley’s son has approved a new production he frequently offers to show the cast a version a film of an interview he conducted with his own father for a television documentary which interspersed it with family footage.“I really believe it gives them an idea of who he once was. Not just some voice from the distant past,” he said.Priestley: key works by a ‘reactionary radical’Benighted: An early novel treading the creaky floorboards of the horror genre’s “dark old house” stories to highlight the horrors of war.
