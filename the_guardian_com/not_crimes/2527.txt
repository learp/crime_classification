The Press Association reports:It came as a huge clear-up got under way in York as falling river levels and repairs to industrial water pumps saw many flooded streets drained of filthy water.Acting Superintendent Mark Grange said: “It is extremely disappointing to see victims of the floods being targeted in this way.“It is impossible to comprehend why anyone would want to bring further suffering to those who are already in a very vulnerable situation.”The homes were targeted in the early hours of December 28 in Huntington Road, which was submerged by the River Foss at the time. One home was burgled after the back door was forced, while at a second tools were taken from a shed.

Photograph: Environmental agency handoutThe Conservative MP for the local constituency of Selby and Ansty, Nigel Adams, has said he was visiting the scene earlier. He said: “It was a few hours before it collapsed. We did go on to have a look at some of the damage. In hindsight, we shouldn’t have been on it. “But I thought it was important that I showed the secretary of state the severity of the damage and the impact.”“We are where we are now. We need to try and ensure that it’s repaired as soon as practically possible and that every possible resource be available to the highways, to the county council to make that happens.”Updatedat 8.02pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.51pm GMT19:51Government releases extra £50m in fundingAn extra £50m in official funding has been released, which the government says will be available immediately to local authorities to help them support households and businesses affected by floods.The funding extends the total level of of support pledged by the government for the winter floods to more than £100m, according to the Department for Communities and Local Government.Communities secretary Greg Clark also said that the Bellwin scheme, which was activated following storm Desmond, would be extended to those councils impacted by storm Eva over Christmas. It means that local authorities will be able to apply to have 100% of their costs above threshold reimbursed through the scheme.“No-one could fail to be moved by the scenes of devastation left in the wake of storm Eva – we’re determined to ensure all those affected get the support they need quickly,” said Clark.Clark’s department said that the money would, for example, help with temporary accommodation costs while authorities worked to get people back into their homes.They added that it would support people as they protected their homes against future floods by providing grants of up to £5,000, so they can install new flood barriers, replace doors and windows with water resistant alternatives or move electricity sockets up to a safer level.Updatedat 9.54pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.43pm GMT19:43The emergency services are still hard at it elsewhere.

Significant flooding is expected in the Tadcaster area. Those in this area are advised to evacuate immediately. The situation is serious and there is a significant risk to life. Please follow the advice of the emergency services and officials in the area.Pictures have begun circulating on Twitter showing the massive emergency services response to the collapse.

He says that, with the debris from the collapse now adding to the blockages in the river Wharfe, he now fears that much of the clean-up work by his team, locals and emergency services could be undone by fresh flooding. Wiseman, who is incidentally a Tadcaster local, told Sky News:  The bridge collapse, I think, is due to the sheer weight of water which is pressing against that bridge for so many days, and also the cumulative effect of just tree upon tree, all that debris flowing down that river and just smashing into that bridge over the past few days. The effect of that closure, that could be closed now for months on end, and it’s just going to get the down in halfHe praised the work of the community and emergency services in cleaning up the town after severe floods just 36 hours earlier, but added:  What we are worried about now is that debris that’s fallen under the bridge will create an obstacle for more debris that will be flooding down on the heavy rains top come. It would just be a travesty if there is more floods to come as a result of that debris and flood the hard work that we have done over the past few days.

A group of Syrian refugees from Manchester had even pitched up ready to help, and were put to work shovelling sand into sandbags, in the car park of the Conservative club in Littleborough.“We saw the pictures on TV and wanted to help,” said Yasser al-Jassem, 35, a teacher who came to Britain in the back of a lorry from Calais in May. “The people of Greater Manchester have been very good to us and so we wanted to offer our help to them.”But many of the 180 households who were flooded out in Littleborough, a few miles north of Rochdale town centre, when the river Roach burst its banks on Saturday, didn’t see the point in protecting their homes. They turned their noses up at the sandbags. “There’s nowt left to protect,” said Sean Whitham, whose terrace on Todmorden Road was one of the worst affected.
