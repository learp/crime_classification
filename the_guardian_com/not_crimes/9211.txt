Tom Waits has failed to halt a hit Paris show he accuses of using his songs without permission, court sources have said.The US songwriter, famous for his croaky “cigarettes and bourbon-soaked” voice and his ballads from the underbelly of life, wanted the acclaimed equestrian show On Achève Bien les Anges (roughly translated as They Shoot Angels, Don’t They?) pulled.He is also demanding half a million euros ($562,000) in damages.Flamenco on the hoof: Bartabas the Furious and his dancing horses The show, a mix of dance, circus and theatre using horses and actors, was a huge critical success last year for the world-famous Zingaro troupe.Its theme of death and laughing in the face of horror came in the wake of the first Paris terror attacks. It is set to begin a new run later this month at Zingaro’s specially built theatre in north-east Paris.Waits, 66, said Zingaro had used 15 of his recordings without asking him and had also been inspired by the downbeat “universe” of his ballads.“I had the feeling someone had emptied my pockets while I had my head turned,” he told the French edition of Vanity Fair magazine last month.

The court ordered Waits and his wife to pay Bartabas and Zingaro €2,500 each in costs, a court source told AFP.The ruling does not affect a separate case the singer is bringing against the theatre for using his work without his permission.
