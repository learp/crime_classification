Dorothy Constable Marie Louise, aka Dot or Dotty (as she prefers), is a normal girl who moves house and has to move schools. Dotty is very nervous because she doesn’t know anyone and she thinks she will have no friends, but Dot is lucky, she makes lots of friends. Although not everyone wants to be friends with her – Laura and her friends seem to be forming a mean plan to win the school talent show.Dot and her new friends and McClusky (Dot’s pet dog or best friend) are starting a detective club all of their own called “Join the Dots” detectives. In the club they want to save the talent show from mean Laura and her nasty friends. Amy, a friend of Dotty who is very shy, is in the talent show, singing.Will Dot, McClusky and Dots friends be able to help Amy overcome her nervous shyness and will they be able to solve the mystery surrounding the talent show and the constant whirring noise they can hear. Is there even a mystery or is it just a big misunderstanding?I like this book because it is funny and it is written by one of my favourite authors, Clara Vulliamy. This book is set as a diary and I would recommend this book for bookworms aged 7-11 who love funny mystery stories. I would like to read the rest of the series which has not yet been published. I look forward to reading the series when it is published.Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop
