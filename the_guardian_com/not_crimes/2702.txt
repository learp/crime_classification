Red Hot Chili Peppers will demonstrate their political allegiance to Bernie Sanders, who is seeking nomination as the Democrats’ presidential candidate, by headlining a concert fundraiser in Los Angeles next month. Their performance at the Theatre at Ace Hotel on 5 February follows months of public support for Sanders from the group. In September 2015, they signed a letter of endorsement posted on the senator’s website, while bassist Flea has publicly declared Sanders as the only feasible option for the next president. Recent months have seen many figures from the world of music endorse the Vermont senator, with Killer Mike and Henry Rollins speaking publicly in support of his campaign. Mike, one half of Run the Jewels, who has previously grilled the politician about issues such as gun control, drugs and free health care, will also perform at Students for Bernie – an additional free music event on 30 January at University of Iowa Field House.At this event, Mike will be joined by Foster the People, Josh Hutcherson and members of Vampire Weekend – Ezra Koenig and Chris Tomson – Dirty Projectors’ Dave Longstreth, comedians the Lucas Bros and the University of Iowa Hawkapellas. Koenig has said he is happy for Sanders to bill the ensemble’s appearance as Vampire Weekend.Sanders, described as a “democratic socialist”, has shunned donations from corporations and funded his campaign with grassroots donoations.“After spending five hours with someone who has spent the last 50 years radically fighting for your rights and mine,” Killer Mike said of his time spent with Sanders, “I can tell you that I am very proud tonight to announce the next president of the United States, Senator Bernie Sanders.”On the online list of Artists and Cultural Leaders for Bernie Sanders, names include David Crosby, Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, Graham Nash, Loudon Wainwright III, Zoë Kravitz, Doors drummer John Densmore and Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore.
