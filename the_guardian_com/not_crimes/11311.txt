British Gas is to start offering customers low-cost loans to allow them to "green" their homes.As the government continues to deliberate on the details of its own Green Deal, the Centrica-owned company is giving customers the chance to invest in energy-saving measures – such as a new boiler or insulation – in the knowledge that the loan's repayments will be offset by the resulting lower bills.Earlier this month, British Gas was criticised for announcing a price hike of 18% for gas customers and 16% for households buying its electricity. It has responded in part with its Home Energy Plan designed to lower bills.It's only open to those buying gas and electricity from the company and paying by direct debit. British Gas sends an energy expert to the home to recommend energy-saving measures. Cavity wall and loft insulation, hot water tank jackets, thermostatic radiator valves and programmable thermostats are all likely to feature. The customer is then given a projected amount they will save if they install the measures.Under the terms of the deal, customers take out a Barclays Finance loan to cover the cost of the measures – at an annual interest rate of 6.9%. The money is repaid over an agreed five, 10 or 15-year period, and the repayments should be less than the savings made.The company is offering customers the chance to buy solar PV systems but in that case requires such a big deposit that you might as well borrow the money elsewhere.Jon Kimber, managing director of British Gas New Energy, says: "We know that household budgets are stretched at the moment, but rising energy prices don't have to mean higher bills. Britain's housing stock is some of the most inefficient in the developed world with £1 in every £4 spent on heating our homes wasted because of poor insulation. Under our offer, customers can improve their homes and save money by cutting bills – all at no upfront cost."Earlier this year, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) said that customers who adopted a range of simple measures saved on average £322 each year, and saw a 44% fall in their gas use.For more information go to britishgas.co.uk/greendeal
