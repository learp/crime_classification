Rebecca Thornton’s story of the tensions surrounding her marrying a Jewish man (Family, 20 August) is one most Progressive rabbis have heard many times. However, it is not the only side to Judaism. Progressive Judaism does not just believe that so-called marrying out has to be dealt with as a modern reality, but rather embraces the opportunity to show what an inclusive and welcoming community we can be.Some of the most fulfilling moments in my career have been officiating at mixed-faith blessings to celebrate weddings of couples like Rebecca and Oliver and then to bless their children. It is sad to read such a story, which does alienate people from the beauty of Judaism. Lifecycle moments are when people often need religion the most, and they are when we should open our doors and not turn people away.Should this couple have found one of our communities, they would have found themselves with a rabbi who would have helped them create a joyful, inclusive ceremony.Rabbi Charley BaginskyCoordinator of the Alliance for Progressive Judaism• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
