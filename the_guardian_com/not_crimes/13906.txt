Black and his fellow film-makers had been asked for their thoughts on Trump’s rise to the presidency and Black responded with an extended digression on Trump’s “obsession” with winning.He said: “We’ve got to start thinking globally. We’re going to be working together … if the human race, if this species is going to survive. Yeah, America first is fine, in terms of finances, but we’ve got to stop thinking that way. It’s not a Monopoly game where the rich billionaire wins the game. It’s about the world working together, and it’s got to happen soon.”Fellow Polka King cast member Willie Garson then added: “This whole concept of winning, what do you mean winning? At the expense of what? Winning, implied, is someone losing … this is insanity.” Black continued: “Who else has been talking about winning obsessively lately? Oh yeah. Charlie Sheen. When he was on crack.”“Where are we where the president and Charlie Sheen are on the same exact page?”The Sundance film festival runs until 29 January.
