Sure, you think you know Stewart Lee, embittered standup who spends minutes, maybe even hours, telling one brilliant, complex gag (and if you didn’t, his TV show Stewart Lee’s Comedy Vehicle is back on BBc2 from 10pm on Thursdays). But did you know he got into comedy thanks to a punk gig?In this special episode of the Guardian Radio Hour on NTS – the show where a special guest joins presenter Kate Hutchinson to lift the lid on a musical passion or theme – Lee collected together his favourite funny punks, from Earl Okin and Ted Chippington to Swinging Cats and Alexei’s Midnight Runners. He discussed his early influences and rock’n’roll renegades, telling us what’s so great about the bands that he’s booked for his takeover of the ATP festival at Prestatyn in April.Listen to the show above or subscribe to our Music Weekly podcast, where you’ll get an abridged version of the show next week.
