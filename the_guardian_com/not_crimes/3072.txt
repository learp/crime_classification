Downing Street is to hold a floods clear-up summit with insurance industry leaders on Tuesday amid signs that thousands of wealthy victims of rising waters in the Thames Valley and West Country are likely to face a £1,000 increase in their annual insurance premiums next year.The figures come from ministers' cost assessment of the likely rise in premiums for homeowners paying the highest level of council tax in high-risk flood areas, all of whom will be excluded from the government's new flood insurance scheme.The cost impact assessment suggests council band H will see increases in insurance costs – from £1,460 allowed under the current industry agreement to £2,490 under the new one. This figure takes no account of any decision by the industry to raise premiums as a result of a new assessment of the flood risk, or the recent government cuts to flood defences.Ministers will want Tuesday's meeting to focus on the speed with which insurers are responding to potential claims, but a growing number of voices in the industry are concerned that the government's Flood Re scheme is excluding too many interests including small businesses, properties built after 2009 and wealthier homeowners.Flood Re, a means of providing insurance subsidies to homes in high-risk flood areas, is due to be in force from next summer following negotiations between the industry and government.An Association of British Insurers (ABI) spokesman said: "An estimated 350,000 properties at risk of flooding will be covered, compared with the fewer than 7,000 who will not be covered by Flood Re because of being council tax band H or built since 2009."Ed Miliband will also meet the insurance industry on Tuesday and argue households affected should be getting their first payments from insurance companies within a month.The Labour leader will also propose the government and insurers agree a new industry standard that significantly reduces the maximum time that people have to wait for their claims to be completed and return home. Labour suggests at present this process can take longer than a year.The Cabinet Office minister, Oliver Letwin, who negotiated Flood Re with insurers, is due to attend Tuesday's meeting along with the floods minister, Dan Rogerson. Letwin is also being lobbied to allow small businesses into the Flood Re scheme, but the industry is fiercely opposed. Ministers announced an extra £10m on Monday to help with small business flooding costs.Companies representing 60% of the insurance market are due to report to Letwin on what they have done to hire extra loss adjusters, or help customers access drying equipment.The meeting comes as a new Comres ITV poll shows David Cameron is losing the battle to impress the public about his handling of the floods. Nearly two-thirds of Britons (63%) think the government is emerging from the current extreme weather situation with a worse reputation for crisis management.Nearly three quarters of Brits (72%) now think the government does not appear to be in control of the flooding situation in Britain, while only a fifth (20%) agree that it is doing enough to help those affected by the flooding and storms. The number of those who disagree that the government and environmental agencies have responded well to the crisis has increased dramatically from 39% when the floods first hit in the new year to 62%.The findings will be frustrating for Cameron who has been chairing almost daily meetings of the emergency committee Cobra as well as visiting almost all the worst affected flood areas, including a visit on Monday to Gloucestershire.The insurance industry says it has handed out £14m of emergency payments to households and businesses made since 23 December, with the payments typically between £500 and £3,000 for households. The ABI also said £24m had been spent on emergency accommodation, adding that insurers are geared up to help in every way they can.There has also been over 5,000 loss adjuster visits since 23 December 2013 and over 2,000 loss adjusters ready and waiting for when the waters go down.In England the Environment Agency estimate there are around 2.4m properties are at risk of flooding from rivers or the sea. There are also an estimated 3.8m properties susceptible to surface water flooding, with around 1m of these also at risk of flooding from rivers or the sea.Of the 2.4m at risk from rivers and the sea, around 1.85m are residential properties. Overall, one in six properties in England are thought to be at some level of flood risk.
