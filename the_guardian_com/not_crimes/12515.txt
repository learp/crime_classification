SSE has rekindled the simmering row over high energy bills by revealing it boosted its retail profits by 40% despite falling demand for power and the company losing half a million customers.Britain’s second biggest energy supplier also raised new fears about future blackouts by saying it planned to close down one of its two remaining coal-fired power stations by March next year.SSE, which became the first of the big six firms to raise its gas and electricity prices at the end of 2013 when it put them up by 8.2%, said the increase in retail operating profits to £456.8m brought profitability only back to where it was in 2012.Alistair Phillips-Davies, SSE chief executive, insisted it had been a challenging year but one in which customers had gained.“In a very competitive market we’ve cut prices twice in 13 months and extended our price guarantee, which will mean SSE customers will have seen no increases for at least two and a half years,” he said.Consumer groups were quick to criticise, noting that the Conservative election win had removed the threat from Labour to the energy companies to freeze domestic prices until 2017.Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, said: “The news that profits have soared will not go down well with many SSE customers, especially given higher winter bills following the cold winter.“With the threat of a Labour price freeze now off the table, the big six have officially run out of excuses for not making proper, double-digit reductions to customers’ bills, following significant reductions in the cost of wholesale energy.”Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “SSE is making more money from fewer customers. Consumers will rightly question why their bills are so high when the supplier’s profits are increasing. “All energy companies need to make sure their customers are benefiting from a cut in wholesale prices. Cuts made to bills earlier this year were welcome but not enough. Research from Citizens Advice reveals households have lost an estimated £47m as many cuts were brought in at the end of winter.”SSE has cut its gas prices by 4.1% from last month and promised to hold them until July 2016, but government figures show the wholesale price of gas has fallen by almost 17% over the past 12 months.After more than 500,000 customers left, the supplier had 8.5m accounts, the same number as in 2008, having peaked at 9.65 million in March 2011. SSE’s adjusted pre-tax profits were flat at £1.5bn for the year to March 2015, but the company has announced plans to raise the dividend by 2% to 88.4p per share.It said it would try to redeploy the 172 employees whose jobs are at risk with the closure of the 1,000 megawatt Ferrybridge coal-fired power station in West Yorkshire, which recently missed out on subsidies under the capacity mechanism to ensure security of supply.The company also plans to sell off £500m of onshore wind farms but expects to re-open a 720 MW gas-fired power station at Keadby in North LincolnshireSSE’s chairman, Lord Smith of Kelvin, who will step down in July, said: “Market conditions for thermal power stations have been persistently difficult, requiring us to take the difficult decision we have announced this morning to end coal-fired generation at Ferrybridge power station by next March. The new price control in distribution is driving significant change and energy supply has once again proved to be a highly competitive business.”Matt Osborne, analyst at energy consultant Inenco, said the move would inevitably raise new concerns about Britain’s fragile balance of supply and demand.“While the closure in March 2016 will not impact security of supply this winter, this is another reminder that we need to secure further investment in new power generation to guarantee the security of our energy supply over the coming years as old plant comes offline.”The GMB union described the closure as devastating. A spokesman said: “As things stand, the only thing consumers will get from some of these suppliers are higher bills.”
