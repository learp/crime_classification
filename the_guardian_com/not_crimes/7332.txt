Following in the footsteps of Wordsworth and Coleridge and encompassing everything from dirty limericks to love sonnets, thousands of visitors to Exmoor have added their poetic contributions to tin boxes, left out for the last three years to entice passersby.Conceived by the poet Chris Jelley and supported by the Lynmouth Pavilion Project, the venture has been running for the last three summers. It has amassed more than 6,000 poems written by people lured by the boxes’ message: “Draw, read or write inside,/ And leave for the next to scribe and confide.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A poem found in one of the poetry boxes in Exmoor.

He is now going through more than 6,000 contributions, sifting out the best, to be photographed and published in book form by Fly Catcher Press in October. The originals will be displayed at Lynmouth Pavilion.“We weren’t expecting that amount of response from strangers,” Jelley said. “But whenever I’d go to check the tins, I’d find people reading the poems in them, too, not just writing … We have a perception that everyone has got to have a gadget in their hand, but we are a nation of book lovers; we love the simplicity of a book and a pencil, and when we are totally unobserved, we are happy to write something.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   An illustration of the Tarr Steps found in one of the poetry boxes, by Dave Wilson.

At the beginning they have no idea where they’re going … The poems I find the most moving are the ones people have written about walking in the location, but without their partners, because their partners are too ill, or because they’ve passed away,” said Jelley, who describes the project as a “love letter to Exmoor”.
