Pablo Escobar’s brother has asked Netflix to allow him to review the second season of the drug war drama Narcos, before its release in September.The critically acclaimed series depicts the rise and fall of the late drug lord (played by Wagner Moura), as well as the efforts made by law enforcement officials to take him down. It was nominated for two Golden Globes, including best drama series. Netflix was initially supposed to debut the second season of Narcos in August but it has since been pushed back to September.Narcos is a hit for Netflix but iffy accents grate on Colombian ears On Tuesday, Pablo’s brother, Roberto, submitted what he called a “formal, friendly request” to view the second season, “solely on an informational basis”, per a statement released by Escobar Inc, a private holding company founded by Roberto, Olof K Gustafsson and Daniel D Reitberg.“It is depicting me, my life, my family and my brother,” the statement read. “I think nobody else in the world is alive to determine the validity of the materials, but me.”In 2015, the year Narcos premiered on Netflix, Roberto, through Escobar Inc, registered successor-in-interest rights to Pablo and the Escobar family name in California.According to Deadline, Escobar Inc CEO Gustafsson said the company tried to contact Netflix before the series debuted for the same reason Roberto submitted his most recent request – but did not receive a response. Gustafsson feels similarly about the upcoming season. “I think it is important that they recognize Roberto Escobar’s wishes to review the show they are putting out, ensuring the family and viewers of an accurate portrayal of Pablo and Roberto,” he said in the statement.Roberto, whose eye sight and hearing are impaired from a letter bomb going off close to his face, worked as the chief accountant of Pablo’s cartel and served 10 years in a maximum-security prison in Colombia. He detailed his experience with the group in his biography, The Accountant’s Story: Inside the Violent World of the Medellin Cartel, in which he claims the US and Colombian governments exaggerated Pablo’s involvement in the Medellin drug cartel. The book was released in 2009.• This article was amended on 7 July 2016. An earlier version misspelled Colombia as Columbia on one occasion.
