It would also be his penultimate collection; he killed himself in February 2010.Jack O’Connell: ‘My world just got much bigger’ “In 2009, Alexander McQueen put on one of his greatest shows,” distributors Pathe said, “an extravagantly beautiful retrospective of his designs. It was a show that he dedicated to his mother and one in which he tried to make sense of his life and art.”“The film explores McQueen’s creative process in the six months leading up to the show, the laughter that came easily with his family and friends, and the pressure that came with the relentless demands of the fashion industry. The film is a celebration of a visionary genius whose designs transcended fashion to become art.”The biopic is expected to begin shooting in spring.
