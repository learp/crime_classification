Despite the revival hype, most of grime’s old guard never actually went anywhere. Kano is one such artist who has been plugging away (albeit punctuated by a high-profile acting stint on Channel 4’s brilliant Top Boy) just above street level since his mid-00s heyday. He’s found the spotlight again now, though, collaborating with Little Simz, JME and Giggs in recent months, and will embark on a string of dates to coincide with upcoming fifth album Made In The Manor (16-26 Mar, tour starts Concorde 2, Brighton) …Meanwhile, fellow grime stalwart Big Narstie plays London next month (O2 Academy2 Islington, N1, 24 Feb) …Antony Hegarty is soon to release a new album under new moniker ANOHNI, entitled Hopelessness. A collaboration with Oneohtrix Point Never and Hudson Mohawke, it has some accompanying Barbican dates, during which ANOHNI will be “performing embodied within a live avatar”, whatever that means (7 & 8 Jul, EC1) …Finally, anti-socialite, new pop hope and general breath of fresh air Alessia Cara briefly tours the UK (23-25 Mar, tour starts Electric Brixton, SW2).
