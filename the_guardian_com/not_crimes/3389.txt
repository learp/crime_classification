Members of pop group Duran Duran are to renew their legal battle over US rights to some of their most famous songs, including Hungry Like the Wolf and Girls on Film.In December, they failed to fight off a bid by publishers Gloucester Place Music, ultimately owned by US business Sony/ATV, to prevent them terminating copyright agreements related to their first three albums.Mr Justice Arnold in the high court ruled that English laws of contract barred them from seeking to reclaim rights over their own works.On Friday, the same judge gave permission for an appeal against his decision. No date has yet been set for the hearing.The group said they were particularly pleased to get the go-ahead as the ruling had an impact on the wider creative community and particularly their songwriting peers around the world.Founding member and keyboardist Nick Rhodes said: “It was enormously disappointing that Sony/ATV decided to mount this aggressive and unexpected action against us to try to prevent the simple principles and rights afforded to all artists in America regarding their copyrights after 35 years.“We are relieved and grateful that we have been given the opportunity to appeal this case because the consequences are wide-reaching and profound for us and all other artists.“In his judgment Mr Justice Arnold stated that his decision was not made without hesitation; we were heartened by this sentiment because we felt it was an acknowledgement that something was truly flawed about the premise and reality of what is at stake.“We remain hopeful that the ultimate outcome will be fair and measured to take into account and support our case and all artists’ rights.”
