Ryan Reynolds has returned as foul-mouthed superhero Deadpool in a tongue-in-cheek short film teasing the sequel to the self-aware comic book movie.Entitled No Good Deed, the short, which Reynolds launched online this weekend on YouTube, is currently showing in cinemas ahead of X-Men spin-off Logan. It uses the opportunity to take aim at Hugh Jackman’s gruff superhero, with Deadpool launching into a weak impression of Jackman’s Australian accent.

Unfortunately he takes too long to suit up and by the time he emerges, the victim has already been offed. Marvel Comics great Stan Lee also makes a brief cameo appearance in the film.

The end credit sequence inexplicably features a fast-scrolling book report on Ernest Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea, and the YouTube video features an erroneous video description that reads: “Wade and the other girls from the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants plan a trip to Cabot Cove.”The first Deadpool film enjoyed enormous commercial success, taking $783m (£637m) at the global box office, and in the process becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time. It was also well-received by critics, with the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw describing it as “neurotic and needy – and very entertaining”.Its sequel is expected to be released in 2018, though Deadpool writer Rhett Reese stated on Twitter that No Good Deed was not intended as a trailer for Deadpool 2, and that none of the footage featured would appear in the final film.
