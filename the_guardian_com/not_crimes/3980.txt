The new Trump logo was a perfect storm of gaffe, fashion and patriotism which seems an entirely appropriate trinity for the Republican candidate. Squint. See it now? Yes, it’s a sex act, a T penetrating a P, or as Slate’s associate editor, J Bryan Lowder, explains, something that “very accurately conveys the attributes Trump wants associated with his political and personal brand — namely that he has a penis and he uses it to screw people.” But what’s interesting is how much it resembles key brands like Polo Sport, Tommy Hilfiger and the British company Sports Direct. It makes sense – if social media picked up striking resemblance to throwback brands then we’re likely to remember Trump’s branding regardless of whether his campaign is successful.

As for the patriotic colour scheme, it’s a nice touch even if it fails to elevate it above our dirty minds.
