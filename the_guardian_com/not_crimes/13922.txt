The first duty of each day is to unlock the heatfrom the mixed changing rooms, to prep the electric saunafor prepaid use, to uncover the pool where, I’m told,two girls once drowned, though long before my time.This we may presume: how they got in after hours, drunk,daring each other to swim beneath the blue-green tarp thateach night tucked the water up; how the first girl panickedhalfway under, tried to surface where the surface wasn’t;and the second, seeing the bump in the plastic, went into end up the same way, a second bump, trying to push offthe suck of the whole pool against the heavy sheet. So bothstayed out of sight, stayed quiet, till the early-morning shift.And I can’t help but wonder what may bob into existenceas I slowly turn the wheel to roll the dripping plastic back,unlidding the water; how such a face might look, floatingframed within that soft flicker of blue; how we’ll both,for a moment, stare each other out in cool contemplationof each other’s daily roles; before I turn away to fetchthe hooped hook on its hollow pole, to skim the water;before the alarm is sounded; before the commotion begins.From J O Morgan’s Interference Pattern (Vintage, £10).
