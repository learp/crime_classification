It was close to 1am by the time Madonna finally came trundling on to Melbourne’s Forum stage on Thursday, dressed in a bright yellow clown smock, riding a tiny tricycle and waving to a sea of 1,500 competition winners. Doors had been billed to open at 8.30pm and many had waited in the rain for hours. One fan claimed to have been standing outside the venue since Tuesday.Music critic Lachlan Kanoniuk attended the intimate, offbeat and highly confessional cabaret show, and said when the American singer-cum-circus clown entered to the sounds of Stephen Sondheim’s Send in the Clowns, “everyone was like: ‘Oh shit, that’s Madonna doing laps on the stage, on a tricycle.’ ”Madonna takes custody battle with Guy Ritchie to English high court In her first Australian show in 23 years, the Material Girl prefaced the Tears of a Clown performance by apologising for any mistakes, calling it a “rehearsal” she had only practised a couple of times, Kanoniuk said.She will be back in full pop star mode on Saturday when she performs at Rod Laver arena, before heading to Brisbane and Sydney.Of the stories told throughout the two-hour performance, she recalled visiting her mother’s grave overgrown with weeds and played the song it inspired her to write, Mer Girl. She wiped away tears as she discussed losing custody of her 15-year-old son, Rocco, to ex-husband Guy Ritchie, before performing Intervention.In another she spoke about visiting then-husband actor Sean Penn in jail, whose jail mates at the time included serial killer Richard Ramirez, aka the Night Stalker. “It was quite a serious story but punctuated by these soundbites of goofy cartoon noises,” Kanoniuk said.The show also featured “a weird mix of old vaudevillian-style, M15+, smut humour and bad wordplay; some jokes about clowns, sex jokes that were really quite bad but she had such great comedic delivery – kind of knowing the jokes were shit and using them as a segue into songs. “Like: ‘I don’t have bipolar disorder but I am a little borderline’, and then playing Borderline.”She said she would “rather die than work in Vegas” and in another bawdy joke asked the crowd to guess the punchline to her joke: “What’s the difference between a car tyre and 365 used condoms?”, wiping a $100 note between her legs and offering it as a prize.Kanoniuk said an audience member successfully answered: “One is a Goodyear and another is a great year.”Shady Music Facts (@musicnews_shade)"I'd rather die than work in Vegas."- Madonna 💀😂 pic.twitter.com/xrCtwNk4IKMarch 10, 2016In her cover of Elliott Smith’s Between the Bars, one of the biggest names in pop music showed a side of herself few in Australia had seen: no costume changes, no highly synchronised dance moves, just Madonna playing an acoustic guitar and baring her soul on stage.Kanoniuk likened it to Prince’s recent intimate “piano and microphone” tour, which kicked off in Australia. “These artists are watching the machine of the music industry crumble away, so they’re thinking why the fuck not do whatever they want, and while they can still get away with it.”• Madonna plays Melbourne’s Rod Laver arena on Saturday and Sunday, Brisbane Entertainment Centre on 16 and 17 March, and Sydney’s Allphones arena on 19 and 20 March
