Meryl Streep is set to sing once more, joining Emily Blunt and Hamilton star Lin Manuel-Miranda in Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns.Sources have told Variety that Streep is being lined up to play Poppins’s cousin by marriage, Topsy Tartlet. Topsy is a maid who, in PL Travers’s Mary Poppins Comes Back, marries Arthur Turvy – so changing her name to Topsy Turvy. The character did not feature in the 1964 film starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, which Travers famously hated. Mary Poppins Returns would reunite Streep for the third time with Blunt, who has been cast as Poppins, after 2006’s The Devil Wears Prada and 2014’s Into the Woods. The director of the latter film, Rob Marshall, is also in charge of the new Poppins. A new soundtrack has been composed for the movie, featuring original songs.Mary Poppins Returns will be set in 1930s London and features Poppins helping the now grown Banks children through a bereavement.
