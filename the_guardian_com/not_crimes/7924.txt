Alabama Shakes have have won the Grammy for best alternative music album. Sound & Color, their second studio album, beat the likes of Björk and Tame Impala at the ceremony in Los Angeles on Monday night. While this is their first Grammy win, the southern rock and blues band have previously been nominated: Boys & Girl’s hit single Hold On was nominated for three awards at the 2012 event.Alabama Shakes: Sound & Color review – riveting, kaleidoscopic second album The album, which gave the group their first No 1 on the Billboard 200 following its release in April, shifted 97,000 sales in its first week, powered mostly by physical album sales, according to Nielsen Music.Sound & Color followed the success of their debut; an album which sold close to 1m copies in the US alone, with critics praising their traditionalist approach to rock and soul, and the startlingly powerful blues voice of Brittany Howard. While their second record is still largely based around that vintage quality, the quartet this time dabbled in synthesisers and orchestral arrangements. “Not all their experiments work, but it’s hard not to be infected by the excitement when they do,” wrote Alexis Petridis in his review. “This is obviously music still informed by the past, but not cowed by it. Sound and Color feels like the work of a band rather than a historical re-enactment society.”As well as their Grammy win for Sound & Color, the group are up for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance for the track Don’t Wanna Fight as well as the prestigious Album Of The Year.The other of the nominees for this prize were: My Morning Jacket’s The Waterfall, Currents by Tame Impala, Vulnicura by Björk and Wilco’s Star Wars.
