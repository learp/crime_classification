Baby boomers are wrongly accused yet again (Letters, 21 February). According to Ipsos Mori, the total of boomers who voted Labour, Lib Dem or Green in the 2015 general election is greater than the number who voted Tory. Remember that the boomer generation includes the radical students of 1968, the early feminist and gay liberation movements, the anti-apartheid campaign, the founding of Amnesty, Third World First, and many other such movements and organisations.Pam LunnKenilworth, Warwickshire• Personally, I wouldn’t want to enter into a marriage or a civil partnership (Court rules against mixed-sex civil partnerships but pair vow to appeal, 21 February). However, as a bisexual, I find it ludicrous that I could do either with a woman but could only marry a man.Ria HopkinsonLondon• Readers should not be too shocked that security officials in north-west China have ordered residents to install tracker devices in their cars (Report, 22 February). I have been fitted with one for many years: it is called a mobile phone. Brian MossTamworth, Staffordshire 'A litre of water’s a pint and three-quarters'Janet Hunter, courtesy of Co-op cornflakes • I don’t have an interesting story about Weetabix (Letters, passim), but I did learn all I needed to know about the change from imperial to metric in the 1970s from the back of a box of Co-op cornflakes. The rhymes were: “A litre of water’s a pint and three-quarters”; “Two and a quarter pounds of jam weigh about a kilogram” and “A metre measures three foot three, it’s longer than a yard, you see”. As we’ve never quite dropped imperial, I still use them today to do rough conversions.Janet HunterCalvert, Buckinghamshire• When I was a lad growing up in Liverpool, we had dockers’ doorsteps, made with compressed raisins and sultanas and encased in slabs of dough (Letters, passim). Cut into squares and sold for a couple of pennies. They took some eating. I don’t think I ever finished one, they were such heavy going.Terry WaferWidnes, Cheshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
