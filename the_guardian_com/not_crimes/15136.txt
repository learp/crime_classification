Moody bluesDark, brooding and aggressively expressionist, this is a world away from the cosy English image of Constable, the souvenir-shop favourite. The setting is the beach at Brighton, where the artist’s wife, Maria, had been sent to take the sea air to improve her tuberculosis. However, that raging ink-black storm looks anything but a tonic.Liquid skyBy the time he created this sketch, Constable had been “skying”, that is, caught up in a passion for cloudscapes, for a few years. In 1822, he had made many studies in oil of the skies over Hampstead.Aerial shotThis was made fast, in a spell where he’d take to the beach and work with paper pinned to the lid of the paint box in his lap.Clouded judgmentConstable lamented that Brighton was a kind of Piccadilly-on-Sea, a seaside encampment for London’s fashionable set.

Its black streak of sea and rain that falls like deadly bolts of gloom suggests the inner landscape of a troubled mind.Part of Constable and Brighton, Brighton Museum & Art Gallery, to 8 October
