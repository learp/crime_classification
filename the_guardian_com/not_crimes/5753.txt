An ice-cream made from a traditional pungent cheese has become a surprise hit in a small Czech town, with happy buyers scooping up all the innovative dessert the producer can make. The cheese used, Olomoucké tvarůžky, is a mature, yellowish cheese with a strong taste and smell that is normally enjoyed with bread, beer and, sometimes, onions. It is popular throughout the country.“Lot of people think it will be salty, but it is really a fairly sweet ice-cream with a tvarůžky cheese taste,” cafe owner and ice-cream maker Roman Cincara said.Cincara, who has applied to have his recipe patented, adds sugar and other ingredients to balance the cheesy taste, while the cheese’s odour is partly suppressed by the low temperature.His cafe – in the eastern town of Loštice, the home of Olomoucké tvarůžky – was bustling with business last weekend, selling all 400 portions available.Customer Lukas Pupik was convinced: “Superb. Sweet-salty, great. It really tastes like tvarůžky.” The cheese has been produced in the Olomouc region that includes Loštice since the 15th century. It gained protected geographical indication status from the European Union in 2010.
