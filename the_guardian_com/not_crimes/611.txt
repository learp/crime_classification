I would give this book a score of 7/10. This book tells the story of a boy who is accused of murder and tries to prove his innocence by solving the murder himself, unfortunately finding himself in danger along the way.The story contains pirates, Gods, killer-scorpions, and sea monsters! The story gripped me from the beginning and was exciting and also a little scary. I like this author and would like to read his other books. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend this book for boys aged between 8 - 12 years. Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book youâ€™ve read?
