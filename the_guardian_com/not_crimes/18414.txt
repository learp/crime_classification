James Shapiro’s exploration of a year in the life of Shakespeare has been shortlisted for the UK’s oldest book prize, just days before the 400th anniversary of the playwright’s death on 23 April.1606: William Shakespeare and the Year of Lear by James Shapiro review – a fraught political and cultural moment Shapiro’s book 1606, which looks at the year in which Shakespeare wrote King Lear, is one of four works shortlisted for the £10,000 James Tait Black biography award, won in the past by luminaries from John Buchan to Peter Ackroyd, Martin Amis and Claire Tomalin. Founded in 1919 by the widow of publisher James Tait Black, Janet Coats, the prize is given by the University of Edinburgh, with students and academics from the university reading more than 400 books to select the shortlist.The book is a sequel to 1599, which followed another eventful year in the life of the Bard – and won Shapiro the 2006 Samuel Johnson prize.Shapiro will compete with a memoir from playwright David Hare, The Blue Touch Paper, Sarah Knights’ biography of writer and publisher David Garnett, Bloomsbury’s Outsider, and Ruth Scurr’s life of the scholar John Aubrey, stitched together from his own words.Four writers are also in the running for the £10,000 James Tait Black fiction prize, which has been won in the past by heavyweights from Graham Greene to Angela Carter. Kevin Barry’s Beatlebone, a fictionalised version of John Lennon’s journey to an Irish island that has already won the Goldsmiths prize, makes the cut alongside Sarah Hall’s The Wolf Border, a look at an attempt to reintroduce grey wolves to the UK, screenwriter Miranda July’s debut novel The First Bad Man, and Benjamin Markovits’s You Don’t Have to Live Like This. The latter tells of an academic in Aberystwyth, stuck in a dead-end career, who is caught up in an old friend’s plan to build a new America from boarded-up neighbourhoods in Detroit.Fiction judge Dr Alex Lawrie, from Edinburgh’s school of literatures, languages and cultures, said the lineup “showcases the wit, energy and innovation that characterised a remarkably strong year for fiction”, while biography judge Dr Jonathan Wild said the non-fiction line-up represented “the cream of biographical writing”.The winners will be announced on 15 August at the Edinburgh international book festival.James Tait Black biography shortlistShakespeare's last act: a torrent of twisted fantasies The Blue Touch Paper: A Memoir by David Hare (Faber and Faber)Bloomsbury’s Outsider: A Life of David Garnett by Sarah Knights (Bloomsbury)John Aubrey: My Own Life by Ruth Scurr (Chatto and Windus)1606: William Shakespeare and the Year of Lear by James Shapiro (Faber and Faber)James Tait Black fiction shortlistBeatlebone by Kevin Barry (Canongate)The Wolf Border by Sarah Hall (Faber and Faber)The First Bad Man by Miranda July (Canongate)You Don’t Have to Live Like This by Benjamin Markovits (Faber and Faber)
