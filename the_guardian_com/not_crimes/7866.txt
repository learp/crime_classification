Although I love a meaty scotch egg as much as the next person, they also work wrapped in pulses and vegetables, and are a bit more virtuous, too, for something deep-fried. They’re great weekend cooking, either way. Today’s second recipe involves a trip to the woods to forage wild garlic, to add boldness to a soothing potato and barley broth.Smoky beetroot scotch egg with piquillo relishI came across this beet and pumpkin seed mixture in a falafel in Texas, and was keen to replicate it at home. The relish brings them alive. Makes six.8 eggs2 tbsp olive oil1 onion, peeled and finely chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped½ tbsp ground coriander 2 tsp smoked paprika2 tsp ground cumin1 tin butter beans, drained and rinsed175g cooked brown lentils2 tbsp pumpkin seeds, ground1 tbsp flaxseeds, ground150g raw beetroot, peeled, grated and wrung dry in kitchen paper1 small bunch coriander, leaves pickedSalt and freshly ground black pepperA splash of milk50g plain flour100g dried breadcrumbsVegetable oil, for fryingFor the piquillo relish2 tbsp olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced1 red chilli, finely chopped4 roasted piquillo (or red) peppers from a jar, roughly choppedZest and juice of 1 orange1 rosemary sprig1 bay leaf1 tsp sherry vinegarTo make the relish, warm the oil on a medium heat, then fry the garlic and chilli until soft. Add the peppers, cook for three minutes, then stir in the orange zest and juice, the herbs and two tablespoons of water. Simmer for 10 minutes, until the peppers have softened a little, then discard the herbs. Stir in the vinegar, season to taste and whizz to a puree.Put six eggs in a pan, add cold water to cover and bring to a boil. Simmer for five minutes, drain and run under cold water to cool. Peel carefully.For the egg coating, heat the oil in a pan on a medium flame, and fry the onion and garlic for five minutes, until soft. Stir in the spices, cook for a minute, then tip into a food processor. Add the beans, lentils, seeds, beetroot and coriander, then whizz briefly to combine (don’t overwork the mixture, or it will go stodgy) and season generously.Divide the mix into six balls (about 100g each). Lay a sheet of clingfilm on a work surface and put a ball in the centre. Flatten it with the palm of your hand, then set a peeled egg in the centre and bring up the sides of the clingfilm until the pulse mixture encloses it completely. Repeat with the remaining eggs (you can make them to this stage ahead of time; if you do, store in the fridge).Beat the remaining two eggs in a small bowl with a splash of milk, and put the flour and breadcrumbs in two separate bowls. Lightly roll the eggs in the flour, shake off any excess, then dip first in the beaten egg mix and then roll in the breadcrumbs. Refrigerate for 10 minutes, to set.Pour enough vegetable oil into a deep, narrow saucepan to come 5cm up the sides and put on a medium-high heat. When the oil hits 180C (ie when a scrap of bread turns golden in 25 seconds), it’s ready: cook the eggs two or three at a time for three to four minutes, turning regularly, until golden all over, then drain on kitchen paper. Repeat with the remaining eggs, making sure the oil is back up to temperature each time.Halve the still-warm eggs and serve with the relish on the side.Pearl barley and jersey royals with wild garlic picadaThe parsley in this superbly nutty picada mellows the gutsy wild garlic; both leave a trail of vivid green through the broth. If you don’t fancy a forage, ask a good grocer for wild garlic, or use a clove of normal garlic and extra parsley. Serves four.3 tbsp olive oil2 leeks, roughly sliced2 sticks celery, roughly slicedTwo handfuls wild garlic, shredded100g pearl barley, rinsedSalt and freshly ground black pepper1.25 litres chicken or vegetable stock150g frozen peas300g jersey royals, quarteredFor the picada75g blanched hazelnuts50g blanched almonds1 large handful parsley leaves, roughly chopped150ml olive oilJuice of ½ lemon Heat the oil in a deep pan on a medium heat, then add the leeks, celery and a third of the wild garlic, season and sweat gently until soft – about five minutes. Stir in the barley, season again, then add the hot stock. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 35-45 minutes, until the barley is tender.Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Roast the nuts until golden, about eight minutes, then tip into a food processor and add the parsley and remaining wild garlic. Blitz for a minute, then slowly incorporate the oil and season with lemon.Boil the potatoes with a teaspoon of salt until just tender, about 10-12 minutes, then drain and add with the peas to the pearl barley broth for the final five minutes of cooking.Divide the broth between bowls, add a spoonful of picada and serve.And for the rest of the week…If you prefer a meaty scotch egg, wrap the eggs in a spreadable chorizo or morcilla (you can get both online from Brindisa). The piquillo relish is also wonderful with frittata or grilled lamb chops, which are also delicious with the picada. It is worth getting enough wild garlic to make double the amount of picada, because it’s so versatile and so good, you’ll be using it on all sorts: add parmesan to the mix to make it pesto-like, or Dijon mustard and capers to make a piquant salsa verde. In both cases, if you cover it with a film of olive oil, the puree will keep happily in the fridge for a week or more.
