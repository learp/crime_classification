One of four rare 19th-century vases designed for Cardiff Castle is at risk of being exported unless a buyer can be found to match the £225,000 price tag.The culture minister, Ed Vaizey, has placed a temporary export bar on the vase, designed by William Burges, one of Britain’s most influential architects and designers, in the hope of keeping the full set in the country.The vases, which bear colourful decoration and lovebird designs, were designed in 1874 for the summer smoking room in the clock tower.The vase that has come up for sale is the last left in private ownership: one of them is in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London; another is at the Higgins Gallery and Museum in Bedford.A third vase was saved by the National Museum of Wales after an export bar was imposed last year. It will be displayed at the National Museum Cardiff.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The rare vase at risk of being exported.

I hope that we are able to keep this vase – and thus the whole set – in the UK for the public to enjoy for years to come.”The decision to impose the bar follows a recommendation by the reviewing committee on the export of works of art and objects of cultural interest, which said the vase was closely connected with the UK’s history and was of outstanding aesthetic importance and significance for the study of Burges.Art treasures leave UK as museums struggle to mount competitive bids The committee’s chairman, Sir Hayden Phillips, said: “This beautiful vase is the fourth in a suite of four. Just over a year ago the committee recommended that the third vase should not be allowed to be exported if it could be purchased to allow it to remain in this country. That was achieved and it is now in the National Museum of Wales.“Apart from this vase’s intrinsic quality, the opportunity is now there for us to retain the original quartet, which would be a noble purpose, in the public interest, and of great historical significance. Its retention would open the possibility of a future reunification and therefore the realisation of Burges’ vision for the four pieces.”The decision on the export licence has been deferred to 16 September.
