It's an appropriate day to bring you this bit of news, with gales lashing higher ground in the north as well as causing havoc in parts of Scotland.The first wind turbines to be approved in the Lake District national park are going to go up at the summit between Ambleside, Troutbeck and Ullswater, home of the famous Kirkstone Pass inn.All together now: There was a lad as loved a lassWho lived at the top of the Kirkstone PassHe said: "Ah'll love thee for ever and everythingBut will ah visit thee? Never, no never.Having trekked up there with the late Harry Griffin and my former photographer colleague Denis Thorpe, in snow, I know how the young man felt. That was the occasion when we dried out in the Queen's Head at Troutbeck and sat so close to the fire that we set Harry's anorak on fire (but fortunately not him).The turbine decision will see three 16.45m (54ft) metre turbines go up in a nearby field at a cost of about £135,000, making the continued existence of the 500-year-old pub viable, at 451m (1481ft) and with no connection to the national grid. As you can imagine, hostility to the notion of wind turbines in the Lakes generally is intense, and opponents of the plan told the Lake District national park planning committee that they would be 'alien'.  This is more how I remember it, midway through walks between High Street and St Sunday Crag.

The approval by the national park's development control committee is seen very definitely as a one-off and not establishing any wider precedent.The inn's landlord John Jennings, who spends £25,000 a year on diesel generators for heat and light (in addition to the warmth provided by customers and his and his family's welcome, in my experience), said that the turbines were simply 'a matter of survival.' The application posed a familiar dilemma for planners: landscape protection and local prosperity are both fundamental; where do you set the priorities in each case. The consensus was that the relatively minor effect of the turbines beside the inn, as seen from both road approaches, was sufficient to put the continuation of the staff's living, fell-walkers' relief and tourists' comfort first.Campaigns against turbines meanwhile continue fiercely in many other parts of the north, notably the emerging 'Hockney country' of Yorkshire's east riding which the Northerner will be visiting tomorrow.
