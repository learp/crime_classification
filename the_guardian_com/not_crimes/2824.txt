At next month’s Bath literature festival, a panel will debate the coming-of-age novel, its talk of hormones and sudden self-awareness inspired by a 50-strong list of books that includes The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath and The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger. Will Darcy O’Brien’s A Way of Life, Like Any Other perhaps get a mention? I doubt it: few novels as good as this one are as little known, even if the NYRB edition does come with a foreword by Seamus Heaney. But never mind. At least I now have an excuse to bang on about it here. Salty's father persists in dressing like the cowboys he once played even as his girth makes this ridiculous Published in 1977, but set in 50s Hollywood – O’Brien was the son of George O’Brien, star of the 1927 silent movie Sunrise, and Marguerite Churchill, who appeared with John Wayne in The Big Trail – its narrator is a kid called Salty whose movie star parents are flamboyantly unhappy. His booze-soaked mother is obsessed with her fading looks, and his father persists in dressing like the cowboys he once played even as his girth makes this ridiculous. Their son is well named. A mournful, observant soul with a deadly talent for mimicry, he is also drily and filthily funny.“I would not change the beginning for anything,” reads the opening of this novel of a glittering world gone all to pieces. “I had an electric car, a starched white nanny, a pony, a bed modelled after that of Napoleon’s son, and I was baptised by the Archbishop of the Diocese. I wore hats and sucked on a little pipe.” It’s a perfect start, and what follows doesn’t disappoint. Salty’s voice is idiosyncratic, inimitable, at once lyrical and ironic. It is, in fact, not unlike Holden Caulfield’s – only this story comes with more avocados and swimming pools, and a somewhat shinier brand of ennui.
