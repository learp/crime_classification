I’ve invented a new dish: it’s called Delia’s key lime pudding. What you do is, you make the filling to Delia’s key lime pie, try to make the base, fail, try again, fail again, cry, eat the filling and pronounce it a success.Yes, Delia’s key lime pie is a game of two halves. The filling is simplicity itself. Put your egg yolks and lime zest into a bowl, whisk for two minutes, add condensed milk, whisk for a further four minutes, add lime juice, whisk again, then pour it into the biscuit base and whack it in the oven for 20 minutes, or until it feels just about set.The difficulty, surprisingly enough, is in the biscuit base. I know what you’re thinking: for God’s sake, Stephen, it’s a biscuit base: how hard can it be? To which I say: hold on to your contempt – you’ll need it for later.The biscuit base has three ingredients: plain digestive biscuits, unsurprisingly enough; butter; and Grape-Nuts breakfast cereal. If yours are anything like my local Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Morrison’s or Waitrose supermarkets, you will have one simple question: “What is Grape-Nuts breakfast cereal?”Well, I’ll tell you. The first thing you need to know about Grape-Nuts cereal is that it includes neither grapes nor nuts. It is made from wheat and barley. If you want to imagine what Grape-Nuts breakfast cereal is, here is a way to recreate what it looks like: finish a box of, say, Corn Flakes, or Frosties or Weetabix, then look at the detritus in the bottom of the bag. Congratulations! You’ve got Grape-Nuts!Delia Smith’s recipe for creme caramel – what could go wrong? Grape-Nuts are the invention of Charles Post, who started life as an agricultural salesman, but suffered a series of nervous breakdowns. In search of a cure, he checked himself into John Harvey Kellogg’s health clinic – I promise I am not making this up – where he was so struck by the quality of the food he decided to get into the cereal business himself. Unfortunately, Kellogg had already invented all the good cereals and taken all the good names, so poor old Post was left with Grape-Nuts, which is both deeply uninspiring and has an incredibly stupid name.Grape-Nuts aren’t bad in and of themselves. They’re what I imagine all food will be like when climate change gets so bad that we move to raft cities and start living off algae: it isn’t actively bad – you can tell that it is providing you with all the nutrients you need – it’s just that eating it feels like a chore rather than pleasure. Delia claims that she has “discovered recently” that Grape-Nuts give a biscuit base extra crunch, which I suspect is code for “I chucked a bunch of Grape-Nuts in with the biscuits to get rid of the stuff”.Here’s what you absolutely should not do: do not attempt to replace Grape-Nuts with any of the following: original Special K, Weetabix, Corn Flakes or Shredded Wheat. If you do, it will look as if you have made a biscuit base, and it will smell as if you have made a biscuit base, but during the cooking process, the lime filling will escape said base and you will end up with what is basically a key lime cake with a biscuit filling. Which tastes delicious, but you won’t be able to show it off to your guests. You have, instead, two options. One: find the biggest, fanciest supermarket in your area, where they will have some Grape-Nuts. Or, alternately, just substitute the “two ounces” of Grape-Nuts for more digestive biscuits, or, if you’d like a bit more crunch, porridge oats. But if you really, really want Grape-Nuts, then don’t worry: I have most of a packet left.Stephen Bush is cooking his way through Delia’s Complete How To Cook (BBC Books, £40) in a year.
