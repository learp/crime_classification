When you started out making music 53 years ago, did you anticipate having such a long career?Yeah, absolutely. As soon as you realise you can’t really do anything else. I couldn’t be an auto mechanic, I couldn’t be a brain surgeon. At an early stage, you realise you’re going to America to do this, and then you want to do more of this, and then you realise that rock’n’roll is more open to those ideas than classical music, where you started from. It’s a rumpus house, rock’n’roll. You can do anything you want in it. You can sing an aria or whatever and people will nod their heads and say, yes, we get it.You’ve remade your bleak 1982 album Music for a New Society under the name M:FANS. When you revisited those songs, what did you make of the person who wrote them?Confused and angry. But he’s trying to figure something out and if he doesn’t always succeed he always tries; that’s what sustains the album.How clearly do you recall recording it?A little too distinctly. The emotions around that time are pretty raw. I was trying to figure out a whole bunch of things about what I was doing and why I was doing it. I thought the music would help. It was improvised, so it was really all or nothing. Whatever comes out comes out.You turned the song If You Were Still Around into a tribute to Lou Reed on the first anniversary of his death. What was your relationship like in the months before he died?Um. Silent. I mean, I wished him well when he came out of his hospital experience. I can’t do very much navel gazing about it. What happened happened. I thought what was important to both of us was the work. Every conversation would always start with: “Have you heard this song? Or that song?” That’s the basis of it.There’s an amazing photograph on your Tumblr of you and Lou on Fifth Avenue in your black Velvet Underground gear, with passersby gawping. Did you like to provoke a reaction?Yeah, but that was Fifth Avenue. When we walked around the Lower East Side kids would throw stones and scream: “Are you the Beatles?” There was something neanderthal about it that made them very upset. Those rocks were sharp and they’d throw them at your head because they were basically throwing them at your hair; so you wanted to get indoors as fast as you could. When I met Lou, the A&R guy said: “You look very commercial”. Anyone with long hair, that was how you were seen.You recently contributed to a study of diversity in the arts, talking about being the son of a coal miner. Do you think lack of diversity is a problem now?I’ve never thought about musicians that way, because all musicians seem to me to be working class. I wouldn’t have veered towards someone who had a lot of money, because when I ran into those people they weren’t as interesting as the hardcore ones.Americans can be bad at identifying accents. When you moved to New York in 1963 did people realise you were Welsh?For about a year I was working with La Monte [Young] every day and I didn’t realise until after I’d left that for the first six months there was a lot of nodding and smiling going on, because he really didn’t understand what I was saying. But it didn’t matter. It worked.When your music got more intense in the late 70s – you notoriously decapitated a dead chicken on stage in Croydon – did you attract a different kind of audience?I was really not aware of it until I did Mercenaries (Ready for War) and I toured post-Vietnam America [in 1979]. That’s when I got all the vets coming out and showing their appreciation. It was hair-raising… people wanting to give me presents after the gig: “Come by the house, we’re just outside town.” I sent my tour manager to find out what they wanted to give me and it turned out it was a genuine German army Luger. The last thing you want to do after a gig is go to a stranger’s house in the dark of night so he can give you a gun.A lot of your early 1980s songs were politically pessimistic. Is it true that you joined the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute?Yes, I did. I was looking for literature. They had some interesting propaganda books. There are all sorts of [my] songs that have references to that. I looked in a lot of strange places, like the Institute for the Study of Conflict, Brian Crozier’s outfit. There was a lot of Sturm und Drang going on and I wanted to see if I could read the patterns, to see how well they were covering their tracks.

What did she make of your music?I never asked her, actually. She came to a concert in Swansea, which unfortunately happened after the chicken incident, and she got confronted by the TV [coverage]. She had a thick skin about stuff like that.Patti Smith recently said she was “very, very suspicious, very guarded and hard to work with” when you produced her 1975 album Horses. Did you find her difficult?No. I was responsible for giving Clive [Davis of Arista Records] something that he would understand, and I did my job. I think all the psychodrama that went on was par for the course. It keeps everybody entertained.You’ve also produced bands such as the Stooges, the Modern Lovers and the Happy Mondays. Which one was most like herding cats?Ha! My albums are the ones most like herding cats.How did you end up acting in the US version of The Bridge two years ago?I got a call one day. People ask every now and again. I just never found anything that skyrocketed me to fame, you know what I mean? But I love that show. I was a panhandler, selling things. You just memorise your lines and off you go.Would you like to remake any other albums?Not at all. I get the opportunity to do that anyway when I do a concert. I like tearing them apart and reassembling them. It keeps my interest. I get bored really easily. In April we have this Velvet Underground anniversary concert in Paris. That’s going to be all about rearranging them again. You’re always rearranging the furniture on the Titanic anyway.David Bowie has just died. You were a fan and collaborated a couple of times; how did you feel when you heard the news?Seeing that headline made me hold my breath. If I stared at my computer long enough, would I find out it was a horrible mistake? My mind went to a time when David and I had been vowing to do something together: write, record, tour… We barely scratched the surface creatively, but we did make a menace of ourselves with the girls! There was an attempt at a song – I even taught him to play a viola part. If we’d given half as much attention to the work as we did to the party… but then I wouldn’t have these colourful memories of our ridiculous behaviour, running around the streets of New York. G’night Dai Jones, you are the Blackstar that never burns out.Music for a New Society/M:FANS is released on 22 January on Domino Records. John Cale plays The Roundhouse in London on 3 February
