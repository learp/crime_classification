Rihanna’s a hit! No she isn’t! Or maybe she is!Last week’s story was how Rihanna bungled the launch of Anti. This week’s story appeared to be: never mind the bungling, she’s gone platinum! Until, that is, the New York Times suggested she had gone platinum off the back of a whopping 460 actual sales of the album. The problem, as Eamonn Forde wrote for Guardian Music, was that no one really knows how to measure success any longer: “Defining Anti as a success or as a failure utterly depends on the lenses through which you choose to look at it. And how you look at it will invariably only tell part of its story. At this early stage in its release cycle, it sits somewhere between a massive free download, a streaming sensation and a lukewarm purchase. The point, however, is that the charts have changed in recent years and therefore the yardstick of success is being forced to change with it in lockstep.” Stereogum pointed out that every piece of information concerning Anti seemed to contradict something else, not least those offered by Jay Z’s streaming service Tidal, which released the album. It also posed a question about whether it is right to count downloads of an album that was paid for by Samsung on behalf of consumers, then given away free, as sales: “Does the high number of doughnuts given away on National Doughnut Day reflect the public’s actual appetite for doughnuts? Or just our appetite for free shit?”Kanye put himself on the cover of Rolling StoneWhat happens when you’re Kanye West and another artist has been attracting the world’s attention for a whole week? You do something to regain that attention. As if unveiling his new album via a special gig at Madison Square Garden – and then streaming it live to cinemas in many of the world’s great cities, including Reading – wasn’t enough, he chose to unveil a Rolling Stone cover, featuring himself (photographed by Tyler, the Creator) and the frankly brilliant coverline, “Does he like mustard?” It appears we will never learn the answer, because the killjoys at Rolling Stone tweeted: “While we love Kanye, and have many mustard-related questions for him, this is not an actual cover of Rolling Stone.”KANYE WEST (@kanyewest)ROLLING STONE SHOT BY TYLER THE CREATOR pic.twitter.com/lOMtOdOEelFebruary 3, 2016Metal turned its back on Philip AnselmoFormer Pantera frontman Philip Anselmo has a long history of making unfortunate remarks on the subject of race. But after he gave a fascist salute and shouted “White power!” at a gig last week, metal turned on him fairly thoroughly, and evidently didn’t believe his excuse that he was talking about white wine. Machine Head frontman Robb Flynn posted an 11-minute video to YouTube. Scott Ian of Anthrax posted in his website: “Philip’s acts were vile and that should be the focus here, anything else is just noise. Philip has apologised, and I would like to offer him the opportunity to really show how much he loves everyone by making a donation to the Simon Wiesenthal Center.” Meanwhile, promoters responded, with the Dutch festival FortaRock cancelling a booking of Anselmo’s group, Down. The latest update on this story, however, is that Anselmo has offered to leave his current band, Down. “I’m repulsed by my own actions,” he wrote in a statement. “From the bottom of my heart, and with all sincerity, I once again am truly sorry for the pain I have caused.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Adele said no to Donald TrumpYou get to be the biggest star in the world (forget sales stats, Adele was this week revealed as having smashed Justin Bieber’s record for the most-viewed Carpool Karaoke), then people will want a piece of you (except Noel Gallagher, who definitely won’t). Trying to cash in on Adele this week was Donald Trump, who decided her music would be the perfect accompaniment to his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Sadly for him, Adele followed the lead of Aerosmith and REM by telling him where to get off. Coming soon: Black Lace insist Agadoo should not be used as bedding music for Trump speeches on matters of pineapple-pushing, tree-shaking or coffee-grinding.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Bowie’s beans were countedIt may not come as a colossal surprise to learn that David Bowie didn’t die in poverty, what with all those hit albums, hit singles, and hit tours. Not even bad deals struck in the 1970s – when it was the law that all rock stars had to strike bad deals – could stop him becoming a man who never needed to worry about whether he could really spare 60p for that Toffee Crisp. This week we learned quite how rich he was, when it was revealed that he had left an estate of around $100m to his wife, Iman, and two children. One of the other telling details of the will was that he left $1m to Marion Skene, who had acted as nanny to his elder child, Duncan Jones, in the days when Bowie himself was preoccupied with being a drug-taking sex alien in makeup.Suge Knight’s time got harderThe former rap mogul Suge Knight remains in jail, awaiting trial for the murder of Terry Carter. Now his time behind bars has become a little bit less pleasant – he’s been told he can have no visitors or phone calls. The only people who can contact him by phone now or pay him a visit are his lawyers, though chances are that even they won’t see him that many times – in the year since the charges were brought, Knight has changed his legal team five times. No one knows why the visitation ban was imposed, just that it was at the request of a sheriff’s detective investigating the case.Martin Shkreli relied upon the fifth amendment Last week the “bad boy of pharma” was threatening members of Wu-Tang Clan on camera. This week he’s in court. The controversial tycoon, who also owns Wu-Tang Clan’s one-off album, was called to testify before a Congressional committee investigating drug-price hikes on Thursday. When questions about his morals, his empathy and his purchasing of the Wu-Tang Clan album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, he cited his fifth amendment right to remain silent. Shkreli was less tight-lipped during a radio show the Breakfast Club later on in the week, where he explained his reasons for buying the only copy of the album. “There’s a lot of things rich guys do to show off,” he said. “The press thing is a part of it, but it’s also to show your friends, or your last company, like, ‘Hey, fuck you, look at me, I got this $2m album.’ Guys do that all the time.” Sure they do! Happy 40th, Ramones!Forty years ago this month, the Ramones entered the studio to record their epochal debut album, the record whose bubblegum roar helped provide the UK punks who were scratching around in search of a sound with the kick up the backside they needed. Of course, no rock’n’roll anniversary can be allowed to pass, and so the group are going to be celebrated this spring in a manner they never were while all four original members were still alive – there’ll be a special Ramonic event at South by Southwest, an exhibition in New York, a deluxe edition of the album, a new documentary. And, naturally, a commercial partnership with Levi’s. If you prefer to think of Joey, Johnny, Tommy and Dee Dee in terms of their music, though, you could do worse than have a look at this fantastic piece, in which the class of 1976 remember the effect the Ramones had on them. “They were really ramshackle,” recalled their NYC contemporary Richard Hell. “They only had five or six songs and were so broke they had to carry their guitars in laundry bags, and they’d get mixed up about what they were doing and start yelling at each other.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It’s bright in BirminghamExciting news from Birmingham, where 29-year-old Lithuanian Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla has been appointed music director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. Which matters because the CBSO has had an impeachable run of picking its chief conductors – Simon Rattle, then Sakari Oramo, then Andris Nelsons. “It all adds up to a succession of conductors who were little, if at all, known internationally when they made their debuts with the orchestra, but whose careers blossomed during their time in the city, and who have continued to prosper ever since,” wrote Andrew Clements. So there’s a fighting chance the West Midlands will get to see the development of the next great maestro. Maurice White, Earth, Wind & Fire founder, dies at age 74We’re only two months into 2016 and yet the music world has lost some of its key creative minds. This week, the industry mourned the death of Maurice White, founder of the horn-driven funk band responsible for hits like September, Shining Star and Boogie Wonderland. The 74 year old died on Wednesday at his home in Los Angeles, his brother Verdine confirmed. White had suffered from Parkinson’s disease and had retreated from the public even as the band he founded continued to perform.
