Building the third Heathrow runway over the M25 would be a more sensible, cheaper and quicker way of completing the project than digging a tunnel for the motorway, the transport secretary has said.Chris Grayling endorsed the idea after announcing the government’s backing for a third runway, six years after David Cameron withdrew support for the scheme.The decision prompted a Conservative rift with Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, saying it was undeliverable and Zac Goldsmith, a former London mayoral candidate, resigning as a Tory MP to stand as in independent, triggering a byelection.Grayling said it had been necessary to take a “tough decision in the interest of the nation”, while declining an opportunity to apologise to voters who believed the Conservative party promise not to build the runway.This much scrutiny for a strip of tarmac? That’s democracy | Rafael Behr The proposal to build the runway on an eight-metre ramp over the M25 in south-west London has been under consideration for several months, since a review by Lord Deighton into ways shaving £2bn-£3bn off the overall bill. It now appears to be favoured by the government, although sources at the Department for Transport stressed that all options, including the original tunnel idea, were under consideration.Heathrow expansionGrayling told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “One of the things Heathrow have been looking at is doing what many other airports have done around the world, which is to build the runway over the top of the road rather than underneath it.”He said the government was working to make sure the third runway was affordable and a ramp was a cheaper and quicker way of doing it than tunnelling. “I am very concerned to make sure it doesn’t cause massive disruption on the M25,” he said.The proposals will be scrutinised in a public consultation before a decision is taken and documents released on Tuesday by the DfT contained correspondence from Highways England, the body in charge of Britain’s major roads, showing that it considered the M25 scheme a major risk.PMQs: Corbyn calls on May to 'come up with a plan' for Brexit – Politics live Highways England said there was a “significant risk of cost overruns” in the tunnel scheme, which it estimated would cost between £476m and £1.1bn. The roads authority described the plan as “high risk”, and said there was “a substantial risk of excessive customer frustration about what might be [a] prolonged period of disruption”. The analyst firm Inrix say that traffic and delays around the motorway junction are likely to increase by 10% after the runway is built, and by 30% during construction.Grayling has begun a tour of the regions to promote the benefits of Heathrow’s third runway, starting on Wednesday in Newcastle upon Tyne where he was to visit an engineering company to stress that it was a project in the national interest, not just for the south-east.On Tuesday, the government hailed its plan to proceed with airport expansion as a sign of strength and decisiveness after years of delays. Theresa May told the cabinet it was a vital decision that had been ducked for too long. But she immediately faced a range of Conservative resistance after she decided to partially suspend cabinet responsibility to allow Johnson and Justine Greening, the education secretary, to express opposition to the plan once it was made public.Following the announcement on Tuesday, Goldsmith resigned as a Conservative MP, describing the government’s decision to back a third runway at Heathrow as the “most polluting, most disruptive, most expensive option”.

But he will have to defend his seat against the Liberal Democrats, who will be eager for the chance to regain a foothold in south-west London, and who wish to make the byelection a vote on Brexit. The party has long opposed any runway expansion.On Wednesday, May faced hostile questioning from one of her own backbenchers at prime minister’s questions, although Labour did not address the issue. Tanya Mathias, the MP for Twickenham, cited worsening air pollution and noise and asked: “Does she agree that environmentally Heathrow is not good enough, and cannot possibly be bigger and better?”May said the government “looked very carefully at the air quality issues”, adding: “The evidence shows that air quality requirements can be met.”The new runway is not due to be built for about a decade but there will be significant local resistance before then as hundreds of houses will have to be demolished and nearby areas fear they will be blighted.Third Heathrow runway taxies to take-off | Letters The runway, which could be finished by 2025, would lead to almost 50% more planes over London, bringing new neighbourhoods under the flightpath. Protests and legal challenges against its construction are expected to focus on air quality, noise and Britain’s climate change commitments.Ministers sought to mitigate some of these criticisms by proposing a six and a half-hour break in scheduled night flights and more stringent night noise restrictions. The scheme will take the form of a draft national policy statement, open to consultation in the new year and subject to a vote in winter 2017-18.
