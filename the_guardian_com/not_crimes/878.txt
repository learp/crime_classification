I’ve been reading about Russell T Davies’s new adaptation of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, for which he was criticised because he dared to change Shakespeare. His seems a minor offence compared to what I’ve done in Vinegar Girl, my forthcoming adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew.I wasn’t so sure about the Shakespeare Project at first. Face it, his plots are terrible. But then I thought, “Well, at least I wouldn’t have to come up with one of my own.” That’s always been hard for me. And here the Hogarth series was saying, “Just help yourself to a ready-made plot and run with it.” It was sort of like a gift.As to why I chose that particular play: you know how sometimes a friend will tell you something that happened to her, and you think, “Wait, there must be more to it than that. I’m sure there’s another side to this.” Well, that’s how I’ve always felt about The Taming of the Shrew. It’s a most outlandish story. I thought maybe I could make it more believable. I could fill in a few details and tone down the exaggerations so that it would have some logic.I have to admit that I’ve been slow in coming to a true appreciation of Shakespeare. My first “Shakespeare moment” didn’t occur till I was in college. I had a friend who did something he was ashamed of and he told me that reading Shakespeare’s sonnet “When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes...” made him feel comforted and less alone. So really it was someone else’s Shakespeare moment, but still, it made me realise that Shakespeare could still have relevance.• Vinegar Girl is published on 16 June by Vintage at £16.99.
