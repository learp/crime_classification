A Cumbrian restaurant has been named the best in the UK in an influential guide that also features a motorway services and a bike shop cafe.The 2017 Good Food Guide awards Simon Rogan’s L’Enclume, in the village of Cartmel, a perfect 10 for a fifth time and names it the top restaurant for the fourth year running for the “soaring sophistication of Mr Rogan’s cooking”, noting the 17-course tasting menu which offers “clever elements of technical wizardry to keep the ‘oohs’ and ‘aahs’ going”. Rogan said: “It’s a huge achievement but could not happen without a massive team effort. For me, it’s a privilege to lead this outstanding group of people. “There’s no doubt that L’Enclume is approaching the most creative period in its history, and achieving the quality I dreamed of when I first opened its doors.” Hut cuisine: shed cafe enters the Good Food Guide The guide also awards a score of 10 to Restaurant Nathan Outlaw in Port Isaac, Cornwall, and places it second in the top 50, for its “first-class food and knowledgeable, welcoming service”. Restaurant Sat Bains in Nottinghamshire, Pollen Street Social in London and Hibiscus, also in London, all get scores of nine and take third, fourth and fifth place in the ranking respectively. Three restaurants housed in shipping containers feature in the guide: Cook House in Newcastle, Craftworks Street Kitchen in Truro, Cornwall, and Kricket in Brixton, London. The guide raves about the “modern marvel” that is the independently run Gloucester services on the M5, which includes a gourmet cafe committed to locally sourced food. Sarah Dunning, the chief executive of Westmorland Family, which owns Gloucester services, said: “Our motorway service areas champion interesting food from their locality and beyond and we are lucky to be able to connect many small, local food producers with the British travelling public.”       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Phillip Milner outside Shuck’s at the Yurt.
