The ultimate Valentine’s Day gift for that special Beatles fan in your life? No, not a box-set, a T-shirt or a Yellow Submarine salt and pepper set. How about pinging them on Skype with a branded animation voiced by Sir Paul McCartney?Well, it’s the thought that counts. And the thought that McCartney and Skype have had is that in 2016, the world is finally ready for “love-inspired Mojis” featuring the musician.Mojis, if they have passed you by, are a feature in Skype where you can send short video clips to friends within instant-message conversations. The BBC and The Muppets are among the partners so far providing clips.And now McCartney:      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Skype’s Paul McCartney Love Mojis.“We’ve coupled original Skype designs with unique musical compositions from Paul so you can always express your love to friends and family around the world, no matter what you’re trying to say,” explained Skype in a blog post announcing the partnership.This isn’t the first time McCartney has dabbled in the world of messaging customisation, however. In April 2015 he worked with messaging app Line on a range of “sound stickers” to be downloaded and used in people’s conversations. The sticker set was sold for 100 of Line’s virtual coins currency – the equivalent of £1.49.
