There are some successful literary careers that rest on mountains of books and others that don’t. Gillian Beer’s is one that doesn’t. It’s not that she hasn’t published, during more than half a century in academia; just that much of her writing has been essays, which have been collected into scholarly anthologies spanning the humanities and sciences.So to describe her recently published study of Lewis Carroll’s thought as long-awaited is an understatement. A 2003 book of essays published in her honour referred excitedly to her forthcoming work on Carroll, while a 2004 Guardian interview declared the book imminent. When I draw this to her attention, she does a passing imitation of the White Rabbit: “Oh dear! I was hoping you wouldn’t notice that.”Gillian Beer on A Conversation by Vanessa Bell Alice in Space: The Sideways Victorian World of Lewis Carroll sets the children’s classic in the intellectual wonderland of the late 19th century. Its anxieties about time, embodied in Alice’s first encounter with the White Rabbit and his fobwatch, are traced back to an age in which, as she writes, “space and time were … coming to be understood more and more as being in intricate and shifting relations, both locally and worldwide”.While scientists were dividing time into ever smaller units, with the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz measuring the speed of nerve impulses in tenths of seconds, the arrival of rail travel had only recently made it necessary for British time to be standardised at all. From noting this disjunction, the book sweeps us forward to the 21st century via the observation that, to this day, the bell in Carroll’s Oxford college – Christ Church – chimes 101 times at 9.05pm each night in honour of the old Oxford time.With an erudition and economy that is typical of Beer’s writing, such thought-clusters illuminate both the intellectual and geographic terrain that formed Carroll and the very English eccentricities that make his nonsense world so resonant a century and a half after the publication of Alice in Wonderland.Like many of Beer’s books, Alice in Space sits happily in the cracks between academic disciplines, dealing with history, literature, science, philosophy and some of the crunchier areas of mathematics. “I like the fact that Lewis Carroll can do things I can’t do, but within the compass of things that I’ve drawn together I think I can enhance people’s appreciation. I do know a lot about the intricate comings and goings of ideas,” she says. Her friend and collaborator Ali Smith beats her drum more loudly: “Gillian is one of the most open and most multidisciplinary of thinkers and writers. She’s an illuminator of the connection between the arts and the sciences, always revealing that they are not so far apart after all. She disproves the notion that dividing our thinking into categories is a good or useful way to go about thought and understanding.”In the book-strewn Cambridge house where 82-year-old Beer lives with her husband, the Romantics scholar John Beer, she cuts a benign, grandmotherly figure. But her kindness masks a formidable intellect. “Her students and colleagues are all familiar with her ability to pronounce the word ‘yes’ so flexibly as to register everything from delighted accord to a gritty determination to rescue something profitable from the unlikely materials in hand,” wrote her one-time PhD student Helen Small, now professor of English at Pembroke college, Oxford. Evolution, child-bearing, child-rearing all played together in my mind and my body … it was when it all opened out to me In her scholarship as well as in her personal life, Beer has always surrounded herself with friends and family. In Darwin’s Plots, her mould-breaking 1983 book about the impact of evolutionary theory on a wide range of 19th-century thought, she cited her observation of her son before he was three as evidence that human development was not instinctively perceived but a learned concept. “He would often say ‘when I’m a baby again’, or ‘Granny a little girl soon’, or ‘Daddy carry me till mummy gets bigger’.”It is not so far from that perception to Carroll’s Alice, who is always growing and shrinking and asking questions that appear to be silly but turn out to be unanswerable. The importance of “looking askance” is key to Beer’s work, according to Small, as is her use of the child’s perspective “as a way of displacing, and thereby questioning, our inherited assumptions about the world”.By happy coincidence, Beer shares a birthday with Carroll. Her first encounter with him was through a copy of Alice in Wonderland that she was given as a sixth birthday present, which she didn’t much like. A year later, she read Through the Looking Glass and loved it: “I can’t quite explain the difference.”She was living in Somerset at the time, the daughter of a divorced mother who been posted away from the family home in the East End of London to work as a village schoolteacher. She recalls “a harmonious childhood”, happily billeted in the home of a bricklayer’s family, with Gillian attending the local primary school, until she excelled in her 11-plus and the local authority began to question their living conditions. She was sent off to board at Sunny Hill school in the Somerset town of Bruton. “It was a perfectly good convent boarding school, but I was used to being alongside my mother and having lots of conversation with her, so I didn’t enjoy it very much,” she says.Gillian Beer in defence of rhyme At 14, she fell down a flight of stairsin the steep grounds surrounding the school and was sent home for six months to recover from a serious back injury. By that time, her mother was being kept busy as headteacher of the local school. “I just started to read: Ibsen and Oscar Wilde. I got one thing, then my ma would go to the library and get everything else they had written. I remember being very struck by Ghosts, which I didn’t really understand because I didn’t know about venereal disease, but I knew about people going mad in a cloistered life.” I’m a historical remnant from the great days of free education: I was carried through by the state When she returned to school, she had “made this extraordinary shift, with this packet of reading behind me”. It was years since Sunny Hill had sent anyone to university but, under tutoring from the playwright Robert Bolt, then working as a teacher, she won an exhibition to read English at St Anne’s, Oxford. She got her first academic job at London University’s Bedford College at the age of 24, and, having decided to get married to John Beer, who was based 150 miles away at Manchester University, “did the thing I had warned my students not to do: I decided to move.”Beer was pregnant with her first son, and on the point of taking a job at Liverpool university, when “this mysterious letter” arrived from Cambridge, offering her a research fellowship at Girton, a post she had applied for a year earlier. “I don’t want to construe my life romantically as this poor little girl who somehow managed to end up a dame and a professor, but at the same time all that happened,” she says. “I’m a historical remnant from the great days of free education: I was carried through by the state.”They went on to have two more sons. “That slowed me down but was so valuable: it was where a lot of my thinking came from: evolution, child-bearing, child-rearing all played together in my mind and my body, so, though I didn’t write a lot for five years, it was when it all opened out to me.”She was also doing a lot of teaching, and there was no maternity leave. “I remember going to talk to the then mistress of Girton and asking if I could have a little time off when my second baby was born in the middle of term, and she said why don’t you take a couple of weeks. It was meant extremely kindly. She was trying to find ways of collaborating.”Beer stayed at Girton for 30 years before moving on to be president of the Cambridge graduate college, Clare Hall. Some of her most important work was on Virginia Woolf, culminating in a 1996 essay collection, The Common Ground, which, typically, viewed her subject in the context of the political, social, philosophical and scientific shifts of knowledge in Woolf’s own lifetime. “She’s one of the reasons, along with the growth and nurturing of women’s studies courses in the academic institutions, that we have Virginia Woolf at all, as the great writer she is,” says Smith. “The seminars she held at Cambridge were legendary not just for this literal groundbreaking she was calmly doing, but for their own anomalousness at the time – for being hospitable, clever, inclusive and open in a place where this was pretty rare.”Dame Gillian Beer: Wrapped up in books She combined her Cambridge role with an increasingly international life, including stints at the Yale Centre for British Art and in the rhetoric department at the University of California, Berkeley. She became a fellow of the British Academy and a trustee of the British Museum, finding time to chair the Booker prize in 1997. Welcomed as a safe pair of hands after one of its periodic furores, when the novelist AN Wilson denounced the prize as “sleazy”, she ended up in charge of a controversial result. The jury chose Arundhati Roy’s debut novel The God of Small Things and failed to shortlist Ian McEwan’s Enduring Love. “We got lambasted. It was probably the time I’ve come most into public notice and had to decide that’s just how it goes: the assumption was that I’d only ever written about George Eliot, when of course I’d taught modern fiction all along. But out of awkward situations you sometimes get other things.”The “other thing” on this occasion was her discovery of Smith’s first novel, Lucky, which she mentioned in her speech at the Booker award ceremony. Smith turned out to be a Cambridge neighbour, and so began a 20-year friendship. “Ali has become one of the pleasures of my life,” she says.Alice in Space began life at a dinner party to celebrate a lecture series Beer had completed in Chicago. “I was handed an envelope with a contract in it, and I was so flattered, I signed it,” she says. She edited Jabberwocky and Other Nonsense in 2013, the first time anyone had researched and collected Carroll’s poetry. But it took a push from two former students to make her apply for the fellowship that would give her the funding to gather together the years of essays and research that form the basis of Alice in Space. “So much of life is caught in learning and I must thank many friends for their encouragement and their conversation,” she writes in the acknowledgements. True to form, the book is dedicated to her five grandchildren. “They all share Alice’s curiosity, and her goodwill.”• Alice in Space: The Sideways Victorian World of Lewis Carroll is published by University of Chicago Press.
