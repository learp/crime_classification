One of the newest and most unusual museums in the UK, Museum of the Mind, which opened only last year at Bethlem, one of the oldest mental hospitals in the world, has made the shortlist for the 2016 Museum of the Year award.The small museum in the handsomely converted former administrative building within the hospital grounds in Bromley, greater London, showcases both the unique historic collection, contemporary art installations and work by patients. It will be pitted against the giant V&A in London, which has won its place for its beautiful new European galleries and other projects, and the Arnolfini, a beacon for contemporary art on the Bristol harbourside since 1961, which has recently formed a creative partnership with the arts department of the University of the West of England.

Whether reaching audiences of thousands or millions, the best museums turn objects into culture, put audiences at the heart of their work and engage with issues of the moment.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The York Art Gallery reopened last summer after an £8m redevelopment.

It has moved three times: from Spitalfields in east London to nearby Moorfields, then to the site now occupied by the Imperial War Museum in Southwark, and in the 20th century to what was then farmlands and orchards on the outskirts of London.
