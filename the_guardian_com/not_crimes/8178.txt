Lady Leshurr: ‘They wanted to pit me against Nicki Minaj – I wasn’t feeling that’ Hello Lady Leshurr! As a punter, what do you like to see from a festival performance?I like to see people having a good time on stage. A lot of people don’t really look like they’re enjoying performing. But if they interact on a personal level it makes me feel like I know them in that moment, and that they’re my family. I just want happy vibes. And lights flashing. And flames.That escalated quickly. You used to work as security at festivals – can you spot people who are going to be aggro? Yeah. And you can see when someone’s totally smashed out of their head. A lot of people start drinking in the morning, early. When I did Glastonbury there were people throwing up in bins at 11am.You’re headlining a stage at Blissfields – what do you have planned? I’ve got a different set for every show I do. Different festivals have different genres. I’m supporting Red Hot Chili Peppers soon and I’m going to have a rock part in the set. I want to bring my energy and vibes from grime and infuse it with rock. Are you a fan of Red Hot Chili Peppers? YEAHHHH! When I was growing up the main rock people I listened to were Red Hot Chili Peppers, Linkin Park and Evanescence. Rock really inspired my sound. The melodies they use and the way they use their voices really inspire me. Californication was a big influence.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Vintage sock-rockers Red Hot Chili Peppers.

I was expecting to see a lot of black and Asian people but the majority of the crowd was white, and the fact that they enjoyed grime was amazing. There were a lot of mums and dads out there, too.Do you agree that if you haven’t fallen over at a music festival you haven’t really been to a music festival at all?I don’t think I’ve done a festival good, then. I’ve never fallen down yet.Is your album done yet? The album will be out at the end of this year but I don’t want to put a date on it. We need to find a good slot.Lady Leshurr: 'The industry just doesn't know what to do with women' Are you still developing a sketch show?    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Yes! I do all these funny characters on Snapchat – I’m going to expand on them. Also, I’m hoping to release a book this year. There are things I’d like to say to inspire younger girls. You’ll find out about my background and how I got into the scene, but it won’t all be about me. There’ll be scribbled notes and inspirational quotes. Why do people get so excited about summer when it’s obviously the worst season? Because it’s hot. People can show off their new summer bodies. A lot of guys do that. As soon as there’s a little piece of sun their tops come off. Everybody loves summer in London. They pretend it’s America.Do you not think autumn is better? You know what, I don’t even really like the sun to be honest. I stay in when the sun gets really hot. Did you go on holidays much when you were younger? No. My first holiday was when I was 18 – I went to Majorca with my friends. I’d always wanted to go. It was amazing. Have you seen the Inbetweeners film? It was like that. We had no idea what the hotel would be like and the coach pulled up outside what was basically a haunted house with loads of stray cats and flies everywhere. I had a great holiday, but I didn’t spend much time at the hotel.Lady Leshurr plays Field Day, 3 June, Blissfields, 6-8 July, Victorious festival, 25-27 August
