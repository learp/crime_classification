The running stylesUse your wits! Can you solve these fiendishly difficult puzzles? Constance and Daphne are running a marathon, which we take as being a race of exactly 26.2 miles. Constance runs the entire marathon at a constant speed of 8 minutes a mile. Daphne runs at different speeds, with fast spurts and slower sections, such that she covers every mile in 8 min 1 sec. In other words, whichever mile you take – the first mile of the course, the last mile or, say, the interval between 13.6 miles and 14.6 miles – Constance will run it in 8 minutes and Daphne will be a second slower. Is it possible that Daphne will win the race?• Can You Solve My Problems?
