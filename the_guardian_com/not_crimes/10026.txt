More should be done to encourage young black people to get into classical music, the winner of the BBC Young Musician competition has said. Sheku Kanneh-Mason: 'Classical music isn't elitist – the problem is it's expensive' Sheku Kanneh-Mason, a cellist from Nottingham, became the first black winner of the prize in May and has since landed a record deal with Decca Records. The 17-year-old is now calling for more music in schools and said he wants to inspire young black children. The comprehensive school pupil said: “When a lot of people imagine classical music they don’t picture much diversity so I think giving people the opportunity to see those role models would be great. I hope to inspire young black children to see classical music as something that they could possibly go into.”Kanneh-Mason, who plays in all-black and multi-ethnic orchestra Chineke! and is an ambassador for the music education charity London Music Matters, said that if more youngsters heard and were educated in classical music “then they would have role models to look up to”. The schoolboy became an overnight celebrity last year when he reached the semi-final of Britain’s Got Talent with his brothers and sisters as part of a classical music group. During their run in the competition Simon Cowell called them “the most talented family in the world” and Sheku’s brother Braimah has since gone on to record with electronic group Clean Bandit and has performed at the Mobo awards in Glasgow.
