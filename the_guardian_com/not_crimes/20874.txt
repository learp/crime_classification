The producer of ITV’s rather Mills & Boon drama, Victoria, was so particular about historical accuracy that the actress had to wear blue contact lenses and staff were tormented with post-production digital corrections (How producer’s eye for detail cost Victoria, 27 September).Ignoring the fact that Jenna Coleman is also ridiculously pretty to portray Victoria, what about her accent and the language spoken in court? Of German heritage, Victoria was brought up by a German nanny, speaking only German until age three. German was also said to be the preferred language in court. But perhaps the blended European royal family makes less good TV in the Brexit era?Danielle LowyManchester
