Patrick Monkhouse called the river Lathkill "one of those charming unscrupulous guests" who never arrives on time but is so pleasant that no one can imagine a party without them. A dry summer will see the upper section rudely disappear underground, but last week's rain had left it thick and sparkling in the late evening sunshine.And such water … It has a preternatural clarity, so that the weir-pools in the Lathkill's lower reaches seem empty, the trout suspended in thin air, the mallards paddling through space. Izaak Walton's young friend Charles Cotton, in later editions of The Compleat Angler, described the "Lathkin" as "the purest and most transparent stream that I ever yet saw … and breeds, it is said, the reddest and the best trouts in England."This fickle stream – burrowing through Derbyshire's prettiest dale, now thick with comfreys and the heavy scent of elder – has proved a little more reliable in recent years. Wetter summers are making up for the lack of winter snows, which used to feed the river into spring. Underground passages in the limestone, which can swallow a river, may have shifted as well.The water is sharply alkaline, with a pH value of over nine, and thanks in part to the water's purity – no phosphates here – the formation of tufa continues on the Lathkill when it has ceased on most other rivers. The Lathkill's brown trout are as special as the water. Philip White, who kept the river for the Haddon estate until the mid-1990s, said he had never seen fish like them. When young, they have greenish backs and white tips on their pelvic and anal fins. But it's the "distinct vermillion flash down the side" that is most striking.The air was thick with insects, and trout were feeding heavily as I passed by, twisting out of the river with a silver flourish, the crystalline water rippling out as a full moon rose over Conksbury bridge.
