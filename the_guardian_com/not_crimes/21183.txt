I opened this book and saw that it was written in the first person present. That always puts me off, but I continued. And I am so glad I did.This was a fantastic novel. The premise, a society where everyone must be perfect and those who are not are punished, has been done many, many times, but never quite in this way. Basically, if you make a mistake or do anything bad in this country, you get tried and branded when found guilty. The branded, or Flawed, are then allowed to live in society, but have many strict rules they must adhere to. I found this a great novel with a heroine who I like a lot. I will totally recommend this to everyone when it comes out, and I hope lots of people read it.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
