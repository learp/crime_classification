Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook has taken to national TV, Capitol Hill and his company’s shareholders’ meeting to try to persuade consumers that the iPhone maker is right in its privacy standoff with the US government. But buried in the transcript of a recent interview with Time magazine offers some key on-the-record insights Cook has not made before. Cook thinks there’s some gray area in helping authoritiesIn one interesting exchange, Time asks Cook about a hypothetical locked door. “Suppose on the other side of the door is the nuclear device that’s on a timer, or the child who’s being tortured. And you have a key to that door,” Time says, asking if he’d unlock it. Cook: “If I had a key to that door I would turn that door.”But he goes on to explain that the San Bernardino case is different because he effectively does not have a key to the iPhone used by gunman Syed Farook. The government, he says, effectively is asking Cook’s engineers to make a lock pick. For the government, that is a distinction without a difference. But for Apple and its lawyers, it is an effort to show that the company is not anti-law and order – it is just opposed to making new products for the government.He’s not enjoying thisIf you take him at his word, the head of America’s most valuable company is not relishing his standoff with the FBI and Barack Obama, who has sided with the Justice Department. “It feels very uncomfortable in some ways,” Cook says.At several points in the interview, Cook seems to make clear that he is not as much of a techno-libertarian as some of Apple’s supporters. He seems to think there is a middle ground that can be reached either in discussions with law enforcement or with setting new law in Congress. At one point he encourages lawmakers to “do something to empower the different intelligence arms to build out a set of capabilities, new capabilities, to do their roles [in] the modern world, and encryption being a part of that”. Time then asks: “That won’t mean you doing it [breaking encryption] for them?” Cook: “Correct.”Apple will become a bigger problem for the government going forwardThe company’s executives have previously suggested they are looking for ways to engineer their way out of future standoffs with the government. Cook more or less confirmed that on record in the Time interview, though he said his motive was to protect consumers, not annoy the FBI. Time: “Is the optimal path forward that you guys just engineer yourselves out of this loop?”Cook: “I think with every release we do, we have to go up. Because we have to try to stay one step ahead of the bad guys out there. The truth is that our security today will not be good enough for tomorrow. That’s true ... I would never do what you’re saying with the intention of doing that. Our intention is never anything to do with government, it’s to protect people. Is it a consequence of it? Yes, I mean over time you do more and more and more. That’s the road we’ve been on for a decade.”
