'You’re dead in two seconds': why do female stars over 40 agree to be in blockbusters? Charlize Theron has signed on to join the eighth instalment in the Fast & Furious franchise. The star, who plays an evil queen in this week’s Huntsman: Winter’s Tail, will continue her villainous streak with a role about which nothing is known apart from the fact she is a baddie. Returning stars include Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson and the last movie’s official villain: Jason Statham. The film will be released on April 14 2017, and is the first of a new trilogy taking the series forward following the death of leading man Paul Walker. Theron was first attached to the project in February. Earlier this week it was reported she is to reunite with Young Adult director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody for a film about motherhood.
