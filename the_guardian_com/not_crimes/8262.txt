Even in Spain, it seems, commemoration of Cervantes’s death in April 1616 is being overshadowed by the Shakespeare festivities centred on (more or less) the same day. Contrasting the ambition and scope of the programme marking the playwright’s quadricentennial with the half-heartedness of Cervantes 400 – sheepishly described by the culture ministry to the BBC as “a work in progress”, with some events only arriving in 2017 – the head of Spain’s Royal Academy lamented the lack of a “major gesture” and glumly noted that “we’ve had 400 years to prepare for this”.The UK has at least paid tribute in the form of the RSC’s stage adaptation of Don Quixote; but otherwise even London’s Cervantes Institute has shown only limited enthusiasm, gesturally marking the anniversary this month with a concert, exhibition and lecture but scarcely pushing the boat out.

Whether or not he can be called the father of the novel, he fathered the founding fathers of several traditions: the English novel (via Defoe), the comic novel (via Fielding), the metafictional novel (via Sterne), the German novel (via Goethe), the Latin American “boom” novel (via Borges) and arguably the historical novel (via Scott). “Polyphonic” and “encyclopedic” fiction start with him too, as does the trope of the comically disparate double act – today’s odd-couple duos in plays, films, stories or sitcoms ultimately descend from his delusional knight and Sancho Panza.Besides those mentioned, authors whose breakthrough or defining works are indebted to Don Quixote include Byron (Don Juan), Dickens (The Pickwick Papers), Melville (Moby-Dick), Dostoevsky (The Idiot), Twain (Huckleberry Finn) and Flaubert (Madame Bovary) - the last may superficially seem unlikely, but Flaubert was read Cervantes as a child and said “my origins are all in [that] book” and “whenever I analyse my inner core, I always find ... Don Quixote”.Cervantes’s power to inspire other authors has survived into the 21st century – recent fans of the Don include Salman Rushdie and Roberto Bolaño, who said “all writers who write in Spanish have or should have a Cervantean influence” – as has the role of his hero as a cultural symbol. Bernie Sanders has been caricatured as a windmill-tilting Quixote, and Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson have been dubbed (by David Aaronovitch) “the Don Quixote and Sancho Panza of British politics”.Still, the Spaniard is far from alone in being overshadowed, as John Sutherland and Stephen Fender show in calling 23 April “Death of Poets Day”. Besides the two giants, they point out in their literary compendium Love, Sex, Death and Words that Rupert Brooke, William Wordsworth, the metaphysical poet Henry Vaughan and the 18th-century versifier and translator Thomas Tickell (whose version of the Iliad was championed by Joseph Addison, riling rival Homer translator Alexander Pope) all passed away on that day. To which lineup can be added Peter Porter, who died on 23 April 2010, just too late for inclusion in the book.If births or deaths on the two days on either side, and writers in other genres, are added, the clustering around Shakespeare’s birthday and death day is even more striking. Leading authors born between 21 and 25 April also include Charlotte Brontë, - who has managed to escape Shakespeare’s shadow in the year of her bicentenary - Henry Fielding, Vladimir Nabokov, Anthony Trollope, Walter de la Mare, the Nobel prize-winning Icelandic writer Halldór Laxness, the Kiwi queen of crime Ngaio Marsh and the versatile and pioneering French writer Madame (Germaine) de Staël, a harbinger of romanticism who has been called “the first modern woman” – yesterday saw the 250th anniversary of her birth.Among further late-April casualties, meanwhile, are William Cowper, Thom Gunn and 16th-century Italy’s Torquato (Jerusalem Delivered) Tasso, plus Mary Poppins’s Australian creator, PL Travers, and French proto-Decadent Jules Barbey D’Aurevilly, who piquantly died on 23 April 1889, a few months away from the Naughty Nineties, when his dandyism and Poe-like mystery tales would become fashionable and seminal. What is it about poets and spring?
