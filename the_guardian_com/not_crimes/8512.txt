Congratulations to Michele Hanson for putting all your Momentum readers at ease (Still here, 9 February). At last someone who sees that we do not have two heads and could actually win the next election for Labour, if only we were reported on fairly. Milton said: “The sheep look up and are not fed.” This has too often been the case in our media, even in the Guardian. More Hanson please.John MyhillNorwich• You report (10 February) that 98 people were subjected to unprovoked attacks by sharks in 2015. This ought to be set against the astonishing figure of almost 100 million sharks killed per year, presumably in unprovoked attacks, many just for their fins.Joe CockerLeominster, Herefordshire• Chibundu Onuzu points out that “ethnic minority” reflects a parochial British viewpoint (Opinion, 10 February). A far more accurate reflection of the place of black and Asian people in the world is the term “global majority”.Henry StewartLondon• Not only did the form of Leicester City miraculously improve after the reburial of Richard III (Pass notes, 9 February), so that they are now favourites to win the title, but the other candidate for his burial place has had exactly the opposite experience. York City’s form has declined to the point where they are now at the other extreme – rock bottom of the Football League. “King power” indeed.Mike PainterYork• While Shakespeare never seems to have been on such intimate terms as to name his storms (Letters, 10 February), he did characterise them variously as dispelleted, black, hideous, contentious, fell, boisterous, pitiless, or even happy according to their moods.Austen LynchGarstang, Lancashire• If the “revised spelling list” produced by the Académie Française is not obligatory (Letters, 8 February), is the use of accents circumflexible?Roger WestGlasgow• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
