The sense of trepidation we felt when we climbed over the stile and set off towards Alston along the south bank of the river Nent proved to be ill-founded: the hay meadow was as beautiful as it had been on our last visit, more than a decade ago. More so, perhaps, because the spotted orchids, standing rigidly upright among swaying fescues, crested dog's tail and Yorkshire fog grasses, were too numerous to count. Purple shaving-brush heads of melancholy thistle marked the hollows in the meadow. Gullies, in which water trickled down towards the river, were traced by a pink ribbon of ragged robin that flowed into the white foam of meadowsweet, where they broadened into boggy deltas.But the main purpose of our visit was to look for grass of Parnassus, the county flower of Cumberland, which I'd last seen growing near the water's edge. After several wet winters, it might have been swept away when the river rose, but it was still there in abundance. The flower buds, like milky pearls held in the green clasp of its pointed green sepals, held aloft on a four-inch stalk, were still closed.Grass of Parnassus is a duplicitous plant, and not just because it is not a grass at all. But we needed to find an open flower to admire its most unusual feature. Eventually we located one whose alabaster petals had spread wide. The flower produces a nectar reward for insects when they land but has a belt-and-braces approach to competing for pollinators' attention, luring them with conspicuous false nectaries. And there they were, yellowish-green combs whose spherical tips mimicked glistening nectar droplets, arrayed between the stamens and the petals. We left with a feeling of satisfaction that this exquisite little flower was still thriving in these high Pennine meadows. @SeymourDaily• This article was amended on 20 July 2014. An earlier version said grass of Parnassus is a member of the saxifrage family.
