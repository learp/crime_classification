There are some things you follow with a gimlet-eyed focus: the waxing and waning fortunes of your favourite sports team, perhaps, or the return of the new series of that TV show that captivated you last winter. Sometimes it’s an interesting artist’s career (what are they up to these days?) that makes you stalk IMDb and Wikipedia restlessly. They are the ones who make your brain light up when you see they are working on a new project. These days, no one is making my brain light up more than writer-director Barry Jenkins.After I saw Jenkins’ debut feature film, I couldn’t shut up about it. Medicine For Melancholy (2008) is a black‑and-white film about the day-long romance between an African American couple in San Francisco that touches on gentrification and identity, which makes it sound more self-serious than it is. Why I love author Colson Whitehead Jenkins is unafraid of long silences in which actors just breathe, and his camera is by turns lingering and swift, a contrast that produces a feeling of intimacy. To wit: by the end of Tall Enough, a six-minute short he made in 2009, I felt entirely connected with his characters. To call his films important makes them sound dour and worthy, but they never feel that way. They are just sincere and beautifully shot.Jenkins’ quiet-but-powerful style is in full bloom in his new film, Moonlight (based on a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney), which tenderly explores black masculinity. There are Oscar whispers already. They may soon turn into shouts.
