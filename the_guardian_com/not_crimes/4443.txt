It is good to learn that on beaches on the other side of the Channel the safety of bathers is assured (Letters, 30 August). No doubt after the string of fatalities on this side the government will make it a statutory obligation for local authorities to provide similar measures. But, as with all the other obligations heaped on our cash-strapped local bodies, this will come neither with extra resources nor the flexibility to raise them through raising council tax levels. One day people might realise that if you vote to cut taxes you might be voting to cut your life expectancy.Paul GarlandSaffron Walden, Essex• Noting the arrival of a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene (Report, 30 August): in view of our headlong rush towards the abyss, surely “Gadarene” would be more appropriate?Richard MartinSutton Benger, Wiltshire• Will the Anthropocene epoch be nasty, brutish and short?Ekkehard KoppHull• Yet another complaint about ingredients in Yotam Ottolenghi’s recipes (Letters, 30 August). I appreciate being introduced to new ingredients such as pomegranate molasses and sumac. His book Plenty is one of the best cook books I’ve ever had. His ability to season dishes is second to none. Leave off Yotam.Libby BernardMaidstone, Kent• Influenced by recent letters, I have started to use Google and other websites when attempting the cryptic crossword. The improvement in my completion rates almost matches the way my snooker scores shot up when I stopped using the cue and started popping balls into the pockets with my hands.Mike HineKingston upon Thames• Never mind those who struggle with the cryptic crossword. Figuring out the quick crossword these days is nigh on impossible. What’s going on?Susan HeadLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
