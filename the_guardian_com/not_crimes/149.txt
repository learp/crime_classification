Police and emergency services were this afternoon hunting a large shark at Clarkes beach at Byron Bay that killed a local 50-year-old swimmer. The man, whose name has not been released, was swimming in the shallows on the eastern side of Byron Bay’s main beach when he was attacked. At a press conference at Clarkes beach this afternoon, Tweed-Byron Inspector Bobbie Cullen said that at approximately 10:45am, police were called after a man was dragged from the water with severe injuries to his right leg. “He was a Byron Bay local on his own swimming, and his wife was on beach at the time of the attack,” said Cullen.Witnesses told Guardian Australia that the woman appeared to be in a highly distressed state as paramedics and police attended the scene.A man, who police did not identify, tried to save the swimmer by dragging him from the water and onto the sand, but he died at the scene. “The man showed extraordinary bravery in trying to rescue the victim,” said Cullen.Newcastle lawyer, Mark Hickey, was identified by News Corp as the manwho tried to rescue the swimmer. He told a reporter he rushed into thewater to help the man.He said he saw a six-or-seven foot shark menacing the victim.“I saw what looked like seaweed but it was blood in the water,” he said, adding that it was likely that the victim died in the water.“The shark came back to him and had another go. I didn’t know it was a person but when I realised I ran out and waded to the bank and grabbed him and did CPR but it was too late.”According to New Corp, the victim was brought back to the beach on a surf ski but could not be saved.Lifeguards spotted a shark in the water off the beach, believed to be a great white.Channel Nine news tweeted photographs of the shark.Helicopter footage showed the shark to be swimming close to the shore. Police erected a tarpaulin around the man and sealed the area with crime scene tape.Cullen said police and Lifesaving Australia acted quickly to shut the beach down. But the signs on the beach were spaced far apart and did not indicate the reason for the beach closure. Backpackers Rafi Mitchell and his friend Steven Miller said: “We didn’t see any signs about the shark attack and jumped in but we thought it was really strange that we were the only people swimming.”They were later warned to come in from the beach by another tourist. Life-saving season is not due to start in Byron Bay until next week, meaning that the beach was unpatrolled. Guardian Australia spoke to local man, Richard Buxton, 70, who was walking along the shore in black speedos and a pink swimming cap, who was still keen to swim. “The odds of someone else getting attacked now are very small. That there’s been a shark attack will not stop me from swimming,” he said.“It’s not the sharks fault,” Buxton added before looking around at the closed beach and the choppers flying low overhead. “But I don’t think I’ll go in now.”The police were hoping to “chase” the shark from the beach rather than cull it. “If it is a great white it is protected and we follow procedures,” said Cullen.The police said they were not aware of previous shark sightings in the area and were in the process of notifying the man’s family. Meanwhile the sun shone in Bryon Bay after a fortnight of poor weather, yet the water remained empty and two search helicopters flew low overhead.Byron Bay local Sally Howell said: “Everyone is shaken. We are waiting for his name to be released. The beach is a crucial part of life here and the bay was always seen as one of the safest places to swim. We are all just in shock.”The last fatal shark attack in the area was in 1993.Police are preparing a report for the coroner.
