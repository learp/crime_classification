Michael Bublé’s wife, Luisana Lopilato, has said their son is recovering and well in her first public comments since the couple announced last year that the three-year-old had cancer. The Canadian singer and Lopilato, an Argentinian actor, have returned to her home country after Noah, their eldest son, had medical treatment in Los Angeles. Speaking at a press conference in Buenos Aires for her latest film on Monday, Lopilato, 29, thanked those who had offered their support to the family. She told reporters: “When things like those that happened to us occur, your take on life changes. It happened to us. Now I value life much more, the now and the today. Thank God, my son is well.”She went on: “It’s difficult for me to speak about this. It’s very recent and I’m still a bit sensitive about the subject. But the love is daily, when people stop me in the street. It’s wonderful to know that you’re accompanied in life and that people love you.” Bublé, 41, and Lopilato put their careers on hold following the diagnosis, but she said seeing Noah “grow and being happy” gave her the strength to finish her forthcoming film, Those Who Love, Hate. Noah was diagnosed in November 2016. Earlier this year the couple released a statement on Facebook saying he was “progressing well” and doctors were optimistic about his future.
