He shot to fame when he appeared in the film They Met in Moscow, on which shooting began shortly before the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Filming was interrupted when Zeldin, who was then 26 and playing an illiterate shepherd who wins the heart of a beautiful swineherd, was sent to the front. But he was recalled on Stalin’s orders to finish shooting the film.When the war finished, Zeldin joined Moscow’s Red Army Theatre, where he was part of the troupe from 1945 until his death. The theatre is now known as the Russian Army Theatre. Fellow actors at the theatre described him as full of energy until the very last.
