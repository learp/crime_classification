A neighbour tells me that I ought not to hang up fat or fix nuts for the birds, because it makes life too easy for them and disaccustoms them to use their wits. This has forced me to admit that it is not so much my object to assist evolution in the development of bird-minds as to secure for myself the pleasure of seeing birds as they are now. It is just a year to-day since my nuts attracted the willow tit, a species so elusive as to have escaped the notice of ornithologists till within a few years ago. My friend was glad to share the pleasure of watching this lovely little creature at close quarters, and his anxiety to know whether the willow tit is among my callers this year again commits him, I consider, to connivance in my temptations to decadence. I doubt, as a matter of fact, whether the results are as he supposes. If it was common to find nuts hanging in trees by a string, all birds, I fancy, would soon develop the agility and clinging power of tits. The sparrows round the house here are already noticeably cleverer and more acrobatic than they were two years ago.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Manchester Guardian, 18 February 1915.
