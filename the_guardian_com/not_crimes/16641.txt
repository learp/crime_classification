Readers’ picture desk is a new series where our picture editors set a topical theme and choose the best of your photos to publish in an online gallery every two weeks. This week’s theme is “empowerment”. It could be something you’ve witnessed at a protest march, or something more abstract. However you choose to interpret, we’re looking forward to seeing your images.Our picture editors will also share with you what they admire about the photographs they’ve chosen to display in the gallery, as well as highlight some of the skills necessary to develop as a photographer – and will enjoy seeing your progress along the way. You have until Thursday 23 March to upload your images. We will publish the gallery for this assignment on Monday 27 March and set our next theme on the same day.You can see the galleries we’ve produced so far here.What makes a good photograph?Click here to see some advice on this from Fiona Shields, the Guardian’s head of photography.
