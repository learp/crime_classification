Prepare yourselves and talk to each other. Most people want to sleep with people who are kind, happy, funny, physically attractive – whatever made you fancy each other in the first place. Hopefully, you still tick each other’s boxes – no, that’s not a euphemism. Tell them they are the bee’s knees. Tell them again. Keep telling them. This is important.Forget spontaneity. Happy, gorgeous couples getting it on in unlikely and exotic locations are fictional or on reality TV. You need to plan this stuff in the same way that a trip to the shops with a newborn looks like you’re off on holiday. Ignore all the well-intentioned nonsense about how sex shouldn’t be a habit. It really, really should become a habit – a good one.If you want spontaneity – and can afford it – leave. Together, obviously. Get someone who likes fish fingers and Andy Day from CBeebies to look after your kids for a weekend and go somewhere on your own. You can get plastered and remember what it feels like to snog each other drunkenly. Hopefully, it feels nice. You might even have sex. Possibly not in a bed.Go to bed together. There’s no point whingeing that you don’t have sex if you don’t put yourselves in the same place at the same time. That means actually going to bed at the same time. There’s nothing more dispiriting than waiting hopefully in the sack while someone’s still downstairs de-fleaing the dog.Fit locks on the bedroom door. There’s nothing worse for a flagging libido than the sound of tiny feet approaching.Set the, ahem, love alarm. OK, so the heady days of morning sex seem like a long time ago. But, with a bit of willpower, you can bring them back. Wake up half an hour earlier and embrace the quickie.Distraction. An hour of the Clangers on a Saturday morning while you and your other half lag the pipes upstairs in the loft – yes, that is a euphemism – is totally appropriate for the sake of your relationship.If all else fails, remember the joy of snogging. If anyone’s feeling a bit self-conscious about her post-baby body or having eaten nothing but takeaways since the nipper turned up, and can’t cope any more, just have a fumble.
