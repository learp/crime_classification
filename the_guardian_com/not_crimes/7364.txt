Is it healthy for children to see their parents row? Yes, according to Fern Britton, who has spoken out in favour of couples arguing in front of their children. “TV presenter believes it is good for offspring to witness arguments as it shows them how ‘real’ relationships work”, says a Daily Mail headline over an article in which Briton says that couples who don’t row are “boring”, and that she is glad her children witness this normal part of a “real” relationship.​'​Sick​ and​ asphyxiating​'​​ – why we live in an age of anxiety However, in 35 years of clinical practice, I’ve not seen the benefits to which she refers. The results I’ve seen include increased anxiety, impulsivity and selfishness, and a lack of good problem-solving skills. We can’t know the exact kind of rows Britton has in her own household, but the article mentions quarrels, rows and arguments. If those are indeed what she means, then I definitely disagree that children (or any onlookers) benefit from witnessing such events. I don’t think the couple benefits, either.Of course there will be disagreements in any relationship. No two people are alike, so they’ll never share exactly the same outlook on every issue. Disagreements are indeed “real”, and negotiations and compromise are the reality when people try to live together harmoniously – that’s not in question. However, the key to a healthy relationship, one where problems get solved and one that benefits the children, is how disagreements are handled, not whether they exist.When we let ourselves become angry, or engage in “heated” exchanges, we’re allowing ourselves to be totally and utterly selfish. We give ourselves permission to release negative emotion without regard to the effect it will have on anyone watching. We don’t mind if we hurt the person with whom we’re arguing – in fact we may deliberately wish to do so. And we aren’t trying to solve the problem that gave rise to the argument in the first place, because we can’t be rational problem-solvers when we’re overwhelmed by emotion.When couples argue in front of their children, there are four messages the children take away. First, they see that their parents are either not well able to control their emotions, or they don’t care if the negativity they’re releasing distresses anyone watching them. This can make them feel anxious and unimportant.Second, there’s no need to bother with self-control, because it’s more important to release your own discomfort immediately, never mind when it is or where you are. This will encourage children to act impulsively rather than rationally.Third, responding to your own discomfort immediately is more important than thinking about how to solve the problem that upset you. This suggests that children don’t need to think long-term when they’re challenged.And last, it doesn’t matter if you think only of your own needs and ignore the discomfort of others. This will encourage children to behave selfishly, and may limit the friendships they can keep.Parents are children’s first role models, and their most important ones. You’ve no doubt heard it said that when it comes to influencing your children, what you do counts for more than what you say. These are true words.
