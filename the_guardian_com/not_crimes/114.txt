Nature’s Greatest Dancers 8pm, EdenYes, it appears that the makers of much-memed nature docs have officially decided to cut out the middleman, matching footage of animals to a pop soundtrack and calling it dance. Steve Backshall presents the mating rituals of birds of paradise, lemurs and more, set to songs by the likes of Ed Sheeran and Michael Jackson. Mildly entertaining, but really the sort of thing that’s better suited to a ident than an entire programme. Hannah J DaviesThe Moorside 9pm, BBC1Second and concluding part of the docudrama re-examining the headline-grabbing but ultimately bogus 2008 abduction of nine-year-old Shannon Matthews from the Moorside estate in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. Sheridan Smith is reliably great as Julie Bushby, the dogged local organiser belatedly realising something is awry, but even more impressive is Gemma Whelan (AKA fearless Yara Greyjoy from Game of Thrones) as Shannon’s increasingly wretched mother. Graeme Virtue Andrew Marr: My Brain and Me 9pm, BBC2Last year, Marr handled “the biggest story I’ve ever covered” (the Brexit vote and its fallout), worked on a new book and two documentaries – in addition to his weekly TV and radio shows. Not bad going for someone at the brink of death just a few years ago. In this personal story, he charts his recovery from a major stroke, returns to the hospital that saved his life and explores some of the mysteries of the old grey matter. Ali CatterallSecret Life of Dogs9pm, ITVNarrated by Martin Clunes, this gentle dog-umentary series isn’t without interesting titbits. Tonight’s episode focuses on working hounds, revealing that chihuahuas are now favoured as sniffer dogs due to their size and startling sense of smell. There’s also the remarkable story of Holly, whose pooch has learned to monitor her blood sugar levels as she sleeps. Cloyingly cutesy in places, but if you’re looking for confirmation that dogs really are our best friends, it does its job. Phil HarrisonLife of a Mountain: A Year on Blencathra 9pm, BBC4Filmmaker Terry Abraham returns to the Lake District, following last year’s study of Scafell Pike. This is another beautifully photographed meditation on the mountain and the people who live on and around it, through all four seasons. The shots of clouds drifting across a sumptuous landscape are interwoven with the wry reflections of locals. However, the insertion of celebrity climbers Ed Byrne and Stuart Maconie feels jarring and unnecessary. Andrew MuellerGrimm 9pm, WThe supernatural drama returns for its sixth and final series, and we begin with the aftermath of a bloodbath. Naturally, this is bound to lead to questions – and so it proves, as show hero Nick (David Giuntoli) finds himself in more danger. Quite what else is going on is likely to confuse newbies, but it involves a mysterious stick, a corpse that’s really not keen on leaving life behind, and a collection of strange symbols on a cloth. Diverting enough hokum. Jonathan Wright The Great British Skinny Dip 10pm, Channel 4Andrew Welch is the public face (and more besides) of British naturism. Faced with dwindling numbers and a perception of naturists as everything from dangerous (not fair) to a bit on the elderly side (not unfair), he’s on a mission to raise awareness of naturism as a fun, liberating way to spend your leisure time. Welch is a great advocate for the cause, and his “skinny dip” initiative is well thought out. But will the weather hold? John Robinson Film choiceMy Beautiful Laundrette (Stephen Frears, 1985) 1.20am, Film4An incisive portrait of Thatcher’s Britain, as seen through the eyes of a gay Asian entrepreneur. Gordon Warnecke plays the young lad who, with the help of chum-turned-lover (and ex-National Front, to boot) Daniel Day-Lewis, turns a dreary south London laundrette into neon-lit Powders.
