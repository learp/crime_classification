It's not yet lights out: Republicans have revived their effort to crush energy-saving lightbulbs, with a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Friday.Just days after losing their effort to repeal a law promoting more efficient lighting, Republicans – who claim the new standards are an assault on personal freedom – have revived their effort.The latest offering, put forward by the Texas Republican Michael Burgess, would seek to tack an amendment onto a broader bill cutting funds for environmental protection.Like the original, the bill to hinder the take-up of energy-saving bulbs would stop the federal government from enacting the provisions of a 2007 law raising efficiency standards of incandescent bulbs by 25%, starting from 2012. But it would not block city or state governments from promoting energy-saving lighting.Republicans – including presidential contender Michele Bachmann – have championed the cause of old-fashioned 100-watt bulbs as a fight for personal freedom and the legacy of Thomas Edison, who invented it.But a first attempt to get rid of the usurper – energy-saving LED and CFLs – was defeated in the House of Representatives on Tuesday night.The bill fell short of the two-thirds majority needed under rules invoked by the Republicans for speedy passage. However, it did get a majority, and Joe Barton, who has been leading the charge of the Republican light brigade, vowed then he would be back."We can put it on an appropriations bill," he told the US politics website Politico. "We can back it under a rule. I can try and go to some of the Democrats who didn't vote for it and figure out a way to get them to consider voting for it in a different format."Burgess told Politico he believed his bill had a better chance tacked onto a bigger spending measure.At the time, the 2007 law on lightbulbs and other energy measures was backed by prominent house Republicans and signed into law by George Bush.Tea Party conservatives, however, now cast it as a sign of government overreach by Barack Obama.But not all Republicans are on board. Politico reported this week that the House Republicans demand for cuts on environmental spending risked alienating the hunters who are a core constituency.Meanwhile, a group called Republicans for Environmental Protection called the focus on light bulbs an embarrassment to the party.The House's defeat this week of bizarre legislation to turn back the clock on lighting efficiency was a victory for the economy, the environment, and common sense, Republicans for Environmental Protection said."We regret that Congress was forced to waste its time voting on a foolish bill that was premised entirely on false claims and ignorance," David Jenkins, an REP official, said in a statement."Members of Congress and talk radio entertainers who knowingly peddled this falsehood and misled consumers are a national embarrassment and ought to be ashamed of themselves."
