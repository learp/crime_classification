Green-minded individuals looking for potential returns of as much as 9% a year, and who are prepared to take some risks with their money, are being targeted by a range of new investment schemes.These include one launched this week that aims to raise £2.75m to help finance a community solar project near Bristol that is expected to generate enough energy each year to power 1,160 homes.Locally run green energy schemes have been one of the ethical investment success stories of recent years. However, those thinking of signing up need to be aware there are risks attached, and some will take the view that a safer bet would be an ethical fund investing in many different companies.The scheme to raise £2.75m has been launched by Chelwood Community Energy, a “community benefit society” (similar to a co-operative) that plans to install a 5MW ground-mounted solar array on “low grade” farmland next to the village of Chelwood in Somerset. According to the share offer document, the scheme has all the required permissions, will benefit from a guaranteed 20-year income stream through the government’s feed-in tariff, and should eventually generate up to £1.2m to fund local projects such as high speed broadband for the village.One local resident who supports the scheme is Helen Pudsey-Dawson, mother of Phoebe, four, and Amelie, 18 months, who rents a house on the farm where the land is. She says: “I believe there have to be alternative sources of power. This one in particular is a very sensible site. Also, the community benefits from this venture.”Chelwood Community Energy has teamed up with ethical bank Triodos on the investment scheme, which will pay members a 5.5% gross interest rate in year one (the rate then increases in line with RPI inflation). The society is projecting an overall return of 9.2% per year over the project’s 25-year life once you include Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) tax relief, assuming RPI of 2.5% a year. EIS relief allows investors to reclaim income tax on their investment at a rate of 30%.However, the offer document says this “should be seen as a long-term investment” and adds that “you may not get back the full amount you invested”. Crucially, investors’ cash is not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The minimum investment is £500 and the offer closes on 31 July.At the other end of the UK, another share issue aims to raise £150,000 by 31 July to deliver superfast broadband to hundreds of homes and businesses along the South Tyne Valley. Cybermoor Networks, the co-op behind the venture, aims to pay members a minimum of 4% interest, plus EIS tax relief. The minimum investment is £100.Meanwhile, two other schemes have gone live on ethical investment platform Abundance, which claims to deliver bank-beating returns by allowing people to put money into renewable energy projects. One scheme is seeking up to £700,000 and is offering an effective rate of return of 8%-9.1% over the 20-year life of the investment, linked to the profits from the Hinton wind turbine project in South Gloucestershire.The other involves roof-mounted solar PV systems installed on houses in north-east England under the green deal and is seeking between £600,000 and £1.9m, with a quoted effective return of 7% over a 19-year period.
