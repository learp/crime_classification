When it comes to quality drama, we’ve never had it so good. But the latest age of peak TV has coincided with the rise of a very different kind of storytelling. One played out on news channels rather than Netflix. The practitioners are ideological fabulists – your Trumps, your Milos, your Nuttalls – and while they might lack basic craft, intellectual rigour and moral discipline, when it comes to telling their tall tales they are worryingly prolific in their attempts to own the narrative. When real life is wilder than Westworld, how can TV compete?Joe Ahearne, the writer and director behind BBC1’s recent workplace thriller The Replacement, has witnessed the rise of alt-truth in public life with relatable exasperation. The Replacement’s ultra-capable antagonist Paula (Vicky McClure) may have created her own reality, Trump-style, to cope with buried trauma but Ahearne insists there is an integrity to the character that Potus and his fellow freewheeling fibbers lack. Her most audacious fiction – pretending to colleagues that her daughter is still alive – seems more like an extreme coping mechanism in the face of impossible grief than an extension of her office Machiavellianism.The Replacement review: just when you thought it was safe to go on maternity leave … “Paula was distorting reality in a way that, initially at least, wasn’t hurting anyone,” says Ahearne. “That is quite different from people who don’t really care what the truth is. It’s the difference between lying and bullshitting. Trump is a bullshitter – he’s just saying what he wants in that particular moment and has no fidelity to it.” That distinction goes to the heart of what good storytelling is about. “Great drama comes from when you have two irreconcilable viewpoints, then there’s a battle and somebody wins. But what’s happening now is that facts seem to be irrelevant. Reality is at stake.”If a war for reality in life is looming, prestige TV might actually help us to win it. Dr James Walters, senior lecturer in film and television studies at the University of Birmingham, believes mass engagement with quality drama, be it convoluted thrillers such as Homeland and Line of Duty or cryptic mindbenders like The OA and The Kettering Incident, could better equip us to dismantle the counter-narratives floated by political opportunists. “These shows have qualities that actually encourage viewers to really concentrate and evaluate the behaviours of individuals and organisations on-screen,” he says. “You might think Homeland and 24 are more sympathetic to agendas Trump is trying to push – these ideological binaries like immigrants versus US citizens – but what they’re often also doing is questioning the behaviours and attitudes of people in authority. As audiences, we have got into the habit of enjoying analysing and interrogating things onscreen.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Glass animal … Brit Marling as Prairie Johnson in The OA. Photograph: JoJo Whilden/NetflixIt is possible to be transfixed or delighted by unreliable narrators on television while being disgusted by those same behaviours in real life. If anything, it feels as if we can often hold the creators of fiction to a higher standard than those seeking power. Not everyone was beguiled by Netflix’s knotty drama The OA, in which Brit Marling’s spacey survivor Prairie unpacked her eventful life story to a schoolkid gang that convened at midnight. But even if viewers had their doubts about Prairie’s story, they could plausibly believe her mini-cult would hang on her every word. “I think there is something really delicious in the mystery about questioning the storyteller’s truth,” Marling told Variety. “The place it kind of ultimately arrives at is that it maybe doesn’t matter as much the details are true, because there’s some essential core that she’s imparting that smacks of honesty.” Hopefully all the commentators who got angry when The OA merely hinted at a Dallas-style, it-was-all-a-dream climax are also poised to hold politicians’ feet to the fire.“Writers know TV audiences will call them out on things; there would be a backlash and ratings would suffer if stuff wasn’t right,” says Walters. He is worried that we have transitioned into an era where writers of fiction care more about depicting reality than politicians. “That flipping of who is more committed to historical fact, we should definitely be troubled by that.” He also thinks our current political volatility and unpredictability will affect some shows more immediately than others. “This is a difficult moment for House of Cards or even Veep where the satire or parody is suddenly too close to the thing itself,” says Walters. “What will be interesting to see is how that seeps into other programmes that explore hierarchical structures and political power. Game of Thrones presents a wild version of political leadership. Well, we’re now actually living in a wild version of political leadership, so where do you go from there?”The Kettering Incident review – Tasmania’s answer to Twin Peaks Victoria Madden, co-creator of Sky Atlantic’s atmospheric teen abduction mystery The Kettering Incident, has also been thinking about how and why we lie a lot. The Kettering Incident’s viewpoint character Anna (Elizabeth Debicki) is a fastidious London-based doctor trying to conceal mysterious blackouts, one of which rather unexpectedly deposits back to her childhood home of Tasmania. She is a truly lost soul and another TV character, like Paula, who uses altered realities as a coping mechanism. “We tell ourselves stories when the truth is too frightening to bear,” says Madden. “But the problem with a lie is that it covers the issues that created them in the first place but doesn’t resolve them. Lying becomes addictive. When we meet Anna, her lies have become part of the fabric of her life.” Can Madden see any parallels between Anna’s means of psychological comfort and the rather more opportunistic approach of the rising new political class attacking #fakenews? “I feel that people who lie do so ultimately for acceptance,” she says. “They are afraid and insecure – and no matter how successful they may become, deep inside is the vulnerable child. The problem is, when you lie, you are covering up pain and, like medicine, while lying can help temporarily, the illness doesn’t necessarily go away.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Elizabeth Debicki as Dr Anna Macy in The Kettering Incident. Photograph: Ben KingBut might Trump and his fellow bloviators have some applicable insight that might make them decent TV writers, able to conjure up a convincing unreliable narrator? Madden is having none of it. “As a writer, at least one of the skills required is to be able to delve into the psychology of a character without judgment,” she says. “You must be able to defend them even when they hold opposing views and beliefs to you and give them the space in which to tell their story. So no, definitely not.”As our screens are flooded with political opportunism it feels as if well-crafted dramas – even those featuring unreliable narrators – might offer a place of psychological sanctuary. Escapism doesn’t have to be mindless. It can offer useful emotional respite. It may even be helpful to flatter Trump into thinking he could transition from Potus to showrunner, applying his dubious post-fact storytelling to prestige drama. Walters has the perfect pitch: “Perhaps we should encourage him to resurrect Lost? You could film it on a desert island and try and get him to stay on location.”The Replacement is available on BBC iPlayer; The Kettering Incident is available on Now TV
