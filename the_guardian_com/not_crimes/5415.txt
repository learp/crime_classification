Severe cuts to public libraries have taken a toll on visitor numbers, which show a drop of almost a third over 10 years, according to the latest government data.Despite ministerial pledges to halt the decimation of library services, the report from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport found that the number of adults who had visited a public library in the 12 months to the end of September 2016 fell to 33.8%, from 48.2% 10 years earlier.Of the four cultural sectors surveyed in a new Taking Part report on adult engagement in culture, libraries were the only sector to suffer a steady and severe decline in visitor numbers over the 10-year period. Between October 2015 and September 2016, 33.8% of adults used a public library service, the report revealed, a 29.8% drop compared to 2005/06 numbers. “The proportion of adults who use a public library service has decreased almost every year since the survey began in 2005/06, when it was 48.2%,” it said.Library campaigners have slammed the figures, saying they illustrate the need for serious action to save the sector, which has been hit by branch closures and reduced opening hours as local authorities seek to shore up holes in social care budgets.Desmond Clarke, former director of Faber & Faber and leading critic of cutbacks to services, said the figures show the government-appointed Libraries Taskforce needed to focus on improving book stock. “The Taskforce needs to take its head out of the sand and properly research all the reasons why so many have stopped using libraries and then work with chief librarians and the Arts Council England to put in place an effective plan to reverse the decline,” he said.Nick Poole, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Librarians and Information Professionals (Cilip) said: “In an age where there is a great need to arm the population with information and opportunities, these figures warn us that it’s time to stop talking about the dismantling of library services and instead to demand action.”He pointed to a national leadership strategy put forward by his members that includes emergency funding and transitional support to ensure libraries can meet their statutory obligations under the 1964 Libraries and Museums Act, as well as full public consultation before cuts are passed by councils.“We’ve put a solution on the table that can deliver the transformation and efficiencies needed to sustain library services nationally and the government has ignored it,” he said. “If they continue to look away, the picture of library use will keep worsening and the electorate will carry the implications into whatever world is waiting for us post-austerity and post-Brexit.”The Society of Chief Librarians defended its members role, saying the decline was offset by an increase in digital resources provided by the sector. “While physical library visits among people over the age of 16 have declined, we have seen a boom in the number of visits to library websites, which provide a range of online resources including ebooks, e-magazines and a range of information in areas such as benefits, citizenship, jobs, health and wellbeing,” a spokeswoman said, pointing to an increase in adults’ online visits, from 8.9% in 2005/05 to 13% in September 2016. The data sheds light on the groups most reliant on their local libraries. Though a smaller proportion of users from lower socio-economic groups used libraries – 29.7% compared to 35.9% of the upper socio-economic group – usage by minorities and disabled people was proportionally higher than in the rest of the population: 43.9% of adults in the black and minority ethnic population used public libraries, compared to 32.4% of white adults. The same pattern was repeated among disabled adults: 35.3% of disabled adults used libraries, compared to 33.2% of those adults with no disability or long-standing illness.Library campaigners present 'innovative agenda' to rescue struggling sector The data was released as more councils raided library budgets to save money. On Wednesday, protesters gathered outside libraries in Bath in a bid to stop local libraries being handed over to volunteers and parish councils. The move, which would also see the relocation of the central library, would save Bath and North East Somerset council £800,000 a year, or £2.4m of its targeted £37m savings by 2020.Dionne Pemberton of the Bath Save Our Libraries campaign described the closure of the central library as “a colossal misuse of public funds”. “The council proposes spending £6m to relocate the library, for savings of £800,000 across the whole district that will not go into effect until 2021,” she told the Guardian. Accusing the council of failing to properly consult on the plan, she added: “The city is reeling, faced with losing a treasured community space and feeling shut out by our elected representatives.” • This article was amended on 3 February 2017. Bath and North East Somerset council is planning to relocate Bath’s central library, not close it as an earlier version said.
