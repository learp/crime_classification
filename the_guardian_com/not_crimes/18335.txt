Today, more than ever, it feels like we need to stand up for democracy, for fairness and equality, for our basic human rights.“We feel Jeremy Corbyn’s realigning of the Labour party towards the principles of social justice and wealth distribution, which the party was founded on, affords the best opportunity to improve everybody’s lives.“By inviting a broad range of acts, not all of whom are known for being overtly political, to play in support of this under the banner of People Powered, we are saying: Speak out! Get involved! Fight for what you believe in! Make your voice heard! Everyone can make a difference!”
