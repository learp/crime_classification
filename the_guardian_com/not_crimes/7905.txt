In the StudioIs it March, spring, winter, autumn, twilight, noonTold in this distant sound of cuckoo clocks?Sunday it is – five lilies in a swoonDecay against your wall, aggressive flocksOf alley-starlings aggravate a mood.The rain drops pensively. ‘If one could paint,Combine the abstract with a certain rudeIndividual form, knot passion with restraint …If one could use the murk that fills a brain,Undo old symbols and beget againFresh meaning on dead emblem … ’ so one liesHere timeless, while the lilies’ withering skinAttests the hours, and rain sweeps from the skies;The bird sits on the chimney, looking in.That Nancy Cunard’s poetic achievement had its own unpredictable rhythms is revealed in the 40-year stretch of work covered by Sandeep Parmar in her magnificent edition of Cunard’s Selected Poems. Her development as a modernist poet is more jagged than it might first look when comparing the often rhymed, often metrical, sometimes crepuscular verses of her first, 1921 collection, Outlaws, with the sweeping free verse and direct address of her Spanish civil war poems. She anticipates herself in some early poems, and, later, may revert to earlier styles. Content leads form: she makes her poems reflect what she witnesses, and if, sometimes, this presents formal problems, it also underlies some of her best experiments. Parmar approvingly notes “the shared high modernist aesthetics” of Cunard’s long poem of 1925, Parallax, and TS Eliot’s The Waste Land, while finding that she adds a layer of influence from French surrealist poetry. French Symbolism, too, might be added to the poetic kaleidoscope – it flickers in this week’s poem. In the Studio comes from a particularly interesting section of Previously Unpublished or Uncollected Poems. Dated 1923, it’s almost traditional in form, yet the small innovations add up to a polished originality. The diction is tougher than in many of the Outlaws poems. The symbolism is offset by some brilliant observation: the five lilies may be “swooning” but we’re in no doubt of their state of decay against the painter’s wall. We see and hear those alliterative “aggressive flocks / Of alley-starlings” and can imagine exactly, gratingly, how they “aggravate a mood”. The atmosphere is fin-de-siècle, perhaps, but grounded in the sitter’s distinct, time-haunted perspective. And, yes, the surrealist touch is intriguingly present in that opening question about the confusing message of the cuckoo clocks.  The Paris studio where the poem is set is that of the painter (William) Eugene McCown. In her introduction, Parmar tells us that German troops “bayonetted her portrait by Eugene McCown” when they ransacked Cunard’s home: presumably, it was the same portrait.  I must admit I prefer this poem to any “iconic” picture of Cunard I’ve ever seen. It’s cleverly, elegantly made, a harmonious chord progression of different nuances. With a sardonic yawn, the speaker rebuts both the narcissism of the model and the pretension of the artist, defusing the latter through fine-tuned mimicry. The artist’s speech is gently parodied but he’s allowed to say something fundamentally interesting, especially at the beginning: “If one could paint, / Combine the abstract with a certain rude / Individual form, knot passion with restraint … ” That extra beat allotted to the eighth line is beautifully judged. I like the unexpected couplet, too, as a more rambling and thoughtless note is struck in lines nine and 10. And the connection in the line “dead emblem … so one lies” forges a critique of artistic convention and the part of the woman’s passive body in it. The image of the bird (one of those alley-starlings?) brings vitality and curiosity in a deft “turn” right at the end.  Cunard is probably remembered now chiefly for her Spanish civil war poems, such as To Eat Today and any new reader should get their measure. They are rough-edged but open up the terrain of what poetry in the 20th century finds it can do. Frontline political engagement is what drives such work. But Cunard was a literary activist too, and contributed importantly to modernism through her efforts on behalf of other writers. Her press, The Hours, was famously the first to publish Samuel Beckett. I think she understood the talents of other people better than her own were ever understood.
