Another storming performance from you.”Presenting the trophy was mathematician and professor for the public understanding of science at Oxford, Marcus du Sautoy. He said: “I thought it was a phenomenal performance. But I am really impressed by how many maths questions there were.“You’re probably cursing the fact that there’s a mathematician giving away the trophy. There were so many.”The winning team was captained by the final’s only female contestant, Hannah Woods, a history PhD student, and also featured Thomas Langley, who is studying history, Oscar Powell, a student of geological sciences whose varied facial expressions won him a cult following online, and Julian Sutcliffe, who also reads history.
