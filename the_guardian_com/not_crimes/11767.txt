Earlier this month, Netflix announced it would be making its service available “worldwide” by expanding to 130 new territories. A week later, a further announcement revealed that the company would be cracking down on the use of proxy servers, which allow international subscribers to access the flagship US Netflix service, a catalogue nearly twice the size of the UK’s offering and eight times that of South Korea’s. Experts, however, say that restricting proxy servers is next to impossible, and even Netflix admits that the best way to curb their use is to ensure that each of its regional catalogues is essentially the same, giving the people of Busan access to just as many lacklustre Nic Cage vehicles as their Ohioan counterparts.With that in mind, the company is keen to secure worldwide streaming rights for any new title it acquires. Happily, that means a film doesn’t need to prove its appeal in Britain to become a part of the UK catalogue; a strong following in any Netflix territory is enough to merit global acquisition. To give an example, UK subscribers recently gained access to Western, the acclaimed third feature film from documentary hotshots Turner and Bill Ross. The film was a breakout success at last year’s Sundance film festival, but like so many great non-fiction films, it was roundly ignored by British distributors and festivals.A rhythmic, deeply compassionate portrait of two neighbouring towns on opposite sides of the US-Mexico border, Western immerses viewers in the day-to-day lives of residents and lawmakers alike, so that by the time gangland violence begins to encroach upon their existence, our understanding of the threat posed is informed by our understanding of the people most affected, rather than the other way around. While fiction films such as Sicario offer glossy, morally indifferent depictions of life at the border, Western zeroes in on the delicate patterns of life in any small town, to underline the absurdity of the steel and paperwork that divides these two communities.If the film was always an unlikely prospect for UK distribution, maybe that’s because documentary discourse in Britain so brazenly favours provocative subjects and worthy causes over artistry and execution, a bias that damages an understated film like Western and rewards a bombastic alternative like Cartel Land. The latter film’s sensational title betrays its flashier, hollower treatment of US-Mexico relations, but still it garnered a UK cinema release last September and a Bafta nomination earlier this month, in a category dominated by worthy but inelegant docs.For now, Western will have to make do with its inconspicuous arrival on a globalised platform that – for all its monopolistic ickiness – has little time for the received wisdoms of regional taste.
