1 The 1975Is 1975 frontman Matt Healy pop’s next great intellectual? One person who seems to think so is Healy himself, while a fair chunk of us suspect he’s merely a good-looking chap who knows his way around a nice tune.

Primal Scream’s audience will be in for a short, sharp shock when the Japanese quartet support them this week.Sheffield, Sat; Nottingham, Sun; Portsmouth, Tue; Brighton, Wed; London, Thu3 The Chemical Brothers      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Chemical Brothers gigs are often less of an exercise in live music and more one in trying to scramble their audience’s brains with lasers, lights and beats.

Of course, her love songs still come wrapped in punk packaging, so don’t expect much in the way of slushy balladry.Bristol, Sat; Nottingham, Sun5 Frightened Rabbit      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Publicity image from music companyThese Scots seem to have pulled off the trick of supersizing their emo-tinged folky indie without becoming Mumford & Sons. Theirs has been a slow-burn career, which means those stadium-ready choruses can – at least for now – still be heard in relatively modest venues.Nottingham, Sat; Newcastle, Mon; Aberdeen, Tue; Inverness, Wed; Glasgow, Fri; touring to 18 Dec
