The winners: mature titlesIt’s no change at the top of the UK box office as Suicide Squad, Finding Dory, Jason Bourne and The BFG all retain their lock on the top four places. Suicide Squad suffered by far the biggest decline, down 62%, but was nevertheless the clear winner, with weekend takings of £4.24m. After 10 days, the Warner/DC release has grossed an impressive £22.2m here. That compares with £25.9m for Deadpool after two weekends of play – but that was a 12-day figure for Deadpool, thanks to its previews strategy. Another apt comparison might be Disney/Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, which stood at £13.8m after two weekends.

Last summer’s big Pixar movie Inside Out had reached £22.9m by the same stage of its run, and it ended up with an impressive £39.1m.Jason Bourne and The BFG both added about £3.3m. With £23.5m, The BFG is now the eighth highest-grossing release of 2016, behind The Jungle Book, Deadpool, Captain America: Civil War, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, The Secret Life of Pets, Finding Dory and Zootropolis. The latter is on £23.9m, so The BFG will soon overtake it. Rounding out the Top 10 for the year so far are The Revenant and Suicide Squad.Battle of the new releasesRaunchy comedy Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is the top new release, landing in fifth place with £1.07m, including previews of £370,000. That’s a fair bit down on Dirty Grandpa, in which Zac Efron teamed up with Robert De Niro, and which began in January with £2.05m, including £605,000 in previews. This time, Efron’s co-stars are Adam DeVine, Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The real winner: Pete’s DragonWith an opening gross of £844,000, Disney’s Pete’s Dragon was the box-office winner among the new releases, if previews are left out of the Mike and Dave number. With family films enjoying consistent returns every day, Disney can be confident of a sustained run for the well-reviewed Pete’s Dragon until the end of the school holidays.

Again, preview numbers are skewing the true picture. Strip them out, and The Shallows wins convincingly with £710,000 against £608,000 for Nerve. The Shallows offers the simple proposition of bleeding, bikini-clad surfer Blake Lively and a circling shark. Nerve delivers a teenage Emma Roberts sucked into a game of escalating dares decided by a mobile phone app.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The indie hit: Wiener-DogThere hasn’t been much in the box-office charts for the past month to challenge mainstream Hollywood. Indie cinemas have been crying out for fresh titles, with many of them turning to the blockbusters that are occupying multiplexes. So the release of Wiener-Dog was certainly timely – the Todd Solondz comedy opened in 38 cinemas, a decent number for the director. Debut box office of £86,000 resulted, including £2,000 in previews. That’s the biggest opening for a US indie since The Neon Demon and Maggie’s Plan over a month ago. Solondz’s biggest UK hit remains Happiness (1999) with £648,000, which Weiner-Dog has little chance of matching.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The futureThe lack of a big blockbuster release at the weekend meant that takings are 34% down on the previous session. But it’s not all bad news: box office is 15% up on the equivalent weekend in 2015, when Pixels debuted at the top spot. The coming session sees the release of Ricky Gervais’ David Brent: Life on the Road, belatedly continuing the adventures of The Office’s man-child narcissist, and Swallows and Amazons, adapted from the Arthur Ransome children’s classic with an adult cast led by Kelly MacDonald, Rafe Spall and Andrew Scott. Hollywood alternatives include horror Lights Out, already a $61m hit in the US, and the poorly reviewed Nine Lives, in which businessman Kevin Spacey finds himself trapped inside the body of his family’s cat. Also due: much-buzzed documentary Tickled, investigating the bizarre sport of competitive tickling, and Belgian urban drama Black, winner of the Discovery award at the 2015 Toronto film festival.
