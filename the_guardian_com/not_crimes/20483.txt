In your article on the Soweto revolt (40 years on, victims reflect on Soweto uprising, 16 June), I was surprised to find no reference to Baruch Hirson’s classic account of the revolt, Year of Fire, Year of Ash, first published by Zed Books in 1979 and recently reissued.It not only gives a detailed description of the uprising in Soweto in 1976, but also shows that this was part of wider opposition to apartheid, as well as tracing the history of protest against African educational institutions in South Africa dating back to the 1920s.It would be a great pity if Guardian readers, informed of the 40th anniversary of the Soweto revolt thanks to your excellent article, were not reminded of the existence of Hirson’s book, should they wish to learn more.Yael ShermanLondon• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
