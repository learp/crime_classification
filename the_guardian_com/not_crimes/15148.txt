Black sheep – a member of a family or group who is regarded as a disgrace. You would think the title of this book gives away the theme or the main story line. Well it doesn’t. This book involves many different dilemmas throughout which enables the reader to reflect, whilst leaving them feeling intensely inquisitive and captivated.I think the best thing about this book is that it is not just a typical teenage love story; the author has put a twist on this.It involves so many different events, from the main character, Dwanye (aged 16), being in a gang, misbehaviour in school and gang crime to the love for rap, two different lifestyles coming together and the cultural community in Brixton. This book symbolises the modern day Romeo and Juliet story. Misha, who is also 16 but is posh, middle class, well- mannered and with an bright future, is the complete opposite of Dwanye, a gangster. This book is sure to make you examine your life and change for the better. I would definitely recommend this book for people who are looking for interesting, yet inspiring books to read.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
