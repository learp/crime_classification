A government decision to remove funding from environmental legal centres will expose communities to damaging development and reduce scrutiny on the mining industry, conservationists have warned.The attorney general’s office has told the network of Environmental Defenders Offices that it will be removing the $10m in funding, over four years, announced by the previous Labor government this year.The existing $100,000-a-year stipend given to each EDO office, which has been provided for the past 20 years, will also be withdrawn, meaning all government funding for the network will cease.According to the EDO, its offices in Western Australia, Tasmania, Northern Territory and north Queensland will probably have to close as a result of the cuts. Larger offices in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland should continue, but with a reduced range of services.EDOs operate by providing free advice to individuals and community groups on environmental law. As well as taking on legal cases, it handles advocacy and a helpline, which is used by 1,500 people a year in NSW alone.Jeff Smith, chief executive of the NSW EDO, said the mining industry will be “breaking out the champagne” at the news of the funding cuts.“We know the mining industry has been lobbying against us for some time because we help community groups take on big developments, we help the Davids take on the Goliaths,” he told Guardian Australia.“I don’t think there’s any coincidence they’ve singled out EDOs across Australia. We are what stands between the community and unsustainable development.”Smith said he was “shocked” at the way the cuts were handled by the government, warning his office would have to scale down its activities.“There is no fat in our organisation, so this will impact frontline services unless we find alternative sources of funding,” he said. “The NSW office won’t close down, we want the community to keep calling us – but it will be hard for us to take on their cases.”The NSW EDO represented residents of the Hunter Valley village of Bulga, winning a case against a subsidiary of Rio Tinto over the dust, noise pollution and destruction of native species habitat caused by the expansion of a coalmine. It is also fighting a case against the controversial Maules Creek mine, which has been the target of vociferous opposition.Smith warned that developments planned for the Kimberley in Western Australia, Kakadu in the Northern Territory, the Tarkine in Tasmania and projects that threaten the Great Barrier Reef could remain unchallenged due to the funding cuts.Brendan Sydes, chief executive of the EDO’s Victorian office, said the decision was a “major blow” and was representative of a wider Coalition assault on environmental safeguards.“This is part and parcel of the current attacks on environmental law, the attack on independent conservation advice and the undermining of environmental protection,” he told Guardian Australia.“I don’t hold out any hope of them changing their mind. [Attorney general] George Brandis has made it clear that he doesn’t support our advocacy work, which is essentially criticising government policy. He doesn’t like people organising themselves into community groups either.”Glen Klatovsky, national campaigner at the Wilderness Society, said: “For thousands of people around the country one of their only avenues to protect their community, often against illegal activity, has been seriously cut. This federal government appears hell bent on ensuring there is as little scrutiny as possible on them and on big developers and miners.”Brandis said the government was having to make savings across all portfolios in a “fiscally constrained environment”.“The government has prioritised the funding of legal financial assistance to frontline services,” he said.“This is consistent with the government’s view that legal financial assistance should be directed to disadvantaged Australians who are most in need of legal assistance – rather than using public money on advocacy and lobbying activities.“The primary objective of the commonwealth community legal services program is to contribute to the provision of legal assistance services for disadvantaged members of the community.“It is vital that vulnerable Australians receive the help they need with their legal problems.”The Greens senator Larissa Waters said it was “outrageous” that Brandis would want to cut funds to the EDOs.“The EDOs are experts in environmental law and I’m not sure why any sane government would want to actively stop that advice,” she said. “It seems they just want to silence critics and any sort of dissent. Sadly, the Abbott government doesn’t value environmental protection.”
