A host of British talent has been unveiled for the forthcoming TV adaptation of four short stories by the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman. The show will feature an original score written by former Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker.Veteran actor Kenneth Cranham, comic Johnny Vegas and 60s kitchen-sink drama doyenne Rita Tushingham will head up Likely Stories, which will be broadcast on Sky Arts later this year.The younger stars include: Tom Hughes, who will also appear in the forthcoming TV biopic of Queen Victoria starring Doctor Who’s Jenna Coleman; George MacKay (Pride, Sunshine on Leith), who was nominated for a Rising Star Bafta in 2014; and Simon Manyonda, most recently in Doctor Who. Monica Dolan, who also starred in Pride, Kick-Ass 2 and BBC comedy series W1A, Paul Ritter (Quantum of Solace, Wolf Hall) and Johann Myers, star of Black Mirror and No Offence, complete the ensemble cast, which will play across all four, 30-minute episodes. Gaiman is the author of several novels and short stories currently being adapted for TV and cinema. His debut novel, American Gods, is being turned into a TV series by the US channel Starz, starring Ricky Whittle and produced by Hannibal’s Bryan Fuller. The short story How to Talk to Girls at Parties is also headed for the big screen with Nicole Kidman. Likely Stories producers Sid Gentle Films, which began production of the series in November under the directorship of Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard (the duo behind the Nick Cave film 20,000 Days on Earth) have now released details of the four stories.Foreign Parts, from Gaiman’s first collection Smoke and Mirrors, will appeal to fans of Charlie Brooker’s twisted Black Mirror. It’s about an introverted banker who begins to believe his genitals are no longer part of him, and are slowly taking him over. Feeders and Eaters, from the Fragile Things collection, is about the relationship between a man and an old woman who has very unusual appetites.Closing Time, from the same book, is an almost MR James-style story of a man spinning a tall tale of haunted houses to the members of his gentleman’s club.Looking for the Girl, also from Smoke and Mirrors, focuses on a man with a lifelong fixation on a model in a porn magazine. But as he gets older, she somehow stays the same age.Phil Edgar-Jones, director of Sky Arts, said, “I’ve long admired the work of Neil Gaiman. He is a genius storyteller and an exceptional talent. Under this British directorial powerhouse, Likely Stories is, in true Gaiman style, brilliantly bizarre and unexpected.”All of the stories are set in London and will, according to the production team, hold a few Easter eggs for Gaiman fans, while the author himself will be making a Hitchcockian appearance in each episode.Gaiman said: “Short stories do not traditionally get a lot of love from TV. I’m really excited to see what the team are going to do – they’ve given it real thought and it feels like it’ll be very, very special.”According to executive producer Sally Woodward Gentle, Likely Stories – despite its Black Mirror feel and the nod to the classic Roald Dahl’s Tales of the Unexpected – “is like nothing else on TV”. She said: “Each film explores common themes of human consumption, destructive obsession and psychological cannibalism – with great humour and humanity.”
