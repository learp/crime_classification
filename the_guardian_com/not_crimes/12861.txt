In Tesco’s new ad, a man with a beard and a waxed jacket begins by asking: “Has love ever made you do something you knew you didn’t really like?” Boringly, it turns out that David (that’s the man’s name) isn’t talking about anal sex but eating spicy food. He hates the stuff but, unbeknown to his wife, has been pretending to like it for the last 15 years.That’s a difficult secret to keep for such a long time. Imagine the terrifying discipline it would require. David may have the appearance of a mild-mannered SEO manager but beneath that scruffy facial hair clearly lies the meticulous soul of the killer from Seven.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This ad is part of Tesco’s wider “Love Story” campaign that seems to exclusively feature the kind of men who think “Every little helps” is the name of a pop-up restaurant in east London run by dwarves. You may also have seen the poster featuring Iain and his “proper” croque monsieur plastered around the place, but the problem with this strategy is that the kind of people David and Iain are meant to appeal to wouldn’t be seen dead in Tesco. There are some things not even love could make you do.
