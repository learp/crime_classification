In 1979, the Swiss art duo Peter Fischli and David Weiss strolled into a Zurich supermarket searching for art supplies. They stopped at the deli. “We saw the cold cuts in the glass vitrine, pointed to it and said: ‘Look, it looks like a carpet shop,’” said Fischli on the phone from the Guggenheim, where he is installing a retrospective. “We just bought it and made it.” The result was their first collaboration, the Sausage Series (1979), photographs in which luncheon meat was arranged to resemble a car crash or, indeed, a carpet shop, its deadpan humour typical of their work.How to Work Better, the pair’s Guggenheim retrospective, which opened in New York on Friday, shows the breadth of their artistic practice, taking in as it does sculptures, photographs, 96 hours of video footage and readymade objects including pizza boxes, car tires and cassette tapes. There are also three public pieces of art placed across the Manhattan – Haus, a miniature German office building on Fifth Avenue; Büsi, a three-minute video of a cat lapping up milk in Times Square and a mural, How to Work Better, in Soho.The exhibition’s title is taken from one of their most famous works, a 1991 text piece inspired by a ceramics factory in Thailand. “It was the rules for the workers,” Fischli says. “We took a photo of it and for a long time, kept it in our studio as a little bit of a reminder for us.”The list outlines 10 things that encourage workplace harmony, simple Big Brotherly phrases like “Do one thing at a time,” “Learn to ask questions” and “Be calm.” The one Fischli struggles with the most is “Distinguish sense from nonsense.” “I think that’s the hardest one to answer,” he says. “It speaks to all working people.”Fischli and Weiss met in 1977 through a mutual friend, the artist Urs Lüthi, and were friends and collaborators until until 2012, when Weiss died of cancer aged 65; the pair had already started work on the Guggenheim retrospective. The Sausage Series was their first work together, and after meeting up again in Los Angeles in 1980, their professional partnership was solidified as they got dressed up in animal costumes for their Rat and Bear series, including two films, a book and a sculpture. In the 1981 film The Least Resistance, the pair recline by a pool, visit an art gallery, argue and talk philosophy.

In the film, meticulously arranged junk including stepladders, tyres and a flaming bale of hay produce a spectucular chain reaction a Rube Goldberg project.“We first made a three-minute sketch, but we decided to make a longer movie and work deeper on it,” says Fischli. “It had its frustrating moments, like when things don’t happen the way you want them to. I see it as work, not only play.”The art duo also claimed a copyright infringement in 2003, when Honda copied elements of their award-winning film for an ad campaign, though they never sued.The dapper duo, who trotted the globe in collared shirts, worked mainly in their Zurich studio, where every day, they would meet between 9 and 10 am, make coffee and divide duties – Fischli always answered emails, while Weiss did the bookkeeping.Work arguments were inevitable. “If you don’t argue, it doesn’t make sense to work together,” said Fischli. “If you work with someone who always has the same opinion as you, you can do it alone. To argue is a very productive thing.”The video of the cat in Times Square comes from a year the artists spent on the road. “When we were invited to do the Swiss pavilion in Venice [in 1995], we were interested in the idea of ‘What is work?’” says Fischli. “We decided to not work for one year; it was a year outside of the studio.

Every morning, we gave the cat milk and we filmed the cat drinking the milk.”The artists also visited tourist sites like the Coliseum in Rome, the Pyramids of Giza and Caribbean beaches for their travel photo series, Visible World.“We were interested in making photos that already exist,” says Fischli. “We could have bought them from an image bank, but going there and making these photos, the act of spending time and making a photo that already exists, was interesting.”The artists also made Airports series, photographing the most banal, unremarkable shots of the aviation industry – a series John Waters called “purposeful mediocrity”.The Guggenheim exhibition closes on 27 April, coincidentally the anniversary of Weiss’s death. Fischli declines to talk further about the sundering of such a long and productive artistic partnership. “It’s too long and a complex question to answer,” he says, before saying goodbye and hanging up the phone.
