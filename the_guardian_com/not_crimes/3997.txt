 How do you study a species that is so rare that it will probably become extinct in a few short decades? This is the question confronting those who study chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, in the wilds of Liberia, one of several African nations where the bushmeat trade is exacting its final, terrible toll on the closest living relative to humans. But how many chimpanzees are still alive in the wild? No one really knows. In 2010, the Max Planck Institute for evolutionary anthropology (EVA) in Leipzig, Germany, teamed up with the Wild Chimpanzee Foundation (headquartered at the EVA), and Conservation International, based in Arlington, Virginia, to launch the Pan Africa Great Ape Program. Using motion-sensitive cameras, they aim to conduct nationwide surveys in 15 countries to estimate how many chimps are left in Africa. So far, they have collected video footage of the chimps in Sapo National Park in Liberia -- video that is already providing valuable insights into chimp behaviour:   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   here or download the free PDF.
