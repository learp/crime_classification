There is affecting news of the Karaoke Sauron, who is not taking the diminishment of his powers as well as he might. Time was Simon Cowell bestrode the Atlantic like a telly colossus, as at home insulting teenagers on ITV as he was floating the idea of taking Las Vegas by storm with a permanent residency for The X Factor.Like I said, time was. These days, his US output is mainly limited to America’s Got Talent, while past suggestions that he might buy ITV with Philip Green have been commuted down to suggestions that someone or other might want to try a more up-tempo number on X Factor next week.What Simon finds especially hard to stomach, it seems, is filial ingratitude. To wit: stars he might as well have given birth to now taking their new projects elsewhere. This week’s perceived snub came from departed One Direction member Zayn Malik, who has been announced as an executive producer and collaborator on a new NBC drama about the making of a boyband and their rise to fame. Boys is conceived by Dick Wolf, the heavyweight producer best known for Law and Order, and its various spin-offs.“Nothing surprises me any more,” explained Simon of Zayn’s perceived treachery. “I think he should have come to me with it, if I’m being honest with you. I do actually believe that when they’ve got these ideas, bearing in mind where we started, they should actually come to me.”Well, quite. It is anyone’s guess why Zayn went for the brains behind the longest-running and most consecutively decorated drama ever to air on US television over someone whose idea of a musical mentor is a palm-fringed Sinitta. And if Simon increasingly sounds like the bitter Phil Oakley part in Don’t You Want Me, I’m sure his peerless ear will be the first to discern it.
