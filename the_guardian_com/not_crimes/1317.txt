A new law in the US state of Illinois will require salon professionals to receive training in domestic abuse prevention. The law aims to train beauty therapists and hair stylists to recognise signs of abuse, and will see around 88,000 people trained over the next two years. The initiative, launched by a coalition of Chicago-based domestic violence advocacy groups, is an innovative way to harness the often intimate relationship between stylists and clients.While the hour-long training will not make salon professionals experts overnight, and they will not be legally required to report violence, the hope is that the knowledge and awareness will equip them to provide a helpful outlet, and potentially guide clients towards existing support services.It is exciting to consider new ways in which different sections of society might be harnessed in the battle against domestic violence, a problem so widespread that more than one in four women in the UK have experienced it since the age of 16. Given the societal myths surrounding the problem, and the fact that victims are often made to feel ashamed or responsible for what is happening, even a small amount of training could lead to potentially life-changing conversations in women’s daily lives. What if we could do more to catch signs of domestic violence in the workplace too, or in other everyday situations?Illinois law turns to hairstylists for help in fight against domestic abuse The Illinois law is reminiscent of the recent Ask for Angela campaign, which hit headlines in November after a photograph of a poster designed by Lincolnshire county council went viral. The posters, displayed on toilet doors in pubs and bars, encouraged anybody who felt they were in an unsafe dating situation to approach bar staff and ask for Angela. This would alert staff and enable them to help potential victims to safely exit the situation. The campaign garnered widespread praise, with many calling for it to be rolled out nationwide, an initiative that could have great potential if supplemented with staff training.Sadly, however, the idea of introducing such widespread, innovative approaches to domestic violence seems unrealistic when we are still struggling to achieve the minimum in frontline support for survivors. What good would it do to train hairdressers in Sunderland, for example, to spot signs of abuse when it was this week reported that the city may be set to lose its only remaining women’s refuge provider? Wearside Women in Need, which can accommodate almost 300 women and children and runs the only specialist refuge in the north east for black women, told the Independent that Sunderland council had informed the charity its funding would be entirely withdrawn from June 2017. While the council said that the 2017-18 budget had not yet been decided, the charity, which has already seen its funding cut by a third since 2010, says it will likely be forced to close if the proposed cut goes ahead. A petition has been set up to call on Sunderland council to drop any plans to withdraw funding. The government last year announced a funding boost for women’s refuges, but charities such as Refuge, which has suffered funding cuts to 80% of its services since 2011, warned that the £20m promised would not meet the gap. And with the UK consistently falling below the Council of Europe’s recommendation for at least one family place in refuge per 10,000 of the population, while sporadic pots of funding are welcome, they fall far short of the amount required to provide the sector with long-term sustainability. What the Ask for Angela posters and the Illinois training have in common is the initiative to capitalise on everyday situations where a small intervention could make a big difference.The idea of tackling domestic violence across our society in new and innovative ways is exciting, but until we get sustainable funding and support for the women’s sector, such progress seems likely to remain a pipe dream.
