A livestream of museum-goers and the trio’s texts is available on the museum’s website.The launch of the project comes just days after hackers posted antisemitic slogans on the website for He Will Not Divide Us, LaBeouf’s anti-Trump art installation. He Will Not Divide Us has been subject to “alt-right” attacks since its launch in January, with installations in New York, New Mexico and Liverpool shut down due to disruption. LaBeouf’s new installation has already attracted similar attention, with two museum-goers wearing red hats emblazoned with Make America Great Again appearing on the livestream for the project.
