Singers can be quite definitive in expressing why they can not, and definitely will not do something – and this is what our guru wants you to explore this week. Songs where lyrics riff on things that will never happen, and why, may help you justify.You have until 11pm on Monday 15 August to post your nomination and make your justification. Regular RR contributor saneshane will select from your recommendations and produce a playlist – to be published online on 18 August.Here is a list of all songs previously picked and therefore ineligible for the series.If you want to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions – and potentially blog about the process/selection for the Guardian – please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com with the subject line “RR guru”, or make yourself known in the comments.Here’s a reminder of the guidelines for RR:Tell us why it’s a worthy contender.Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of a song’s words.Provide a link to the song. We prefer YouTube, but Spotify or Soundcloud are fine.Listen to others people’s suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist.If you have a good theme, or if you’d like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.comThere’s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are “zedded”, at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of “zedded” (picked for a previous playlist so ineligible), “donds” and other strange words used by RR regulars.Many RR regulars also congregate at the ’Spill blog.
