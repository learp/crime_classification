A narrow majority of delegates at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) summit support moves to extend a ban on Japan's scientific whaling plans until at least 2016 in a vote due on Wednesday.Despite fierce opposition from Japan, New Zealand is proposing that the IWC endorse a ruling by the international court of justice (ICJ) and add strict conditions to any future permits it issues for scientific whaling.Whaling nations such as Japan, Norway and Iceland, supported by a clutch of African and Caribbean states, claim that lethal research can be the most effective form of marine science.The resolution's fate will be decided by a simple majority, and the Guardian has learned that the EU, which votes as a block and can strongly influence final outcomes, is backing it."The EU believes that the court's ruling must be a milestone for this organisation and we have to update our working procedures accordingly," a senior EU source said."There are pretty clear instructions [from the ICJ ruling] that could be immediately translated into some improvement of our scientific committee's working practices." These could then form the basis of IWC instructions to its 88 member states."If it goes to a vote, there is a majority, although it may be very tight," the source said. "The problem is that you then have something approved with a tiny majority. It is not ideal but it is still a message."Japan has already announced its intention to restart scientific whaling at the end of 2015, after suspending its south Atlantic whale culls for a year in deference to the ICJ ruling.New Zealand and the EU are still trying to achieve a consensus position that could avoid a divisive vote and a Japanese withdrawal from whatever arrangement is declared.Compromise drafts are reportedly being drawn up and a meeting of interested parties is planned for Tuesday evening that Gerard Van Bohemen, the head of the New Zealand delegation, said could arrive at a technical solution to the issue if there was goodwill on both sides."Both sides would have to step back from their positions and come together around what should be a straightforward issue but has really become mixed up in the politics of scientific whaling," he said."It is about how you assess the scientific purpose of a scientific whaling programme, the size of a sample and whether that's reasonable in terms of the objectives you're trying to achieve, whether you've considered non-lethal options and whether they are a feasible way of achieving the same objectives."Under the potential compromise arrangement, the IWC could assess the answers to such questions in future requests for scientific whaling permits.Environmentalists are opposed to any weakening of the original resolution. "We are totally against it," said Aimee Leslie, WWF's global cetacean and marine turtle manager. "As a minimum we want the resolution to be accepted as is, and hopefully strengthened."The Buenos Aires group of Latin American states may well propose a stronger version of the resolution, strengthening ocean sanctuaries in the event that a compromise is reached.If Japan and other whaling nations signal openness to the ideas on the table, a form of words to smooth over the gaps between nations on the issue will probably be agreed by Thursday. If it does not, a vote on the resolution will probably take place tomorrow. "I would think it has a majority," Van Bohemen said. "That is just how the numbers are stacking up at the moment."Japanese negotiators insisted that there were still wide differences between the two positions. "But I believe that we can try to find some common ground," one said.To illustrate the value of Japan's scientific whaling, he said that past programmes had revealed that the age of sexual maturation for minke whales had fallen in the 1960s, but began to reverse in the 1990s.One marine scientist canvassed by the Guardian said that the diplomat's scientific information was not especially useful for the conservation and management of whales, the justification for such research. Asked whether Japan would unilaterally resume scientific whaling if it lost the vote, the Japanese negotiator replied: "I do not reply to 'what if?' questions."
