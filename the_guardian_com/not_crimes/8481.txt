I wake up, fairly innocently for a few moments, and then the news filters into my consciousness, and I remember. It’s like a bereavement. When you first wake, for the first few seconds that loved one is still in your world, then you remember and are distraught. I hadn’t realised it would hit me like this. None of us had. It’s a trauma. A body blow to the country.I can’t sleep. At breakfast, we discuss the latest news with our scrambled eggs. The political world is imploding. The whole country, it seems, has been taken for a ride. No one really wanted to go in the first place, and now even some of the outers are full of Bregret. “Nicola Sturgeon is our only hope,” someone says. “Nicola for PM. Can’t she lead the whole country?” We are in Oswestry, off today to Caernarfon. Gillian Clarke and I decide to take the mountain route. “We’re heading for Gwynedd,” Gillian tells me. “We’re going to Remain country,” she says with a lilt in her voice. We cross the River Dee. “We have a river Dee, too,” Gillian says. Oh why didn’t the whole of Wales vote like Scotland? I hadn’t realised it would hit me like this. It’s a trauma. A body blow to the country We arrive at our hotel a bit later than the other party and quickly get changed for the night’s gig at the very modern and beautiful Galeri on Victoria Dock. We’re joined by Welsh poet Ifor ap Glyn. And so the gig begins. The best one yet. The audience appears to need us. Even some of the same poems have acquired a different resonance in these changed times. We listen to each other’s poems now, and realise we are comforting each other. A habit of light from Gillian. A prayer from Carol Ann Duffy. A moon from Imtiaz Dharker. At the end the whole audience are on their feet – they stand clapping and cheering for so long it makes some of us cry. Someone says, “You were like a building, each one of you held a different bit up. You lifted us.”Strange how quickly the tone and timbre of the country feels to have changed. And stranger still to think that once I left Scotland because it didn’t feel welcoming to me, because people were always asking me where I was from, because it wasn’t easy to be openly gay; and now I find myself longing to return to Scotland because it feels the safe place. In these unwelcoming days and nights, it is Scotland that is welcoming. The biggest surprise is that none of us saw this juggernaut of racism approaching Strange, too, to try to gauge the mood of the country through poetry. Pre-referendum, I would read a poem of mine, “Extinction”, that was originally called “Planet Farage”. It was written as satire and every night before the referendum it had audiences killing themselves laughing. Now that satire has become a reality, it suddenly isn’t funny any more. When I finish reading the poem, there’s now a drop in temperature, moments of extended silence, then people kick into life and clap and cheer, as if they want to identify themselves straight away, adding their vigorous voice. As if they want to be on the side of poetry.A climate change poem for today: Extinction by Jackie Kay Our country has split: people are in-ers and outers, remainers and leavers, like groups in a poor science fiction drama. When we stop in places, we listen keenly to the conversations, overhear snatches. “What’s Merkel got to do with it?” Or, “They should all be made to leave.” Where has this bile come from? How did we sleepwalk into this? It is some consolation to be Scottish. It is the country that is still holding open its hands, and saying loudly you are welcome here. You belong.The biggest surprise is that none of us saw this juggernaut of racism approaching. It is coming down the main roads and the slip roads and even beautiful country lanes at huge astonishing speed. We have to stop it. We cannot wait to cross the border. We cannot wait to feel at home.
