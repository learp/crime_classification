Join Lockwood, Lucy and George as they investigate the strange and unnatural mystery of the whispering skull entombed in a jar.Lockwood pines for a new case and when one comes in everything seems to be going splendidly, that is until George is spellbound by an evil mirror. Things get worse for the trio when the tomb of the most hideous and vile dark Mage which they are meant to be guarding is robbed (ending in the murder of one of the grave robbers!). Could things possibly get any worse? Well, of course - it’s Lockwood & Co! This is a thrilling read and one of my favourite books. I would say it should be read by 9+ (as it is moderately frightening). If you read it I am sure you won’t be disappointed!• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
