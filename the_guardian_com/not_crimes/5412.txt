The Royal College of Midwives is announcing its support for Britain’s membership of the EU, claiming that the union keeps the NHS safe and provides rights for British women during pregnancy. The group said the EU had also ensured better working conditions for its members, as well as maternity rights and the guarantee for pregnant women to have paid time off to attend antenatal appointments.Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the RCM, said: “We are laying out to our members why we think it is important that we remain part of the EU. I believe midwifery in the UK is stronger for it, I believe patient care is safer because of it, and I believe working conditions are better as a result of it. “To me, the benefits of staying in and the risks of leaving are both crystal clear. Staying in is better for the NHS, it is better for women, and it is better for midwives. We are better off in.”Out campaigners have claimed that the NHS could be badly hit by a decision to stay in the EU. It published an open letter from more than 50 healthcare professionals, including one midwife, that claimed that the NHS was facing a financial crisis. They said it had been “starved of necessary funding” while taxpayer money was sent to Brussels.A poll by the National Union of Students, meanwhile, has found that 85% of respondents want to vote to Remain. The NUS is launching a “We Want IN” campaign, which will aim to drive up voter registration. It will provide student unions with support, including briefings on why it believes remaining in the EU could help higher education.
