After the death of Jo Cox, I found myself looking at two photographs and wondering if I hadn’t lived too long. One was of Jo Cox: radiant, intelligent, with no limit to the good she might have done. The other was of Thomas Mair, the man accused of her murder. Here, it seemed to me, was a face with nothing in it except an unspoken question: do you really want to to go on living in a world where the life of a woman like her can be taken away on a whim?After a few hours’ thought, I decided not to quit. But it was no easy decision. Early in my life, I discovered that the mere thought of a woman being at the mercy of male violence put me in a panic. Possibly this had something to do with the fact that I was the only male in the house and just six years old, so how could I defend my mother if the bad men showed up? After I got a Ned Kelly cap pistol for Christmas I felt a bit better, but not a lot.Little did I know that I had a long life stretching ahead in which I would hear about the bad men almost every day, and always with the same despair. The arts were my refuge. Big mistake. Just recently, writing an article about the great European works of art, I put in a sentence about Bernini’s sculpture of his lovely young mistress Costanza Bonarelli, and I’m still wondering why I didn’t take the sentence straight out again, because the terrible truth is that, when he discovered that she had been falling into bed with his randy brother, he hired a thug to ruin her beauty. The thug slashed her face, but Bernini was the culprit.He himself had a long history of chasing every woman in Rome, but one of the great artists of his time wasn’t content with being just a standard two-faced swine. Given the chance to be something worse, he took it. Pressed on the point, he might have used the excuse that great artists have great passions. He might have, but he would have been offering further proof that he was a jackass.Clive James: ‘In many ways, when I was young, I was as dumb as Omar Mateen’ Kindness, in the end, makes the difference. Monet was callous to women and Renoir told him so. Renoir was kind to his models, and outside his studio the street filled up with mothers waiting to speak to him about the possibility of him marrying their daughters. He did his best to be fair. Balanchine, a genius, should have done the same, but when he fell for his young star ballerina Suzanne Farrell and she fell for someone else, he ruined her career. Later on, she forgave him. He was lucky she didn’t shoot him.
