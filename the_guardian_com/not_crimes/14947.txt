Thank you.“For now I’m taking some time to be with loved ones, I hope you all understand. Love Biggins.”The TV star has already announced he will continue with a pre-planned trip in October to the Polish city of Krakow and visit the nearby Auschwitz concentration camp, where more than a million people, mainly Jews, were killed by the Nazis.While in the house, Biggins had said: “You better be careful or they’ll be putting you in a shower and taking you to a room,” as housemates queued for the bathroom.He later apologised to Waissel and Big Brother for the “trite, ridiculous remark”, which was not broadcast but which he discussed in an interview in the Sun.Biggins had also received a warning on Friday after he made controversial statements on bisexuality and Aids during a conversation with Aubrey O’Day and Renee Graziano.He claimed HIV had been spread by bisexuals who had sex with infected people abroad “and brought it back to their own families in America, and that’s how it became a worldwide disease”.Biggins also claimed bisexuals were “people not wanting to admit they are gay”.He later tweeted how grateful he was for the support of his fans, saying: Christopher Biggins (@onebiggins)Nearly 13,000 new followers on Twitter since I went into #CBB and "came out".
