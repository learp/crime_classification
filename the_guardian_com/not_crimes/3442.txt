The star of Under Siege and Above the Law visited the capital twice in December and was received by President Tomislav Nikolic and Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic.At the time, Seagal said he would do “everything possible to promote Serbia” worldwide and expressed a wish to establish an Aikido school in the capital city, according to a government statement.Has Steven Seagal proved you can be a Buddhist and a mascot for the arms trade? During one visit, Seagal was asked to train Serbian special police forces in Aikido, a Japanese martial art that he has displayed in his blockbuster movies. His visits were sponsored by a pro-Russian Serb group. A friend of Russian president Vladimir Putin, Seagal has in the past promoted sports for Russian schoolchildren and said he would not rule out eventually seeking Russian citizenship.Serbia has officially sought EU membership but has been struggling to overcome strong opposition from pro-Kremlin nationalists.
