I see from Ruby Tandoh’s article (Made to share, G2, 3 November) that online sharing of food images is five times more likely to occur among those who are 18 to 24 than among those aged 55 and above. And, as a result, we are spared photos of “old-fashioned sherry trifles, unpretty Irish stew or traditional meat-and-two-veg meals”. I hope that Ruby manages to avoid dinner invitations from anyone over 55, including me. Although, on reflection, I shan’t be inviting her, as I shall be too busy making sure that my dinner party signature dish of Irish stew (or meat-and-two-veg if I am pushing the boat out) looks and tastes suitably drab, whilst also leaving time for the trembling distribution of hundreds and thousands onto my passé trifle.Glenna McCullochTwickenham, Middlesex• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
