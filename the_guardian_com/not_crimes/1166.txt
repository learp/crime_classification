It occurred to me only recently that it’s never going to happen. Even if Donald Trump loses the race in November, he’ll act as if he’s won. He’ll repeatedly explain how, by many different measures, he was the true victor. He’ll blame others for whatever went wrong and insist that the outcome suits him perfectly anyway, because he’s a billionaire and therefore immune to dissatisfaction or regret. The bit where he loses and feels bad about himself, that’s never coming. And, of course, he might actually win.Instead it’s the Republican party that’s going to lose and feel bad about itself, whether Trump is victorious or not. It’s not yet clear precisely how this disaster will pan out, but here’s a telling example of what’s already happening. John McCain is a widely respected Republican senator. He may have lost the 2008 presidential election to Obama, but he held his Arizona senate seat two years later with 59% of the vote. He’s also a former prisoner of war, and when Trump implied that McCain didn’t qualify as a war hero because he’d been captured (this was back in July last year) it seemed like one of those sufficiently stupid moments. It wasn’t.McCain, understandably, doesn’t like Trump much. In March he expressed concerns over “Mr Trump’s uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues”. But just last month he said of Trump: “I think he could be a capable leader.”This about-face is also understandable: after 30 years in the Senate, McCain is facing a tough primary fight against a Tea Party opponent. But in Arizona, where a third of the electorate are Hispanic, his tepid endorsement of Trump has gone down badly, and current polls put him in a near tie with his Democratic rival, Ann Kirkpatrick. Supporting Trump hurts him; disavowing Trump hurts him. He can’t win. If only one could say the same about Trump.Supermarket bird spotter      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   American robins stocking up at their local supermarket. Photograph: David Stephenson/AlamyIn the 28 years I’ve lived in London, I’ve never bothered to learn the names of the birds. I can confidently identify a magpie, but that’s about it. Knowing the names of American birds is no help – your robins don’t really look like American robins, because they are not related.None of this would be a problem if my wife hadn’t suddenly put up a bird feeder and become terribly interested in them. She knows I spend most of my working day staring out of the window, and now whenever she returns home she wants a full report of what’s been happening in the garden, bird-wise.“Not much this afternoon,” I say. “Just a couple of supermarket birds.”“What?” she says.“You know, supermarket birds. They live under trolleys in the car park.”“Do you mean starlings?”“Yeah, whatever, Professor,” I say. Perhaps it’s time I bought a book.An inbox full of blessingsI’ve just become resigned to the fact that the bike shop I visited last week is now going to send me two emails a day for the rest of my life. These join the daily offers sent by a website from which I ordered seeds four years ago, the annual birthday wishes I get from a van hire company I once patronised, and those weekly nudges sent by a US floral delivery service too impatient to wait for someone else I know to die.I never unsubscribe from these things, partly because in my experience this has no effect beyond generating an additional unwanted message – but mostly because these days I consider every email I receive that requires no answer to be a tiny blessing. I can only apologise for my silence, Ironmongery Direct.
