Outraged parents spent their holiday screaming into the void after Channel 5 screened Watership Down, a U-certificate animation that features the murder of rabbits, at 2.25pm on Easter Sunday. The 1978 film, an adaptation of Richard Adams’s fantasy adventure novel, tells the story of a warren facing imminent destruction. A group of rabbits set out on a violent journey to find a new home. Their number includes a seer called Fiver (voiced by Richard Briers), who has apocalyptic visions of the sun soaking the land with blood. The film includes scenes of bloodied bunnies fighting tooth and nail over their territory. Parents angrily tweeted Channel 5 to express their disapproval. Some called for programmers at the broadcaster – which also screens the shows Botched Up Bodies, Extreme Fishing with Robson Green and Dance Moms – to be sacked. As yet no one has complained to the industry standards body, Ofcom. Channel 5 has yet to comment.The Royal Gentlemen (@Royal_Gentlemen)Can't believe channel 5 playing watership down today for the Easter film... Someone is getting sacked for that choice.March 27, 2016Also featuring the voices of John Hurt, Nigel Hawthorne and Roy Kinnear, Watership Down was a success at the UK box office on its initial release, despite many reviewers’ concerns that it was too brutal for its U certificate. The BBFC, which last considered it for classification for its home video release in 1987, still receives a few complaints about the film’s rating every year. In an interview with the Telegraph on Sunday, Adams, who based the book on a story he made up for his daughters, said that he had never been tempted to temper the subject matter. “I never consider the readers,” he said. “I was allowed to read anything I liked when I was little, and I liked all sorts of things that I shouldn’t have been reading.”
