Sydney’s lockout laws, Australian marriage equality and a surprise appearance from Kylie Minogue were the big talking points at the 30th annual Aria awards, otherwise dominated by the electronic music wunderkind Flume.The 25-year-old Sydney electronic producer whose real name is Harley Streten, picked up five of the pointy statues, winning best male artist, album of the year and best independent release for his sophomore album Skin, as well as best dance release and best pop release for Never Be Like You.Flume had already won all three artisan categories – best producer, engineer and cover art of the year – when nominations were announced in early October, bringing his total Aria awards to eight.Arias 2016: Flume cleans up as Crowded House joins Hall of Fame – as it happened In his acceptance speech for best dance release, Flume rallied against Sydney’s controversial lockout laws, which he said had curtailed opportunities for young musicians that he himself had benefitted from.Wearing a pin in support of the Keep Sydney Open campaign, he thanked the venues at which he’d performed, “especially the small ones ... because that’s where music evolves, that’s where all the exciting stuff happens, and that’s what’s getting shut down right now”.“To our policy-makers and our politicians, please keep Sydney open so that the young artists, so that the next generations of musicians, can have the same opportunities that I had,” he told Guardian Australia on the red carpet.

And that’s what I’m going to try and keep doing.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Robbie Williams (right) presents the Aria award for best video to 21-year-old Troye Sivan.

Photograph: Paul Miller/AAPMarriage equality and Sydney’s lockout laws mobilised the crowd more than many of the performances did, with Crowded House raising one of the biggest responses of the night with their induction into the Aria Hall of Fame.Flight of the Conchords, Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement, eventually presented the award after some territorial posturing over frontman Neil Finn’s hailing from New Zealand.“We can’t let this happen. You have enough bands in Australia,” said Clement.“We really need Crowded House, our musical Hall of Fame is more of a Doorway of Fame. So stop it Australia,” said McKenzie.After an acceptance speech from Finn, in which he remembered Paul Hester, the band’s drummer who died in Melbourne in 2005, Missy Higgins and Bernard Fanning performed Crowded House classics Fall at Your Feet and Better Be Home Soon.Crowded House – still in black tie, which, for Finn, constituted a very purple suit – then performed Distant Sun from the band’s 1993 album Together Alone.

In contrast, the four ticketed concerts Crowded House will play from Thursday to Sunday will be capped at just 6,000 punters a night, Finn said. “[1996] was a time when there was a complete absence of health and safety,” Finn told media. “It’s a wonder that no one died. People look after each other in those situations – and it’s nice when a population can be trusted.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Flume, Jimmy Barnes and Jessica Mauboy: highlights from the 30th Aria awardsHe said the band was “determined to make those shows sing and fly and be as good as – if not better than – what we were like 20 years ago”.Finn had condemned Australia’s “detention and mistreatment of asylum seekers [as] completely unacceptable” before he performed with Paul Kelly at the Aria awards in 2014.“It’s still the same,” he said on Wednesday. “It seems like a very strange place to be commenting on it but it’s a deeply concerning thing. It really is.”John Butler and Ben Lee, who appeared on stage together to present the Aria for best male artist, acknowledged the traditional custodians of the land, with Lee adding: “We also want to use this opportunity to say we stand with Standing Rock.”Nakari Thorpe (@nakarithorpe)Best calls of the night - Acknowledgement of country from @JohnButlerTrio & showing solidarity with #StandingRock from @benleemusic #ARIAsNovember 23, 2016      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Ben Lee (left) and John Butler present the Aria for best male artist.
