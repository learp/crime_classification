Eleven-year-old Jake hates his new school because he caught meningitis, which left him with severe hearing loss in both ears, so he finds it hard to make friends. One day Jake’s mum gets him a hearing dog whom he names Echo. They are best friends until Echo is stolen. Will they ever see each other again?I like this book because it is exciting, adventurous and funny. I couldn’t stop reading it because it was so gripping and you could see the determination of Echo (the dog) and Jake (his owner) when they are trying to get back together. Echo is a very brave and smart dog who won’t give up however difficult things become. I felt quite sorry for Jake because it must have been very difficult to have hearing problems and also start at a new school. You can learn a bit of sign language from reading this book and I didn’t know before reading it that children can have hearing dogs. I wanted to keep reading to the end because I wanted to find out if Echo and Jake would get back together. It has a good ending but I’m not going to say what happens as I would spoil it!How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
