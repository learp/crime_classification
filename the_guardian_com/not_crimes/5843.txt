David Cameron is prepared to consider contacting Vladimir Putin directly to raise the "very serious issue" of the six Britons who have been detained in Russia following a Greenpeace protest against oil drilling in the Arctic last month.The prime minister told parliament he would personally speak to the Russian president if it would help the plight of the detainees, who learnt last week that the authorities had decided to downgrade their charges from piracy to hooliganism.One of the British people currently in detention is activist Phil Ball, from Cameron's constituency of Witney in Oxfordshire. The other five are freelance video journalist Kieron Bryan – who had been hired by Greenpeace to document the protest – engineer Iain Rogers, and activists Alexandra Harris, Frank Hewetson and Anthony Perrett.Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Cameron said the Foreign Office minister David Lidington was dealing with the case on a daily basis.But he added: "I think this is a very serious issue and I have spoken about this in the house before, not least because one of my constituents is involved."I will look at every single intervention I could possibly make in order to help and if contact directly with President Putin would be helpful, then that is certainly something I would be prepared to consider."The prime minister's offer came after a question from Labour MP Chris Bryant.The MP for Rhondda told Cameron that the German chancellor, Angel Merkel, had rung Putin despite the fact that no Germans had been detained."Have you already rung President Putin and if not, will you do so as a matter or urgency?" asked Bryant.The so-called Arctic 30 and their ship, the Arctic Sunrise, were taken from waters near the port of Murmansk on 19 September after two of them tried to board a Gazprom oil rig.The families of the Britons met Foreign Office officials earlier this month to discuss what action was being taken to help bring their loved ones home.In a letter seen by the Guardian, Harris told her parents and younger sister that she felt like she was "slowly dying" in her cell.Bryan's family, meanwhile, are still trying to understand why a journalist was detained for doing his job.Last week his brother, Russell, said: "From our point of view, they've replaced the piracy charges with other very serious charges, which still carry a maximum of seven years. We don't believe Kieron should be there facing any charges as a journalist and we still want him freed."
