Britain's borders and hanging baskets may look rather different this summer after stocks of busy lizzies, one of the nation's favourite bedding plants, were devastated by a type of mildew.Some suppliers – including B&Q, which normally sells about 20m of the plants a year – will not sell busy lizzies this year to help stocks recover.Impatiens downy mildew has thrived in the wet, mild weather over the winter and some horticulturalists believe it threatens to wipe out one of Britain's most popular plants.Experts including the gardener and broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh are urging gardeners to turn to other summer varieties such as geraniums, begonias, petunias or marigolds to fill their beds, borders, containers and baskets.Titchmarsh said: "Busy lizzies are a favourite of many gardeners and hopefully by taking this step the industry can take time to understand and control the problem."In the meantime there are some great alternatives available that will add a splash of colour and grow well in partial shade, such as begonias."Impatiens downy mildew is thought to have been brought to the UK with imported cuttings and was first identified in 2003. Commercial growers used a fungicide to control it but say the disease has become immune.Joclyn Silezin, horticulture buyer at B&Q, said: "Busy lizzies are a hanging basket favourite with gardeners everywhere and are simple to grow even in the gloomiest weather. With the very future of them under threat we have had to take drastic measures to find a replacement for the nation's favourite plant."Plant sellers Thompson and Morgan sold 9.2m busy lizzies in 2011 but will not sell them this year. A spokesman said: "We had problems last year because of the downy mildew and had to make a decision as to whether or not to sell them again."We decided that we didn't want to disappoint our customers, who may put a lot of effort into growing plants only to find they succumb to the disease. Hopefully by next year it will be under control and we will be able to bring them back."Suttons Seeds, based in Paignton, Devon, said it would continue to provide the plants. "We have printed information in our catalogues on how to look after your busy lizzies to help avoid downy mildew and we are also offering alternatives to them," it said. "We just felt that it is better to give the consumer all the information so that they can make their own choice as to whether they still buy them or not."The Royal Horticultural Society is advising gardeners who plant busy lizzies this summer to destroy any plants displaying symptoms immediately. The mildew appears as a white powder on the underside of leaves, causing them to yellow and fall off.
