It began with a coil of black smoke spiralling up from the hay in the dusty confines of the barn. This had previously been "sweating" for two weeks but now: "Time to ring the fire brigade," said Clive Owen who farms Ravenseat Farm on the Pennine skyline near the Tan Hill Inn, said to be the highest hostelry in England. His wife, Amanda, also a rangy six footer, needed no reminding of the threat of a hay barn fire so near the family farmhouse. Back home she herded their five children behind an imaginary line to keep their inquisitiveness at bay, her original plan of driving a Land Rover with lambs to sell at Kirkby Stephen market that afternoon forgotten.Now it was action stations before the fire engines from Hawes and Reeth arrived. At 1,360ft – on the wind-blasted heights above Arkengarthdale and Swaledale, and in the path of sweeping draughts over beautiful heather-clad purple moorland beloved of Pennine Way and Coast to Coast travellers – every moment counted. Up clambered Clive on a ladder to the top of the hay to check the threat; down came the pea-hen he found sitting on two eggs, the latter smudged with soot, to be relocated on a grassy bank outside.The engines arrived and he greeted the firefighters with a request: could they direct their hoses gently so he could remove what bales were not actually alight relatively unscathed? As the smoke intensified, sooting up clothing and lungs, they battled on removing what bales they could before breaking through to the source of the smoke now exposed to the draught and revealed as a fireball, though still under control of the fire crew. Why the conflagration? Clive wipes his brow, after saving 130 out of 330 bales. "Little bit of moisture", he says, "and a lot of pressure. Big bales strapped tight, the right atmosphere to work up a sweat in the barn, and then … spontaneous combustion."
