An ochre and charcoal artwork by an internationally exhibited Aboriginal artist from far north Western Australia has been sold for $1,800 – from a charity shop.The artwork, titled Spearhead Dreaming, turned up in a pile of donations to St Vincent de Paul’s Brunswick opportunity shop in December.Shauna Patterson, the store manager, was helping sort through the stacks and said she knew immediately they had found something special. “When you are working with so many different donations, you just really start to get an appreciation for something which is really beautiful,” she said.They flipped the 120cm by 80cm painting over and saw it had been signed on the back by Marcia Purdie, a Gija (Kitja) woman from Halls Creek in the East Kimberley who is part of that region’s artistic tradition of using natural pigments – ochre and charcoal – to paint dreaming stories.Battle for bark art: Indigenous leaders hail breakthrough in talks with British Museum It was put on sale for $1,800 on Tuesday and, by Wednesday, had been snapped up.David Wroth, the co-director of Japingka Aboriginal art gallery in Fremantle, WA, is putting on an exhibition featuring some of Purdie’s work next week.One of her paintings, of a similar size to the one donated to Vinnies, has been given the sticker price of $2,900.Wroth said Purdie’s work “stands up very well” next to celebrated East Kimberley artists like Rover Thomas, Jack Britten and her own mother-in-law, Shirley Purdie.She had her first solo exhibit in 2001 and was included in a 2005 Indigenous art show in Washington DC.Wroth said the East Kimberley tradition was unique because it used ochre when most Indigenous art traditions, including in the central desert, had moved on to commercial pigments, and also because it used broad swathes of colour.“It’s coming to be collected and coming to be very valued,” he said, adding that 35-year-old Purdie was an “emerging name” but the combination of her technical skills and the cultural knowledge brought through family connections was impressive.Neither Wroth nor Kirstie Linklater, the director of the Artlandish Aboriginal art gallery in Kununurra, in the Kimberley, which also carries Purdie’s work, could trace the origins of the painting. Purdie herself was uncontactable.“It’s surprising, but you do hear about things that end up being rediscovered through things like Vinnies – I just think you call that a windfall,” Wroth said.Patterson, who said she was inclined to see the best in people, maintained the painting had been donated on purpose by people who knew its worth.“I like to believe it was generosity,” she said. “I think people are very supportive of what we do.”
