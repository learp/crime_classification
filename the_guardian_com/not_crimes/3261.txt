The olinguito, whose discovery was announced last week, is a remarkable creature. For a start, it is utterly engaging, with big eyes and a distinctive thick red-brown pelt. It has been likened to a cat crossed with a teddy bear.But the importance of Bassaricyon neblina, which has its home in the forests of the Andes, goes beyond aesthetics. The very manner of its discovery is instructive. The olinguito's existence was determined by careful analysis of old museum exhibits. These showed that the little carnivore had been confused with other similar-looking creatures over the past century and so had been overlooked by science.Fortunately, the creature's remains had been well-tended and curated and so researchers – once they realised their oversight – were able to analyse the DNA of pelts and skeletons in their collection to reveal the existence of the first new mammal to be discovered in 35 years. In times of austerity it is easy to question expenditure on preserving the past and the extinct. But as the olinguito story shows, such curation gives us a powerful tool for exploring the living world.
