I go out so rarely that just going out is amazing. I’ll listen to music while I get ready. Angry, nihilistic stuff like David Bowie’s Time is good if I’m going somewhere I’m nervous about. I’ve recently liberated myself from wearing body-hugging clothes. I’m trying to buy clothes that feel sensuous rather than styled. I’ve got into silk tunic dresses from All Saints or the White Company. I also love Dawn O’Porter’s Bob dresses. She dressed me in one called the Flack for the British comedy awards.I would love to be dressed more, because I loathe shopping. I buy loads of clothes from Asos that just sit there until I try them on in a bad temper, right before the returns deadline. I kind of hate clothes; I still wear hipster-style jeans and I’m always showing my arse – totally undignified for a woman of my age.I’m against lipstick, big time. Dark eyes need nude lips, so I just use a kohl pencil and lots of mascara. What I do is too accidental to be called a smoky eye – it’s more like a smutty eye. My mum taught me how to put on makeup as a teenager, and I’ve been doing it the same way ever since, although I have started doing my eyebrows. I tend to go quite dark, then think, “They don’t look dark enough”, add some black eyeliner, then I look in the mirror and go, “Jesus, I did not know that was happening.” I use a Mac foundation and, sometimes, Sally Hansen tanning spray on my legs.RJ Mitte: ‘I have more clothes than most women, and two stylists’ I don’t take my makeup off before I go to bed. It’s too boring. I feel almost the same about brushing my teeth: ritualistic washroom crap must take about six years off your life.• Nina Conti is on national tour with her In Your Face live show from 25 September until the end of November; go to ninaconti.net for details.
