Sam Smith, the warbler behind the theme for the James Bond film, Spectre, has won the best song Oscar.Smith’s song, The Writing’s on the Wall, is the second Bond theme to win the Oscar after Adele’s Skyfall took the prize in 2013. Like Adele, Smith had already won the Golden Globe for best song ahead of the Oscars.The Writing’s on the Wall became the first Bond theme to reach No 1 in the UK pop charts in October last year. Co-produced with dance act Disclosure, it achieved 700,000 combined sales of physical copies and streams in its first week, more than Skyfall, which made it to No 2. It may have been The Writing on the Wall’s year, but it was far from certain that Smith’s song would win the prize. Among his fellow nominees was Lady Gaga, whose song, Til It Happens to You was written for The Hunting Ground, a documentary that examines the issue of campus rape in US colleges. The Weeknd’s ballad Earned It, from Fifty Shades of Grey, was also expected to offer a strong challenge for the prize.

The Guardian’s Alexis Petridis called it an “X Factor song”. “The melody doesn’t dig into your brain: you keep expecting it to arrive at a showstopping chorus that never comes,” he wrote. However, the song did garner the support of former 007, Roger Moore, who tweeted: “Sam Smith has delivered a very haunting and wonderfully orchestrated #Spectre theme song. Well done!”
