Maria Miller’s report is to be welcomed (MPs urge action to fight ‘shocking’ bias against mothers, 31 August). However, there is little point in creating new rights until there is proper funding of Citizens Advice bureaux, law centres and other voluntary agencies to enforce those rights. Rebecca Raven was assisted by her union in her unfair dismissal case. A large section of female workers are not unionised and have to represent themselves.High tribunal fees, complex legal issues and aggressive correspondence from the legally represented employer deter the vast majority from pursuing their claims. Until this is recognised, the “shocking bias” will continue unchecked.Andrew Hillier QCSouth West London Law Centres • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
