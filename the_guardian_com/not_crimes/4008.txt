For almost 20 years, I have maintained my own company. It has given me the freedom to show the world how I feel and to learn how I can best present my flamenco productions. I have been able to do shows both with and without narrative, and to develop the work with dance and music in a very positive way. I’ve had to take a lot of risks – if you run your own company, you can stray from the familiar path to present something new.When I’m working on a new show, I begin on my own. Gradually I start to unify the music and the steps, and then involve the set, lighting and costume-design team. The whole process normally takes three or four months. Voces, which is about some of the artists who have influenced me, and which I am bringing to London this month, was created in an unusually short time, with the whole team working together in the studio.

If we are working at home in Barcelona, my son goes to school at 9am. The school is English-speaking, so I also do an hour’s English class each morning. We have a good team, very organised – we have now been working together for around 20 years – so that makes it possible for me to give time to both work and family. Once my son is at school, all of the dancers come to the studio to work with a trainer on an hour of warm-up and strengthening exercises. Then we rehearse from 10am to 5pm. After that it’s time to pick up my son and go home. I might do an interview or some other work – then it’s bathtime, supper, and everybody is ready for bed.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Flamenco is a way of life. It takes courage, but flamenco artists often have longer careers than other kinds of dancers. They learn to adapt themselves to a type of exercise that develops extra agility and vigour. Older flamenco dancers can perform with a strength that you will not find in other dance genres. But the most important thing in flamenco is passion. It is not about technique, but about emotion – if you don’t feel it, you can’t do it. It’s not just a physical expression – it must come from the heart.Ballet Flamenco Sara Baras is at Sadler’s Wells, London, 16-20 February.
