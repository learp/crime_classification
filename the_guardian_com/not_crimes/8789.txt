The roaring wind worked hard last night; it stripped the tattered remnants from the hedgerows and smashed the weaker, sapless twigs from the trees; it whirled the clustered ash-keys into space. Wind is more awe-inspiring, sounds more vindictively destructive in the dark than in the light. Then came a strange lull and impressive hush, and we looked out this morning upon the transformed world; the winter snow had come. The thaw followed quickly, and the peewits, fieldfares, and redwings soon found damp, bare spots where food was to be found; the tits and dunnocks discovered the insects which had been driven into shelter by wind rather than cold, and the autumn seed stores for the finches were soon available. Famine does not immediately follow the first fall of snow. There are limitations to the intelligence of insects. The winter gnats and small flies have sense enough to discover holes in which they can shelter from the wind, rain, or snow, though we cannot tell how they find them. They do not, at any rate, take into consideration the fact that their natural foes can also see and investigate holes. A pair of blue tits this morning were thoroughly enjoying the short-sighted policy of the sheltering insects which had selected one large hollow and were slumbering on its dry roof. The tits did not even enter; they could reach the food by hanging from the lip, and the ecstatic movements of the their short but expressive tails indicated their enjoyment.
