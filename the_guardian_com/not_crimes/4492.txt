Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains are country music’s Bowery: a landmark that everyone orbiting the genre – from Dolly Parton to Fleet Foxes – cites, regardless of whether they’ve been or not. On the other side of the world, however, perhaps it won’t be long until another blue-hued range is on the country map. Julia Jacklin hails from the Blue Mountains outside Sydney, and her debut, Don’t Let The Kids Win, evokes a millennial Gillian Welch. Put the two together (plus some terrible national stereotypes) and you envisage the young Jacklin strumming on a porch, harmonising with the dingos. But Australia isn’t in thrall to the States’ singer-songwritery heritage. “I’d say the [definitive] sound where I grew up was Australian hip-hop or soul music,” says Jacklin. “There’s not an indie-folk scene there.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest And yet 26-year-old Jacklin is now part of a bold young Oceanic Americana cohort. After moving to Sydney to study, she went to record her debut in New Zealand, working with producer Ben Edwards because she loved his work on Auckland strummer Aldous Harding’s debut. There she met Port Chalmers’ Nadia Reid, whose songs are full of haunted yearning, and Marlon Williams, who’s released volumes of country covers alongside his rousing original material.SXSW 2016: the insiders' guide on who to look out for this year Back home, meanwhile, there’s Sydney’s Gene Clark acolyte Caitlin Harnett and Melbourne’s Dylan-indebted Fraser A Gorman (his mantra: “Country music sounds to me like rock’n’roll!”). Jacklin rejects the suggestion that this thoughtful songcraft is a reaction against prevailing wiggier guitar trends down under, nor does she think it owes much to heartland Australian country music. To her, it’s just the product of supportive communities.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Mercifully absent from their output are the tweed waistcoats and civil war fetishisation beloved of the Mumfords et al: this lot bring dark humour and self-awareness to what can often be a painfully earnest genre. “If I am bound for something/ Honey, won’t you know that I always take the shortest fucking road,” Nadia Reid avers on Reaching Through, while Jacklin finds a pessimistic revelation in Leadlight: “I didn’t know that the grass was not only greener/ Upkeep is cheaper when you embrace the rain.”Rather than follow Fleet Foxes’ rustic trail signs, Jacklin says that discovering Father John Misty marked a turning point in her songwriting. Specifically, “that it was OK to inject humour and sarcasm and to put ideas into his music,” she says. “I’m not a very serious person, and getting up and playing serious music was boring to me.” Best tell the folks in Blue Ridge, there are new kids on the block.Julia Jacklin’s Don’t Let The Kids Win is out on 7 October on Transgressive
