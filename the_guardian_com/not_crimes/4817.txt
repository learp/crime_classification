“Oh my God, we’ve got scobies coming out of our ears,” says Clare Lattin, shutting the fridge door and placing two bottles of glowing kombucha on her vast kitchen table. For the uninitiated, a scoby is a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast used to produce fermented, effervescent tea. “Come by the restaurant and we’ll vac-pac one for you,” she offers.The restaurant could be one of two. Lattin is the co-founder of the diminutive European gastro-chic Ducksoup in Soho, and Rawduck in Hackney. A third venue with a focus on pickles and ferments is in the making. She also co-owns the food and drink PR company EightyFour (the client list includes the Hix restaurant group and the Chiltern Firehouse). Finally there’s a ceramics line, Vessel & Time, for which she sketches designs that are then produced by a potter in Dorset. She also finds time to handbuild her own ceramics. A board of clay vessels sits drying on the floor of her apartment. “One day, the dream is to just design and make jugs,” she says.Lattin’s apartment is on the ground floor of a converted factory in Hackney Wick. The building was turned into studios by a community of artists in the 1990s. “I came to a party here about 15 years ago, so I knew the community existed,” explains Lattin. “Then, four years ago, my friend [the artist Sue Webster] heard an apartment was coming up for private sale. I came to view it and that was that.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The book-lined sitting room with a large faded rug.

Delivery men come and go, and over the course of the day, a small pile of brown packages amasses at the front door, including a box addressed to Mr Reason and Mr Squalor (aka the Chapman brothers, whose studio is a few doors down). I’m curious about how people congregate. I love creating corners of different experience “It was very masculine when I moved in,” says Lattin of the cavernous apartment. Slowly, she has transformed the space, opening up the spare bedroom to create an office, adding internal French windows to the one remaining bedroom, and replacing the bathroom and kitchen. The industrial proportions of the property have been softened and apportioned with hanging fabric from Caravane and Linen Works . By the front door, Lattin has stitched offcuts of vintage Berber skirts from The Cloth Shop on to a plain linen panel. “I love hanging fabric,” says Lattin. “It’s an affordable way to divide space and it creates a sense of airiness that reminds me of being on holiday.”On open shelves throughout the space are groupings of carefully collected objects. “I’m fairly minimalist,” says Lattin. “I look for objects with texture and character, but it’s really hard to find things in the UK alone – you end up having to pay a fortune.” She points out some of her favourite finds, including a pink and blue tin plate from Damascus, and a pair of cracked French earthenware pots. For her, the faded pink and grey rug (from Maroc Tribal) recaptures the colours of the Nevada desert where she recently travelled to see the artist Nancy Holt’s salt tunnels. “It was the most peaceful experience.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A board of drying clay pots in the kitchen. Photograph: Kristin Perers“I’m really interested in the way people sit and congregate,” says Lattin. “And I love the idea of creating corners of different experience.” This is clear in her personal space and the way different forms of seating are used within it. In front of a bookshelf is an unupholstered armchair with a nude-pink cushion, and a birch plywood occasional table and stool from the Shoreditch-based workshop Unto This Last. There’s an Ercol bench, vast sofa and secondhand Thonet rocking chair gathered around a patchwork of monochrome rugs. In the kitchen, a Windsor chair faces the dining table and beside the desk space is a deep, built-in daybed.This interest also informs the spirit of her restaurants. “I wanted to open somewhere where you could pitch up by yourself, grab a seat at the bar and find good food, with good wines by the glass without paying a fortune for it or booking it two weeks in advance. The seating, the menu, the wine list… It’s all about promoting conversation in an intimate environment.” And sharing scobies, of course.
