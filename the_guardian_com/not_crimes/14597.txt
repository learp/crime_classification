Newly left behind by the falling tide, the jellyfish gleams wetly on the still shining sand. It is the most perfect specimen of a compass jellyfish I've ever seen. Slightly domed and perhaps the size of a large side-plate, the creature is so pale a cream as to be transparent, the sand on which it is resting clearly visible beneath. Unlike that wickedly pretty and fantastical false jellyfish the portuguese man o' war, this is a creature whose good looks are based on restraint in both form and colour.From a dark spot at its centre, a series of V-shaped red-brown lines radiate outward and it is these, with their fancied resemblance to the compass rose, which gives the jellyfish its name. Sometimes the base of the V is filled with colour but on this individual the markings are simple, consisting of the lines alone. The perimeter of the stranded bell is fringed with scalloped lobes tipped with the same rich brown and, emerging from beneath the seaward side of its perfectly circular form, four long frilled feeding tentacles stream like a comet's tail. There is something about these bowl-shaped creatures that never fails to remind me of Lucie Rie's ceramics. But there is another side to this attractive creature: the tentacles can deliver a painful sting, and one this large is not something I'd necessarily want to encounter while swimming.This summer there are a lot more jellyfish to encounter than usual, with the Marine Conservation Society recording not only increased numbers, but also sightings of various species earlier in the year than normal. Some idea of the numbers involved are indicated by the incident of Monty Python-like improbability earlier this year when Torness nuclear power station was temporarily closed after the cooling water intake screens were blocked by a huge influx of moon jellyfish.
