The lambs, very white beside the grey-fleeced ewes, complained in infantile tones when the rain drifted in dense clouds over the windswept fields, but the leaf-buds, opening almost visibly, welcome the warmer wind and invigorating rain. Round those Cheshire farms where damson trees line the hedges as well as the orchard borders white blossom is everywhere, and in many orchards cherry, plum, and pear are well decorated; a few yards from where I now write some beautiful sprays of pink apple blossom are already open. In the fields, beyond easy reach of urban root-grubbers, primroses are plentiful, and jack-in-the-hedge and silver stitchwort whiten many a roadside ditch; a little sun after the rain, and countless still folded flower buds will burst open. Although I met with several dainty willow wrens feeding along the now green hedgerows and in the bushes by a small stream, not one burst into song; they repeatedly called plaintive “looits,” but seemed too depressed by the dull sky to sing. The sand-piper, the redstart - announced by “R. C. S.” from Surrey, - and the yellow wagtail are due here now, but I failed to find them in likely spots. There may be a rush of migrants any time now. “H. H.” - I have several times stated in these notes that not only are there white and piebald blackbirds, but that this species is more given to such “sports” or variation than any other; indeed a white blackbird is far commoner than a white sparrow.
