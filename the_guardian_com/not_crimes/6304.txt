Bruce Springsteen’s decision to cancel a concert in North Carolina over an anti-LGBT law has been called a “bully tactic” by a US congressman.On 8 April, Springsteen cancelled a concert in Greensboro because of a controversial law that critics say legalises discrimination against LGBT people. Under the law, all public institutions must post signs designating that bathrooms and locker rooms are to be used only based on the biological sex reflected on their birth certificate. Springsteen issued a statement explaining that he and the E Street Band did not want to play the gig because they “want to show solidarity for those freedom fighters” protesting against the law.From Jim Crow to transgender ban: the bathroom as battleground for civil rights Speaking with the Hollywood Reporter, North Carolina Republican congressman Mark Walker said that it was “disappointing” to hear about Springsteen’s much-celebrated decision. “Bruce is known to be on the radical left and he’s got every right to be so,” said Walker, “but I consider this a bully tactic. It’s like when a kid gets upset and says he’s going to take his ball and go home.”Major companies including Disney and Netflix have threatened to relocate productions from North Carolina if the bill was passed. Walker, however, claims the legislation does not “target the LGBTQ community” but “targets impostors,” he said. “It’s a little crazy to think sexual predators wouldn’t be devious enough to pull something off if they were free to go into any bathroom they want.”“Some things are more important than a rock show, and this fight against prejudice and bigotry, which is happening as I write, is one of them,” Springsteen said. “It is the strongest means I have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards.”
