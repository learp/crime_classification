While James Duddridge may be exercised by John Bercow expressing an opinion (Report, 13 February), as a constituent of the Speaker I can report that he is completely impartial when it comes to his constituents, for he is neither allowed to vote in the Commons nor raise questions on the floor of the House on our behalf. It is the political disenfranchisement of his constituents that is truly scandalous.Alex HatfieldLongwick, Buckinghamshire • My heart skipped a beat when I read Claire Ptak’s ice-cream sandwiches recipe in the Valentine’s Day edition of Cook (11 February). The ingredients, to serve two, include a 500ml tub of ice-cream, eight digestive biscuits and 200g of dark chocolate. I reckon that’s 1,356 calories per dessert. At that rate, the only heart you will be heading for is a heart attack. Clare WyffelsColchester• For Valentine’s Day, I recommend Claudia Roden’s Mediterranean Cookery. Crudités avec aioli; aioli avec fish stew, followed by Gippland’s garlic ice-cream. Beverages à choix. Your virtue may well rest inviolate (Letters, 13 February).Margaret WaddyCambridge• KeyKegs may be doing real ale a favour (Letters, 11 February), but being plastic, non-returnable and disposable they are an environmental nightmare.Nathan BrownSouthampton• In the north-east, pastry with currants (Letters, 13 February) was a “singing hinny” – “hinny” being Geordie for a woman. And the “singing” was the sound of it cooking on the griddle.Ruth RhodenLow Habberley, Worcestershire• To us it was simply “fly pie”.Leslie BeaumontCroston, Lancashire• I am pleased to see your letters about the definite article (passim) are not written by hoi polloi.George McLeanManchester • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
