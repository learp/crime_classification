First off, it’s pronounced “oo-bay”. Second, it’s a kind of yam. Third, it’s blowing up in Instagram foodie culture, as much for its velveteen purple tones as its taste – reckoned to be somewhere between pistachio, white chocolate, vanilla and coconut.Post-cronut, in the never-ending decadence war of online eating, the Wonka-ish ube is having a moment. Like the cronut, it has relied on the innovation of one chef, the intriguingly named Björn DelaCruz of hip Filipino restaurant Manila Social Club in Brooklyn, New York. DelaCruz decided to make ube donuts for his employees one day, as a snack.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Björn DelaCruz’s gold-covered doughnut with ube filling.

But for those without as much aspiration, he has taken regular ube doughnuts to the market at the perfectly reasonable rate of $40 a dozen, using frozen, grated ube – the fresh stuff was so obscure even New York couldn’t regularly supply it.

The result of this supply constriction was 200 foodies queueing in bleak Williamsburg mid-winter to grab their quota and take the obligatory photo.Since then, other restaurants and bloggers have turned the lurid tuber into a range of looks: velvet cheesecake, indigo ice-cream, magenta macaroons, purple pancakes, lascivious lava cakes and Filipino favourite Pinoy waffles.

For now, though, its crossover appeal is reason enough to pump up the jams.
