A loophole in Queensland mining laws could allow a startup company to avoid government scrutiny of its suitability to operate a coalmine with a $120m-plus environmental liability after raising less than $750,000 from investors.Batchfire Resources has inked a deal to buy Callide mine that may also not require it to seek a new environmental permit, sparing it from a possible hike in the amount of money it must guarantee for site rehabilitation should it go under.Batchfire, whose key shareholder, Ambre Energy, has a mixed record including a failed US coal venture that lost investors millions, has agreed to take over the mine from Anglo American by assuming all shares in subsidiary companies that hold the coal giant’s interest in Callide.Adani freezes investment in Carmichael mine until world coal price recovers This would leave the same company holding the mining leases, meaning there is no trigger for what a spokeswoman for the Queensland resources minister, Anthony Lynham, said would be “rigorous assessment” of a new owner by the Department of Natural Resources and Mines.Batchfire would face no compliance audit, assessment of its financial and technical capability or its capacity to continue operations and rehabilitate the site post-mining.The deal highlights what energy analysts and environmental lawyers say is the growing exposure of taxpayers to the risk of expensive environmental clean-ups as global coal giants unload less-profitable mines onto companies with far fewer resources.A spokeswoman for Lynham said approval from the DNRM of new owner was “only required where a mining lease is transferred”.“Approval is not required where the mining company itself is sold through a transfer of shares in the mining company to a new owner,” she said. “The mining lease remains an asset of the same mining company.”She confirmed no application to transfer the leases had been lodged with the department. It is not clear if the same Anglo subsidiaries, upon takeover by Batchfire, would need to seek a new environmental authority for the 7.4m tonne a year open-cut mine.If not, there would be no recalculation of “financial assurance” for mine rehabilitation – now a bank guarantee for $121m in the name of Anglo American – should the new operator collapse.Less than two years ago the Queensland auditor general found financial assurances held by the state generally went “nowhere near covering rehabilitation costs with no clear criteria for assessing these”.A spokeswoman for the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection suggested a transfer in the environmental authority would follow a transfer in the mining lease.Coal giants abandon unprofitable mines, leaving rehabilitation under threat “In general, should a mining lease be transferred, the holder of the EA would change, and financial assurance be recalculated,” she said.David Barnden, a climate and finance lawyer with Environmental Justice Australia, said the deal around the Callide mine highlighted “another example of regulatory failure”.“As the coal industry comes under increasing market pressure we’re seeing more and more examples of mining companies coming up with ways to avoid or defer their rehabilitation obligations,” Barnden said.“A number of new operators with unproven experience and minimal cash backing are buying mines cheaply. Unless regulators act now these sort of loopholes will be used more and more, increasing the risk that rehabilitation obligations will end up in the hands of companies that don’t have the capacity to fulfil them.”Barnden said share sale agreements like the one involving Callide “allow existing owners to relieve themselves of the responsibility and risk of rehabilitation liabilities, whilst the new owner avoids the scrutiny of the regulator”.“This transaction appears to be designed to take advantage of this loophole.”Ten of Batchfire’s shareholders, who together had pooled less than $750,000, are registered to a single house in Chapel Hill in Brisbane’s west.Batchfire’s largest shareholder, Ambre Investments, which has a 48% stake, is linked to a controversial resources play that last year lost investors millions of dollars in a failed US coal export venture that drew strong opposition from environmental groups.Ambre Energy had previously abandoned an unsuccessful coal-to-liquid fuel venture and been denied the opportunity to mine agricultural land west of Toowoomba by the former Newman government, which ruled it was “not in the public interest”.The Department of Environment and Heritage Protection spokeswoman said the state held a bank guarantee of $121m as financial assurance from Anglo American, the current holder of the environmental authority for the Callide mine.The government could not transfer bank guarantees from previous holders of environmental authorities, she said.Anglo has said the deal, under terms that are confidential, “remains subject to several conditions precedent”.Queensland gives Adani environmental permit for Carmichael coalmine Callide, an open-cut mine south west of Gladstone, has operated since 1944, with most of its 7.4m tonnes of coal a year sold to two nearby power stations.The 2014 auditor general report found the state was “exposed” to the cost of clean-ups and that both mining and environment departments were “reluctant to take appropriate action and revoke permits and claim financial assurance” where it fell short.“Environmental rehabilitation at the expense of those in the mining industry whose activities cause the damage, continues to remain an unrealised aspiration,” the report said.Reforms around the regime since the report include the environment department’s gradual takeover of managing financial assurance.The Palaszczuk government continues to review the scope of the bond scheme amid the prospect of a potentially costly clean up of Clive Palmer’s collapsed Queensland Nickel refinery.
