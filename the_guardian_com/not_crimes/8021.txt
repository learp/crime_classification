Is this the end of the road for One Direction?Liam Payne, one of the main songwriters in the British boy band, announced on Twitter on Thursday that he had signed a solo deal with Capitol Records.Liam (@Real_Liam_Payne)Happy to have signed to @CapitolUK.

Although no specific timeline has been mentioned, Harry Styles, aka the cool one, told reporters last year to “give it 18 months”.Directioners have cornered the market on obsessive online fandom and quickly had #OneDirectionisOverParty trending on Twitter – noting that it’s the group six-year founding anniversary in two days. dead inside cause 1D (@NoControlProjec)Brother: did you see Liam left?

Styles is currently filming a Christopher Nolan-directed movie called Dunkirk in France. Louis Tomlinson, the other main songwriter, is a judge on America’s Got Talent and adjusting to new fatherhood. Payne already had some solo songs recorded with rapper Juicy J that leaked earlier this year. But even boss Simon Cowell, who created the band, flamed the breakup rumors back in March.“I don’t know if it’s a hiatus or a breakup, to be honest,” he told Billboard.“In a weird way, I don’t want to know. I don’t think they’ve had enough time to experience what it’s like not being in the group to really answer that,” said Cowell.Although quitting the band does seem to pay off. Last March the internet nearly melted when Zayn Malik announced he was leaving the band permanently to be a “normal 22-year-old”. Since leaving, Malik’s single Pillowtalk debuted at the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and he’s dated supermodel Gigi Hadid.
