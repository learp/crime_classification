The story begins at the beginning of a school day as a class is given job assignments for a week’s work experience. Vicky, one of the main characters, is late as her lift, her brother Staggers’ moped, breaks down. This means she loses out on the exciting jobs and gets one of the worst assignments, that of an Assistant Sandwich Maker.While working as a sandwich maker at the big company, she uncovers a deadly truth about the company and seeks help from her friends. Together they set out on perilous journey to save a boy and expose the company’s evil practices.The story throws light on the fact that many companies are corrupt and will do anything to make money, even if that means causing illness and death. The company has no morals and it is up to the children to try to help those affected by the company. I liked this book because it was exciting, fast-paced and Andy Mulligan always shows how clever kids are. Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
