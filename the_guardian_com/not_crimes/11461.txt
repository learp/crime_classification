Maddy is ill, so ill she can’t stay in contact with the world. She hasn’t left her house in seventeen years. Then Olly and his family move in next door, and he is determined to meet her.Will Olly ever reach her? And will Maddy ever be able to see the world again?Better than I imagined it would be, this book was good because it was able to show a good romance in all of the strange turns and struggles and troubles in each of the characters lives. It was a classic romance story with all of your struggles of life, yet it did not seem to agitate as a classic story of heart break (and especially with this story as it the character struggles with multiple illnesses and issues). Another good part of the story was the fact that it shows people that they should embrace the world around them and sometimes take a risk, as it can be worth it. Particularly when love and romance are involved. Sometimes love is worth the risk.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Though, like every story, there were some issues with the book, like the fact that everything did seem to be a bit over-exaggerated in terms of the illness. I understand that these are extreme circumstances but as this story is meant to be realistic, I feel the whole scenario and situation was completely over the top and unlikely.I would give this book a 3.5 out of 5. Although it had issues in terms of the character’s illness and overall life with her mother, it had a good solid romance story that compelled me to continue reading and made me want to read more.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
