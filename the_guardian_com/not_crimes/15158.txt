Glencore has yet to finish erecting signs warning of contaminated river life near a Northern Territory mine more than a year after the miner and the state government became aware of elevated levels of heavy metals.Government documents have revealed inconsistencies in the information given to the public about potential lead contamination of fish near the company’s McArthur river mine, despite the NT government and mining giant being aware of recommendations for warnings since July 2014.Glencore first-half profit tumbles amid commodities rout Members of the four clans that control the lands in the remote Gulf region fish extensively from the river for food, and have previously expressed deep concern at the colour of the water downstream from the mine and potential contamination of fish.Glencore said it was yet to finish erecting the signs about contaminated fish because it is waiting for regulatory approval from authorities.Documents released this week show the Northern Territory government and Glencore were aware of elevated levels of heavy metals in fish, invertebrates and cattle around the McArthur river mine (MRM) in July 2014 but appeared not to immediately and fully inform residents and traditional owners of Borroloola, an Aboriginal community about 60km from the mine.The documents were obtained under freedom of information laws by the NT Environmental Defenders Office.A September 2014 briefing note prepared for the mines and energy minister noted an independent monitor’s report of “potential elevated levels of contaminants – in particular lead – in some fish samples in the Surprise and Barney creeks”. The two creeks are on the mineral lease and flow into the McArthur river.Further testing from the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries was requested on 4 July, with a note that if contamination was detected an immediate warning not to eat species or to limit consumption of species must be issued.In February 2015 another briefing document noted a “significant issue” of elevated levels of contaminants including lead in fish stock, zinc levels in oysters and lead levels in mussels in three different locations.“The chief health officer and the Department of Health have an overall responsibility to safeguard the health of the public,” it said, recommending MRM be instructed to erect warning signs along the two rivers and around Bing Bong port “advising people not to eat fish or other species from these waters because it may pose a risk to public health”.“MRM has not yet demonstrated that appropriate signage has been erected.”When questioned, Glencore told Guardian Australia on Thursday MRM had received the instruction to erect signs in November and had begun discussions with the chief health officer “regarding appropriate signage and the locations they should be placed”.“An approach was agreed to by the chief health officer in February 2015 and work began to implement the plan. Most signs have been installed as agreed. Some cannot proceed until we have clearance from the relative authorities.”Statements from the government and Glencore have been inconsistent on the extent of the contamination problem.Despite Glencore detailing its plans to erect the recommended signs, a spokesman for the current mines and energy minister, Dave Tollner, told Guardian Australia elevated lead levels were nothing out of the ordinary, were common in the region, and not related to the mine.Adam Giles: 'emotional' mine protesters need to have its benefits explained Giles on Wednesday also said there was no link to the mine, and denied the government and Glencore had failed to warn residents, pointing to existing advice to eat less fish and shellfish from the area.On Tuesday he threatened to order the mine’s closure if it did not improve its environmental practices and raise its environmental bond to cover eventual remedial costs. In a statement provided to Guardian Australia, Glencore Zinc’s chief operating officer, Greg Ashe, pointed to 2014 findings which did not show evidence of “mine-derived lead” in McArthur river and Surprise creek, and only recorded elevated levels in “small non-eating fish deep within the mine itself”.The company has previously acknowledged the Barney creek contamination in a location where fishing was not permitted, and said it could have been dust from trucks.Ashe on Thursday said the information contained in the FOI reports was out of date.“What we do have is a very small number of fish that were identified that contained elevated levels of lead, within the mine site on Barney Creek,” he told a Mining the Territory conference. “That is seasonal and we’ve done a lot of things there to see that,” he said.David Morris, principal lawyer at the NT Environmental Defenders Office said the inconsistencies were “remarkable”.“There is on the one hand a view being put by the government and MRM that everything is under control, that health issues and mine design issues are being addressed,” he told Guardian Australia.“On the other hand the FOI docs demonstrate the government is far from satisfied about MRM’s ability to manage the site … and remains concerned about health risks and potentially catastrophic impacts on the environment.”Environmental groups and residents of Borroloola have long protested about the potential adverse environmental impacts of the mine, demanding information on the contamination of waterways and a smouldering waste rock pile emitting potentially toxic fumes.An independent environmental report last year found 90% of fish stock in a nearby creek had shown dangerously high lead levels.At a minerals summit in Darwin in December, which residents picketed, the chief minister, the NT’s chief minister, Adam Giles, dismissed their concerns, saying “emotional” people opposed to projects just needed to be better educated about the benefits of mining.The documents also detailed the potential contamination of cattle grazing on the mine site.Last week, just days before the documents were released, the government sent out a media statement revealing the cattle contamination which began more than a year ago and saw a large number of animals shot, and hundreds more quarantined since. Before the FOI release, a traditional owner, Jack Green, suspecting it was the McArthur river mine the government was referring to, called for answers as many Borroloola families ran cattle stations around and downstream from the mine.“How can they guarantee the problem is fixed when cattle are still able to wander into Surprise creek and drink from the water because the surrounding stations are not fenced off properly?” he asked “We need to know if it is safe to hunt and drink the water there.” Tollner’s spokesman said the issue was with cattle owned by MRM getting on to the mine site which sits on MRM’s pastoral lease, and there was no need for any other cattle owners to be informed.The Environment Centre NT called on the mines and energy department head, Ron Kelly, to release information about the mine’s management plan, and the Environmental Defenders Office has called for a temporary closure while the contamination issues are sorted out.
