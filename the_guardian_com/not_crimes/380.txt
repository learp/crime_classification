From iPads to educational apps, technology has become commonplace in the classroom, but it is also the source of much debate.Benefits are said to range from student engagement to behaviour management. “We are moving away from simply ‘learning’ a subject or topic to ‘feeling’ the content,” wrote Graeme Lawrie, director of innovation and outreach at Sevenoaks School, earlier this year. “[Technology] allows a student to explore, to experience or to be involved in something, as if they are actually present in that environment or place.” A 2015 OECD report showed, however, that investing in classroom technology and computers doesn’t necessarily boost results, while applications such as MinecraftEdu have been challenged for being “a gimmick that will get in the way of learning”.With budgets becoming more and more stretched, can schools afford to invest in bringing technology into the classroom, especially when the results are so varied? This seminar will discuss whether technology is a money saver or a money waster for schools, including:Are schools too easily impressed by new gadgets? Or is tech getting an unfair press?How can head teachers judge what is a useful investment?How can schools make better use of the tech they have, at a time when budgets are tightened?DetailsDate: Thursday 15 June 2017 Time: 6pm - 8pm, with networking until 8.30pmLocation: The Guardian, King’s Place, 90 York Way, London, N1 9GUProgramme6 - 6.30pm Registration and networking6.30 - 7.30pm Panel discussion: Technology in schools: money saver or money waster?7.30 - 8pm Q&A8 - 8.30pm Networking and drinks receptionPanel Helen Caldwell, programme lead for primary computing, University of NorthamptonDonald Clark, founder, PlanB LearningHelen Goulden, executive director, Innovation Lab, NESTAMore speakers to be confirmed.Is this event for you?The event is aimed at teachers, governors, education technology experts, senior school leadership and academics.
