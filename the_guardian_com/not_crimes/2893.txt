In October last year I received a letter from the government telling me not to miss out on £140 help with my energy costs through the Warm Home Discount scheme. I qualified as I receive the guarantee credit element of pension credit. However, I have since learned that this only applied to customers of the bigger electricity suppliers.I am with Good Energy, which I chose because it supplies electricity from sustainable sources, but it is not in the scheme. So I lose out on £140. This seems grossly unfair. I have phoned Good Energy but there is nothing it can do. I also sent a message to my MP, to no avail. £140 would mean a lot. What a strange situation to be in. RS, Littleborough, LancashireStrange, but true. To qualify, we are sad to report, you will have to switch to another, bigger supplier. That’s because the Warm Home Discount Scheme is only available if you are supplied by a company that has at least 250,000 domestic customers. Good Energy has 55,000 electricity customers and therefore doesn’t provide the incentive.Guardian Money is a big fan of Good Energy and its pledge to only sell electricity from renewable sources – often its own wind turbines. However, £140 is a lot to those on low incomes, so you must decide whether it’s worth switching. If you do, but still want green electricity, Ovo Energy has a 100% renewables tariff and, crucially, is part of the warm homes scheme.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
