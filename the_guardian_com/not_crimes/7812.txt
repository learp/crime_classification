The adaptation will be Craig’s first major television series since the BBC epic Our Friends in the North in 1996. Aside from another Rudin production, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Craig’s recent work has been mostly confined to the Bond franchise, with the most recent film, Spectre, released last year. During the promotion for the film, Craig said “I’d rather slash my wrists” than do another Bond instalment, and that if he did do one, “it would only be for the money”.He later warned not to read too much into the comments: “I’m quite straightforward and I say things when I feel it and then I change my mind … I’m still enjoying [Bond] much more than I ever did, because I’ve been allowed to bring what I know to the role.” Craig recently added that he would play Bond for “as long as I’m physically able”.It was revealed that Craig was also behind one of the stormtrooper helmets in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
