When Zara Gaze, a sand sculptor, spotted a pile of sand by a construction site in Brockley, south London, she spied an opportunity to make a political statement about gentrification.Gaze, 38 and a single mother of one, used a spade and plasterer’s trowels to shape 40 tonnes of sand into a “fat cat” eating broccoli as a gesture of protest at soaring rents and the lack of affordable housing.“The place used to be an old garage and somebody had daubed graffiti – ‘enjoy your quinoa’,” Gaze told the Guardian. “I think it’s going to become flats that cost a ridiculous amount of money. I was on my way to a friend’s house and thought it too good an opportunity to miss.”Banksy’s refugee piece shows us how to protest – and grieve | Suzanne Moore After seeing the pile of sand on Saturday afternoon, Gaze returned to work on it from 10.30pm that night until 3.30am, when a foreman and security guard turned up. Questioned, Gaze said she had merely rearranged the sand that was already there. They let her take photos of her guerrilla art before she “toddled off” into the night.“It was great vibes, people were coming out of the pub offering me rollies. They really did get it. It’s a stupid pun,” said Gaze who moved to the area about 15 years ago.When she returned after several hours, her work had been flattened but the pictures she had posted on Facebook did the rounds. The fat cat represents a departure of sorts for Gaze, who says her previous sculptures, including works at Glastonbury, have been less political.“I feel like getting more political. People are pretty miserable at the moment, they are really pissed off at the government, so this is a call to other artists. People are not shouting enough,” said Gaze, who works as a signwriter. “It’s very difficult to live in London and many people I know are making noises about moving out of London,” she added.
