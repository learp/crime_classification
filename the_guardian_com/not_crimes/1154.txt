It's one of those days when the cloud has persisted at ground level all morning and, despite the slight but steady breeze, has remained completely unmoving. At the beach the landward limit of visibility is defined by the half-hidden dunes, and on the other side by a few yards of grey sea which merge seamlessly with the grey of the mist. As I advance along the beach the mist keeps pace, retreating steadily before me and following stealthily behind so that I walk in a curiously hushed and chilly cocoon. Pale gulls appear briefly, sailing silently along the ridge of the dunes, and even the oystercatchers feeding at the shoreline are uncharacteristically quiet.All the familiar landmarks are hidden, when I become aware that the enclosing mist, though just as dense, is no longer a light-deadening grey but is becoming brighter and creamier. Unexpectedly, the clouds have parted to reveal a very small patch of blue which, rather than being immediately re-engulfed, begins slowly to widen. Though still behind a veil of cloud, the sun is now visible as a hazy silver disc. There is a faint but perceptible rise in temperature, colour begins to break up the monochrome of the day and it appears the mist will soon be vanquished. It does not lift or thin, however, but gradually clears as if being pushed apart by some unseen force. Over a now blue sea it rolls back in two dense walls like a scene from a biblical epic. I head for the highest point of the dunes, the ideal place to watch the continuing drama of the landscape's reappearance, as from here both the sea and the inland hills can be seen.But whatever factors caused this unexpected respite, they are changing, and by the time I reach my vantage point the tide of battle has turned and the mist is sweeping back, swiftly regaining the ground so recently lost.
