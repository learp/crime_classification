Women’s rights campaigners and human rights groups in Peru have vowed to appeal against a ruling that clears jailed former president Alberto Fujimori and his health ministers of criminal responsibility for a nationwide family planning programme that resulted in thousands of forced sterilisations in the late 1990s.The ruling came just hours before Peru celebrated its national day and the inauguration of a new president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, last week.Public prosecutor Marcelita Gutiérrez ruled that neither Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year jail term for human rights abuses and corruption, nor three of his former health ministers should be prosecuted for the state-run policy, under which hundreds of thousands of women and men were surgically sterilised between 1996 and 2000.After a year-long judicial investigation the ruling said the reproductive health and family planning programme had not violated human rights as part of a state policy, and individual medical personnel were responsible for the “isolated cases” where women were sterilised without consent. It recommended five doctors should be charged.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  The shameful history haunting Peru’s electionsMore than 300,000 women and men – mostly poor and indigenous – are understood to have been sterilised in the late 1990s in Peru, and many of them were forced or coerced into having the procedure. Many continue to suffer emotionally and physically from the operations, which were often botched or carried out in insanitary conditions.“Thousands of forced sterilisation victims have seen cut short their hope to obtain justice,” said Marina Navarro, executive director of Amnesty International Peru.“[This is despite] solid evidence that the medical personnel [who] applied the family planning programme were pressured to reach sterilisation quotas and that, in many cases, the women did not give their free and informed consent.”Women’s right groups – who reacted immediately to the ruling by interrupting a military parade and picketing the prosecutor’s office – have vowed to continue campaigning for justice.“We will persist until those principally responsible are punished,” said Maria Ysabel Cedano, executive director of feminist NGO Demus.Peru's forcibly sterilised women find their voice Carlos Rivera, a lawyer for the Legal Defence Institute, said an appeal had been lodged with a senior prosecutor, who has 30 days to decide whether to reopen the case.Fujimori has always claimed that the family planning programme was intended to reduce the birth rate to alleviate poverty. Fujimori, his then health ministers (Alejandro Aguinaga, Marino Costa Bauer and Eduardo Yong Motta) and his daughter, Keiko Fujimori, who narrowly lost her presidential bid in June’s elections, have always denied forced sterilisation was state policy.But Dr Hernando Cevallos, who was the leader of regional chapel of Peru’s medical doctor’s union, says the orders came from the top.Cevallos – an incoming congressman for the leftist Frente Amplio coalition – reported to the attorney general’s office in 1997 that health ministry officials had ordered 12 doctors to sterilise about 250 women over the course of four days in Piura, northern Peru.“The clinic barely had the care facilities for a patient having a natural birth, let alone for major surgery on such a scale,” said Cevallos.“The health ministry set goals and deadlines, for example, 150 or 200 people must be sterilised over a weekend in order the reach the targets,” he said.“There were incentives like equipment for the medical facility so it could function properly, or prizes for personnel who reached or exceeded the goals and, of course, they put on festivals to lure in more patients.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Keiko Fujimori narrowly lost Peru’s recent presidential election to Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.

In January, a national database was set up to allow people to register their experiences of forced sterilisation.In 2003, the state paid compensation to the family of Mamérita Mestanza, who died during a surgical sterilisation in 1998.Peruvian women intent on bringing state to book over forced sterilisations In 2004, the state pledged before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to investigate and sanction those responsible for the sterilisation campaign but no one has been prosecuted.Felicia Mamani, 49, says she was sterilised by force in July 1997 when she was lured back to the clinic three days after giving birth and operated on under a local anaesthetic.“We were like lambs to the slaughter,” she said. “‘Now you will have no more children,’ the doctor said to me afterwards. ‘You’ve already got an army.’ This was a favour for me, he said.”Many more were coerced or given false incentives to be sterililsed, says Mamani, who lives in rural Chumbivilcas, in Peru’s south-eastern Cusco region.“How many country people, who couldn’t even speak Spanish, did they bring [to be sterilised], telling them they would not get hospital attention and would have to pay a tax if they had more children? How many?”
