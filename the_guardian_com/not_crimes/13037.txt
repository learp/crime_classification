Unmissable show?Aside from Judge Judy and Jeopardy, I also love a show here in America called The Profit, which is about an entrepreneur who goes in and fixes failing businesses. I also love How To Get Away With Murder and Scandal and Empire. And there’s a survival show over here called Naked And Afraid. Every night before I go to bed I have DVDs of Murder, She Wrote, and I realised that it’s very similar to Judge Judy in that it’s about figuring out a problem so that the truth is uncovered. That’s a common theme in the things that I like. It’s why The Profit and Naked And Afraid appeal to me. You have to break things down to the bare bones to build them back up again.Earliest TV memory?Watching Diana Ross and the Supremes perform on The Ed Sullivan Show. It must have been 1965. It was fantastic.Bring back…Unfortunately, most of the cast are dead now but I’d love to see The Golden Girls brought back. I’d love to see Murder, She Wrote, too. Angela Lansbury is such a watchable, wonderful actress. Even her scenes with no dialogue are compelling.TV turn off?I don’t like practical jokes. I don’t like when someone is being made fun of and they’re not aware that it’s a ruse. I’ve never been a victim myself but I have been ambushed by zoo radio people. What was the practical joke they played on me? Oh, I don’t know. I’ve forgotten. I’ve moved on.Pitch us a TV show…How about Celebrity Drag Race? I don’t think I need to go any further! You’ve got it! Drag doesn’t change who you are, it actually reveals who you are, so it would be interesting to see how those personas emerge.Mastermind specialist subject?Pop music. I love the Stock, Aitken and Waterman era when they ruled the charts, and my favourite song of theirs is Take Me To Your Heart by Rick Astley.RuPaul’s Drag Race, Monday, 10pm, truTV
