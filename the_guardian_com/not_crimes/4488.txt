Scott & Bailey9pm, ITVThe penultimate instalment of the Mancunian detective duo’s latest three-parter. With details about the online murder ring leaked to the public, it’s not long before Bailey (Suranne Jones) is seemingly in physical danger. Meanwhile, Scott (Lesley Sharp) is unable to help Taisie as the police pry into the nature of her communication with Sam. Mixing its leading ladies’ personal quandaries with a tale of dark web disarray, this is one of the sharpest and most convincing homegrown police procedurals around.

Photograph: Jude Edington9pm, Channel 4New series pointing a camera at Bedfordshire police. As is always the case with such programmes, it can barely help but be compelling – which is why so many of them are made. This episode leans on the hottest of buttons, as the cops discover a dozen or so stowaways aboard a refrigerated lorry. Among the many questions requiring answers is the one of whether the migrants climbed aboard of their own volition or were locked inside by traffickers. Andrew MuellerMurder in Paradise10pm, Channel 4In 2014, backpackers David Miller and Hannah Witheridge were murdered in Koh Tao, Thailand. They were not the first Brits to die in murky circumstances on this remote party island: as this unsettling doc explores, flaws in the police investigation played out against a need to protect tourism, a whiff of organised crime and the low status of Burmese migrant workers – two of whom are on death row for the killings, a conviction many observers find unconvincing. Jack SealeSupernatural10pm, E4“Half of hell is sort of freaking out, sir.” And so begins a new series of fantasy drama Supernatural, where darkness has been unleashed on Earth, bringing zero fun and all sorts of freaky occurrences and explanations. Sam and Dean are surrounded by dead people and bring a baby into the world, but can they protect it as the rabids close in? Reliable baddie Crowley is inhabiting the body of a woman initiating an orgy, which takes the fantasy aspect pretty darn far. Hannah VerdierMasterChef8pm, BBC1Craft is a top London restaurant run by award-winning chef Steve Parle. It’s the task of this week’s five contestants not just to cook every item on its menu but to do so within a demanding, high-stress environment where expectant customers will be paying actual money for their efforts. There follows an Invention Test in which they come up with a dish of their own to place hopefully before judges John Torode, Gregg Wallace and Marcus Wareing. David StubbsCaravanner Of The Year8pm, BBC2You’d be hard-pressed to come up with a more quintessentially English name than Grenville Chamberlain, the chairman of that exceedingly British body, the Caravan Club. In this charming little thing, he challenges six enthusiasts to compete for the caravanner of the year award. Before you can say “elevate the pop top”, we’re plunged into a polite war of reversing tests and awning assembly speed trials – and all without a crystal meth lab in sight. Ali CatterallCriminal Minds: Beyond Borders9pm, WA show you can enjoy equally as procedural froth, or as an anti-travel show for Trump sympathisers. In this spinoff series, Gary Sinise’s FBI unit are called to rescue folks in trouble abroad. Tonight: Thailand, where two US backpackers have gone missing (in a fictional echo of the Channel 4 documentary also showing tonight) after leaving a farm. Suspicion falls at first on a male companion from the US, but things quickly prove to be a good deal more complicated. John RobinsonFILM      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A pioneering career woman … Miss Potter. Photograph: Momentum Pictures/Sportsphoto Ltd/AllstarMiss Potter, (Chris Noonan, 2006), 9pm, BBC4A whimsical version of the life of Beatrix Potter that must have done no harm to the Lake District tourist industry or Potter’s publishers. Renée Zellweger’s Potter is a pioneering career woman as much as infants’ fantasist, and it’s stuffed with cute animated bunnies, awkward Victorian courtship (with her publisher, Ewan McGregor) and charming scenery.
