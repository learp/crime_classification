Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:34pmCancer is something that happens immediately; losing your hair is more gradual until you shave it off. They're hard to compare... Maybe someone will come along and say they can cure me of baldness.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.34pm BST13:34Kungfulil asks:Can you tell us a bit about your obsession with the Telecaster? Bit of a boring question I know, but I couldn’t imagine you with another instrument. Big love from an old fan.  Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:33pmThe reason is that Mick Green played one, and I wanted to be exactly like him. It just have a special sound. What it is: Mick Green played one, so the thing itself became an object of desire. I wanted a Telecaster, and there was one in the local music shop in Southend in the window, it cost £107, way beyond my means, I just used to go and stare at it. Eventually I managed to get it. It's always been the only guitar for me. It's just so simple and basic and it has a really mean sound - I love it.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.33pm BST13:33'Bob Dylan's If Not For You, put me in mind of my wife Irene.

Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:31pmI don't know that any songs did! That whole period, of when I thought I was going to die, it was one of the most intense years of my life. It gives you a different consciousness, and it's fading from me now like a dream. To try and put myself back there... I don't know about music. I can remember one afternoon, I was at home, and I've got one of these things you put your CDs into and it'll play stuff at random. There's a song, Bob Dylan's If Not For You, which put me in mind of my wife Irene. If I ever heard that song it would bring a tear to my eye. After she died, the song was that much more intense. I was listening to my random thing, and that came on, and I burst into tears, and then another one came on that was really poignant... record after record came on like that. I was just crying, sobbing my heart out, and it felt bloody great.Updatedat 1.38pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.31pm BST13:31moffifox asks:Since beating the devil and coming back to life, what is your biggest daily challenge sir?  Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:28pmThe operation meant that I'm on daily medication for the rest of my life, and have to remember morning and evening to take a handful of pills. I've become diabetic, so I have to give myself insulin injections and things, and sometimes I need reminding. I have to take this stuff called Creon, because they've taken my pancreas away, in order to digest food. So every time we stop for a meal, the band are like: take the Creon!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.30pm BST13:30jinbad asays:I was flabbergasted (in a good way) to learn of your devotion to Latin. Do you think it should still be taught in schools?  Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:26pmYes I do. Are you really educated if you don't have Latin? I only remember about three words myself... it is nice if you're in a cathedral or something and you can read the inscriptions on tombstones. And understand the derivations of words. It's culture - people should have a bit of culture. We should remember that Shakespeare had "small Latin, and less Greek".FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.29pm BST13:29Jean Noir says:Wilko how’s Malcolm? He taught me classical guitar in Salisbury early 80s – damn fine musician, picked up the lute in a matter of weeks as I recall!  Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:24pmThis is my brother. He's the same as ever, we're pretty good brothers. He's very different from me, a very calm guy and a brilliant painter. Malcolm carried on his classical guitar, and his lute, but also his painting - he's superb. A couple of years ago he had a painting exhibited at the Royal Society of Watercolourists exhibition. How is he? He's fine.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.26pm BST13:26jimbartlett asks:What do you miss most about Lee Brilleaux?  Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:23pmWhen I think of me and Lee, I think of two young people. The first time I met Lee, I was 18 I think, and he was about 14. I remember being absolutely impressed - he had a very vivid personality, he was funny. He had a dynamism about him, and he was always the leader, if you like. I just liked the guy. The last time we were involved together was a long time ago, we were both still pretty young - did that person continue? I don't know. I got the ache with them, with Dr Feelgood. The bustup was pretty acrimonious but I walked away thinking I didn't want to dwell on that - I just wanted to remember this great thing that happened, when it was good. I miss me from then, I miss us all from then - what were we like? It was good.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.23pm BST13:23Kevin Marsh asks:Are you still painting and would you like an exhibition in the Beecroft Art Gallery?  Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:20pmI did, years ago, have one of my paintings exhibited there at their annual exhibition. The other day I found this unfinished one of my psychedelic landscapes, a circular picture, and there was this photo lying on top of it, quite by chance, of me and my wife Irene walking down this long country path. And it fitted exactly in this trippy landscape, and I did start getting the urge again. Maybe I should try it again. But I don't know if I will.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.20pm BST13:20AgileJohm says:Really glad you are not dead :-), so can I have my money back from your farewell gig?  Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:18pmThe farewell tour was very emotional and great, the feeling I was getting from people. And going around going to awards ceremonies, and everyone knowing I was going to die... it's quite a buzz really. And then of course I was snatched from the jaws of death by Mr Huguet, and it was slightly embarrassing. Saying I'm gonna live isn't quite the same as saying I'm gonna die. But sorry, you can't have your money back.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.18pm BST13:18Ellis McKinnon says:Hi Wilko, forget the guitars;) tell us about your observatory and when did you first get interested in astronomy?  Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:17pmI first got consciously in astronomy when, in 1979 or something, Ian Dury and the Blockheads went to Australia for a tour. We had a long flight and were very jetlagged. It was nighttime in Melbourne, and we got to the hotel, and I went wow! The southern sky! I'm going to look at these stars! I went up to the roof and there was a swimming pool - I got one of those lilo things, lay down, and saw these stars. Wow, there were more than I remembered seeing at home, and they were coloured, and moving about! Then I realised I was looking at fireflies attracted by the pool lights. I realised I didn't know anything about the stars at home, or there. That was my first interest in it. Anyway, a few years later I was going to go to New Zealand for a tour on my own, and I thought I'd like to repeat this experiment but I'll get a bit of knowledge first. The thing that engaged my interest wasn't the constellations, it was: is the moon upside down in New Zealand? It's tricky. You try working it out. I looked in books and everything. Patrick Moore couldn't tell you. I was stood on my head trying to work it out. So I just had to go there. So I started looking at the moon, and seeing the way round we see it, using binoculars. I get to NZ, and there was no moon, each night. After a few days, I walked off stage and out of the gig, and there was the moon, upside down! I got into the habit of looking through my binoculars, and at Jupiter, you can see it's a disc, it's so exciting, and you can see the moons. This was so thrilling. This was the sight that told Galileo that everything didn't revolve around the earth, and changed our understanding of the universe, and it's so beautiful. Eventually I started buying proper telescopes, and now I've got a dome on top of my flat roof at home, and a great big telescope. Sit in the dome, man. It's good. Even if it's raining, with the rain beating down, it's great. I had a long break from that when I was ill, I couldn't climb the stepladder onto the roof.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.13pm BST13:13johnnylate says:Very much enjoyed the two Julien Temple documentaries, at the end of the second the energy and gusto with with you faced knowing you were going to die seemed to be gone. How much of that was to do with the operation and have you regained that drive again?  Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:10pmYeah, it took me a long time to recover physically from the operation. Charlie Chan told me it takes three years after an operation like that. I kind of wonder, I'm going to get better for three years, but I'm 68 - could I keep getting better and better until I'm 25 again? I don't know. I do feel very fit, but on the other hand I'm 68 - I'm starting to notice that I'm trotting along. Me and my son had to go to hospital for something or other, I'm trotting along behind him like a kid - we've kind of reversed roles. He looks after me. But I think I'm on it now.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.12pm BST13:12AgileJohm says:What’s it like playing next to Norman Watt Roy? So much energy night after night for 30 years.  Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:08pmWhat can I say? Norman is the reason I'm still playing after all this time. The first time I ever saw him was a television show, with Ian Dury playing live on television. I flipped - the next day I was going around saying did you see that bass player? When Ian Dury asked me to join the Blockheads, one of the great attractions was being able to play with Norman, and Charlie the drummer - the rhythm section was great, and I'm a rhythm guitarist. Eventually I got Norman to play with me. I just get such a kick, and it's 1-2-3-4 and it kicks in - it never diminishes. Every time I get a kick. You have to be careful when you go over to that side of the stage that you don't slip over in the lagoon of sweat he creates. The look of how he plays, it's everything. He's so popular with audiences - people love him and so do I.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.11pm BST13:11Right_On asks:Do you remember playing Middlesex Polytechnic back in the early 1980s?

Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:05pmI wonder if he means Lou Lewis - interesting character. He's still one of the crowd in Southend, I see him regularly.

I have seen you play many times over the years. Q. What is your fav strings and what is that D shape you play on Going Back Home?  Guardian contributor WilkoJohnson1 31 May 2016 1:01pmBack in the Feelgood days Rotosound would send me big boxes of strings, and T-shirts, but they don't do that any more. I don't know what brand I use now! Any old brand, as long as they're the right length. And that D shape is the basic thing that any schoolteacher singing Kumbaya uses. In fact a whole lot of what I do takes place on the third and fourth strings if we want to look at it like that. When I break strings, it tends to be the fourth - I lean on that quite a bit.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.05pm BST13:05ID225585 says:Where are your two original Telecaster guitars, the white one and the original black one signed by Bo Didley.
