Nigel Lawson once declared, “the NHS is the closest thing the English have to a religion”, while the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London revealed its unique place in the nation’s hearts.Every day it changes people’s lives. In one day, 1,300 people will die, 2,000 will be born and 1.5 million will be treated by the NHS. In 2014, it was declared the best healthcare system by an international panel of experts who rated its care superior to countries that spend far more on health.For all its problems – an overstretched workforce, increasing waiting times, bureaucracy, poor IT – the health service remains a national treasure. As Valentine’s Day approaches, we want to explore the love affair the UK has with the National Health Service.Are you a healthcare professional who loves their job?

Perhaps you’ve been helped to have a longed-for child. Or have you seen a relative’s life transformed by treatment? Are you from another country where the healthcare system is very different?
