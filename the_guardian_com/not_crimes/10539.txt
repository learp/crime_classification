I think it's good that people throw in the odd snarky one - it makes it a bit more like real conversation! I'm sorry that I'm not Doctor Who or someone, but you know, there we are.

Out of these three, who would you say you are most similar to and why?  Guardian contributor MilesJupp 21 September 2016 2:14pmI've always thought of myself of a cross between Gordon Brown and Pippa Middleton, for reasons that are, I hope, extremely obvious.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.14pm BST14:14ID6440291 asks:What was the programme you were recording near Teddington Lock about three years ago? Did it ever see the light of day?  Guardian contributor MilesJupp 21 September 2016 2:12pmIt was the television version of In and Out of the Kitchen, which saw a very thin glimmer of daylight. Filming at Teddington Lock was interrupted by a man who took his top off and wanted to jump off a bridge, but was talked down by the first AD, who was a former military policeman. Extraordinary scenes.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.14pm BST14:14Classshakercoola asks: Do you think “class” is something one ought to discover about another rather than it being imposed through self-reference in the hope to elicit the estimation in which one should be held by others?to which risennorth adds: Parklife!  Guardian contributor MilesJupp 21 September 2016 2:11pmYes. The estimation in which you're held by others should be unaffected by class, shouldn't it? But perhaps self-deprecating remarks that people make about their own class are in fact just as much a part of the problem as anything else. Really good question.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.10pm BST14:10UnstoppableSteve asks: With regards to The News Quiz, have there been any orders from above to take it easy on the Tories? It’s been noticeable that the government gets a fairly easy ride compared to previous series, especially when Jeremy Hardy’s not on the panel.  Guardian contributor MilesJupp 21 September 2016 2:08pmAbsolutely no way have there been orders to take it easy on the Tories. We're only two episodes in, so who knows what might happen. From the point of view of writing and performing on the show, pretty much anyone is fair game. But certainly Jeremy, as you suggest, is more likely to aim his ire to the right than the left. And very funny he is doing it too.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.08pm BST14:08ID8378794 writes:With the current politics in the UK and US, it must be a strange time for comedians as the reality seems a little surreal. Has this situation made it more or less difficult for comedians?  Guardian contributor MilesJupp 21 September 2016 2:06pmIt's made it easier in the sense that there is more to talk about. But harder to assume an aloof position from which you can reflect on the whole spectrum, because it's so obvious who the villains and the failures are.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.07pm BST14:07Thumbs-up for StaffordJennifer Woodyard asks: What did you think of the town of Stafford when you visited last week?  Guardian contributor MilesJupp 21 September 2016 2:03pmThat was my fourth visit to Stafford in recent years. And my favourite yet! What a great bunch of people.  Guardian contributor MilesJupp 21 September 2016 2:03pmThere was a Pizza Express near the station, and my tour manager had vouchers.

Which of these shows do you most enjoy appearing on and which comedians do you find the funniest in this format?  Guardian contributor MilesJupp 21 September 2016 2:00pmI really like being on Would I Lie to You? and Have I Got News for You. I think the person who has made me laugh the most on a panel show was Joe Wilkinson, who interrupted a needlessly unpleasant and filthy exchange on something with the words: "I can't believe I missed Zumba for this."FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.05pm BST14:05Lewis Coates asks: When you’re tucking into a nice bit of rabbit, does it make you think of Watership Down?  Guardian contributor MilesJupp 21 September 2016 2:02pmI remember once being on holiday with my parents in a restaurant in France, and pleading with my father not to eat rabbit.

As with Homer buying Marge a bowling ball, I bought it for my dad but kept it for myself. Given that you thought you could turn your hand to cricket journalism, which would have been your dream job, is there now a new dream job that has replaced it, and could you please write a book about your attempts to fulfil this unreachable destiny?PS: I saw you do stand-up in Aberdeen many years ago. Don’t remember anything about anyone else on the bill, but you were terrific. I have stolen your “getting abuse for being posh, so I instructed my servants to carry my sedan chair away as quickly as possible” joke on a few occasions. It went down well. Thanks for making me funny by proxy.  Guardian contributor MilesJupp 21 September 2016 1:51pmWould you read a book about my attempts to become a bounty hunter?

I know how to shake one’s booty as the youth say. Miles: Are you in or what?  Guardian contributor MilesJupp 21 September 2016 1:44pmIt depends which bits of each story you intended to appropriate. The dancing scenes in the Wicker Man are, I would have thought, preferable to those in Balamory. In fact, there is an actor that was in Balamory and the Wicker Man, but you will of course already know this as part of your background research... Juliet Cadzow. You've got to consider if you going to go the Edward Woodward or PC Plum route for your policeman character, but you may feel capable of making a policeman character that contains the best of both of them. But look, clearly this idea has legs, and if it doesn't happen then I think there are worrying implications for the future of the British film industry.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.52pm BST13:52abitofblue asks: Which relation of yours pulled some strings?
