As shocking as Steven Avery’s case is to Netflix viewers, his wrongful imprisonment for 18 years is not an isolated incident in the troubled US criminal justice system.Avery’s defence attorneys Dean Strang and Jerome Buting say there are systemic weaknesses in the system and that wrongful convictions are widespread, especially among the poor.

The documentary, which detailed their separate trials and Avery’s earlier release after 18 years of false imprisonment for rape, has become a cult hit for Netflix and made stars out of the defense team.“There’s a perfect storm that came together in Stephen Avery’s case,” Buting told the Guardian ahead of an international speaking tour. “Obviously he was the only gentleman who has been proven to have been wrongly convicted, get out of prison and then be charged with a serious crime like homicide. But a lot of the things you see in this case are not unusual.”Buting and Strang, who have become heroes to many viewers of the 10-part series Making a Murderer, will tour Australia in November hoping to bypass the media and speak directly to the interested public about the important issues the series raises.Buting says the time is right for the tour due to the growing awareness from true crime documentaries and podcasts like Serial.“The notoriety that the documentary has brought us means that we have an opportunity to speak out about systemic weaknesses in the United States’ criminal justice system, and that many people are willing to listen and engage us on those issues,” Strang said. “We are not the best imaginable people to undertake that conversation, but we are the lawyers with the best opportunity right now. It would be wrong for us to squander that opportunity or to fail to do our small part in encouraging Americans to demand more of their courts, prosecutors, defense lawyers and police officers. “We hope to provoke thought and, with luck, change in the way police in the United States interview people – especially young people – in custody, in the woeful underfunding of indigent defense, in perceptions of jury duty, in the wrongly pre-eminent role that finality today enjoys in the hierarchy of values in American criminal justice, and in any other shortcomings that engaged citizens may seek to fix.”Controversial Making a Murderer lawyer: 'I don't get Netflix at home' Strang and Buting come across as tireless fighters for justice in the film as they unpick the dubious methods used by the prosecution against Avery and Dassey, a teenager with learning disabilities. The unlikely bespectacled pair emerge as the moral centre of the story – sex symbols even – with their own army of fans and Tumblr tributes. “I found it frankly embarrassing that people would think of me as a hero when I was quite frankly just doing my job but there are many other people who are more deserving than me,” Buting says. “But for whatever reason I have been the focus and I really want to take the opportunity to get out and get people talking about what it’s like to be a criminal defence attorney and what happens in criminal courts.”Based in Madison, Wisconsin, Strang has become internationally recognised as Avery’s trial lawyer and has also been the subject of countless features celebrating why viewers love him and his fashion sense is the subject of a Tumblr.Buting, the taller of the two, is a past director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, a past president of the Wisconsin Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and a sought-after criminal defence lawyer in Brookfield, Wisconsin.Throughout the trial, which ended almost a decade ago, Strang and Buting were unimpressed by the media and that dismay has motivated the speaking tour. Buting says: “When the documentary first came out it was kind of apparent to both Dean and I that things hadn’t changed much in the nine or 10 years since we tried the case. The media were kind of shallow and hurried or they would interview us for 20 minutes and put two of the silliest things on the TV news, so that is sort of how our conversation on justice developed.“We thought it would be nice if we could have a forum where people could ask us questions directly or indirectly through a moderator and not have to filter through the media. And we could talk about the questions they have about the documentary and also the broader issues surrounding the documentary about justice.” In America upwards of 90% of criminal defendants are indigents: too poor to pay for a defence lawyerJerome Buting Buting says Avery did not get a fair trial because of the “bias and the downright malice” that developed from the $36m civil lawsuit for 18 years of wrongful conviction he had just taken out against Manitowoc County, its sheriff, and its district attorney. “I think that [the] law enforcement community has it in for him,” Buting says of Manitowoc County police force. “They told the public repeatedly that they were turning the investigation over to the neighbouring county and they weren’t involved but in fact they were involved in the most important searches of the entire case.”Avery’s family, who ran the local car yard, were outcasts in Manitowoc County and treated as second-class citizens, according to the film. “Class obviously plays a big role, in America upwards of 90% of criminal defendants are indigents: too poor to pay for a defence lawyer much less an expert or forensic tests,” Buting says.While the series has been criticised for being biased in favour of Avery and for omitting evidence which incriminates him, Buting says Avery has maintained his innocence throughout it all and has never slipped up.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Netflix’s Making a Murderer under fire for bias“The reality is for the better part of two years he was incarcerated and then locked up in the supermax prison for the worst of the worst. All of his conversations with the outside world were recorded, he had no visits with his parents, if there was anything that was incriminating we certainly would have heard about it. And that’s hard to hold together for that length of time not to slip up.”Making a Murderer directors defend series: 'Of course we left out evidence' Even though Avery remains in jail, Strang says the series, which the convicted killer himself has never seen, has offered him hope. “Thousands of new ideas for scientific testing and further investigation have come in since the film was released,” Strang says.“Many people have rallied to Steven’s support, and that support has taken many forms. As importantly, perhaps, he clearly has new hope, which for a man serving life in prison without the possibility of parole is essential if he is to continue to aid his new lawyers in seeking justice.”Strang says the TV series and the speaking tour alone can’t change the way justice is done in America, but it will help. “As an incremental and intelligent addition to the dialogue and thinking already under way about the relationship between police and the communities they serve, about the gaps between the professed values of our judicial system and its actual performance, and about the over-incarceration of people in American jails and prisons, we hope that it can contribute to a lasting impact,” Strang says.A Conversation on Making a Murderer with attorneys Dean Strang and Jerome Buting begins in Perth on 1 November before heading to Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Auckland in New Zealand
