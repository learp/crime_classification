The record-breakingly expensive series The Crown leads the field in the Bafta ceremony , with five nominations in the academy’s annual television awards. Three of its actors are tipped for a prize, and the show also stands a good chance of winning the award for best drama.If the first series, which cost £100m, does take crowns of its own at the ceremony on London’s South Bank, the victory will be particularly sweet for Netflix, the company behind the production. Success would underline the achievements of the powerful network streaming service just as the Cannes film festival introduces a controversial ban on its streaming-only films competing for its Palme d’Or.The Crown, created by Stephen Daldry and Peter Morgan, tells the story of the royal family from 1947 to the present day and stars Claire Foy as Elizabeth II. The English actress, who also starred in the BBC’s adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall, will be joined on the red carpet outside the Royal Festival Hall by two of her co-stars in The Crown, Jared Harris, who plays King George VI, and John Lithgow, who plays Winston Churchill.But organisers of the Cannes film festival, who are unrolling their own red carpets later this week, are unhappy about the failure of Netflix to ensure a theatrical release for its feature films before streaming them directly to television. While two Netflix productions will compete this year for the Palme d’Or – Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories and South Korean director Bong Joon-ho’s Okja – such films will no longer be eligible, unless Netflix complies.Foy is Bafta-nominated for best actress alongside Thirteen’s Jodie Comer, NW’s Nikki Amuka-Bird and Happy Valley’s Sarah Lancashire. Harris and Lithgow will be rivals for supporting actor, and Vanessa Kirby is nominated for best supporting actress as Princess Margaret.Daniel Mays, who starred in series three of Jed Mercurio’s Line of Duty, is also a contender for supporting actor, as is Tom Hollander in the BBC’s The Night Manager. Nicola Walker will be up against Kirby for her role in Last Tango in Halifax. Siobhan Finneran is also nominated for Happy Valley, alongside Wunmi Mosaku for Damilola, Our Loved Boy.To win best drama, The Crown will have to beat ITV’s family hit The Durrells, Sally Wainwright’s gritty crime series Happy Valley and the BBC’s critically acclaimed adaptation of War and Peace.Benedict Cumberbatch is in line for best actor for his Richard III in The Hollow Crown: The Wars Of The Roses but will have to defeat a stiff challenge from Robbie Coltrane, who played a 1970s comedian accused of historical sexual abuse in Channel 4’s National Treasure.The ceremony will also celebrate the most popular TV moments. Ed Balls’s Strictly Come Dancing routine is in contention, as is Planet Earth II’s footage of a snake chasing an iguana. James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke trip with Michelle Obama in the passenger seat, and Danny Dyer’s revelation that his ancestry can be traced back to the British royal family on Who Do You Think You Are?, will also feature.Joanna Lumley, star of Absolutely Fabulous and The New Avengers, will be honoured with the Bafta Fellowship at the ceremony, which will be hosted by the comedian Sue Perkins.
