The morning's brisk northwesterlies have died away almost entirely and the stinging hail showers have given way to unbroken sunshine. Despite the lovely afternoon I have the whole long curve of the beach to myself, the expanse of sand made greater by the lowness of the tide. It is incredibly peaceful – even the oystercatchers who take off at my approach do so quietly, while the bar-tailed godwit feeding at the sea's edge don't take off at all and merely trot along a few paces to keep their distance before getting down to business again.It's not until I'm approaching the dunes at the end of the walk that I hear the first bird calls – a flock of approaching geese hidden by the wall of sand. But as the sound gets louder I realise it's not geese at all but the far more musical babble of whooper swans in flight. And then suddenly they are here, winging their way over the crest of the dunes. There are a hundred or more, pure white against a flawless blue sky, so low one can see the flash of yellow on the bill and the shine of reflected light in their eyes. They fly not in a mass but wingtip to wingtip in a long line, and as I'm still gazing up at them, entranced by the sight and the sound, further along the dunes a second, smaller flight of swans appears.I watch as the first group heads out to sea. They do not, as I think they might, gain height but stay low to the sea's surface and, still calling incessantly, recede in an undulating line of white against the deep blue. The second flight angles across to intercept them, and after a few seconds of confusion the two lines merge.Far enough out to sea to clear the headland they alter course from west to north-west and I watch them become smaller and smaller until they are lost to sight as they leave their winter quarters for their breeding grounds in Iceland.
