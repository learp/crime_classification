Lost in Showbiz is increasingly troubled by a series of anonymously sourced reports suggesting Kim Kardashian has vowed to “change her ways” after being the victim of a violent burglary.To everyone calling Kim Kardashian a bad role model, ​you're not exactly Gandhi yourself A couple of weeks ago, you may recall, Kim was in a Paris apartment when armed robbers broke in, held a gun to her temple, then bound and gagged her before throwing her in the bathtub and making off with millions of dollars worth of jewellery. Since then she has withdrawn from public appearances and social media. Or, as one far-from-isolated headline preferred it: “Has Kim Kardashian learned her lesson?”Attention, showbiz criminologists: there is no lesson, unless you require reminding – as so many seem to – that aggravated burglary is a violent crime. There are no circumstances in which people “ask for” violent crimes to happen to them, and anyone even so much as suggesting there might be is as stupid as they are spiteful.In fact, after all these years, I have finally found the circumstances in which I can honestly say I hope Kim Kardashian doesn’t change a thing.
