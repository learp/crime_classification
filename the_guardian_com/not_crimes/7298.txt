How many thousands of bluebells have been picked this week? The withered flowers are scattered along all the country roads which lead to the stations, dropped from weary, hot, and grimy hands; but there are far more which have reached their intended destinations, and brighten many an otherwise flowerless city room. It hurts us to see the discarded flowers, gathered but wasted, yet the very act of picking did the children good; they were attracted by and gathered beautiful things in beautiful places, and, best of all, in the open air. All the thousands which have gone have made no appreciable difference to the supply; the woods and banks where they grow are just as bright a blue as at the end of last week.The tough shroud of the pupa case has been split by soft but swelling bodies, and the white butterflies have crept out of their prisons and allowed their crumpled wings to grow and burden. They are not like the tortoiseshells, awakened sleepers after a winter rest, but for the first time are enjoying freedom as perfect adult flies. So, too, the roof-winged alder-fly has left its aquatic home of immaturity, and whirrs on new-found wings as a creature of the air. It swarms alike around mere or tiny pond.
