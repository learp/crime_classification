Dave Chappelle SpecialsThe last accusation you could level at Dave Chappelle’s two new standup specials for Netflix is that he has let the constraints of political correctness keep him from saying what’s on his mind. However, aside from the Bill Cosby and Caitlyn Jenner material, what really shines through is Chappelle’s effortless timing and technical excellence. Available now, NetflixCatastropheHow will Sharon react to Rob’s tumble off the wagon? Will her dad get a decent farewell? And how will the show handle the loss of Carrie Fisher? Hopefully with the same tart irreverence that makes it such fun.

This series, perhaps inevitably adapted from a web comedy, documents the travails of a hapless fictional rock band from Toronto. Monday, 11pm, VicelandThe Trip to SpainSteve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s hugely entertaining mobile midlife crisis continues with a jaunt to Spain. Who could have guessed that watching two greying entertainers doing impressions, and critiquing each other’s table manners could be such fun?

A snoresome season’s finale is here, and Team Rick, the Hilltoppers, the Kingdom and the Scavengers are going to war. RIP Negan? Monday, 9pm, FoxChild of Our TimePeculiar things are generally happening in the brains and bodies of 16-year-olds. So, as Robert Winston and Tanya Byron return to the group of 25 children whom they’ve been monitoring since the year 2000, we can probably expect a little more turbulence than usual. How are these youngsters coping with their raging hormones? Expect sex, gaming and paragliding to figure. Monday, 9pm, BBC1American Playboy: The Hugh Hefner StoryIs Hugh Hefner an exploiter and objectifier of women? Or a sexual and cultural emancipator? Might he even be a bit of both? This new Amazon original series tells his story – it’s an authorised version so expect an intimate view, possibly through rose-tinted spectacles. From Friday, Amazon PrimeThe Get Down      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Street smart… The Get DownBaz Luhrmann’s somewhat Marmite hip-hop history returns for its second turn around the block (party).
