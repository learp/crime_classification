Paul Daniels has left hospital to spend his “final days” at home after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, his son has revealed.The entertainer is sticking to his belief that when “it’s your time it’s your time” as he spends his last days at home surrounded by his family, Martin Daniels told the Sunday Mirror. The 77-year-old fell at home and was taken to hospital suspected of suffering a stroke, although he was later diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour, his son said. “There’s no treatment which can help him. Doctors haven’t said how many weeks or months he might have – and we haven’t asked.Paul Daniels, magician and entertainer, diagnosed with incurable cancer “He knows things are not in his hands now and we are living in the knowledge every day is a bonus. It is unbearably difficult. He has said before when ‘it’s your time it’s your time’ and that’s how he is trying to face up to things.” Martin Daniels, who is a magician himself, cut short a tour in Argentina after receiving a call from his father’s wife and assistant, Debbie McGee. The entertainer remained upbeat while undergoing tests in hospital that later revealed he had a rapidly growing brain tumour, his son said. “A couple of days after I arrived to see dad in hospital he was up and walking about trying to cheer up all the other patients. He said to me, ‘right I am going to have a wander round now and see if everyone is all right’. “He went round the beds saying hello, making jokes. He sat at the nurses’ stations. He was doing a little ditty by the door to the ward saying, ‘roll up, roll up, visiting time is over folks’.” Daniels, who is said to be “lucid”, was at his Thames-side home surrounded by his family, said his son, adding that the support of his fans had given them “tremendous strength at what is a very difficult time”.
