It was a steamy August day in Atlanta and Margaret Mitchell was crossing the road to go to the cinema with her husband when she was struck by a car and dragged seven feet before the driver could bring the car to a stop. At the hospital, she hung on for a few days, her fans and family hoping and praying. At noon on the fifth day, 16 August 1949, the author of Gone With the Wind died, aged just 48.The book she wrote lives on. First published in 1936 – 80 years ago this month – Gone With the Wind received a stupendous reception. Despite being sold at the high price of $3 during the Great Depression (around $52 –£37 – today), Mitchell was mobbed, losing a button and a lock of hair to eager fans on publication day. Between June and December, around 1m copies flew off shelves.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A 1939 poster for Gone With the Wind.

Nor is its appeal is limited to the English-speaking world; it is available in Amharic (Ethiopia) and Farsi (Iran) and in 2012 the book was translated and published in North Korea, where the themes of war, hunger and famine resonate with local readers.In Atlanta, the house where Mitchell lived and wrote Gone With the Wind in is now a museum devoted to her memory. The homage from the American south is well deserved; Mitchell gave her readers an indomitable southern heroine, reframed slave-owning plantations as beloved homesteads and reduced the complications of race to huggable slaves who adore their owners. Such is the magnificence of Mitchell’s historical revisionism that many contemporary readers would assume that she lived through the civil war herself, felt first hand the loss of dignity that came with defeat. This was almost true, as Anne Edwards points out in Road to Tara, her biography of Mitchell: while the young Margaret was born long after the war was over, she was reared on a solid diet of civil war reminiscence; on their Sunday afternoons, her family devoted themselves to the stories of veterans turned bards. One can see how the tales of a glorious past influenced Mitchell’s novel. Writing, after all, is the author’s means of retrieving moments, and even worlds, made remote by time or tragedy. But a novel can sanitise entirely the inequities of real history. Gone With the Wind, however, takes liberally from its author’s life. As Edwards tells it, the protagonist was originally named Peggy, like its author. Also like the actual Peggy, the fictive Scarlett is tormented by unrequited loves. Both enjoyed the hedonism of prewar gaiety and ill-advised marriages to rakish men. On record, Mitchell admitted only to the likeness of Prissy (the slave who helps deliver Melanie’s baby) to a servant named Cammie. If Gone With the Wind was inspired by Mitchell’s life, it is worth noting what was left out. Mitchell lived at a time when her beloved Georgia enforced discriminatory Jim Crow laws that mandated the separation of blacks and whites in schools, trains and most public places. If the romanticism of Mitchell’s novel was a beautiful, literary reconciliation with defeat, segregation could be considered its ugly, legal twin. The defeated south could not revert to the days of slave plantations, but via segregation it could confine its former slaves to a social position where they could not fraternise, shop, eat, or use the same drinking fountains as their former owners. If, in Mitchell’s reality, blacks were free but unequal, in her book they are flat and one-dimensional, enduring the cruellest sentence a novelist can impose.In an essay on Gone With the Wind, New Yorker cultural critic Hilton Als describes the effect of Mitchell’s brand of white supremacy on himself, a young black boy watching the movie version for the first time: “I loved [Scarlett] so much and I didn’t want her to suffer,” he confesses, even though “Scarlett in real life might have lynched a nigger in order to make that person pay for all the inexplicable pain that she had gone through.” Als’s words describe the premise that Gone With the Wind enacts: that it is the white and beautiful who must be rooted for, their individual complications considered, their possession of privilege assumed rightful, and their complicity in injustice ignored. How must a woman who longs for a world of slavery be evaluated? It is not a question that bothers most readers. But it is in the details of cultural relics like Gone With the Wind, preserved here in the name of nostalgia, that the nubs and seeds of a resilient bigotry pass from one era into another.
