Combining height with a voice of unusual breadth and depth, Tim Pigott-Smith was born to play authority – and often authoritarian – figures.His stage work included two memorable Shakespearean kings – Leontes in The Winter’s Tale at the National Theatre in 1988, and Lear at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in 2011 – and one quasi-Shakespearean ruler: a future King Charles III in Mike Bartlett’s blank-verse fantasy about the succession to the throne of the current Prince of Wales.A particular cruelty of Pigott-Smith’s unexpected death is that he had only recently begun to reach the scale of success his talent had always suggested, receiving a Tony award for the Broadway run of Bartlett’s play last year and an OBE in the 2017 New Year honours list.After becoming a TV face as vicious colonial policeman Colonel Merrick in ITV’s magnificent Indian Raj drama The Jewel in the Crown in 1984, Pigott-Smith was regularly directed to the forces uniform section of TV’s wardrobe departments.He spent three years of ITV peak time as a police chief constable in The Chief, and was outstanding in Paul Greengrass’s 2002 film Bloody Sunday as Maj Gen Robert Ford, the officer in charge of the notorious violent suppression of a Derry peace march in 1972.Tim Pigott-Smith: a life on stage and screen – in pictures What’s striking is that none of these key career roles would naturally win the audience’s sympathy; even Charles III was an ambiguous and wilful figure. Unlike many leading men, he was always willing to play negative personalities, enjoying the challenge of finding nuance and vulnerability in apparent villains.Pigott-Smith’s approach to roles combined physical and intellectual attention. The key to his fine Lear was precise medical research into the symptoms of dementia. His astonishing Charles III was crucially not an impression, but a complex characterisation: sampling some of the Prince of Wales’s vocal and gestural mannerisms, but bringing all of the actor’s Shakespearean experience to imagining the psychology of a man who had waited more than 70 years for a job.Although the success of King Charles III would have allowed Pigott-Smith to do pretty much what he wanted in the West End or on Broadway, it felt typical of him to choose a production of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman that was due to start performances at the Derngate in Northampton on Monday before touring to 11 UK venues. The actor was intriguingly cast in one of his least monarchical parts – salesman Willy Loman, victim of the American dream – and the project had huge personal significance for him because Willy’s wife, Linda, was to be played by Pamela Miles, to whom Pigott-Smith had been married for 45 years.It was devastating for both of them when Pamela was forced to withdraw from the production last week after a rehearsal room injury, but that blow now seems small after the horrific shock of Tim’s sudden death before rehearsals on Friday. That the couple – greatly loved by each other and by the acting profession generally – were robbed of the possibility of appearing in a project they so prized is a bleak aspect of his unexpected loss.It is some consolation, though, that a TV version of King Charles III – a play that the actor considered a highlight of his life – was completed and will be shown on BBC2 this year. Though this memorial to him is far too premature, the part perfectly showcases Pigott-Smith’s kingly vocal and physical presence.
