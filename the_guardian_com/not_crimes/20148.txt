Despite a US president-elect who believes climate change to be an epic hoax, science suggests that the Earth is likely to warm significantly in the next 100 years, making the likes of Mad Max and The Day After Tomorrow seem less and less appealing as a form of escapism. But worry not: Shell’s latest ad – set in a pastel-hued house that looks like something off a CBeebies show – gives us hope for the rise of sustainable energy.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest In celebration of the energy entrepreneurs it has collaborated with to develop concepts such as gravity-powered lighting, Shell has recruited some publicity-hungry popsters to warble over a beat by EDM man-for-hire Steve Aoki. The connection between renewable energy and the likes of Pixie Lott screeching about “the best day of my life” isn’t entirely clear, but what is clear is that Shell’s vision of eco-utopia involves plenty of rancid cooking oil and recyclable mouldy coffee beans. Despite this fun singalong, though, let’s not forget that pissing away the world’s fossil fuels has already made many of its shareholders nearly as wealthy as a certain conspiracy-hungry demagogue.
