The single biggest challenge facing the arts and cultural sector is the pressure on local authority funding.In March the government launched its white paper for culture – the first of its kind for more than 50 years. It reaffirmed the importance of local authority funding in the national arts ecology. If you include libraries, local authorities are still the biggest funder of arts and culture in England. Bigger than the national government funding of the Arts Council and national museums, and bigger than the current lottery support.But given their diminishing budgets, local authorities are facing tough decisions about how they invest in arts and culture. Although many councils have an informed understanding of the benefits of arts and culture, unlike social care – local government’s biggest cost – the funding of museums and theatres is discretionary, not statutory.Culture spending by councils 'down 17% since 2010' Since 2010, local authority investment in arts and culture has declined by 17%, or £236m. Councils will be asked to find even greater savings in the years to come. Our recent report with the New Local Government Network, Funding arts and culture in the age of austerity, sets out the scale of this funding decline. While local government spent £1.2bn on arts and culture in 2014-15, the cuts, which have fallen fairly evenly across museums, libraries and galleries, are still significant and likely to continue. London boroughs saw the largest cuts in arts and culture spending, at 19% between 2010 and 2015, while local authority investment in museums declined by £33m over that period.New ways to sustain arts and cultureThe Arts Council cannot replace all the funding lost from local authorities, but we do want to encourage councils across the country to work with us to develop creative, innovative solutions. We can only invest where local authorities keep the faith with arts and culture. We’re in, if you’re in.In spite of the landscape, many local authorities are already finding new ways to sustain arts and culture. First, with innovative partnerships: the libraries west consortium is a partnership of library services in the south west that use a shared management system to pool resources and achieve economies of scale. Some authorities have teamed up with universities; in Durham, the university will host an exhibition of the former Durham Light Infantry Museum’s collection.Second, by diversifying funding in imaginative ways. Kent county council has developed an innovative approach to procurement: potential applicants for multimillion-pound waste contracts are encouraged to consider how they can support arts and culture, opening up income streams for artists. Liverpool city council is scoping out a voluntary levy on businesses that rely on tourism and a hotel bed tax to support arts and culture. Gloucestershire’s city council, meanwhile, is focusing on preventative health by partnering with the NHS Gloucestershire clinical commissioning group and others to create a pilot project that uses culture to deliver a range of clinical outcomes.Who would be a librarian now? You know what, I'll have a go The Arts Council deploys funds in imaginative ways to support local authorities, such as our creative people and places programme, which invests in places with low levels of arts engagement such as Blackpool, South Tyneside and Nottinghamshire. The Arts Council wants to see a better balance of spending between London and the rest of England. Historically, 60% of ottery funding was distributed outside London and 40% within the capital. In 2015, this shifted to 70% outside London and 30% inside. And in the next two years, we’re promising to push this to 75% and 25% respectively. While the Arts Council cannot change the economics of local government or bridge the funding gaps, we can use our relationships as a national development agency to broker new partnerships. We can focus special funding on particular areas of need and invest in the best ideas. There are ways forward that can make a difference and we should all advocate for the transformative powers of arts and culture for everyone.This is an edited version of a speech by Peter Bazalgette, chair of the Arts Council, on local government and the artsTalk to us on Twitter via @Guardianpublic and sign up for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.
