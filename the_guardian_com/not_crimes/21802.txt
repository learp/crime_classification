In one of the year’s more unexpected pop collaborations, Carly Rae Jepsen has teamed up with the none-more-Nathan-Barley PC Music team for a new single, and we’re premiering the video for it here.PC Music: the future of pop or 'contemptuous parody'? Super Natural by Danny L Harle (feat. Carly Rae Jepsen) marries Jepsen’s pop smarts to PC Music’s aggressively trebly, saccharine ear for something that sounds like pop, but off to the side. “The way I got wind of the whole PC Music scene was through my friend, Nate Campany,” Jepsen told The Fader earlier this month. “I was in LA, and Nate said, ‘You’ve got to come check this out, I promise you haven’t heard anything like it.’ I met Danny and he was instantly charming, and all the things you want in a collaborator – just somebody who’s very excited about the whole thing. He played me some stuff and the first feeling I had was, I’ve never heard anything like this! Today in music, that’s such an exciting feeling. When it comes to collaborations, what excites me the most is doing something that’s completely outside the world that I have been in. It’s fun to get into Danny’s world for a while.”The video is directed by regular PC Music collaborators Bradley & Pablo, and Harle called it “a huge landmark for PC”.
