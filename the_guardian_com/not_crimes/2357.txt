As an artist and Tate member I was at first amused to read of the whip round among staff for a leaving present of a boat for Sir Nicholas Serota solicited by the Tate management (Report, 28 April).However, I was appalled to learn of the level of insecurity and hardship apparently experienced by Tate staff being asked to contribute. I was further appalled to see Tate Modern also nominated as a candidate for this year’s Art Fund museum of the year, not least as it has recently opened the £260m Switch House, a massive new building of mediocre design, largely empty of art, next to the original monolith.Sir Nicholas, while having many notable achievements to his credit, has sat unchallenged atop the British art establishment for 28 years (and will continue to do so at the Arts Council). In that tenure many questions have been asked over such matters as the cosy role of artist trustees – for instance the scandal over the purchase of Chris Ofili’s The Upper Room, and the apparent revolving door relationship between artist trustees and Tate patronage (currently being enjoyed by Wolfgang Tillmans). I share the dismay of Tate employees being asked to contribute to Sir Nicholas’s nautical send-off, but I have an alternative suggestion for a leaving gift – a pair of net curtains.John KeaneLondon• I worked for nearly 40 years as a specialist curator in a national museum and have watched with horror the increasing separation between management and specialist staff. Numerically the former have increased at the expense of the latter until they must account for the lion’s share of the wages bill. Without the expertise of curators, conservators, scientists and others there may be little left of value to market, advertise or share with a public which is already being sold short. Our national institutions are unable now to offer the ready access to study collections and to curatorial knowledge which formed the most important of their core functions.Gillian VarndellColchester• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
