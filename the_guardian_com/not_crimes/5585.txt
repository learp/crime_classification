How do you mostly listen to music?In the car it’s always radio - Radios 2 and 3 most frequently. Everywhere else it is (more often than not) Spotify on either decent headphones or speakers. It is an amazing platform, with access to so much music, which I would happily pay a lot more for. I like the fact that different parts of my musical listening appear on different formats, for example my musical taste during 2000-2001 is almost exclusively to be found on Mini-Disc!What was the first record or cd you bought?    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest A cassette of Aha’s debut album Hunting High and Low, bought with my pocket money. Music videos were an incredibly powerful development during the 1980s, and Take On Me is iconic. I had the opportunity to revisit it in 2009, reworking it as Take Me On for Stephen Deazley’s Cabaret Baby.What was the last piece of music you bought? David Bowie’s Blackstar.If you found yourself with six months free to learn a new instrument, what would you choose?As a percussionist I play hundreds of instruments, all requiring different techniques and approaches. Over the last 18 months I have spent much time learning what is possible with my Canna Sonora (or Aluminium Harp) which is a friction instrument of solid aluminium rods originating in Capone-era Chicago. I would love to spend six months studying and playing more hand and stick drums in West Africa (Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal), the groove and sense of rhythm found in this corner of the world is infectious and simply makes you want to move. I have studied and performed this music widely, but after scratching the surface I just want to dive back in.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Max de Wardener’s Im DorfeIs applauding between movements acceptable?It totally depends on the context and how the audience as a whole is listening to and engaging with the performer(s). For my money a good performer will make it clear when to and when not to clap, but when it happens to me I’m generally pleased as it means there’s a very direct connection between myself and the audience, through the music. Clap if you are having a good time, but if you are unsure in a formal setting, wait a second, because no one wants the evil eye!What’s been your most memorable live music experience as an audience member?As a child: watching Stravinsky’s Petrushka from the choir stalls at the BBC Proms. The music and performance was electrifying, I loved and laughed at the brilliant trumpet fanfares. It threw me into a new musical world, and I set about listening to and digesting music by Stravinsky, Zappa and Varèse. As an adult: Kraftwerk’s Trans Europe Express (part of the band’s The Catalogue world tour) at Sydney Opera house, the production and sensory experience was spell-binding.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest We’re giving you a time machine: what period, or moment in musical history, would you travel to and why?I spend my time working almost exclusively with living composers to create new work. So, I would like to jump forward 100 years and see what new sounds, performances and technology are happening in 2116. It would also be interesting to see how music history treats the music of today.Do you enjoy musicals? Do you have a favourite?No, I find it one of the hardest forms of music to enjoy. Which conductor or performer of yester-year do you most wish you could have worked with? It is incredibly hard to look past the immense talent of Johann Sebastian Bach. There is something so precise and pure about his music. I am particularly fond of the Cello Suites and The Art of Fugue. The idea of Bach writing a suite for percussion or simply improvising together is a surreal but deeply rewarding experience.Which non-classical musician would you love to work with?      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Miles Davis Photograph: David Redfern/RedfernsUsing the time machine again, Miles Davis, and Gil Evans as arranger. Imagine you’re a festival director here in London with unlimited resources. What would you programme - or commission - for your opening event? I would commission some new British music, something big, which a large and diverse audience could engage with. What do you sing in the shower? The most melodic thing I am currently working on. Today that is ’33, 44, 78’, from The Filthy Fifteen by Nicole Lizée.It’s late, you’ve had a few beers, you’re in a Karaoke bar. What do you choose to sing? Nothing. I would politely decline.
