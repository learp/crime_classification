The winners of the 2016 Hugo awards have been announced, with this year’s choices signalling a resounding defeat for the so-called “Puppies” campaigns to derail the venerable annual honouring of science fiction literature and drama.The winners were announced on Saturday evening at MidAmeriCon II, the World Science Fiction Convention held this year in Kansas City.The Puppies are taking science fiction's Hugo awards back in time As in previous years, there had been attempts by two separate groups, the Sad Puppies and the Rabid Puppies, to “game” the awards in favour of their preferred slates of works. Both groups claimed that science fiction has become dominated by a liberal, left-wing bias.The Hugos are voted on by those who purchase an attending or supporting membership to either the current or previous Worldcon events. Eligible voters can tick the “No Award” box if they don’t agree with any of the shortlisted works, a tool which has been used to block out Puppies recommendations previously. In 2015, five No Awards were given, including for the prestigious best novella and best short story categories; an unprecedented number, as No Award had only been presented as many times in the entire history of the prize, which began in 1953.In contrast, this year there were only two No Awards, in the smaller best related work and best fan-cast categories.Best novel went to NK Jemisin’s The Fifth Season, a richly-detailed story of a planet undergoing a periodic and catastrophic season of apocalyptic climate change. Jemisin has previously clashed with Rabid Puppies co-ordinator Theodore Beale, who was expelled from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America after he publicly called the black author an “educated but ignorant savage”.The highly-acclaimed Binti by Nnedi Okorafor scooped best novella. The tale of a member of the first member of the Himba community on Earth to be accepted into a prestigious intergalactic university, Binti also won the Nebula award for the same category earlier this year.And best novelette was given to Folding Beijing by Hao Jingfanq, a Chinese science fiction story which, translated by Ken Liu, appeared in Uncanny Magazine.The best short story, best editor long form, best editor short form, and best professional artist awards all went to women nominees — respectively Naomi Kritzer for her piece Cat Pictures Please, Ellen Datlow, Sheila E Gilbert and Abigail Larson.In other categories, Neil Gaiman’s return to the character that made his name earned him the best graphic story award, along with artist JH Williams III, for Sandman: Overture, while Oscar-nominated film The Martian and Marvel TV show Jessica Jones won for the best dramatic presentations.The Hugo Awards: George RR Martin, Vox Day and Alastair Reynolds on the prize's future While only two No Awards were given this year, the Hugo award organisers now face the decision of whether to change how the nomination system currently works. With people able to buy supporting memberships to Worldcons — even if they have no intention of attending — to ensure they have a say in what ultimately gets on the ballot, the Hugos remain democratic, if vulnerable to internet campaigns.The 2016 Hugo award winnersBest novel: The Fifth Season by N.K.
