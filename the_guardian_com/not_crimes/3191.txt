4.25pm BST16:25Sarah MarshWe are about to close comments, but wanted to say a big thanks to all of you who joined us today ... and now go forth and enjoy your weekends (whatever they entail).As I said earlier, this is a new Friday feature. We want to create a community space for our readers to share ideas and projects, and also engage with our journalists – finding out more about editorial decisions. We welcome more opinions on how to make this format work, so please share them in this form as well as in the comments. I will leave you with this picture sent in as part of our underwhelming UK weather/ holidays call-out. Hopefully you will have as much fun this weekend as this family (ahem) in Stonehenge, Wiltshire.

Is it time to abandon the dream of owning a home? Readers' views However the economic plight of young adults is not unique to the UK. The Guardian’s Millennials project examined the growing inequality in disposable income between millennials and baby boomers across the developed world. The figures show that young people’s earnings have not kept pace with the growth of that in other age groups in the UK, US, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Canada.We’re hearing more and more about the economic uncertainty faced by millennials around the world - rising education costs, stagnating wages, a more unstable job market, questions over the future of state pensions and for many in the UK a diminishing chance of homeownership. The potential social and economic impact of a generation that can’t afford to build up assets is not just a crisis for millennials but also for their predecessors and future generations.Updatedat 3.56pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.42pm BST15:42Why child refugees are the UK’s problem – by Amelia GentlemanAmelia GentlemanHere the Guardian’s writer on social affairs talks about going to Calais to talk to lone child refugees and the response her piece garnered.I’ve been looking at the online response to the piece we published earlier this week about lone child refugees in Calais. Broadly, it can be divided into two categories: people who say it made them feel sad or angry and people who say this isn’t Britain’s problem.A lot of people in the first category asked how they could help. Volunteers and donations are needed by the charity Help Refugees that provides a lot of the food in Calais. Donations are also needed by the Women and Children’s centre in the camp. Citizens UK is campaigning on the issue and has ideas about how to raise awareness on a local level. Home for Good is working on increasing the number of foster families ready to look after asylum-seeking children.   Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi for the GuardianIn the second category many people responded that this is a problem for France to sort out, and argued that the British government should look after its own children first. But (as people interviewed in Calais explain), France is trying to sort it out, and is already doing a lot. Volunteers in the camp do tell the children that they should apply for asylum in France and not risk their lives trying to come to the UK, and over 300 unaccompanied children in Calais already have. But those who haven’t applied often have friends or relatives in the UK, or have been told by their parents that they will be safe there. Why is it the UK’s problem? The government has already agreed that is has a “moral duty” to help, and has included in legislation its commitment to give homes to some of the most vulnerable children stuck in Europe. The reason why people are getting angry now is that fewer 20 of the tens of thousand unaccompanied children in Europe have been housed here.This piece doesn’t attempt to address the wider, incredibly complicated immigration debate – just focuses on the fact that in Calais, there are dozens of very vulnerable, primary school aged children, living without their parents in the worst conditions imaginable. Three months on from the government’s commitment to help, very little has happened.Editors here have agreed that we will go back in a month to see what progress has been made. I really hope it will be a more positive report.Updatedat 3.42pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.26pm BST15:26Guardian readersBack to politics and you are continuing to discuss Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith’s leadership hustings. Get involved by clicking on the comments here, or scrolling to the bottom of the page for more.   DonutHingeParty 05 August 2016 1:05pmI'm a Labour member and pretty despairing of the whole situation. Aside from Trident, there seems very little bluewater between the two candidates, and lets face it, the whole point of Trident is that by the time its launched (or not launched) we'd be dead anyway, so we'd never actually know.I want to get out there on the doorsteps talking about the party to constituents, but at the moment its like trying to sell a fire damaged house, and when you're taking people round it catches fire again.I'm hoping that at Conference we can all kiss and make up, and start working together to build an effective opposition to take on the Tories in the run up to the 2020 election.I have a sneaky feeling that when the National Policy Forum reports to Conference, some of the policies they suggest may have already been raised by one Mr Owen Smith MP. Corbyn did say last night that he'd extend an invitation to build a new cabinet with people from all wings of the party - whether individuals choose to take that invitation will speak volumes to their constituents when it comes time for the Boundary Commission review.There is also the matter of the NEC being largely feted to be won by the Momentum candidates, which will change any future arbitration issues around rule interpretation and membership. Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith go head to head in tense Labour leadership hustings   sharness 05 August 2016 3:19pmI have been a Labour Party member for 42 years, cutting my teeth supporting Margaret Jackson (Beckett) in Lincoln in 1974. It may be my age but I am increasingly pessimistic about the future of the Labour Party if we do not offer a coherent, radical vision for the future security and prosperity of everyone (possibly with the exception of Boris) in a just and tolerant society. Traditional Labour voters, in my opinion, still believe in public service, hard work, tolerance, moral responsibility and the essential goodness in people. I detect similar qualities in the vast majority of our young people. What we lack is courageous, visionary, intelligent, inspirational, practical, fiery, feisty, articulate, sensitive, inclusive, energetic leadership. Not much to ask is it?I voted for Corbyn last time. I have no personal loyalty to him and would consider a viable alternative. However, Owen Smith is Andy Burnham Mark Two. Policy on a swivel. Soundbites and substance-free sugar. The PLP has yet to ask why Corbyn was so popular with members, many of whom have been moderate Labour supporters for decades. Until they have that discussion and listen, yes, listen, not talk, they will continue to be baffled by leadership election results. I have contacted any number of Labour MPs in recent months and only one has had the decency to reply with anything other than an automated reply explaining how busy they are; presumably talking to each other on Twatter (no I don't mean Twitter).FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.17pm BST15:17A guide to Instagram storyEleni StefanouSticking with pictures, we asked Eleni Stefanou, a social producer here at the Guardian, to talk a little about how her team are approaching the latest way to tell stories with Instagram.Instagram introduced a new feature this week called Stories. Here are some of the similarities it shares with rival app Snapchat: posts fill the entire screen, can be drawn and written on and disappear after 24 hours. Instagrammers were quick to call out the cloning – rapper Big Narstie perhaps best capturing the mood when he tried out the feature:Big Narstie shares his thoughts ...But those who protest may be fighting a losing battle. Instagram is the darling app of the fashion world and all the shiny stars in its gravitational force. Vogue magazine’s first Instagram Story, timed for the launch, had appearances from Anna Wintour, Cindy Crawford, Adriana Lima and Suki Waterhouse. Even Taylor Swift emerged from her semi social media hiatus to use the feature.Taylor Swift News (@TSwiftDailyNews)"What's going on? You feeling less like a cat and more like a squirrel today? Yep." - Olivia on #InstagramStories! pic.twitter.com/7hk8FleQprAugust 2, 2016These subtle endorsements will help normalise Instagram Stories and lend it its most lacking quality: spontaneity. Meanwhile, many news organisations, including this one right here, are giddy with excitement because they can now join in on the fun without feeling like they’re talking into an empty auditorium – Snapchat has been notoriously difficult for news organisations to reach an audience through because of its lack of discoverability (no hashtags, directories etc). But like most digital trends, the success of Instagram Stories will depend on human behaviour, which is, it’s fair to say, unpredictable.Here at the Guardian we’ll be experimenting with Instagram Stories to bring you information in a more immediate and visual way.

Sewage pollution of the coast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian“Parts of Guanabara Bay, which will host aquatic events, are teeming with dangerous viruses and bacteria, threatening the athletes as well as the 350,000 spectators who may want a dip in the sea,” he wrote. The comments underneath were really interesting and as of Friday the discussion remains open to comments. Here’s a selection:   wolandscat 03 August 2016 4:20pmThe Olympics bidding process is complete nonsense. No city bid should be accepted if the city has not already achieved sustainable, operating solutions for various basic issues including air cleanliness, water quality, safety and infrastructure. Instead, bids are accepted from places with massive problems in these areas, containing promises to 'fix everything in time'. Why would anyone think a city like Rio would fix in the 8 years since the bid all the problems never adequately addressed in the previous 300 years?   martinusher 03 August 2016 6:43pmIts simple. Once profit becomes the one and only guiding principle then everything else slides into a trough of 'just barely livable'. The well off can isolate their living conditions, the rest do the best they can with what they have. There's no mystery or magic to this -- look at the evolution of clean water and sanitation in Victorian London, from polluted wells and ad-hoc sanitation to piped water and organized sewerage. By the turn of the 20th century access to potable water was regarded as a right, not a commodity.Societies are actually going backwards. Privatization is retrogressive, a necessary step only for societies who have run out of options to make profits from productive labor. Its ultimately self-defeating as the health and welfare of the population as a whole is compromised.   UprightApe 03 August 2016 3:51pmBrazil has a vast coastline of pristine beaches, so why do the events have to be held in Rio at all? I will never understand this rigid, inflexible focus on coming out parties for Olympic cities. It was unrealistic to expect any cleanup when you factor in the "squatter" slums of some four million people that surround the city, built without water or sanitation. Cities should already be clean when that corrupt bidding process begins.Updatedat 2.25pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.04pm BST14:04Let the Games begin!Paul CampbellThe week before the Olympics is always a drag. It dawdles along with all the urgency of a slug in summer, only stopping to spit out bad news. So far week we’ve had word from Rio that the judges and referees might be corrupt, the water is dangerous, the infrastructure is collapsing, and that Great Britain might not even exist by the time the next Olympics come along.But we’ve been here before. In the week before London 2012 we worried about athletes not going to the opening ceremony, transport confusion and the exorbitant cost of the whole thing.'It completely changed my life': your memories from London 2012 The day before the opening ceremony in 2012, Mitt Romney reported “disconcerting signs” in London and suggested that the city was not ready for such a big undertaking. By the time the summer was out, everyone was asking a different question: had we just enjoyed the greatest Games in history?  The Olympic flag is carried by Daniel Barenboim, Sally Becker, Shami Chakrabati, Leymah Gbowee, Haile Gebrselassie, Doreen Lawrence, Ban Ki-moon and Marina Silva during the opening ceremony of London 2012. Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesThe turnaround might not be so spectacular this time around – and it is clear that the Brazilian government and the Olympic movement have serious, long-term problems that need to be addressed – but it’s worth remembering that, once the sport begins, little can touch the Olympics for magic. This is no ordinary sporting competition. The Games as we know them began in 776BC, when a Greek baker by the name of Koroibos stripped off his clothes and ran across a stadium in Olympia quicker than any of his fellow athletes.The stories have kept coming in the last 2,792 years. At the first modern Games, in 1986, Edwin Flack won the 800m and 1,500m events despite suffering a hefty bout of travel sickness during his six-day journey from London to Athens. The trainee accountant was so buoyed by his success that he entered the marathon event – even though he had never run more than 10 miles before in his life. He finished second, not bad for a man who had snuck off to Athens without telling colleagues as he worried he might be fired. Four years later, at the 1900 Olympics in Paris, a young art student by the name of Margaret Abbott decided to enter the golf competition as she was in the city. She beat all comers – including her mother, who also entered – to win a porcelain bowl (gold medals weren’t used at the Olympics until 1904 – and they haven’t been made out of solid gold since 1912). Abbott had no idea that the golf competition was part of the Games and she died in 1955 without knowing she was America’s first female Olympic champion.There are already some good news coming out of Rio, such as the journey Ellis Hill took to see his son compete in the shot put at the Games. Hill drives for Uber in Pennsylvania, where he happened to tell a customer that his son was competing at the Games but he couldn’t afford to travel down to Brazil to support him. The passenger set up a crowdfunding page as she thought it was only right that a father could see his son become an Olympian. The money was raised in one wee and Ellis will be in Rio to cheer on his boy. Hopefully the rest of us will enjoy the show when the the Games begin.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.47pm BST13:47John Harris: my favourite article of the weekJohn HarrisWith the Olympics upon us, Jason Burke’s piece about elite Kenyan distance runners shone brilliant light on the mess of stuff that lies behind international competition: global inequality, the way athletics funds whole chunks of Kenyan society, the constant shadow of doping, and the fact that many Kenyans see athletics as “a shortcut to financial security and success.” The quotes alone were fascinating, as in the case of the marathon runner Wesley Korir, who’ll be competing in Rio. “People always ask: Why do we run so fast?” he said. “There’s a simple answer.

Here are two very different responses.No, we’re not having less sexHatty, 25, London: to millennials, the older generation’s obsession with sex seems really backward Millennials are not less interested in sex, we just have less to prove about it.In the UK at least, 1990s “ladette” culture saw young women proving their feminist credentials by being more like the boys and having more casual sexual encounters than they might actually have wanted to. Millennials, on the other hand, have no pressure from family to remain virginal (my mum put me on the pill and bought me condoms without batting an eyelid), but also no pressure to be sexually liberated either.There is also less pressure on men to be macho about sex. I have a male friend who waited until his early 20s to lose his virginity, because he wanted it to be within the context of a loving relationship and he wasn’t afraid to tell people that.To millennials, the older generation’s obsession with sex and their highly restrictive gender-normative approach seems backward.Yes, we have less sex for many reasonsJordan, 26, Essex: nowadays people prefer to stay in, rather than go out and interact There are many reasons why millennials are less into sex, the main one being the rise in technology. Social skills are dependent on human interaction, and nowadays people do not make effort to go out and meet others, they prefer to stay in and interact online instead. This coupled with worries about contracting sexually transmitted diseases means a lot of people would rather just stay in and watch porn.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.17pm BST13:17Behind the story: are millennials really having less sex?Nicola DavisThe sex lives of millennials came under the microscope this week. Here, Nicola Davis, who writes about science and technology for the Guardian and Observer, talks about working on this story.One of the studies I covered this week looked at the sex lives of Americans, revealing that a greater proportion of young adults today are abstinent than they were in previous generations. The study is the latest in a string of papers based on the US General Social Survey - which has asked questions about sexual behaviour almost every year since the late 1980s. And, as always, it throws up food for thought.When it comes to sex, it turns out that people’s behaviour is rather different to what current social narratives would have us believe. Yes, the rise of online dating and apps such as Tinder, Happn and Bumble have changed the way people date, but the new research shows that the “youth of today” are not, in fact, more promiscuous than older generations were when they were young.We don’t yet know why. Although pornography, worries about sexually transmitted infections, the rise of online TV and even changing definitions of what sex is could all play a role, the old adage of “more research needed” applies.But with attitudes towards premarital sex, and sexual behaviour more broadly, becoming more tolerant, the authors also put forward a more upbeat idea regarding the rise in abstinence among young adults. “This disconnect may speak to rising individualism wherein individuals hold permissive attitudes about a variety of behaviours while also feeling less pressure to conform in their own behaviour,” they write.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.10pm BST13:10Matthew HolmesI asked for some opinions on last night’s Labour leadership debate (yes, really, John ... )   John O'Donnell 05 August 2016 12:40pmYou are really asking for it.Do you go around poking sleeping dogs with sticks too?Anyway, some of you have been happily discussing below – and while there’s voracity to discussions elsewhere, not all of you are drawn in:   imperium3 05 August 2016 12:32pmFor myself I've completely lost interest in Labour's internal war because it just doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Both sides have become firmly entrenched in their beliefs and believe their Labour would romp to victory if only it weren't for the other side and their wrong-headed ideas. They don't seem to be willing to risk a split either, so we can probably expect Labour to remain a lame duck for the foreseeable future.It doesn't matter what anyone says or does in the leadership campaign - Corbyn is bound to win by a large margin, but that's not going to make a jot of difference. Frankly I'm somewhat surprised that Smith chose to run - he seems like a bright spark and he must surely know that it's a foregone conclusion. He could have left Eagle to take the fall.   guardianistaleeds 05 August 2016 12:36pmIt does seem to be picking up attention as the morning goes on, but outside the guardian have been quite shocked by how little coverage it got in the news at breakfast.

In fact, that was the entire thing: a helicopter flew over the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii and filmed some lava that looked like two eyes and a grinning mouth. But those 20 seconds of footage became so much more.

Others enjoyed the reminder of Fight Club, Watchmen and that Pixar short about the lonely volcano.
