Young people are better versed in the romantic trials and tragedies of Justin Bieber than Romeo, Juliet, Hamlet or Macbeth, according to a new study.Research has found that Britain’s under-25s are more likely to recognise a lyric by the Canadian pop star than a line by Shakespeare. The survey revealed 43% could identify Bieber’s lyrics, while 38% recognised the work of the bard. One third of people could not recognise “To be or not to be” – perhaps Shakespeare’s most repeated line.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   William Shakespeare.

Sam Lee, Deezer UK & Ireland’s music editor, said: “Like Shakespeare, Justin Bieber is undoubtedly one of the most well-known figures of his time and his popularity means people nowadays seem to know their ‘baby, baby, baby, ohs’ more than their ‘wherefore art thou Romeo’s.’”The survey of 1,000 UK adults, aged between 18-25, was conducted by One Poll in April 2016.• This footnote was appended on 21 April 2016: the phrase “All that glitters is not gold” is derived from a passage in the Merchant of Venice which actually says “All that glisters is not gold”.
