Jonathan Jones (The cult of the picturesque ignores the reality of modern Britain, 7 December) seems to believe that landscape protection is the sole preserve of well-heeled toffs, anxious about losing the splendid view from the drawing-room window, without regard for the needs of the lower orders. May I therefore recommend to him a recently published book, 22 Ideas that Saved the English Countryside, by Peter Waine and Oliver Hilliam, published by the CPRE? Here he will find the socialists, communists, Labour MPs, city dwellers, urban planners, Methodists, radical ramblers, and yes, some well-heeled toffs, who over the years campaigned and lobbied for the idea of countryside protection and access, which he seems to regard as elitist.They put in place our framework of regulation, rights and public support, which has enabled this country to maintain a rich and varied rural landscape, in spite of being both densely populated and highly developed. This framework is now seriously under threat from moneyed interests, supported by their allies in government, who seek to hoodwink the public into believing that the only way to deliver adequate housing and economic growth is to declare the countryside up for grabs. Opposition is characterised as nimbyism by well-heeled toffs, anxious about losing the splendid view etc etc. That Jonathan Jones lends support to that insidious notion, is very disappointing.Isabella StoneMatlock, Derbyshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
