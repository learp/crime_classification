Which flowering climbers that won’t need pruning can I plant in our wild hedge to provide colour and fragrance? Perhaps a rambling rose and a honeysuckle or two?As it’s a native hedge, I suggest dog roses (Rosa canina), wild clematis (Clematis vitalba), native honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum) and hops (Humulus lupulus).If you want froth, remember that rambling roses tend to flower once, while climbers repeat-flower. Ramblers such as creamy white ‘Wedding Day’ and white ‘Kiftsgate’ easily grow to 10m and, if left unpruned, flower high up. ‘Rambling Rector’ (creamy white), ‘Paul’s Himalayan Musk’ (pinkish lavender), ‘Kew Rambler’ (small, pink and ‘Seagull’ (pure white) all grow to about 6m.Ask Alys: which flowers can I plant on a damp grave? A less beastly selection that grows to 5m includes ‘Madame Alfred Carrière’ (white-flushed, soft pink), ‘Albéric Barbier’ (creamy white to yellow) and ‘Madame Grégoire Staechelin’ (large pink flowers, free flowering, orange hips): all repeat-flower, even when north-facing.As for honeysuckles, ‘Graham Thomas’ has highly fragranced white to yellow flowers in mid- to late summer, and red berries in autumn. It will grow to 7m.• Got a question for Alys? Email askalys@theguardian.com
