How Not to Disappear is a fascinating story written by Clare Furniss with multiple narrators, Hattie and her long-lost aunt Gloria. This is something I loved about the book as not only did we get chapters from Hattie but also from Gloria, her memories from when she was younger and also when older, facing her past. What Hattie doesn’t realise at the beginning is how much she has in common with Gloria and the road trip will bring everything to light.This book was an amazing read and Hattie becoming pregnant during this difficult time of her life does make things tough. This, I believe showed all those undergoing the same issues as Hattie relate back to the story and this definitely made the story far more realistic. She is a very strong character who becomes a woman as the story progresses, making herself strong enough to face the realities of life. Hattie’s aunt was also an interesting character. She had dementia but she didn’t let that stop her; she was very independent and liked to drink throughout the day. As you get further into the book you see that she is concealing dark secrets and when reading about her past I couldn’t help but tear up. This creates an emotional bond between the reader and the characters, showing the huge success of the author and how well written this novel was. • Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
