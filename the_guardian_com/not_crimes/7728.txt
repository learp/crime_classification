Not If I See You First is the story of Parker Grant, who lost her eyesight aged 8 in a car crash with her mum.Fast forward a few years and another tragedy has befallen Parker; her father died of an accidental overdose and she has to learn to live in her house all over again - this time with two noisy cousins and her overprotective aunt and uncle. She hasn’t let that hold her back, sprint training every morning and taking on a role as school agony aunt alongside her best friend Sarah, but it becomes clear that there is only so long she can keep her emotions to herself. However, Parker has created ‘The Rules’, a set of 12 rules of how to treat a blind person, most important of which being: once her trust is broken, there are no second chances. Following the joining of the two high schools in Parker’s town, she suddenly finds herself facing Scott Kilpatrick, her former best friend, and boyfriend, and realises that perhaps sticking to rule number 12 will be more difficult than she thought. This is a heartwarming tale of courage and forgiveness, and Lindstrom’s ability to create such an engaging and resonating voice is impressive, especially whilst managing to create a character who is as determined and independent as Parker.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
