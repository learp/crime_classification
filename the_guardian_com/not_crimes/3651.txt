This is such a beautiful book. It is very easy to read and doesn’t have lots of big words that you have to use a dictionary to look up but it isn’t simplistic either.It is about an orphan girl called Maia who longs for a real family and then some distant family are found in the Amazon. She is really excited about meeting them but let’s just say that they are not what she expects. She has adventures in the Amazon and makes lots of friends. I won’t tell you if she is sent back to England or not. You will have to read it to find out!The characters are really lovely and the descriptions of the scenery are really vivid. The book is easy to start reading but then you get to a point in the middle where you just can’t put the book down.I could easily read this over and over, but I should like to read more Eva Ibbotson books.Recommended reading age: 10 yrs and above.You will like this book, if you like: beautiful stories.How does it make me feel when reading it: It makes me feel like I would love to travel in the Amazon with Maia.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
