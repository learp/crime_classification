The Boy in the Girls’ Bathroom is written by Louis Sachar. I like this book because there are lots of funny parts in the book. The book is enjoyed by children who like bad and naughty things.The character who I would say I like the most is Bradley, because he is funny and he said things like “give me a dollar or I’ll will spit on you”.Bradley tells lots of lies; he starts fights with the girls; he went into the girls bathroom; has serious behaviour problems and also no one likes him except Carla. If you are interested his full name is Bradley Chalkers.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
