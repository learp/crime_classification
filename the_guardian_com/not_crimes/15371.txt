Bridget Jones is back, and the good news is that she looks pretty much like Renée Zellweger, rather than the unrecognisable impostor who emerged a couple of years ago. A decade older than when we last time we saw her, in 2004’s Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, everyone’s favourite calorie-counting media muppet is still juggling blokes (Patrick Dempsey joins Colin Firth to form the new instalment’s love triangle), but this time has a bun in the oven to boot.Having been jilted at the altar, Bridget is still working in TV, hanging out with bezzie mate Sally Phillips, scandalising mum Gemma Jones and cuddling up to dear old dad Jim Broadbent. Her music tastes might have been updated a little, however. Out with Céline Dion, in with Ed Sheeran, who makes a flash-frame appearance here. The trailer features a very funny scene in which Emma Thompson’s obstetrician has to perform two eight-week scans because Bridget appears to have told both prospective partners that the sprog is theirs. Will there be another almighty man-scrap for old big-knickers’ affections? Will Firth’s Mark Darcy rock another of his famous Crimbo jumpers? And can Zellweger hold on to Ms Jones’s plummy tones until the credits roll this time? We’ll find out when Sharon Maguire’s film is released on both sides of the Atlantic on 16 September.
