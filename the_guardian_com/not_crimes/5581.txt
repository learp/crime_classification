It never quite made it into space, but one of Wigan’s chosen few – a meat and potato pie – has boldly gone where no pastry has gone before.Tethered to a high-altitude weather balloon, its progress monitored by an onboard camera, the celebrated northern concoction, complete with foil tray, rose to a point 29 miles above the Earth’s crust. Nasa didn’t want to know about this, so we got a couple of lads from Sheffield to sort it instead.Tony Callaghan It remained in the air for more than two hours before beginning a graceful descent into a field 38 miles away from its launchpad. First indications were that it did not reheat on entry.The unmanned flight provided a taster for the World Pie Eating Championships being held in Wigan on Tuesday.Organisers claim to be optimistic that data collected from the mission will help this year’s contestants down their 12cm competition pies in record time. Tony Callaghan, who owns Harry’s Bar in the town centre, said: “We are continually questing to go where mankind has never gone before: sub-16 seconds consumption of a regulation pie.“We are aware that scientists have been experimenting with plants on the international space station, to see if their molecular structure changes, so we are experimenting with pies to see if the structure changes with space travel.”And the point of that, of course, is to discover whether it “allows the pie to be eaten quicker”.Callaghan brought in experts from Sheffield-based SentIntoSpace to help with the launch from a pub car park. “Nasa didn’t want to know about this, so we got a couple of lads from Sheffield to sort it instead.”Bill Kenyon, of Ultimate Purveyors, the St Helens firm commissioned to make the pilot pie, said: “This is the first step to enable mankind to consume pies with more elegance and comfort. Neither the sky, nor the pie, should be the limit.”Wigan has had a long love affair with the pie, but it was only in 1992 that the world championships were first held in the town.

The night before the big event another competitor’s dog, Charlie, had eaten 20 pies and damaged a further 10.To say that Wiganers are both proud and fiercely protective of their pies is an understatement.Bakers have been known to attach notices to their vans, declaring: “No pies are kept in this vehicle overnight.”And especially not before Tuesday’s contest.
