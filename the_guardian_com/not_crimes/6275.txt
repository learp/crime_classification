Glastonbury festival has admitted breaching environmental regulations after human waste from the site polluted a nearby river.The incident happened after a steel tank used to store sewage from festivalgoers sprung a leak during the event in June 2014. A “large quantity” of sewage filtered into the river Whitelake, causing harm to fish and water quality, a district judge was told.Sensors in the stream alerted the Environment Agency to increased ammonia levels, which prompted it to launch a prosecution against the festival company. South Somerset and Mendip magistrates court in Yeovil heard that a number of fish – including protected brown trout – died as a result. Glastonbury Festival 2014 disputes this, but admitted the single charge against it, accepting that significant harm was caused.Festival founder Michael Eavis appeared at the court along with Christopher Edwards, the operations director.District judge David Taylor adjourned proceedings for a “Newton hearing” – a private discussion between both sides of a case before a judge – to decide the facts before sentencing.

It doesn’t have the sewage infrastructure of Peterborough. The management of waste produced by the festival is quite an issue. There are a series of systems that manage it.”Martyn said the festival used three very large steel tanks, one of which is located on a nearby dairy farm. “In 2014 the tank sprung a leak in one of the joins between the steel plates and the base of the tank,” Martyn said. “Around 28 June [2014], that leak developed and allowed a very large quantity of sewage to get into a farm ditch and from there into the Whitelake river.“It caused significant harm to both the fish and the water quality.” Martyn alleged that the festival had failed to test the tank and monitor it properly in the lead-up to the incident. “The impact was extensive,” he added. “It extended for at least 4km (2.5 miles) downstream. “In relation to fish, there was a significant fish kill. There is a dispute about the assessment of the fish kill. The fish that were killed included brown trout, which has protected status.”Martyn said the level of the offence was at “category one”, meaning a fine of between £55,000 to £300,000 was appropriate. The turnover of the festival that year was about £37m, he added.Representing the festival, Kerry Gwyther said an environmental report found the stream had a history of being of a “poor quality”. Of the 42 dead fish, 39 were recorded downstream and only 10 of these were brown trout, he said.There was no post-mortem testing of the fish to establish the cause of their deaths, Gwyther added. “We don’t accept that it was a major incident as described by the agency,” he said. “The leak period was eight hours. We do accept that there was a significant effect on water quality and fish health. Gwyther described the leak as “very small” and said the manufacturer and installer could only explain it as a “freak accident” as the tank had a service life of 50 years.He added that Glastonbury made just £84,000 profit before tax in 2015 and a similar figure for 2014. “That’s because of the huge amount of money that Glastonbury donates,” he said, which amounted to £2m in 2015 to charities including the Somerset Wildlife Trust and WaterAid.The judge said there were significant differences between the accounts of both parties. The Newton hearing to decide the facts is expected to last for four days. Environmental experts are due to give evidence at that hearing, as well as the tank’s manufacturer and installer.In a statement released by Glastonbury, officials said that improvement work on the site’s infrastructure has started: “With the causes already identified and analysed, Glastonbury Festival continues to work with all stakeholders, including the Environment Agency, on ways to prevent and safeguard against any problems in the future.Substantial improvement work on the site’s infrastructure has already begun and will continue over the coming months. At the same time, the Festival will again work rigorously with all of its contractors and staff to raise awareness of the environmental issues involved and the importance of preventing further incidents.”They added: “Working alongside our charitable partners, these important messages about protecting the land will also be shared with the Festival’s ticket holders as we continue our work to reduce the Festival’s impact on the environment.”
