We’d all rather ride in warm and dry weather but sometimes that isn’t an option. Don’t let bad weather put you off, though – with the right kit, attitude and skills and you can stay safe and still enjoy your ride.There’s no such thing as bad weather …‘There’s no such thing as bad weather just the wrong kit’ may be a well-worn cliche – but with a good waterproof jacket, neoprene overshoes and gloves your wet-weather ride will be a lot less uncomfortable.Breathability is key, otherwise your sweat will just mean you get wet from the inside rather than the outside. If it rains hard for a long time you are going to get wet anyway, but having the right kit will at least stop you from getting too cold.To be waterproof, jackets need to have taped seams. While a fully taped, fully waterproof jacket is a good option in really bad weather, a lightweight jacket which stuffs in a back pocket will stop you getting caught short in a shower – and you can easily stow it away if the sun comes out.What lurks beneath?Don’t ride through puddles or standing water. You won’t be able to see how deep the water is until it’s too late – it might just be a shallow puddle, or it could be a wheel-breaking pothole. Steer clear.Slippery when wetAvoid manhole covers, painted lines and the tell-tale rainbow of oily residue on the road. If you can’t avoid them, try to steer straight and don’t turn or brake until you’re through.On guardMudguards will not only help protect you from the elements – stopping water spraying over your feet and up your back – a rear guard will also protect the person riding behind you. Some club rides insist participants fit guards in wet weather. If you’re unsure, ask the mechanic in your local cycle shop which mudguards will fit your bike.

Wider tyres should offer more grip, so if you ride a road bike, for example, consider swapping your 23c tyres for wider 25c or 28c rubber. Think of reducing your tyre pressure too: anything from 10 to 20psi lower than usual should offer greater contact with the road and so traction – although you might also be more at risk of a puncture, and fixing a flat in the pouring rain is no fun at all.Easy does itConventional rim bike brakes are much less effective in the wet (although disc brakes are not as badly affected) so you need to give yourself much more time to slow down or stop. Test your brakes at the start of the ride. Obviously, take extra care on tight corners which you might zip around on a warm, dry day. And be aware that it’s not just water that reduces grip – grit washed into the road, especially quiet country lanes, can catch you out too.Light upRain, overcast skies and steamy windows all reduce motorists’ vision, so it’s a good idea to ride with lights in wet weather. A flashing rear light on your seatpost is inexpensive and effective. Think reflective and bright clothing too – you can never be too visible.Post-rideClean the grit off your chain after a wet ride and reapply oil to help your chain last longer. After that it’s time for a hot shower, a change into dry clothes and a your treat of choice – you deserve it …Have we missed anything? Share your tips for wet weather riding in the comments below.
