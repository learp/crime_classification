Lego has dropped restrictions on bulk orders after facing a storm of criticism for refusing to sell thousands of toy bricks to dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Ai, known for his criticism of China’s rights record, accused the Danish toymaker of censorship in October after it declined a bulk order of bricks, which he wanted for a new work. Lego said at the time it had a long-running policy of not fulfilling bulk orders or donating bricks if it knew they would be used as part of a political agenda.Ai Weiwei has not been censored: Lego is a toy, not a force for evil But the decision was condemned by rights groups and triggered an online campaign asking people to donate Lego to the artist and free speech campaigner. Lego said in a statement on Tuesday that it would stop asking people why they wanted its bricks. It did not refer directly to Ai’s order but acknowledged that the rules “could result in misunderstandings or be perceived as inconsistent”. Customers wanting to build public displays out of Lego bricks will now only have to make clear that the company does not endorse the project, it added.
