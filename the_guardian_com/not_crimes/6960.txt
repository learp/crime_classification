Have you ever gone against any teacher or a parent just because they have been causing problems? Even if you had, it would have backfired with severe consequences. So just imagine, if your country’s president was not doing the right things would you stand up against him/her?Well, a 12-year-old girl, Kestrel Hath, climbed up the wind singer and said all the bad words she could think of to the place she lived in Aramanth, and to the emperor as well. The root cause of all this was her teacher Dr. Batch, who started teasing her in the class and then she ended up climbing the wind singer. The Hath family may have to go through all sorts of consequences. The Wind Singer is another thriller where the audience experiences how a family in a city goes through problems, where they hate the rating system which is exams. Honestly, The Wind Singer is a book which shows the level of confidence an individual can hold. It is a must-read story!! • Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
