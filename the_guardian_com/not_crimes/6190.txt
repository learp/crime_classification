Carrie Fisher, the Star Wars actor who became an acclaimed writer, has died in Los Angeles four days after reportedly suffering a heart attack on a flight from London. As well as her acting talent, writing skill and beauty, Fisher was known for her unflinching honesty. Here are some of her best quotes:On her slave outfit in Return of the Jedi“The father who flipped out about it, ‘What am I going to tell my kid about why she’s in that outfit?’ Tell them that a giant slug captured me and forced me to wear that stupid outfit, and then I killed him because I didn’t like it. And then I took it off. Backstage.” Via The Wall Street JournalOn death and underwearelisabeth (@threelisabeth)please honor carrie fisher's wishes and include in her obituaries that she "drowned in moonlight, strangled by her own bra." ❤️❤️❤️ pic.twitter.com/Pj5sRsIvkzDecember 27, 2016On Star Wars“Movies were meant to stay on the screen, flat and large and colorful, gathering you up into their sweep of story, carrying you rollicking along to the end, then releasing you back into your unchanged life. But this movie (Star Wars) misbehaved. It leaked out of the theater, poured off the screen, affected a lot of people so deeply that they required endless talismans and artifacts to stay connected to it.” Via The Princess DiaristOn how she got cast in Star Wars“I slept with some nerd. I hope it was George [Lucas] ... I took too many drugs to remember.” Via Vanity Fair Carrie Fisher dies at 60: actor and writer best known as Princess Leia On being Princess Leia“I am Princess Leia, no matter what. If I were trying to get a good table, I wouldn’t say I wrote Postcards [From the Edge, her best-selling novel]. Or, if I’m trying to get someone to take my check and I don’t have ID, I wouldn’t say: “Have you seen [When] Harry Met Sally?” Princess Leia will be on my tombstone.” Via WebMDOn ageing“Please stop debating about whether or not I aged well. Unfortunately it hurts all of my feelings. My body hasn’t aged as well as I have. Blow us.” Via TwitterCarrie Fisher (@carrieffisher)Please stop debating about whetherOR not👁aged well.unfortunately it hurts all3 of my feelings.My BODY hasnt aged as well as I have.Blow us👌🏼December 29, 2015“I’m not happy about being older, except what are the options?” Via Rolling StoneOn discussing her affair with Harrison Ford“I don’t think it’s that revealing, or it’s certainly not offensive. It’s not unkind about him. It’s flattering. I mean, the way people are reacting to it is funny to me, too. I’d do him at 73.” Via The Princess DiaristOn how her father, Eddie Fisher, helped Elizabeth Taylor after her husband’s death“He first dried her eyes with his handkerchief, then he consoled her with flowers, and he ultimately consoled her with his penis. This made marriage to my mother awkward.” Via Wishful DrinkingOn fame“You have owned my likeness, lo all these years, so that every time I look in the mirror I have to send you a check for a couple of bucks.” Via George Lucas’s Lifetime Achievement Award at the American Film Institute   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Carrie Fisher, actor and writer, dies at 60On drugs“You know how they say that religion is the opiate of the masses? Well, I took masses of opiates religiously.” Via Wishful DrinkingOn bipolar disorder“Think of it as an opportunity to be heroic – not ‘I survived living in Mosul during an attack’ heroic, but an emotional survival. An opportunity to be a good example to others who might share our disorder.” Via her advice column for the Guardian
