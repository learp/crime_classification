Perhaps there will be blood, sweat and tears on the agenda this week – though in fact the first of those was covered in its own list back in 2013: pick your tune and make your suggestions now for a playlist of the best next week.You can find a list of all songs previously picked and so ineligible for the series here.You have until 11pm on Monday 6 June to post your nomination and make your justification. Regular RR contributor Pairubu will then select from your recommendations.If you would like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions – and potentially blog about the process/selection for the Guardian – please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com with the subject line ‘RR guru’ or make yourself known in the comments.Here’s a reminder of the guidelines for RR:Tell us why it’s a worthy contender.Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of a song’s words.Provide a link to the song. We prefer YouTube, but Spotify or Soundcloud are fine.Listen to others people’s suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist.If you have a good theme, or if you’d like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com.There’s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are “zedded”, at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of “zedded” (picked for a previous playlist so ineligible), “donds” and other strange words used by RR regulars.Many RR regulars also congregate at the ’Spill blog.
