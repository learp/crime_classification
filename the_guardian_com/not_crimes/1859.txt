Indie survivors the Maccabees rode the tail-end of the genre’s heyday with their 2007 single Toothpaste Kisses. But while the majority of their contemporaries disappeared into the ether, the band toned down the twee and rose through the ranks of rock to achieve a No 1 record and festival headline slots. They prepare for the latter with two summer warm-up gigs (Y Plas, Cardiff, 13 Jul; O2 Academy Liverpool, 14 Jul) …Guy Garvey’s Meltdown – the festival whose name rather satisfyingly conjures up images of what guest-curating such an event must feel like (especially if the shambolic ATP is anything to go by) – has had more acts added to its bill. New additions include Richard Hawley and Kiran Leonard, who’ll join the likes of Laura Marling, Robert Plant, Connan Mockasin and I Am Kloot on the Elbow man’s lineup (Southbank Centre, SE1, 10 to 19 Jun) …Finally, two thirds of New York hardcore/rap band Ratking showcase their talents in London next month, with Wiki + Sporting Life joining forces on stage. Expect an airing of God Bless Me, the pair’s recent collaboration with Skepta (Electrowerkz, EC1, 4 May).
