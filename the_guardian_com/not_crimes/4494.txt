In Hollywood, short films are a necessary evil – crucial for assessing the potential of emerging film-makers, but near impossible to exploit for commercial gain. In practical terms, that means an ever-replenishing pool of great shorts, most of which are unlikely to find an audience. Eager to take advantage of this glut of overlooked work is Le Cinéma Club (lecinemaclub.com), a new online portal for underappreciated films, each of which screens for a full week free of charge. Founder Marie-Louise Khondji says that she’s open to works of any length, but the site’s offerings thus far have skewed short, with the longest clocking in at just over an hour.The Witch review – an eerie campfire tale that gets under your skin It’s not hard to imagine why. By looking beyond feature films – the rights to which are typically tied up in deals that would preclude seven days of free streaming on a quirky video platform – Le Cinéma Club has secured work from the likes of Gus Van Sant, Andrea Arnold and Yorgos Lanthimos. Currently, the site is playing host to a short film from a more recent inductee to the arthouse hall of fame, Robert Eggers, who shot to indie stardom this year with his singular 17th-century horror The Witch.With its indescribable mood, scalpel-precise plotting and counterintuitive casting of Finchy from The Office, that film rightly proved one of the breakout hits of last year’s Sundance film festival. Eggers’s 2014 drama Brothers, meanwhile, was consigned to life as an industry calling card – a victim of its own 10-minute runtime. Now, though, presented in the rich context of Le Cinéma Club, the short reveals itself as just as beguiling and complex a piece of work as The Witch, and one that deepens our understanding of Eggers as a film-maker.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Opening on an emblematic sequence in which a playfight between two boys tips over into genuine brutality, Brothers is a minimal but finely woven portrait of fraternal conflict and rural seclusion. Though set several centuries after The Witch, the short shares a number of cast and crew members with Eggers’s feature, as well as a woodland setting, an old-timey end-credit typeface and a general sense of ethereal unease.It’s tempting, then, to call the film a warm-up, such is our collective disdain for films that happen to run less than 80 minutes, but Le Cinéma Club suggests a more enlightened interpretation: of Brothers as a partner piece to its more celebrated lengthier sibling, and short films in general as complementary to – not lesser than – their feature- length peers.
