After reporting the Raspberry Pi foundation was offering its latest unit for free with the £5.99 MagPi magazine, we asked readers to share the ideas and projects they’d been working on to get the best out of the British built computers.The Raspberry Pi Zero sold out within days, but with other iterations having been on the market since 2012 there’s already a thriving community building on the foundation pieces of kit, with conventional add-ons as well as, well, slightly more eccentric items.The latest ‘kidtech’ kits: tried and tested Some may have ripped up the engineering handbook and forgotten to search for a problem to solve in the first place (did we really need a bot to tweet Craig David lyrics?), but in each submission there was an admirable level of ingenuity and enthusiasm and a genuine passion for learning.Below are a selection of our favourites – you can still get involved by clicking the blue GuardianWitness button or commenting below. Have you encountered alternatives to the Raspberry Pi? Maybe you’ve built something from scratch? If so, we’d love to hear about that too.First up, it’s RoboCrocRoboCroc I used a Raspberry Pi to turn one of my children's old shoes into a robot :)Sent via Guardian Witness By Mark Norwood  26 November 2015, 15:54 Next, and perhaps more practical, a novel way to keep an eye on household utility useRaspberry Pi Solar and Smart home data loggerWe made a data logging system using a Raspberry Pi and a custom circuit board which logs the output from our solar PV system and solar thermal (hot water) and uploads the data every minute to a reporting website on http://home.briandorey.com/ There are more photos and details anbout the project on my blog at http://www.briandorey.com/post/raspberry-pi-solar-data-logger-version-2.aspxSent via Guardian Witness By justalocal  1 December 2015, 14:47 More monitoring from Will McGugan, who shared his entomological pursuitsMonitoring the nocturnal activities of exotic insectsThis is a timelapse created with the Raspberry Pi and an infra-red camera. It shows 24 hours of the movements of a pair of Mexican Elephant beetles. The Pi takes photos at regular intervals and sends them to a web application, also running on the Pi.Sent via Guardian Witness By Will McGugan  27 November 2015, 16:21 Then there was this perhaps Instagram-inspired camera Raspberry Pi hacked into a Holga 120 Film CameraI crammed a Raspberry Pi Model A into an old Holga film camera, along with the Raspberry Pi camera module, a wifi adapter and battery backed up clock. The resulting camera can take normal still pictures, but also has an ASCII art mode that generates pages of images using text.Sent via Guardian Witness By Kimondo  2 December 2015, 10:07 Past and present tech collide in this BBC Micro projectPi Twitter for the BBC MicroThis Raspberry Pi also provides access to Twitter on a BBC Micro Model B. The Pi does most of the hard work, connecting to the Twitter API over Wifi, and renders the output of a Twitter search in Mode 7 colour back to the BBC. As the BBC is connected over Serial, you can type messages and send them back as Tweets and use this implementation as a realtime Twitter Client.Sent via Guardian Witness By David James Lennon  28 November 2015, 20:01 This group of Quake fans were keen on the gaming capabilities of the Raspberry PiQuake On LANQuake On LAN allows even the most novice user to run a proper Quakeworld deathmatch server on their LAN using a low power Raspberry Pi Model B or Model B+.Long gone are the days when you needed a noisy, expensive, dedicated server and a degree in Networking Technology to arrange some free for all fun for you and your friends!No new code was written for this project. It is simply a bundle of pre-existing software pre-installed and pre-configured for your convenience (all wrapped up in some simple scripts and a cron job). Now starting your own QW Server at home is literally a “plug and play” experience.The image for your SD Card can be downloaded at http://www.quakeonlan.net/Sent via Guardian Witness By Paul Scollon  30 November 2015, 13:42 This musical mod has combined a Raspberry Pi 2 with an Arduino to breathe new life into the Sinclair ZX81Re-imagining of a ZX81 with a Raspberry Pi 2 and a Arduino. Not exactly a ZX81: Fully assembled AZ15 case with a Raspberry Pi 2 and Arduino / Leostick at its heart, and fully functional ZX81 keyboard as its soul.

The RPi is housed inside the wall box and runs a program that polls the GPIO for pulses from the wallbox. It decodes the pulses into a song selection and using UPnP protocols over my home wi-fi, adds the song to the SONOS queue.Sent via Guardian Witness By Stephen Devlin  2 December 2015, 16:12 Many of you were keen to tout the Raspberry Pi’s educational capacities, and we were interested in this exploration of the internet of thingsInternet of LegoA living Lego city powered by a Raspberry Pi, several Arduiono and similar microcontrollers and web APIs.

I also added a little web page to the device to mimic a medical tricorder display.Sent via Guardian Witness By David Luna  30 November 2015, 12:33 We also wanted to celebrate some of the most pointless ways to spread joy ...@BotSelecta - programmed to tweet Craig David lyricsUsing the Raspberry Pi 2 as a host, I have programmed a fairly simple script (with the help of online tutorials) to periodically tweet random lyrics from Craig David's debut album Born To Do It. If that isn't a good use of the RPi, I don't know what is.Sent via Guardian Witness By Sotiris Kakanos  1 December 2015, 22:16 Lastly, something festive for those who feel Twitter should set the mood at this time of yearChristmas Twitter Tree LightsChristmas tree lights controlled by a Raspberry Pi that festively attempt to reflect Twitter's feelings about Christmas.
