Adele’s 60s-style eyeliner is one of the most coveted looks in pop, with hundreds of video tutorials dedicated to helping fans perfect her signature technique. In April, the singer’s own makeup artist, Michael Ashton, released a YouTube video that is the definitive guide to copying her “cat-eyes”, which has been watched more than 2m times.

Can dedicated fans and festival-goers imitate Saturday’s headliner at a rainy Glastonbury without a mirror?       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Heather Cook.

She blends both the liquid and felt nib liner, drawing those all-important wings like a pro. VERDICT: Adele!      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Tom Holder.

Starting out as an eyeliner novice, he soons gets the hang of it: “Once you find your eye, you’re fine!” VERDICT: A-Don’t!      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Amber Dagnall.

It’s a speedy application, following an initial under-the-eye blip. Those all-important flicks are subtly added on afterwards, having been initially forgotten. VERDICT: A-Don’t!

VERDICT: Adele!      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Lori Baker.

Without access to either, she applies her liquid liner precisely in one smooth, gliding motion. VERDICT: A-Dept!      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Moley. Photograph: Alicia Canter for the GuardianMoleyDespite being unfamiliar with Adele’s famous flicks, Moley soon gets the hang of it: “I can do anything – I’m Adele!” he announces, just one eye in, using the pencil and felt-nib liners to recreate her look – on both his upper and lower lids. VERDICT: A-Dont!
