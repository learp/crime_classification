Foxcatcher director Bennett Miller and the Oscar-winning screenwriter and playwright Tom Stoppard are to unite for a new version of A Christmas Carol, which looks set to be Hollywood’s first major traditionalist take on Charles Dickens’s festive tale to hit the big screen in decades.The new version will be set, like the novel, in the 19th century, according to the Hollywood Reporter. There is no official confirmation that it will be shot as a live-action production, but neither Stoppard nor Miller is known for their animated work.Ice Cube to play Scrooge in Christmas Carol movie Humbug Dickens’s classic 1843 novel has been adapted for cinema and television countless times, yet recent big-screen efforts have been animated, like the Oscar-winning 1971 short starring Alastair Sim, motion-captured (as with Disney’s 2009 adaptation starring Jim Carrey as the miserly curmudgeon), musical adaptations of the original (such as 1970’s Scrooge and the 1992 A Muppet Christmas Carol), or comic riffs (1988’s Scrooged, starring Bill Murray). The last major traditionalist English language live-action adaptation is the 1951 film classic Scrooge (A Christmas Carol in the US), which also starred Sim in the title role of a mean-spirited miser who learns kindness after being visited by three mischievous Christmas spirits.Miller and Stoppard’s version is being set up at Megan Ellison’s Annapurna Pictures, with Ellison, who worked with Miller on Foxcatcher, joining Scott Rudin and Jennifer Fox on the list of producers. It will follow another recently announced adaptation titled Humbug, this time starring Ice Cube as the Scrooge figure, into production. Stoppard is best known in Hollywood as the Oscar-winning screenwriter of 1998’s Shakespeare in Love, while Miller has been nominated twice in the best director category for his work on Foxcatcher and 2005’s Capote.
