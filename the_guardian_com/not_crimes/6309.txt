It’s not so much stretching the definition of weekend as breaking it entirely, but I did two races last week, so forgive my gung-ho calendar approach. On Wednesday night I did a local 10km up on Wimbledon Common, which I confess I entered mainly for the fabulous medal. As a tribute to Uncle Bulgaria (not a fan of modern technology) I ran it without looking at my watch, though I must also confess I didn’t stop to pick up any litter. I thoroughly recommend these low key, well organised races through the summer - even if not all feature Womble-based bling. Knees, stretching and heel-striking: three running myths debunked Then the next evening, I ran the Great Team Relay with a speedy team of Guardianistas - we came fourth overall and got to start and finish in the Olympic stadium. Of course, runners yesterday had the same treat for the Great Newham Run 10km - did you race it? - and I think it’s very hard, no matter how tired your legs, not to find a little extra speed when you get onto that wonderful track. Then, finally, to the weekend, and yesterday’s 20 mile run in a very very muggy London. I don’t usually carry water with me, or often stop for it, but I did make an exception yesterday. As for tomorrow’s big track/ MP session in the threatened 32 degree heat ... I need a little lie down just thinking about it. Any tips from those in countries where temperatures regularly hover at such levels most welcome. As, of course, are all your weekend running stories.
