Both the Isle of Wight Festival and Glastonbury have been and gone for another year, but don’t put your wellies away just yet - the festival season is only just getting started. If you’re attending a well established music festival for the first time, or going to a more obscure one that has become a tradition, we’d like to see your pictures from the muddy banks and sunlit cities.Whether it’s food throwing, folk music or family orientated, share your experiences from summer festivals across the northern hemisphere. And if you live in the southern hemisphere, we’d like to hear about any winter festivals you are attending as well. We’ll feature the most interesting contributions on the site.You can share your festival pictures by clicking on the blue ‘Contribute’ button on this article. You can also use the Guardian app and search for ‘GuardianWitness assignments’ – and if you add it to the homepage – you can keep up with all our assignments.GuardianWitness is the home of user-generated content on the Guardian.

Posts will be reviewed prior to publication on GuardianWitness, and the best pieces will feature on the Guardian site.
