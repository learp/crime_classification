As a year 10 GCSE English student, literature lover and fiction fanatic, reading is a colossal force in my life. I read constantly and openly without shame because I love it!However this has not always been the case. During my years in primary school, reading was a daunting prospect for me. I persevered because my teachers expected it of me, but I began to resent reading as it meant writing “chapter reports” in my reading journal which reduced any enjoyment and pleasure, and I struggled through some embarrassingly public personal help during silent reading time.When I changed schools and started to attend comprehensive school at the age of 11, this all changed. With a fabulously enthusiastic and encouraging English teacher, memories of my unpleasant reading experiences began to fade. Fears of the unknown in such a large school and lack of a crowd of my friends (most of whom had attended other schools) meant that my attention was immediately captured by our school library. With the colourful posters, comfortable chairs and rows upon rows of intriguing looking books, it looked like the perfect place to hide out.How Michael Grant's Gone series cured my iPad addiction But what really got me to start my reading journey again were the library staff. They are really lovely and they talked to me at any time about books I had enjoyed and very quickly made reading sound exciting, without forcing me to pick up a book again.It was when I joined our book group, The Millennium RIOT Readers, that the stories which shaped my life fell into my arms. My Name is Mina by David Almond was by no means the first book I read thanks to recommendations from the group but it was absolutely the first story to grip my heart and drag me into the pages. It awoke the literature-hungry obsession in me and brought out my inner book geek. Before Mina, the Heartland series by Lauren Brooke had sparked my interest in fiction books and I progressed from those to Michael Morpurgo novels as a YA reader.Our librarians took my interests into consideration when helping me find books I would like and encouraged me to become the reader I am today. I maybe don’t have an extensive list of books which made become a reader as such but I think that is because every book I read for pleasure has had an impact on me in some way, and I still have help and encouragement to read for pleasure from the people who gave me the right books to start the reading ball rolling!Tell us about a book or reading experience that made something go pop in your brain by signing up here!
