How much should we drink a week? US researchers have found that no one seems to agree. Only half of the 75 countries they surveyed had drinking guidelines and those that did were inconsistent. The World Health Organisation defines a “standard drink” as one with 10g of pure alcohol, roughly equivalent to a half pint or small wine. However, British authorities say it is 8g, and a drink is not a drink in Austria unless it has 20g. The newly introduced upper drinking limit for men in the UK is 14 standard British drinks a week. But tell that to Poland and Vietnam where men can happily put back 35 drinks in British measures.alcohol limitsVariations in safe-drinking levels around the world.
