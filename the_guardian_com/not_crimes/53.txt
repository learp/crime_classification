Twitter has finally lifted the curtain on its long-teased rejig of the timeline.A new feature, dubbed “show me the best Tweets first”, will mix-up the Twitter timeline for the first time ever, putting the “most important” tweets from people you follow at the top of the timeline.The rest of the feed remains as normal, and scrolling to the top loads in tweets chronologically, as before.It’s a minor change, similar to the “While you were away” feature pushed out to users in the past year. But it is sure to prove controversial regardless.Initially, users will be able to opt-in to the feature, but eventually Twitter confirms that it will push it to everyone as the default setting.But don’t worry: you will still be able to turn it off.
