Outfits on display will include the Victor Edelstein blue velvet dress she worn at the White House where she famously danced with John Travolta and the pale pink Emanuel blouse she wore for her 1981 engagement portrait by Lord Snowdon. Both Prince Harry and William are believed to have given the exhibition their blessing. As well as the exhibition, Kensington Gardens will be restyled to feature flowers and foliage inspired by Diana’s life and style. They will include tulips, scented narcissi and white English roses.
