He made his name with the “Mexico trilogy” – a trio of contemporary westerns that followed the character of El Mariachi.

Rodriguez has also been a frequent collaborator with Quentin Tarantino, directing vampire western From Dusk Till Dawn, for which Tarantino wrote the screenplay, and teaming up with the director for the B-movie double-feature Grindhouse.Carpenter will be an executive producer on the Escape from New York remake, which Fox are hoping to spin into a film franchise.

As yet, there is no word on whether Russell will return in the role of the eyepatch-sporting Snake, or whether another actor will take on the role.
