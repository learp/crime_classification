We the undersigned have asked in the strongest possible terms that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office brings every possible pressure to bear on the authorities in Saudi Arabia to ensure the safe return of Amina al-Jeffery to the UK without delay (Report, 4 August).Amina is a 21-year-old British citizen. She was taken to Jeddah by her father in May 2012 because, in his terms, she was becoming too westernised. It is alleged that she is being kept against her will in the most inhumane conditions imaginable: caged, physically assaulted, deprived of food and water, and refused permission to use the bathroom.Amina is subject to protective orders under the inherent jurisdiction of the high court – and orders have been made to try to secure her safe return. Her father is refusing to cooperate with the consul in Jeddah.Today Mr Justice Holman has ordered Amina’s father to permit and facilitate Amina’s return to the UK, and to pay for her airfare, stating that she must return by 11 September 2016. Given the problems of enforcing this order in Saudi Arabia, we call upon the FCO to ensure that the order is complied with.It is unconscionable that a young woman should be treated in this way, and she is entitled to the protection of the FCO. We ask that urgent intervention is taken to secure her safe return.Cris McCurley Partner at Ben Hoare Bell Solicitors LLPPragna Patel Director, Southall Black SistersPolly Neate Chief executive, Women’s AidDianna Nammi Director, IKWROVivienne Hayes Director, Women’s Resource CentreRachel Krys Co-director, End Violence Against Women NetworkRosie Lewis Assistant director, Angelou CentreUmme Imam Director, Angelou CentreShahien Taj Director, Henna FoundationDeeyah Khan Film-maker and founder of FuuseShaheen Hashmat Writer and activistEleanor Linsey Sisters of FridaGita Sahgal Director, Centre for Secular SpaceGwenda Nichols President, National Council of Women for Great BritainJoanne Peyton Women’s rights activistSameem Al Author/politicianSue Robson NE CEDAW group chairShahda Khan NEWN Sharron Ward Director/producer Katalyst filmsPat Garrett Women’s rights activistHannah Summers JournalistHelen McCormack Women’s rights activistRukshana Thakrar Independent social workerPolly Harrar Director of The Sharon ProjectYasminara Khan TV researcher/journalistHarriet Wistrich Director, Centre for Women’s JusticeLibbey Maktari Independent Yemen GroupAnnie Bishop NEWNHenna Cheema African InitiativesUsha Sood BarristerDenise Gilley ISWMaryam Namazie Spokesperson, One Law for AllGina Khan Spokesperson, One Law for AllJasvinder Sahgera CEO Karma NirvanaDr Phyllis Chesler Emeritus professor, City University of New YorkDr Paula Boddington Senior researcher, University of OxfordLionel JoyceKathleen Sloan Women’s rights activistCarol Meredith Women’s rights activistBecky Rogerson Director, My Sister’s PlaceDr Hilary Middleton Price Honorary fellow, University of ManchesterLalaie Ameeriar Academic and researcher, IKWRODr Phillipa DawsonRuth EagleFiona Nichol Manager, Wear Valley Women’s AidEmma Boyd Women’s rights advocateRashid Begum SolicitorBal Howard Project and performance manager, HBV, Suffolk constabularySarah Smeeth National Probation ServiceVicki Marcus Consultant social workerProfessor Kathryn Hollingsworth Newcastle University Law SchoolDr Nicki Godden-Rasul Newcastle University Law SchoolClaire Allen Criminal justice workerMartyn Jones Chief executive, Prif WeithredwrBarbara Natesegara BAWSOShelley Moore Women’s safety officerEllie Richols Comms Officer, African Initiatives• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
