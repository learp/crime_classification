How edifying to see Kate Moss 2016 dressed as Kate Moss circa 2010 at last night’s launch of her collaboration with Equipment in London’s Marylebone. New mayor, new Europe, same old Moss. After all, this is how we know her to be: black pan-season suit, skinny scarf, pop of colour, hair down, her extraordinary face angled towards the pavement. Even the location – the Chiltern Firehouse, that of 2014 fame – was reliably Moss, and in 2016, positively retro.

So last night was, presumably, purely an exercise in re-branding the past. She arrived with her now-boyfriend Count von Bismarck, in the same week the tabloids suggested she was dating someone else. She also wore a red silk shirt from the spring/summer 2017 collection, despite this being the launch of the autumn/winter 2016 collection because, yes, there will be another collection. And finally matched her outfit with the count’s, Kooples-like, in an act of cute-slash-tabloid-baiting defiance. But what of the collection? It’s practical above affordable, but not painfully, and easy to wear. There are no sheer shirts, for example, because (to paraphrase her last night) gone are the days when Moss would flash a nipple. Rather the collection – and indeed Moss’s outfit last night– is a streamlined version of her familiar Saint Laurent-ish, androgyny-friendly stable of suits and silk blouses and scarves. There are the Mossy hallmarks of hyper-norm slip dresses in black and snakeskin print, low-cut printed shirts with extra-long sleeves at her behest (she likes her hands covered, according to Vogue). Animal print everything, KM monogrammed blouses and lightning bolts-on-things, in homage to Bowie. What else? Fat Tony DJ’d some funk, Lara Stone and Nick Grimshaw ate fried chicken and someone saw fit to name a cocktail Sex and Violets.
