1 Inside: Artists And Writers In Reading PrisonReading Oscar Wilde’s poem The Ballad Of Reading Gaol as a teen, I never dreamed that the Victorian prison in which he was incarcerated was still in use. Yet HM Prison Reading was very much in business until 2013. Now it has opened its doors to artists and writers from Nan Goldin to Colm Tóibín to remember Wilde’s imprisonment for, in effect, being gay. Wilde haunts modern culture; now his ghost has come home.HM Prison Reading, to 30 Oct2 Michelangelo Pistoletto      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Michelangelo Pistoletto’s Accarezzare gli alberi Stroking the Trees Photograph: Blenheim Art FoundationBlenheim Palace, one of Britain’s most stupendous buildings and a jewel of the European baroque, is a spectacular setting for the “poor art” of Michelangelo Pistoletto. He belonged to Italy’s 1960s arte povera movement, which celebrated the pre-industrial at a time of rapid economic change.Modern concepts in historic settings are very much the stuff of this artist’s life and work – all things considered, Blenheim and Pistoletto were made for each other.Blenheim Palace, Woodstock, Thu to 31 Dec3 Richard Serra      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Richard Serra’s NJ-1 (2015). © RichardSerra Photograph: Cristiano MascaroThe drawings of Richard Serra are not for the faint-hearted. If you thought that Kazimir Malevich’s Black Square took the colour black as far as it could go in art, think again: this great American abstractionist creates drawings that are thick, massive walls of blackness. Death is an unavoidable association and so is the Holocaust. Serra depicts the world as ash. He reveals a universe without light; a black hole of the psyche. His drawings are masterpieces of the 21st century, a terminal point of abstract art that is absolutely compelling.Gagosian Gallery, Davies Street, W1, Thu to 17 Dec4 Wifredo Lam      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Georges MeguerditchianThis Cuban painter brought modernism home when he mixed his own cultural traditions with the early 20th-century avant garde’s appetite for masks, totems and the exotic. His chunky, almost Aztec style and dream images make him a hugely interesting painter whose vision anticipates the Jungian dream art of Jackson Pollock – but from another America.Tate Modern, SE1, Wed to 8 Jan5 Robert Motherwell      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Bernard Jacobson GalleryThis is a survey of the most intellectual of America’s abstract expressionists, the brilliant generation who scaled new heights in modern art from postwar New York. Motherwell trained as a philosopher and his expansive dreamlike shapes are embodiments of ideas as well as emotions.Bernard Jacobson Gallery, SW1, Thu to 26 Nov
