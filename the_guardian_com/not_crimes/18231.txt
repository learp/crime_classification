The first trailer for Supersonic has been unveiled, a film which documents the career of “one of rock’s true giants”, Oasis.The film, which comes out in cinemas on 2 October, was produced by director Asif Kapadia and James Gay-Rees who made Amy and was directed by Spike Island’s Mat Whitecross. Thanks to Liam and Noel’s frequent and much valued interviews, there’s little we don’t already know about the brothers’ 20 years together. During the clip, the footage follows their ascent from “lads on a council estate” to the heights of fame via tabloid exposure, 90s hedonism and peaking with their two-day stint at Knebworth Park in 1996. Although Liam and Noel’s voiceovers were recorded separately, the film has given hope to fans who feel it is the brother’s first attempt at uniting since their acrimonious split in 2009.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Whitecross, the film’s director, did not rule out a possible reunion during an exclusive screening of the film at Festival No 6 on Sunday. Revealing that Coldplay’s Chris Martin had been playing the role of Oasis peacemaker, he added: “Neither of them have discounted the idea of getting back together. It will happen, I’m sure. The idea of never seeing them again for me is impossible.”It is not yet known whether both brothers will attend the Supersonic premiere, but it’s likely it will take more than encouragement from Martin and a red carpet to unite the two together. As Liam recently tweeted: “Just seen the trailer for oasis film i must say I do come across mighty fine super real unlike some people see you at the premiere LG x”.
