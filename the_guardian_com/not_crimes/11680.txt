Are you going to do that?’“Barbra Streisand, I saw her at the Bel-Air hotel, and she said: ‘Are you going to make your chicken pot pie because this is my favourite?’ I saw Viola Davis the other day and she said: ‘I love the macaroni and cheese you make.’ So I said: ‘For sure we’re going to make it.’“This year we have lobster corn dogs. We make our own lobster mousse and then make little sausages and then put them in batter and fry them. We serve them with a little jalapeno sauce, so it’s really tasty. It’s a good snack. A twist on a classic English dish.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Wolfgang Puck, third from right, working with his team on the Governors Ball menu.
