At the time of writing at least 43 people are thought to have died, and dozens have been injured, during the eruption of Japanese volcano Mount Ontake. It was a well-monitored volcano, so why wasn't there more warning?"The sudden nature of the eruption suggests that it may have been caused by a 'steam explosion' – when a pocket of water inside the volcano is heated to the point where it begins to convert to steam, leading quickly to an explosion," explains David Pyle, a volcanologist at the University of Oxford.And sadly these steam explosions are almost impossible to predict. Ordinarily rainwater percolates into a volcano, is heated by the hot rocks below and then rises back to the surface to form hot springs and steaming vents. But if for some reason the water becomes trapped, or a fracture brings it into contact with magma, then the excess heat turns the water to steam. "It undergoes rapid expansion, 500-1,000 times its original volume, which can unplug the vent and blast out massive lumps of rock," says Dave McGarvie, a volcanologist at the Open University. Unlike conventional magma eruptions there are no precursor earthquakes, or changes in the magma chamber, to provide early warning.McGarvie estimates that more than 100 volcanoes are capable of producing a steam explosion, with those in regions of high rainfall (such as Indonesia, Japan, Philippines and Alaska) being most vulnerable. At Mount Ontake scientists are waiting anxiously to see if a magma eruption will take advantage of the new vent.• Escape from Mount Ontake – in pictures• Mount Ontake erupts – video
