Metrodome Group, the UK distributor behind titles such as The Secret in Their Eyes, Monster and The Falling, has entered administration. All staff have been made redundant with immediate effect. Some reports suggest workers at Hollywood Classics, a sister company specialising in library rights, have also been laid off. Brighton-based company 101 Films has reportedly bought some titles. But the immediate fate of some of Metrodome’s high-profile future releases – including this week’s Childhood of a Leader, given five stars by Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw, and the Kristen Stewart-starring Personal Shopper – remains unclear.Also on Metrodome’s upcoming slate is A Quiet Passion, Terence Davies’s Emily Dickinson biopic starring Cynthia Nixon; last year, the company brought Davies’s Sunset Song to cinemas. The company launched 12 years ago, specialising in arthouse movies from directors such as Thomas Vinterberg, Lukas Moodysson and Lars von Trier. They distributed breakthrough early work from Ben Wheatley (Down Terrace), Sarah Polley (Away From Her) and Luca Guadagnino (I Am Love) as well as Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha, and a variety of genre titles such as Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus, Camp Hell and The Fall of the Essex Boys.Metrodome found particular success in 2010 with the Argentinian drama The Secret in Their Eyes, which won the foreign language Oscar that year, and was recently unsuccessfully remade with Nicole Kidman. Recently, the company had seemed on a roll with critically acclaimed if sparsely attended titles such as The Tribe, White God, Tangerine, What We Do in the Shadows and Xavier Dolan’s Mommy.
