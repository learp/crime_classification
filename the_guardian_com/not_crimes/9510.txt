Phil Redmond, the man behind Grange Hill, Brookside and Hollyoaks, has criticised the lack of working-class voices on British television and called for the BBC and Channel 4 to be merged.Redmond directed his scorn towards television regulators, who he said were stifling creativity and had “made TV crap”. Brookside creator Phil Redmond: ‘Northern powerhouse? Northern slaughterhouse, more like’ The 66-year-old, who oversaw Brookside for 21 years before its cancellation in 2003, said television was no longer representative of the diversity of the UK and was failing to tell “ordinary stories”.In an interview with G2, Redmond said: “What’s needed on British TV is different voices – working-class voices – something more than elites recruiting from the elites and making TV that doesn’t understand the issues affecting ordinary people.”Redmond is not the first to accuse British television programming of elitism. Julie Walters is among those who have lamented the lack of working-class representation in drama, while Lenny Henry recently called for greater racial diversity. Redmond once oversaw a roster of television’s most popular soaps, but Hollyoaks is his only creation still being broadcast and he sold his production company in 2005.The producer and screenwriter said he believed the biggest problems plaguing British television could be offset by merging two of the biggest channels. “I think Channel 4 and the BBC should be merged. Channel 4’s ad revenue could subsidise the licence fee down and it could become the new BBC4,” he said.He also offered a damning verdict on Channel 4, which axed Brookside after two decades: “It was supposed to be for alternative voices. It’s not for anything now.”
