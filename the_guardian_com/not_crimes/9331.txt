As the 2016 mayoral race line-up nears completion, candidates are already defining themselves by their attitudes to Boris Johnson’s dubiously conceived Garden Bridge. Labour’s Sadiq Khan has said he’d scrap it if elected, earning a rebuke from the Boris-loving Evening Standard, whose top brass, I’m quite sure, have never taken any perfectly lovely tea and cake with the bridge’s principal backer and awfully good friend of the mayor, the dear, darling Joanna Lumley (I write this as a fan...). The Lib Dems’ Caroline Pidgeon is a long-standing sceptic but Zac Goldsmith, hot favourite to be named the Conservatives’ choice next week, has taken a more tolerant line, remarking at a hustings that the £30m Transport for London somewhat reluctantly sank into the enterprise isn’t all that much in the wider scheme of things and will have been well spent if the bridge turns out to be a great success. To that extent he might be right, but has Goldsmith, perhaps, deduced that a Tory mayoral pretender criticising “Good old Boris” in any way, shape or form would be electorally unwise?Meanwhile, the Green Party’s Sian Berry has been roundly scathing about the Thomas Heatherwick design for linking Temple Tube with the South Bank, including by declaring her support for a competition to make fun of it organised by the artist Will Jennings. The results of that competition, part of a Garden Bridge-bashing project called A Folly For London, have now been announced. The winner, picked by Berry’s national leader Natalie Bennett, architecture writer Owen Hatherley and Guardian cartoonist Martin Rowson, is a dystopian piece by Ben Weir called Green Fire of London, which depicts an eternal flame burning on a pier on the Thames, its polluting smoke fuelled by trees uprooted from London parks. Point taken and congratulations, though it’s a bit polemical for my taste. I prefer Andrius Daujotas and Tautvile Dziugyte’s “walk on water” effort (see top of page), which got an honorary mention for its splendid absurdity, and Shimokawa Shohei’s fine suggestion that the bridge should instead be a gigantic cake (I mean, it’s so obvious). My absolute favourite, though, is the runner up, Floating Tidal Exploded Bus Maze from the Chris Doray Studio, shown below. I choose to read it as a sort of tribute to Johnson’s eight year failure to improve London’s lifeblood public transport mode, but what do I know? Whatever, it’s really great.
