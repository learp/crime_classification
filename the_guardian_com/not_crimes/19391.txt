Chris Evans said Top Gear was “repositioning” the way people watch TV in the era of on-demand viewing, but the BBC show lost a third of its audience on the BBC’s iPlayer during its first series without Jeremy Clarkson.The first episode of Top Gear drew more than 1.4 million requests on the BBC’s catch-up service after it returned at the end of May, but by the time of the fourth episode three weeks later, the number had fallen by half a million to 901,000.The figures, published by the BBC on Tuesday, echo the decline in the traditional TV ratings for the show, which began with an overnight audience of more than 4 million viewers but ended up with fewer than 2 million.Chris Evans quits BBC Top Gear after just one series Defending the performance of the show, Evans had earlier pointed to the programme’s catch-up viewing as evidence of its continued popularity and said Top Gear was “repositioning the way” people watch TV.Chris Evans (@achrisevans)The way Top Gear is being viewed is repositioning the way television is consumed.
