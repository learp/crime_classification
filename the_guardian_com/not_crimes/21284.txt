Hazel Hooper’s mum is a witch, a healer. They live in a secret forest together happily, until one day a demon breaks into the Glade and kidnaps her mother. Hazel (who has shown no signs of magic yet) shoots jets of fire out of her hands at the demon, but it escapes, dragging her mother away.Hazel sets out to find her mother, but not before taking with her a grumpy dormouse called Bramley, whom she accidentally created as a familiar when she tried to stop the demon. They bravely enlist the help of Titus White and his apprentice, David, because they may be the only ones that are able to get her mother back. Hazel has to keep her identity a secret, and Bramley hidden, as the penalty for being a witch is to be burnt at the stake. Together they encounter Nicolas Murrell and Lilith, two powerful and evil Wielders, their two terrifying demons Rawhead and Spindle, a member of the undead and Baal, the ultimate demon from hell. This book was full of surprises and every single character was fully formed and believable. I would recommend this book to anybody who loves battles between good and evil. Plus, if you do love this book, there is a sequel coming soon called Fire Witch. I can’t wait!• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
