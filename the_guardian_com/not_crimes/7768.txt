Tourist – To Have You Back Coming from a production background, I know that mastering the art of simplicity can be a difficult task, but Tourist manages to achieve this with ease.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest J Hus – Friendly I like J Hus because his rapping style is different, intriguing and his lyrics are extremely well written. I hope he gets the credit he deserves and continues to better himself with every record. He’s signed to Black Butter, which is a wicked label close to Rudimental’s heart. He’s just released a sick video for this track, too.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Anne-Marie – Do It Right Anne-Marie is our little sister and we’re proud of the success she’s having. This track is a straight banger – not only works on the radio, it kills in the club. I have no doubt Anne-Marie is ready to conquer the world.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Netsky – Rio Rudimental tour as a live 10-piece band, but we also DJ. We play this track out in every DJ set. It’s an anthem in our eyes and always gets the dancefloor popping. We played it in Australia and our band jumped up and started dancing on the DJ booth.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Kollektiv Turmstrasse – Sorry I’m Late Another one I love to play out our in our DJ sets. This is my favourite house tune right now: it gets me mad excited for the summer. We’ll be playing it out at our residency at Amnesia this summer for sure.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest
