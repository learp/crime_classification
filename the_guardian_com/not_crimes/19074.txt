First in the queue at 9:30 on Friday night!

Unfortunately, the record I was searching out was not there. It was time for some second hand crate digging in Wilton. LSD Records is one of the best shops around and, although I’m reluctant to shout about them, they deserve props. Here I picked up the Happy Mondays’ Pills Thrills ’n’ Bellyaches, Are We Not Men> We Are Devo! and X-Ray Spex’s single Oh Bondage! Up Yours! I had fun chatting to people about why anyone would pay £30 for the Diana Ross charity shop special to hearing about the early morning queuing.As fate would have it, I ended up in Portsmouth on Sunday so it seemed rude not to visit Pie and Vinyl for a look round. They had LOADS of stock left, and I was tempted with the Elastica re-press, but the price was too toppy. But it was good to make sure I wasn’t missing out on much, so it was worth the trip.Last stop on my way home was Elephant Records in Winchester. And there it was: the Sun Palace 7-in I had my heart set on! I also picked up Creation Rebel’s Starship Africa on beautiful gold vinyl. But maybe the pick of the bunch was an original press of Ricardo Villalobos’s Alcachofa, which I found in a used crate just before leaving. There was no way that was staying there.

Luckily, there were dozens of Smiths and U2 singles. The new War on Drugs record sounds amazing … Toto was an impulse buy I’ll never regret.

My local store – the excellent, knowledgable and friendly Sandy’s in Dee Why, Sydney – focuses on these because they sell. Nothing’s grabbed my attention this year and, with this in mind, my usual haunt is too far to travel on a Saturday morning. Discussion over.Saturday morning drifted lazily by, and we decided to head out for lunch. Then I believe my subconscious took over. While my wife showed one of my sons where the restaurant bathrooms were, I mentioned to his twin that Run the Jewels had released a tote bag and metal hand pins to mark Record Store Day. He thinks those hands are awesome. “We have to go now, Dad,” he told me. So that’s what we did.Red Eye Records was much busier than I’d expected early afternoon. A queue snaked its way where usually there’s an inviting space and attendant waiting just for you. And there, pinned to the display board, was the one and only tote bag they had in stock. “Do you want to ask, or shall I?” I asked him. With the throng of people he was well outside of his comfort zone, so he nominated me. And he didn’t even bat an eye lid when he paid $65 (13 weeks’ pocket money) for a printed tote bag and two pins. “I love record stores,” he told me afterwards. “I could live in one.” J Horlock‘Don’t you wish you’d released Up the Junction in 1979 and looked like this today?’      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Chris DiffordPhotograph: Crysse Morrison/GuardianWitnessChris Difford helping Raves from the Grave in Frome celebrate Record Store Day.

Here’s mine and my daughter Rachel’s haul from David’s Music in Letchworth. The 15-hour queue overnight was helped by amazingly kind locals supplying us with flasks of coffee and biscuits! Worth every minute and every penny! jred‘The battle-plan was formulated on Friday night’      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   More spoilsPhotograph:PJ Winfield/GuardianWitnessWe weren’t going to start queuing at 2am in the morning. We had our pride. And we aren’t getting any younger. So we would go local to start with, and arrive just as the shop opened. But then the text came from my mate – they were opening early … there were rumours of queues around the block were rife ... and the first 20 get a bag!So we decided to go at 7 o’clock. Luckily, this was to prove just about good enough; thanks to our fairly rural location, we ended up 12th and 13th in the queue. Being old rockers, we agreed what we’d fight for: The Def Leppard EP, Pink Floyd for my retro choice, Rush for my mate, Marillion because it was golden vinyl (C’mon … gold!), The Boss because well … he’s the boss! Sorted … all done … pretty expensive for the Boss, but it’s a once-a-year splurge.Then we decided to go to a second shop. Another queue, despite it now being 10am. My mate checked out at this stage, as he’d already added an expensive 70s rock vinyl singles compilation to his pile and was experiencing his usual post-purchase self-hatred.I couldn’t resist a few more morsels: a ludicrously over-priced Pearl Jam single and an even sillier priced Beatles double A-side. OK that was enough – time for breakfast. But damn, a The The single? Where the hell did that come from? I had to have it, and fortunately it may prove to be the most lucrative purchase of the lot … one day, the fickle hand of record-buying fate permitting. Assuming I never ever play it, of course, and keep it in a vault. PJ Winfield‘Wonderful shop with wonderful staff’      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Sound Machine, ReadingPhotograph:Darrell Warren/GuardianWitnessThe Sound Machine in Reading was impressive on Saturday. I didn’t even have to get up at 5am and queue for two hours to get these beauties. Darrell Warren“Oh, you made this album? Don’t care!

That’s how long I had to queue to get these two rereleased Cocteau Twins LPs on Saturday. It was worth it. They sound utterly gorgeous – and that purple … wow! The guy who served me at Resident Records in Brighton let on that the band’s bassist Simon Raymonde had been there earlier in the day and also had to queue – to buy his own albums.

Neilos CarterAnd finally, the one we were all waiting for …With groans from the hardcore and cheers from my peers, I got my hands on Aqua’s Barbie Girl. If nothing else, it’s brightened up my collection! Record Store Day for me is about the fun side of vinyl collecting and the atmosphere – not just getting the rare and most coveted. I always buy one real gem, one exclusive and one fun/coloured/cheesy vinyl. I was never going to beat the overnighters, but still managed to pick up a copy of Kate Tempest, and added Pulp’s His n Hers from the classics. My heart was set on the Distillers’s Coral Fang or, yes, Toto’s Africa (how does it spin?), but both were sold out by the time I got to the desk. Emma Richards
