“Stevie Wonder makes these beautiful cakes: some people eat the frosting, others eat the middle and there’s so much meaning layered in there. To write a song called Happy Birthday, which he must have known would be used as a celebration song for millions of people, and hide a message of unity in there was genius.It’s no secret that this was a song about Martin Luther King, his death and people coming together to stop things like that from happening again. I think it’s a celebratory song with a protest edge.There’s a lyric where he asked why can’t we have a day where we just celebrate peace? That’s the biggest protest song you can ever have. It’s an amazing way to make a song enlightening and fill you up with a positive feeling.I think just because it’s a protest song it doesn’t have to have some sort of dogma attached, it can be more useful as a way to give people the energy to get out there and be heard. People get fed up with oppression and I think protest music can be fantastical and lead people to rethink, reposition and organize themselves.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Check back on the Guardian’s Resistance Now for the next playlist suggestion next Monday.
