If you think 10 sounds tricky, consider the fact that in the 1980s and 1990s Japanese school kids had “30 a day” drummed into them. Thirty different foodstuffs. In the early 2000s the guidelines shifted from specifying a number of ingredients to advocating – by way of a nifty spinning top diagram – a balanced diet. But I have friends in their 40s who still occasionally do a daily tally to see how close they’ve come to their target. And the reason this is not a crushingly unrealistic plan is, in great part, down to what most Japanese mealtimes look like: a table full of small platefuls to share, or a trayful of tiny bowls just for you.While this is, broadly speaking, an Asian way of eating, the system finds equivalents in many other cuisines: tapas, mezze, the whole small-plates trend … But restaurant examples belie how simple an approach to home cooking it actually is. All you need is a base (my default is a bowl of rice, but grains, mashes and breads all work) and as many sides as you can muster. These needn’t all be veggie, although for our purposes here, you do want to include a veg or two in any meat or fish-based dishes you make.The key is to keep it simple. Having several batches of ready-made pickles, ferments, dips and slaws in the fridge helps, as does the most straightforward prep: these aren’t recipes, just stick‑man drawings. Blanch, roast or steam veg and dress it with something you like.My go-to condiment is ponzu (or citrus-flavoured soy) and a cheat’s version couldn’t be simpler: just squeeze as much citrus juice as you like into a small jug of soy – clementine, lemon, orange, lime or a combo all work – and store in the fridge.Ten ideas for quick veg dishes (see main picture)1 Sweet potatoSteam thick rounds till tender, then fry in 1 tsp of butter and 1 tsp maple syrup until crisp.
