Glass Sword by Victoria Aveyard is the sequel to Red Queen, and follows on Mare’s journey from where the last book finished.The book is still written entirely from Mare’s point of view and begins on their journey from the palace to join the Scarlet Guard. It then follows her recruiting other newbloods (those with red blood but with silver abilities), getting them to join her in defeating the new King and his mother. Glass Sword also follows Mare’s journey in totally rediscovering herself, after being forced to pretend to be a silver for so long, especially in relationships she had in her past life.  I did enjoy this book, however it definitely was not as good as the first. It began really slowly, and I was beginning to get slightly bored. Not that much actually happens in the book, and the important things that happened and could have been interesting felt rushed and unimportant.I also began hating Mare more and more through out the book, especially her thought process and her morals. This made it hard to bring myself to read this, and overall made the book less enjoyable. I would say that this book is worth reading if you really enjoyed the first one, as I did enjoy the book overall. However, if you thought it was more mediocre I wouldn’t continue with the series.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? • Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
