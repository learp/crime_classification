In October 1998, the New Yorker asked me to photograph a “major-league ex-dictator”. I took that to mean Idi Amin, but in actual fact it was Augusto Pinochet. He was renowned for being difficult so I knew it was going to be a tough shoot. That’s why the Dorchester Hotel came up. There was a suite there I was familiar with. I knew that if I pre-lit five rooms, it would be difficult for him to reject them all.Initially, though, I didn’t know who it was and I thought it would be interesting to do the shoot out on the streets of London. When I found out it was Pinochet, I decided against that. I knew a number of Chilean people living in the city and I didn’t like the idea of having him in the street. I wanted to contain the situation.I was also friends with a young photographer who had lost two brothers in Chile’s “disappearings”. That definitely added a dimension to how I was feeling, yet there isn’t anybody I would refuse to photograph. I was completely aware of what Pinochet stood for, that he was a mass murderer, but that didn’t stop me. Where you stand politically doesn’t sway whether you should photograph somebody. He probably won't even acknowledge you However, my friend’s experience left me uneasy about shaking Pinochet’s hand. Jon Lee Anderson, who wrote the article my portrait accompanied, had already done a number of interviews with him. He said that, the whole time, Pinochet had never looked at him directly. “He probably won’t even acknowledge you,” he said.But when Pinochet walked in, he looked at me directly, and walked towards me, hand outstretched. I was completely unprepared. There’s nothing you can do when somebody puts their hand out to you but shake it, so I did. Once I’d got over that, I took him to the first location: beside a big window, with just natural light. The flame red background was already there, as were the glasses. His hand on the table looked like a claw. I think this shot might even have been the first frame of the shoot. That happens a lot – the first and the last are the ones that work.I was distinctly aware, all the time, that I was in the presence of a terrible, terrible man – the charges that were laid against him, the thousands of people who had disappeared. It’s strange going into a shoot where you know the subject’s history: it doesn’t have a bearing on how you photograph, but it does have a bearing on how you feel.He carried himself like a world leader. I’ve photographed a number of people who are presidential, or have been leaders of countries, and he had that same demeanour. There’s an authoritative arrogance about them. It was the same with Blair. I don’t have much respect for those who take on the mantle of power. I’ve met quite a few and they never really impress me.
