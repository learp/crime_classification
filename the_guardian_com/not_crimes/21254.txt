Chris Evans’ third episode fronting Top Gear drew the best critical response yet but it was not reflected in the show’s overnight ratings, which fell to 2.4 million – the lowest figure for the BBC2 show for more than a decade.Top Gear launched two weeks ago with 4.3 million viewers before dipping to 2.8 million for its second episode last week.Chris Evans slams Top Gear’s critics as catch-up viewing lifts ratings The show’s consolidated audience for Sunday night will be substantially higher once people who recorded it and watch it in the next seven days are taken into account.But the overnight ratings, despite the rise of on-demand TV, remain an important, if diminishing, indicator of a show’s success.The BBC2 show’s Sunday night audience was its lowest for 13 years and only narrowly avoided being the lowest audience for any episode of Top Gear since it was reinvented by Jeremy Clarkson in 2002.The show’s lowest overnight audience is understood to be the 2.362 million who watched the sixth episode of the second Clarkson series on 15 June 2003, according to one industry source.Last night’s audience - to three decimal places - of 2.371 million means there was only 9,000 viewers in it. There was the consolation on Sunday night that the show, relaunched by Evans following the axing of Jeremy Clarkson last year, was up against BBC1’s coverage of Euro 2016 in which Germany beat Ukraine 2-0, watched by 6.3 million viewers. It was also scheduled against the second half of an hour-long Coronation Street on ITV, watched by 6 million viewers.

However, it does not include people who watched it on the BBC’s iPlayer.Sunday night’s Top Gear was memorable for the sequences it included - and didn’t include - with Chris Evans being sick after being driven around at high speed by co-presenter, Sabine Schmitz.But the controversial footage that was filmed of Matt LeBlanc and rally driver Ken Block doing “doughnuts” around London’s Cenotaph war memorial was cut from the film of the former Friends’ star’s high-speed tour of the capital.Response on Twitter was generally more favourable to the show but it was not enough to turn around its overnight ratings slide.Evans has previously pointed out that the show’s overnight audience is only one part of its total ratings performance and accused critics of being “out of date”.Poor Chris Evans – in defence of the new Top Gear Sunday night’s overnight audience of 2.4 million viewers delivered a 10.4% share of the audience to BBC2, with a five-minute peak of 2.8 million.The modern Top Gear era began when the show, revamped by Clarkson and executive producer Andy Wilman, beginning with 3.5 million viewers, a 12.8% share, on 27 October 2002.Two factors have to be taken into account in comparing with 2016 - first, these are consolidated figures (although catch-up viewing was far less prevalent back then) and TV viewing is now far more fragmented than it was in 2002.Clarkson will be reunited with his former Top Gear colleagues, Richard Hammond and James May, along with Wilman, for their Amazon Prime series, A Grand Tour, due to launch on the on-demand service in the autumn.
