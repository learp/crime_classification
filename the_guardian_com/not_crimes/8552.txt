I feel sorry for her now. Free SamCam!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.27pm GMT21:27And Star Baker is…SAM! That’s another tick on Mary’s ‘elevation to the peerage’ checklist. She’ll be Baroness Berry of Bath by the time SamCam’s broken kitchen timer has gone off, you mark my words.

FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.24pm GMT21:24Maddy’s yoga mat looks like a yoga mat, but alas NOT LIKE A TROPHY OF ANY KIND. Her sponge is a bit close, but it tastes nice. SamCam’s surfing cake includes a tonne of fondant, and Mary gives a big “ooh!” at the strawberries in the middle. All the sponges taste lovely, and she gets a well done from Paul. Jason’s Ashes trophy looks more like a funeral urn, and is on the wonk. His jam is overcooked and the sponges are dry.David’s helmet cake looks like a huge dinosaur poo, but Mary’s impressed with the five layers. They’re well baked and taste great, shame about the presentation.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.20pm GMT21:20Fondant is being slapped on, and some frantic freezing is going on. Only 15 minutes left! David’s cake currently looks nothing like a helmet, and SamCam’s wave looks like a giant igloo. Jason is panicking, and it’s all a bit of a shambles. David’s fondant is falling apart, and now his helmet has collapsed. That’s an American football helmet, apparently.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.17pm GMT21:17David has a theory about his cake cooking quicker if he sticks a metal spoon in it, because the spoon will become a conductor of heat. I’d like to remind David, who clearly wasn’t paying attention in GCSE Physics the way I was, that stainless steel is a very poor conductor of heat because it is an alloy. David can’t find a spoon, so he sticks a fork in it. Mel’s mind is blown by David’s boundary-breaking skills. Later he’ll be making a lightbulb glow using an orange.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.17pm GMT21:17Jason is using his previous experience as a plaster to ice his sponge. It needs a second coat, apparently, so he’s putting it in the fridge before giving it a final skim. SamCam was unfamiliar with fondant before last weekend, and is now being adventurous with it. Steady on.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.16pm GMT21:16Cakes are in the oven, in a selection of terrifying neon shades. Jason’s sponges look radioactive. One of David’s helmet cakes is ready, and SamCam’s blue cakes are a bit green. She’s cut a big hole in the middle and filled it with strawberries, presumably to represent all the crap that floats in the sea off Cornwall.

If he doesn’t get Star Baker I’ll be most miffed.

She’s getting a bit hysterical. David is making an American football trophy, make from three different sponges in the shape of a giant helmet. “That’s a big helmet”, says Mel. “He’s got a big head”, says Mary. Give these two their own show, I say.Updatedat 9.33pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.09pm GMT21:09SamCam is making her cake without egg yolks so her blue sponge doesn’t go green. Meanwhile Maddy is making a cake yoga mat, having entirely ignored the trophy brief.

A cake made out of Jamaican sausage rolls would be amazing, however.Jason is making an actual-size Ashes trophy on a cricket pitch Battenburg. But will he make his own marzipan?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.06pm GMT21:06Day two, and time for the Showstopper Challenge! Our four celebrity contestants have to knock up a 3D cake in the shape of a sporting trophy of their choice. I don’t think the Strictly glitterball counts.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
