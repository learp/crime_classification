Separate Rooms – Parker and LilyMuch of the music I listen to at home tends to be from bands we’ve met on tour. Parker and Lily supported my “other” band, Cinerama, in North America in 2003 and that’s when I first heard their haunting, organ-laced, reverb-drenched, “60s film soundtrack” style. They were a perfect accompaniment to Cinerama and their music has stayed with me ever since.

Theirs is a uniquely bewitching and graceful sound; a sound that partly inspired he Wedding Present to record our Saturnalia album at the Cocteaus’ studio, in 1996. I also wanted to cover one of their songs for our Hit Parade series but they refused my request for them to supply lyrics.

This song had a huge effect on me as a growing lad – for obvious reasons – and I think the fact that it was actually banned by the BBC at the time made it all the more thrilling for me. I suppose the lyrics could be best described as “abstract” but since my knowledge of French is rudimentary, that has never really bothered me. It’s kind of obvious what the song’s about, anyway! Apart from being a fine tune, I love the arrangement and the sound of the organ and bass guitar. The song introduced me to the genius that was Serge Gainsbourg.

But I regret that now because I missed out on many years of seeing them. When I finally caught them live, I realised my friend had exaggerated; they’re just a little quirky, with their instrument-swapping and offbeat stage designs. I didn’t know what to expect, but it certainly wasn’t the complex, powerfully melodic wall of sound that I now adore.

That’s totally understandable, of course, given that I’m the curator, but I do prefer to give slots to artists like French for Cartridge, who are slightly more eclectic and whose semi-classical arrangements, which will often feature bell-ringing or tag-team voices, are more challenging for the audience.
