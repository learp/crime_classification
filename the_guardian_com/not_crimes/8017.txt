Per-per-per-cheat. Churrup-churrup-chur-put. I’m struggling to put into words the extraordinary song I heard last week. Only poets such as John Keats and John Clare come close to capturing the quick-fire bubbling joy of the nightingale, whose liquid melodies make the lovely song of a nearby wren seem flat and one-dimensional.This aural wonder was even more miraculous because I heard it on a chilly sodden evening at a brownfield site in Kent.The nightingale is almost the only brown object to be found inside Lodge Hill, an accidentally rewilded former military training site whose mock-up Belfast housing estates have been subsumed by a rioting thicket of hawthorn, sallow, bramble and wild rose.These thickets, and the high fences surrounding this forbidding place of unexploded ordnance, have given rise to a vibrant population of nightingales, which nest close to the ground and are particularly vulnerable to 21st-century hazards such as domestic cats. The nightingale was last year added to the “red list” of endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and around 1% of the British population is breeding inside Lodge Hill, designated a site of special scientific interest for the birds.Nightingales v 5,000 new homes: the battle over the woods of Lodge Hill All this makes the attempt to cover Lodge Hill with 5,000 much-needed homes rather heartbreaking. A public inquiry announced in 2015 has been delayed until 2018 because the developer wants more time to identify “compensation sites” for the nightingales. These secretive birds cannot be picked up and moved like, say, great-crested newts, and there is no scientific evidence that the unexpected success of Lodge Hill’s nightingales could be replicated elsewhere.Handily for housebuilders, Lodge Hill is becoming less suitable for the nightingales because its scrub is maturing into woodland that lacks the dense thickets they require. Natural England and Lodge Hill’s new owner, the Homes and Communities Agency, have a statutory duty to ensure it is properly maintained for the birds. The RSPB says there’s no sign of anything being done.Lodge Hill should be a unique national nature reserve. Whether it becomes so will say something powerful about our society and whether we always bow to market forces or still have an ear for joy. I’m hopeful. As Keats put it: “Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!”The Boxer’s goodbye  We often seek out beautiful music in grief, and one of the most spine-tingling songs for Muhammad Ali was played by Paul Simon in Berkeley, California, last Friday evening. News of Ali’s death broke during his performance. Simon paused midway through The Boxer to apologise for bringing bad news. Then he gently started playing again. A concert can seem an ersatz form of mourning, but that was a classy tribute.Hen harriers in the firing line Highlander was one of four hen harrier chicks named by schoolchildren in the Forest of Bowland, Lancashire, when they were fitted with satellite tags in 2014. Hen harriers are Britain’s most persecuted bird because their appetite for grouse upsets those who make a living from game shooting.That autumn, Sky and Hope’s tags abruptly stopped working – suggesting they were shot dead. Burt vanished but Highlander was thriving until her tag stopped working as she flew through County Durham this spring. The English uplands should support 300 pairs of hen harriers. This year, there is, possibly, just one nest. This doesn’t need mourning, it requires action.Thou wast not born for death, immortal bird.
