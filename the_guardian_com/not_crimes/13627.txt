Ida Tarbell, a film about the pioneering turn-of-the-century journalist who exposed the monopolisation of the oil industry by the Rockefellers, is to be made by Amazon. The script, which featured on the 2015 Black List of best unproduced screenplays, is by Mark McDevitt; no director or cast has been announced. The film focuses on Tarbell’s series of 19 articles, The History of the Standard Oil Company, which detailed how John D Rockefeller monopolised the country’s oil business. One of the first CEO profiles, it was compiled from hundreds of hours of interviews with supporting players, and backed up by thousands of pages of documents.

Photograph: David E Scherman/Time & Life Pictures/Getty ImageTarbell never met Rockefeller, who was at that time the best-known businessman in the US. He had formally retired a few years before the publication, citing a desire to move into philanthropy. Tarbell’s articles depicted him as viciously ruthless and miserly. The articles won considerable praise, but also earned Tarbell the label of “muckraker”, something she took umbrage at. In a piece, Muckraker or Historian, she sought to justify her work and explain that she was trying to present balanced reporting in the face of headline-baiting activism.  All the radical element, and I numbered many friends among them, were begging me to join their movements. I soon found that most of them wanted attacks. They had little interest in balanced findings. Now I was convinced that in the long run the public they were trying to stir would weary of vituperation, that if you were to secure permanent results the mind must be convinced.
