Fortune Cookie is a typically charming, soulful story from the amazing Cathy Cassidy. I love the fact that Cathy, instead of making all the Chocolate Box series all about girls, has included a boy. This really interests and gives the reader a surprise – it certainly engaged me!Jack is a troublemaker but he is also kind-hearted, caring and honest (even if he lies once or twice). He lives with his mum and sisters in a grubby flat just above a Chinese restaurant. Jack feels like the luckiest person in the world to have a place to stay and a family. However, when things go from bad to worse after a terrible mistake turns his life upside down, Jake has no choice but to pay a visit to his long lost sister, Honey Tanberry, who gets in touch. In this story, Jake realises that everything is not what it seems; that even though everything may look perfect, it may not be. For example, his sisters have their own problems. We see the sisters through his eyes and his presence helps bring an end to the hatred between Honey and Cherry.This is a story that relaxes and warms you. It ends with a happy ending where everything is put right. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Because whatever the age, this story is AMAZING!How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
