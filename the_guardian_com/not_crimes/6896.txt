Jeremy Vine’s video of an alleged road rage incident in a west London street is upsetting, but not surprising to regular cycle commuters.Bike users in London and elsewhere shared many similar stories on social media, including those of drivers getting out of their cars to physically threaten cyclists over perceived indiscretions.In Vine’s video, a woman who had been driving behind him gets out and starts hurling abuse at him. Vine was taking the primary position, due to parked cars on both sides, with the driver apparently furious at Vine for riding in the middle of the road.Challenging Vine, the driver says: “Why the fuck would you stop in front of a car. You don’t respect your fucking life. Move your bike, move your bike. I could have hit you and I’d be done for a murder. Get the fuck out of the road. Fucking idiot, now fuck off. You lot piss me off.” Peter Walker (@peterwalker99)Most notable thing about @theJeremyVine road rage video is just about every London cyclist will have faced similar https://t.co/PORndZZFUUAugust 30, 2016If you’ve been involved in an incident similar to that experienced by Vine, we’d like to hear from you.
