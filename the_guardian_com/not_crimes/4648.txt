Authorities are moving to prevent any spread of disease after a “low severity” case of avian flu was confirmed in chickens at a farm in the south of England.A 1km zone restricting the movement of poultry has been imposed around the commercial chicken breeding farm at the centre of the outbreak in Hampshire and the birds there are to be culled.Tests identified the outbreak as a low severity H7 strain of the disease, a much less severe form than the H5N8 strain found at a Yorkshire duck farm in November.A statement from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said there were no links between the two cases and there was a very low risk to human health.Britain’s chief veterinary officer, Nigel Gibbens, said: “We have taken immediate action to contain this outbreak as part of our robust procedures for dealing swiftly with avian flu.A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said it did not pose a food safety risk to customers.“This is a low severity form of the virus and we are taking action to ensure the disease does not spread or develop into a more severe form. We are investigating the possible sources of the outbreak.”He urged poultry keepers in the surrounding area to be vigilant for any signs of disease and to ensure they were maintaining good biosecurity on their premises.Nick Phin, director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, said: “Based on what we know about this strain of avian influenza and the actions that have been taken, the risk to human health in this case is considered very low.”A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said that, on the basis of current scientific evidence, the advice was that avian flu did not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers.He added: “Laboratory investigations on the outbreak indicate it is the N7 subtype of H7 but this will need to be confirmed in further testing.”The MP for Meon Valley, George Hollingbery, said the outbreak was detected in the village of Upham. He said: “The news of an outbreak of avian flu in Upham is obviously very concerning and I’ve been liaising closely with Public Health England, based in Fareham, Hampshire county council and Defra throughout today to ensure I’m kept up to date with developments.“It appears that all precautions have taken place to ensure this problem is dealt with effectively and the experts are doing all they can to identify exactly what type of H7 strain it could be.“Most importantly, I have been told that presently any danger to the public is very low and this is very welcome news. The strain is a mild one and is not similar to the recent outbreak at a duck farm in East Yorkshire.“However, there is no doubt the authorities are taking it very seriously and regular updates will be issued in due course.”
