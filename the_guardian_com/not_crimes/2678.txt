Over the next two weeks 2,200 bands and 30,000 music professionals will descend upon downtown Austin for South by Southwest’s music festival. South by Southwest (AKA SXSW or South by) began in 1987 with a simple yet bold goal: bring New York and LA’s music industries to central Texas. In its first year, organizers hosted four times the participants they planned for, an initial success that foreshadowed the festival’s steady growth curve. SXSW now hosts music, film, and interactive events and has become a key component of Austin’s transformation into an internationally recognized music city.Austin’s locals famously grumble over SXSW, as visitors bloat the sidewalks and strain its facilities. It’s not uncommon to see residents sporting T-shirts that say “SXSUX” and “Welcome to Austin, don’t move here.” Despite the backlash, however, the festival continues to grow; it has become a critical source of income for the city. Last year’s event, for example, pumped $317.2m into the economy, according to the organization’s impact report.Residents protest these changes: the cost of living in Austin has skyrocketed, exiling some artists and musicians from the city they helped create, and leaving critics concerned over the pressures felt by lower income residents. If not the direct cause, SXSW becomes a focal point for this growing unease about the city’s changing socio-economic landscape. The cost of living in Austin has skyrocketed, exiling some artists and musicians from the city they helped create And yet, in an age when cities across the country are tightening budgets and facing steep competition for tourist dollars, festivals like SXSW – and their consequences – may be taking the place of other cultural institutions like museums and performing arts facilities: they are a guaranteed source of income, requiring minimal public investment and maximum symbolic impact. A University of Chicago study on culture and arts infrastructure, Set In Stone, finds that cities have overinvested in arts facilities exceeding proposed budgets and underestimating local interest. Austin – with SXSW, Austin City Limits festival, and Fun Fun Fun Fest as well as its new Formula 1 racing event – has been extraordinarily successful at developing events-based culture, and international urban stakeholders are looking to central Texas for the reasons why.

Smith/EPABack in 2007, at Austin’s famous Mohawk club, I was taught a lesson about how the city’s particular brand of place-making worked when then-mayor Will Wynn jumped on the stage. Speaking to the crowd, Wynn swiftly compared Austin’s cultural offerings with those of other major cities: “People ask me when we’ll get a major sports franchise, and I tell them, ‘Live music should be our sports franchise!’” He went on, listing three things Austin needed to keep true to its official motto as the “live music capital of the world”: a walkable nexus of venues, a supported community of musicians, and engaged audiences. In his off-the-cuff cultural benediction, Wynn provided a partial blueprint for Austin’s success: a concentration of cultural amenities, a deep pool of talent and a local and visiting populace eager to participate in a scene. After his visit to the Mohawk, Wynn told me that city stakeholders rolled their collective eyes at the idea of culture leading the way. Slowly, however, the city nurtured its cultural assets, allowing for a density of downtown cultural amenities to develop. Venues in the central business district, including the Mohawk, provided a focal point for college crowds, other countercultural types, and tourists. SXSW serves as a sort of metric for that change: as Austin’s downtown scene grew, it lent SXSW the venues and spaces it needed to grow.

Smith/EPAThere are direct and indirect costs and benefits to Wynn’s strategy. While Austin’s downtown has seen robust growth, its inner core has gentrified, homeownership has risen well above the city’s median income, and the city’s poor have moved to Austin’s outer ring.Downtown condo, hotel and residential growth has boomed. When I returned to the Mohawk two years later, for example, I saw that the onetime dirt lot across the street had transformed into a 120-unit luxury apartment complex called The Beverly.At the same time, musicians and other creatives feel they have become victims of the successes they played a part in. Musicians and venue owners claim they aren’t seeing the benefits of Austin’s boom. In 2011, the owner of Emo’s and co-owner of Antone’s – two downtown Austin standbys – felt the pressures of these changes, evoking the gentrification of New York’s East Village to claim his venues were priced out of the downtown core, telling Billboard: “We were going the way of CBGB.” Perhaps more vitally, Austin’s downtown has grown, but it has also become richer, and whiter. A team of sociologists from the University of Texas at Austin have tracked the multiple effects of these economic changes for those on the bottom of the socio-economic ladder in Invisible in Austin: Life and Labor in an American City.

As the mayors of cities like Phoenix, Portland, and Kansas City leave SXSW after their “secret” meeting on Stem-fueled (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ) economic development, they should learn from Austin’s events-based cultural policy as well. Festivals can be the foundation of a low risk urban cultural policy with long-term rewards, including promoting arts education, developing local media, stimulating tourism development and crystallizing a city identity. But these urban cultural policies need to be held to a high standard. They must attract capital to a city while also maintaining an economic and symbolic responsibility to its local communities.As the 29th SXSW kicks off this week, the Music City will be on full display, hitting both high notes and low. Festivals will increasingly be a part of our city culture. Just as the first SXSW was designed to be a showpiece for Austin talent, these large-scale events can and should maintain that commitment to their localities.
