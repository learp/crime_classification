From the hilltop site of Bere Alston with its railway station for Plymouth, narrow ways once frequented by miners and market gardeners drop towards the Tamar. Along the rushing Tuckermarsh stream, thick moss clings to leaning trunks, curtains the walls of derelict gardens and coats stems of regenerating saplings. In this damp woodland, the songs of wren and robin sound like spring and ferns remain upright, untouched by frost. The tide ebbs in the main river, where water swirls strongly seawards beneath mud banks, reed beds and a flock of sheep on land protected by a levee. On the sunny shore opposite at Calstock, two swans and last year's cygnet dabble off the muddy slipway, and the shouts of schoolchildren out to play carry across the channel to this shady river cliff on the Devon side.Ahead, the path along the embankment is framed by the graceful arches of the viaduct. Beneath this essential part of the Tamar Valley branch line, the sweet smell of silage wafts from Ferry Farm and, on the other bank, shoreside dwellings and the boatyard seem strangely quiet. Weeks after the Christmas landslip, which cut vehicular access from Danescombe, stranded cars and a red tractor were shipped one at a time on naval landing craft, around the North Ward meander, beneath the chapel on the rock in the woods, to Cotehele Quay, just half a mile downstream. Owners then drove the long way home to their village car park.Downriver, more familiar territory at Boetheric comes into view â€“ the polytunnels that grow strawberries and raspberries, and the eucalyptus and pittosporum groves cut for florists. Here, beneath Braunder Wood, saltings have been washed by high tides and strewn with reed stems, logs and debris. A lane leads uphill, away from the widening expanse of shining water, towards rutted fields of maize stumps; the sheltered banks sprout fresh nettles, bedstraw and a few primroses.
