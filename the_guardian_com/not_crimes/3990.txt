I grew up in the mining village of Dudley in Northumberland. My father, who was also called Robson Green, worked down the pits. I remember he’d come home with his face covered in coal dust and I wondered why it was so black. Even at a very young age I thought, well, that doesn’t look like a job designed for human beings.But my dad loved going down the pit. He honestly loved working with his mates every day and the camaraderie they shared. To be a miner you have to be brave, you have to be courageous, you have to be knowledgeable and you have to be strong. My dad had shoulders on him like an ox and biceps like beach balls. Later on in his mining career, he was a deputy, responsible for the safety of 55 men.My mother, Anne, was a cleaner and a shopkeeper. Out of economic necessity she had to hold down two jobs and she would take me and my older sisters, Dawn and Joanna, and my younger brother, David, with her when she cleaned houses.I slowly realised that Dad was the toughest man in the village. When I was 15, a boy at school punched me in the face, knocking some of my teeth out. My dad marched round to his house and didn’t touch the lad but he head-butted his dad, stuffed him in a dustbin and put the lid on it. I thought, wow, what a dad!My paternal grandfather, Matheson, was also a miner. He had no choice but to go down the mines when they were privately run. If a miner refused, the tied cottage system meant he would lose his house. My grandfather was a very prudent man and saved a lot of money. After the mines became nationalised, he offered to pay for my dad and my uncle, also Matheson, to go to university. He said to them, “Do you want to get an education and escape from the black hole?” Uncle Matheson jumped at the chance but Dad didn’t. He was happy down the mines.Uncle Matheson and my father would frequently argue long into the night about politics. Like me, he was all about socialism, togetherness and investing in people, whereas Matheson, to this day, holds very strong conservative views. At the time of the miners’ strike, my dad was extolling the virtues of Arthur Scargill while Matheson revered Margaret Thatcher. Talk about a recipe for conflict.So Matheson and I differ politically but I love him dearly and he’s my best friend. He’s also the one who taught me to fish – a huge passion of mine.When Dad passed away in 2009, it was a shock. At the funeral there was a big picture on display of him smiling: this big, joyous, handsome, charismatic guy. My mother, my sisters and my brother remind me that he hasn’t gone because I’m the absolute double of him.I didn’t learn until I was about 26 that my dad was a national ballroom dancing champion. He won loads of trophies. I’m not sure why he was so quiet about his achievements. Maybe he thought ballroom dancing wasn’t a manly thing to do. I did see him dance once on my 18th birthday and it was astonishing to watch this big, powerful man glide across the room like Fred Astaire. And as my acting career took off, I think he enjoyed living vicariously through me when he turned up on film sets to watch me work.I’m so proud that my dad is inherent within me and my sisters and my brother. He’s not gone – he’s still here. I’m so proud of what he and his ilk represented.• Robson Green stars in the new series of Grantchester on ITV, from 2 March
