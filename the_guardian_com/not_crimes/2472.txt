First, a shame-faced confession: until this weekend, I had never seen a movie by the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien. There, I said it. He’s been a blind spot for nearly 30 years, and now I have finally faced up to my problem.The Assassin review - enigmatically refined martial arts tale baffles beautifully It’s not that I don’t know who he is. I’ve badly wanted to see his work since I first heard about his “coming of age” trilogy in the mid-1980s, but for a long period his movies were very hard to see in cinemas or on video. Then, about 10 years ago, his work began to be released in the US, but only his newer movies, those made in Japan or Paris, or his contributions to anthology movies. And meeting him in an anthology movie would be like first encountering Alain Resnais or Agnès Varda by watching Far From Vietnam, misleading at best. So I held off seeing those. The movies I most wanted to see, those made in his native country, were still hard to find, so I waited and waited. Now that I’ve seen The Assassin, I plan to chase down his early work, no matter the expense, and region-coding be damned.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Hou and I are both nuts about Ozu, so it was always obvious we’d get along. The Assassin is a good deal busier than most Ozu, but bears many of the master’s hallmarks: stately pacing; a camera that moves little but misses nothing; exquisite framing (and, in moving shots, exquisite reframing); and meticulously beautiful composition and mise-en-scène (steam, smoke, mist are all beloved by Hou).The languorous pace allows the ravenous eye to absorb all the carefully posed elements in each frame: the interiors subdivided into multiple planes of focus; the human figures moving as if choreographed; while in his landscapes, mountain ridges recede away in waves, and a single swan glides from left to right through a glassy lake at twilight, its wake like a knife wound in blue-black silk. Throughout, we see and hear the wind in the trees, the very image that DW Griffith considered the essence of cinema.The Assassin director: why I gave plot the chop No matter how prodigiously beautiful it may be, The Assassin is cinema stripped down to its essence: sound + image. The bonus is that it’s Hou’s first foray into wuxia martial arts action; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon territory. Calm shots are drawn out like long, linear notes on a stringed instrument, a violin or cello, until the brief bursts of action arrive like violent percussion, a fist punching through the screen at us, reminding me of those moments of violence in Kubrick when the locked-down camera suddenly goes handheld.What story there is – a trained female assassin’s loyalties are torn – is like the fables that underpin certain Malick movies: just enough to hang a rapturous movie experience on; not enough to get in the way. The results are magical and sublime, and I now have, in Hou Hsiao-hsien, a new best friend at the movies. It’s been a long time coming.
