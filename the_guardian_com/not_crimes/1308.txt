Have you ever had the feeling that you’ve been completely wrong about something your entire life? Perhaps you’ve seen through superficialities to the truth of the thing. Perhaps you’ve had a sudden moment of perception, a sort of X-ray vision that enables you to reconsider the foundations upon which your life is built. I’m sure you’ll agree it’s terrifying, disorienting, discombobulating and really rather thrilling.The gentle magic of gardening, where human art and nature’s anarchy meet | Giles Fraser: Loose canon Which is how we arrive at what to many will be the unpromising topic of gardening. Now, if gardening can ever be said to have a “big weekend”, in the manner of Radio 1, then this coming bank holiday is surely it. It’s not only the last chance many of us will have to breathe some late-summer life into our wilting flora; it happens to be pretty much bang on the 300th anniversary of the birth of Capability Brown, a man whose influence is writ large in English gardens everywhere. Yet were I now the same person I was at the year’s dawn, the whole thing would have just passed me by.You see, it’s not so much that I was wrong about gardening, as that gardening was wrong about itself. Because it’s taken me 37 years to learn that it’s not really about life and light and colour and that sort of thing at all. No; it’s about wanton annihilation. Which, as any civilised person will know, is infinitely more endearing.I had long nursed an animus towards gardeners and their gardening. I used to believe it was effectively a form of species fascism practised by subscribers to Reader’s Digest. To my mind, its incarnational manifestation and Grand Vizier was Alan Titchmarsh, who I considered to be the anti-Bowie. And my antipathy towards it wasn’t merely philosophical and aesthetic, but practical: I learned from an early age that I’m a sort of inverse ET, killing flowers at touch.Then, a few months ago, I was confronted in my back yard with what I can describe only as Satan and his legion of demons, who had adopted the earthly form of Russian vine. This, for me, was a moment of epiphany. I realised that the point of gardening isn’t really growing things, but killing things. It’s creative destruction. For every beautiful bloom, you must lay waste to countless other organisms. Gardening is creative destruction. For every beautiful bloom, you must lay waste to countless other organisms This realisation has revolutionised gardening for me. It’s brought out the cold-blooded, dead-eyed killer within: I can spot an enemy life form at 50 paces, and it tends to be powerless against my instruments of destruction (sort of hooked scissor things). At last, I can reconcile gardening with those really quite violent computer games I used to play. It’s the circle of death. Phew.Lest you deem me a brute, let me reassure you of my sagacity, for, amid the merciless obliteration of unwanted greenery, I am visited by the occasional moment of contemplation. “Perhaps this plant is a cure for a horrendous disease,” I may muse, sometimes adding: “If we found just one shoot of this growing on another planet, it would be the greatest discovery in the history of humankind.” And then I forget about all that and proceed with the massacring.It is with some shame that I look back on my attitude to gardeners. I now appreciate just what a fearsome force they are, and abundantly creative with it. But best of all has been the bridging of the Bowie-Titchmarsh chasm. Observers at the garden centre that day would surely have wondered what had prompted my wild behaviour. I can now reveal the cause: I had discovered that a variety of weed suppressant is called, with no hint of pop-cultural awareness, Ground Control. Ground Control! It’s a sign! It’s all OK! “This ain’t rock’n’roll! This is ... pesticide!”There were concerns earlier this year that youngsters weren’t being taught gardening, that there was a lost generation of gardeners. Well, no wonder. Tell kids it’s all about nurturing and caring and beautifying and they won’t care. Tell them it’s about extermination, and watch their eyes light up as they ask for implements of devastation (spades, forks etc) for birthdays. For years we’ve been trying to sell the outside to youngsters, making out it’s all some Swallows and Amazons idyll, the perfect setting for wholesome japes and natural adventure and whatnot. Turns out the best way to get them out of the house is for a corporation to tell them there are pretend cartoon monsters over the road. Gardening is surely due the same rethink.Alan Titchmarsh is wrong – young gardeners just need a bit of nurturing | John Foley So that’s what I’ll be doing this coming bank holiday: killing stuff. Join in, kids. You’ll help some lovely plants to grow, yes. But, more to the point, you’ll never feel so alive.
