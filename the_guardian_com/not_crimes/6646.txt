A diver found dead off the Western Australian coast may have been killed by a shark, police say, in what would be the first fatal attack since the state introduced its controversial shark baiting program.Officers are investigating the death of the 38-year-old man, who went missing while diving with four other people on 29 March near Dawesville.After a search spanning 300 square kilometres involving rescue boats and helicopters, police divers found the man’s body on Wednesday, with an initial examination indicating a shark bit him.A police spokesman told Guardian Australia it was unclear whether the shark bite occurred before or after the man’s death and that his companions did not witness a shark attack.“Further investigation and consultation with relevant experts will be undertaken,” WA police said. “The matter is being investigated by the coronial investigation unit and a report will be prepared for the coroner.”The WA government introduced baited drumlines off the state’s coast in January. There are a total of 72 baited hooks, attached to the drumlines, placed 1km from the shore of popular beaches in Perth and south-west WA. Contractors shoot sharks measuring more than 3m long if they are found on the hooks.The missing diver disappeared around 5km out from Dawesville channel, south of Perth. There are no drumlines in the channel.The last fatal shark attack in WA occurred in November, when a surfer, Chris Boyd, died near Gracetown.Seven people have died from shark attacks in the past three years in WA, which prompted the government to introduce the drumlines. Opponents claim the policy is cruel and counterproductive.Natalie Banks, a Perth scuba diver and anti-shark cull campaigner, told Guardian Australia that drumlines were not the way to prevent fatal shark attacks.“We don’t know if this was a shark attack at this time but it is interesting that it happened at a time when drumlines are in the water,” she said.“We need proper programs in place to stop these incidents occurring. Why aren’t we putting money into surf life saving, shark spotting, tagging and tracking? We are seeing proof every day that drumlines don’t work.”Across the country in southern New South Wales a swimmer was killed by a shark on Thursday. The woman, in her 60s, was swimming with a group near the coastal town of Tathra when she was taken by the shark around 100m from shore.
