The award-winning poet Kim Ki-taek has been described as “an observer of minute and microscopic details” with a rational but compelling style of description that pulls you in to his universe, where no encounter is ever mundane. The art critic John Berger, who gave us Ways of Seeing, would have found much to commend about the two poems presented below.—Lee Yew Leong, Editor-in-Chief, AsymptoteMy Eyes Met HisMy eyes met his for a moment.His face was familiar,but I couldn’t remember who he was.Bewildered by the odd familiarity of unfamiliarityI couldn’t take my eyes off him.He, too, seemed to ponder who I was.He was rummaging through a garbage bag.He was inside the skin of a cat.As if he were used to standing upright,to walk with four feet appeared awkward.As if complaining to me, who had disturbed his ransacking,Meow, he let out with feeling.But the strange sound like a baby crying unexpectedlyseemed unbearable for him to hear andimmediately he shut his mouth.He didn’t run away like other cats.As if angry over his own sad figure being caught,he lowered his head, turning slowly, back arched,and moved off into the distance for a long time.Chewing GumGum that someone has chewed and spat out.Gum with clearly visible teeth marks.Gum molded into a small, round ballafter being crumpled and folded upon itself into a tiny compact of creases;without discarding or erasing even oneof the countless teeth marksupon pre-existing teeth marks.Gum that is quietly spending time fossilizing.Gum neither torn nor smashednor completely mangledhowever strong a force capable of ripping through meat and cracking open nutshas gnashed it over and over.Gum soft as flesh,chewy as meat,elastic as plump limbs flailing between teeth,awakens the teeth to long forgotten memories of carnage—enjoyable blood, flesh and stench.Gum that has absorbed into its bodya murderous intent and hostility stamped by teeth throughout the history of this Earth.Gum that has been squashed, ground, and pressed to its fullestthen grudgingly releasedbecause the teeth were exhausted first.Discover more poems by Kim Ki Taek from the Asymptote archive.*****Kim Ki-taek was born in 1957 in Anyang, Gyeonggi-do, and started his poetry career after winning the Annual Spring Literary Contest with the poems “A hunchback” and “Drought”.
