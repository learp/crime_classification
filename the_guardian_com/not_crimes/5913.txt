Hello!Cast your mind back (maybe weeks, maybe years) to when you got your sex education. Was the information useful? For me and Mae, it kind of ... wasn’t.Both of us learned about the female reproductive system and the risks of STIs, which is all valuable information. But there’s so much more to our bodies than just sex – so why is the education only about sex? We should understand things like how urinary tract infections happen and how to avoid them. We should know not to use douches. And maybe childbirth and menopause wouldn’t be so scary if we had the right information.So we made this last episode of Vagina Dispatches all about sex education. We wanted to discuss some of the things that are missing from the syllabus, and also figure out why we don’t know what we should. To do it, we sat down with some sex educators, some friends and our moms(!).
