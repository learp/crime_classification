It looks like something from a deep sea horror film. But this conger eel was caught by accident six miles off the coast of Devon. Measuring more than 2 metres (7ft) and weighing an impressive 59kg (131lb), the fish was snared in the nets of a trawler.Pete Bromley, manager of Plymouth Fisheries, said: “This conger eel is a very large fish, and an unusual catch for a trawler. Conger move to very deep water and die after spawning, so, like all large congers caught off the south-west approaches, this fish is likely to be an unspawned female.“These large eels are generally found hiding in the many wrecks around the south-west, or on reefs and rocky ground, but they do venture out to open ground in search of food, usually during neap tides or slack water. Despite their size and power, they are not very strong swimmers.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The full-length eel. Photograph: SWNS.comThe eel was caught by the inshore trawler Hope. Despite its great size, it turned out not to be too valuable – making about 70p per kilo at auction when it was sold, for a total of £40.Scott Govier, 42, a commercial fisherman from Plymouth, Devon, caught the monster eel. He said: “It was just a normal days fishing – business as usual. When we pulled it up I was stunned, because it was so huge. It was already dead when we pulled it up, else we would have thrown him back in and let him live.“It was too much of a magnificent specimen to kill, but as he was already dead it seemed worth bringing him in. I don’t know how long it was, it was difficult to tell and I never really took any notice. “It was sold in the Plymouth market, made just over £40. Congers aren’t worth much these days, but it went for more than I expected.”• This article was amended on 18 May 2015 to correct the length of the eel. Initial reports had said it was 6 metres long, but Plymouth Fisheries later said it was closer to 6ft (about 2 metres).
