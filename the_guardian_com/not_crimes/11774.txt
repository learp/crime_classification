The world’s most prized ecosystems, such as the Amazon rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef, require stronger local management to reduce the enormous global threat posed by climate change, according to an international team of scientists.In a paper published in the journal Science, the researchers warned that localised pressures such as deforestation, nutrient pollution and poor water quality could exacerbate climate-driven challenges such as heatwaves and ocean acidification.A study of three Unesco world heritage sites – the Amazon, the Great Barrier Reef and the Doñana wetlands in Spain – found that “stewardship is at risk of failing”, putting the ecosystems at greater risk of collapse due to climate change impacts.“Despite the solid scientific basis for managing climate resilience in such ecosystems, failure to do so is putting globally important ecosystems at risk,” the paper warned.While Brazil has slowed the deforestation of the Amazon by 70% over the past decade, the Science paper said: “These successes are now being partially undermined by major infrastructure and natural resource extraction projects and by shifts in legislation.”These added pressures were likely to mount as the Amazon dealt with rising temperatures and dry spells driven by climate change, which could turn it into a drier, more fire-prone place that lost much of its biodiversity.Climate change is the leading threat to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, although there are significant local issues such as overfishing, chemical pollution from agriculture and the dredging of the seabed to facilitate the expansion of ports.Spain’s Doñana wetlands are threatened by pollution and groundwater extraction for fruit growing and the tourism industry. The wetlands are considered one of the most important sites for waterfowl in Europe, as well as hosting a range of amphibians.Researchers said local management at each of the world heritage sites was “worrisome” and risked compounding the effects of climate change.“Poor local management makes an ecosystem less tolerant to climate change and erodes its capacity to keep functioning effectively,” said the study’s lead author, Marten Scheffer, an ecologist at Wageningen university in the Netherlands.“Local management options are well understood and not too expensive. So there is really no excuse for countries to let this slip away, especially when it comes to ecosystems that are of vital importance for maintaining global biodiversity,” he said.Terry Hughes, another co-author of the paper, said the Great Barrier Reef was facing an “unfolding disaster” due to climate change and local pressures.The reef has lost half of its coral cover in the past 30 years, is considered in “poor” and worsening condition by the Australian government and may be listed as “in danger” by Unesco’s world heritage committee later this year.“It’s an easy exercise to document how pressures have increased over time – they look like the famous hockey stick,” said Hughes, who is the director of the centre of excellence for coral reef studies at James Cook university in Queensland.“Fishing pressure has gone up, the number of recreational boats in Queensland has just passed 250,000 and the population in the reef’s catchment will double in the next 25 years, meaning more coastal development and more dredging.“It’s hard to reconcile the aspirations of coalmining in Australia to action on climate change. Australia has got itself a well-deserved reputation for dragging its feet on climate change and there’s no greater indication of that than the handing out of 60-year coal licences. The stressors on the reef are intimately tied to the fossil fuel industry, given that the dredging is for coal ports.“The northern and offshore reefs are still very pretty and help out the tourism industry but you need to go further to find a reef in decent condition than you did 30 years ago.”His co-author Scott Barrett, of Columbia university, said improved local management needed to be driven by the international community, as well as individual countries.“These ecosystems are of value to the whole world, not only to the countries that have jurisdiction over them,” he said.“It may be necessary for other countries to bring pressure to bear on these ‘host’ countries or to offer them assistance, to ensure that these iconic ecosystems are protected for the benefit of all of humanity.”
