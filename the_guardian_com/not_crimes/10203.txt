A huge mural of Kanye West locked in a passionate embrace with Kanye West has been destroyed by its creator. Australian artist Scott Marsh painted over the six-metre-tall depiction of the rapper, having reportedly sold the piece for $100,000 (£53,000). 'Classic Sydney': council orders removal of two-storey nude Kim Kardashian mural Located in Chippendale, a creative district in Sydney, the image is a re-creation of a photo of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West at the 2015 Grammys, which was later Photoshopped by Buzzfeed, replacing Kardashian with another West. Shortly after images of the mural went viral, the artist said that he was contacted by someone claiming to be West’s management, who offered him a five-figure sum to paint over it. “I asked for six figures and a lifetime supply of Yeezy Boosts,” Marsh told one website. They did not respond.Having announced that he would paint over the mural and sell a video of the event plus a one-off oversized print of Kanye Loves Kanye for $100,000, Marsh has now achieved a sale. Posting a message on Instagram, he didn’t reveal who had bought the piece, but confirmed its purchase, saying: “So this just happened.”For those disappointed to miss such a spectacle, one “part” of West still remains untouched by white paint.
