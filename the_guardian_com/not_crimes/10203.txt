The recipeFinely dice a couple of spring onions. Roughly chop 6 small (not cherry) tomatoes, then finely chop a medium-sized, medium-hot red chilli. Cut 200g of watermelon flesh into large pieces. Toss the spring onions, tomatoes, chilli and watermelon with 2 tbsp of olive oil and place in the fridge to chill.In a shallow pan, warm a generous film of olive oil and use it to fry 4 slices of ciabatta. Brown them nicely on both sides. As the second side starts to turn gold, scatter the chopped chillies over the surface and spoon over some of the olive oil from around it. Remove from the pan.Cut 250g of halloumi into 2 large slices then let them cook, brushed with a little oil, on a ridged griddle pan, until golden brown.Divide the salsa between 2 plates, then place the chilli bread and the halloumi among it. Serves 2.The trickA dish of contrasts. I like to chill the watermelon to provide a cool contrast for the hot toast and sizzling halloumi. The hot elements of this salad should be just that, and the melon should be refreshingly cold. Take care not to over-brown the cheese, as it loses its point when overcooked. A few flashes of pale gold on the surface are all you need.The twistCantaloupe melon is a good alternative to watermelon here, as would be slices of sweet, ripe mango. If the sweetness of melon isnâ€™t your thing, then take a selection of tomatoes, from small sweet-sour yellow cherry tomatoes to large, knobbly marmande instead. Feta is good here, too, but you may find it easier to warm in a hot oven, wrapped in a foil, with a little olive oil.Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
