I note the reference to my practice, Forbes-Laird Arboricultural Consultancy, in an article on your Opinion pages (Notebook: The animals of Smithy Wood, 18 November).Any decision to grant planning permission affecting ancient woodland is taken after careful scrutiny of the proposals, with matters of need, benefits and harm – and whether this latter can be mitigated against or compensated for – all being considered.In each case where FLAC has helped a client to secure such planning permission, it was the overall judgment of the decision-maker that needs and benefits clearly outweighed the harm.Our role is chiefly to ensure that the extent of harm is kept to an absolute minimum, and to advise on appropriate mitigation and compensation measures.We decline to promote schemes affecting ancient woodland if the extent of harm is either significant or avoidable, not least because such schemes rightly have no prospect of securing planning permission.Julian Forbes-LairdDirector and principal consultant, Forbes-Laird Arboricultural Consultancy• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
