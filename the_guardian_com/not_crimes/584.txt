As with the fate of so many social networks, news of Friends Reunited’s closure was greeted with surprise that it had been continuing at all. Since its peak in 2005, when it was sold to ITV for £175m, the site’s key demographic – old people who wanted to snoop on the loves of their teenage years – had been in steady decline, cannibalised by Facebook stalking, LinkedIn lurking and a quick Google Image search.Like many of those teenage relationships, our online socialising platforms can make us think they are for ever. One day, we look back and wonder when or why it ended. So here’s a roundup of the flings and LTRs of our digital lives from the last decade or so, for a quick update on what they’re up to, whether they’ve gone bald yet, and if, just maybe, they still hold a candle for us …MySpace       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest In 2011, Justin Timberlake led a consortium to buy MySpace, at which point the old template – your spangly falling-stars, your carefully curated black-pink-and-aquamarine html theme – was abolished in favour of a deeply confusing constellation of self-curated music and showbiz “content” that tried to muscle in on Spotify’s success. Your old photos can be dredged up by logging back in, and clicking on the “mixes” tab. There’s also a tab for “old profile songs”, but it seems few of those tracks have survived the exodus.Bebo       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Once the preferred haunt of emos and teens too young for the heady sophistication of Myspace, Bebo came back online in December 2014 as a mobile messaging app, under the slug “chat with attitude”. The idea? You create an avatar and then … chat! And draw pictures. New Bebo also attempted to lure users back with the offer of access to old photos at the beginning of last year.Friendster       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest By 2009, this woolly mammoth of internet archaeology had been acquired by Malaysian e-payments provider MOL Global, which repositioned it as a social network for online gamers. But in June 2015, the entire site was shut down, and is now simply a holding page announcing that the owners “made the decision to take a break and pause our services”.Menshn“Twitter for topics” was the promise offered by renegade Tory media node Louise Mensch’s Menshn. It opened in mid-2012, but early users found the site full of glitches, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, overrun with single-issue cranks. It ceased to be in 2013, in part because of a breakdown in the working relationship between Mensch and the site’s co-founder.Faceparty In the early 2000s, Faceparty was a slightly creepy dating/hookup shack masquerading as a more legit friend-grid. Now? The same, but with almost no people and more creep-factor. The site now heavily promotes its “adult verification service” – £12.99 – to give users access to “adult content” posted by other users. If you do feel you need to pay for your dick pics, you can.Google Plus       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Google Plus has more than 2.5 billion users – but do they know it? Anyone with a gmail address is automatically signed up, but many never use it. A redesign last November shifted the focus towards community-themed social networking, but overall it remains a wasteland of brands doing “content” to sell you fashion accessories.Yo!Launched on April Fool’s Day 2014, Yo! is possibly the only social network to have been designed by one developer in a single eight-hour stint. Users could send each other one word and one word only: “Yo!”. Since then, it has tried to build on its success spurt by acting as a sort of social media clearing house. For instance, logging in today will ask you if you want a “Yo!” every time “Fall Out Boy goes viral on Tumblr”.Ello       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest A sort of eat-clean version of Facebook, Ello was designed by open-source types who wanted a network that would be perpetually ad-free and would never harvest your data, for malicious purposes or otherwise. Millions signed up for its exclusive invite-only phase, but it now divides its time mainly between graphic designers and artists who love its clean minimalism, and ordinary schmoes with no wares to sell who have no idea what they are supposed to be doing, bar admiring tasteful reclaimed artisanal furniture from Norway.
