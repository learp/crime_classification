Andie’s life as the only daughter of an American politician has never been normal, but they’ve got by well enough. Now summer awaits with a perfect internship, best friends and time to let loose. But then a scandal shreds her father’s image to pieces and her dreams of a flawless summer remain only mere figments of her imagination. But just because things aren’t what you planned, it doesn’t mean they can’t get better...can’t they?Unexpectedly (excuse the pun), I found this novel an enjoyable and heart-warming read, in between revision, it’s exactly the kind of easy read I want to relax with after trying to work out why chemistry exams are strictly necessary. Despite not being much of a dog fan, I think that it was the perfect thread to run through the middle of the plot and this led me to wonder whether my view of dogs has changed. Although I don’t think that I could handle being a dog walker for an entire summer!Overall, I think that this book is a fun summer read and the friendship between Andie and her three friends at the heart of the book was captured brilliantly. Andie and two of her friends dare the third friend to send texts using only emojis all summer — which sounds like something I would challenge my friends to do! The story of Andie’s mother added a more solemn undertone to the story, but it didn’t stop me laughing aloud at some of the antics that Andie and her friends get up to! If you are looking for an easy, yet captivating read over the holidays, then this is perfect.WARNING: MAY CAUSE YOU TO CONTINUALLY CEASE REVISION, RESULTING IN BAD MARKS AND/OR GRUMPY TEACHERS.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
