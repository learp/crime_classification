It might sound like a pain in the behind to read, but an academic tome about the cultural history of the anus is among the contenders on the shortlist for the 2016 Diagram prize for the oddest book title of the year.Joining six other contenders on a list that also includes studies of Soviet-era bus stops and famous birdwatchers, Reading from Behind: A Cultural History of the Anus is “really trying to get to the bottom of its subject matter”, according to Horace Bent, the Bookseller diarist and prize administrator.Reading the Liver: Papyrological Texts on Ancient Greek Extispicy is now Bent’s “go-to book on divining the will of the gods from the entrails of animals; I can also imagine it becoming the core text at a pop-up street food vendor”.Soviet Bus Stops is a photography book about what the publisher calls “unexpected treasures of modern art”, while Paper Folding With Children is “a translated craft book that seems to assume children are extremely flexible”, he writes.Transvestite Biker Nuns from Outer Space doubles as an exploration of cult film, as well as “an excellent theme for your next fancy dress party”, according to Bent.Tom Tivnan, the Bookseller features and insight editor and Diagram prize co-ordinator, says the annual prize is “bang on trend in our age of the shortening attention span. We don’t judge books on the contents within or even by their covers, but in the purest, quickest, shallowest way possible: from the title.”Next stop, Siberia! The strange and beautiful world of Soviet bus stops – in pictures Tivnan named Too Naked for the Nazis as his early favourite because “it combines two well-worn Diagram themes of nudity and the Third Reich”. He also praised Behind the Binoculars: Interviews with Acclaimed Birdwatchers for promising to get behind the scenes with “superstar twitchers” such as Phil Hollom, Andy Clements and Debbie Pain. “No, me neither.”Bent is particularly pleased with the academic tone this year: “Once again readers from across the globe have scoured the bookshops and looked into the far-flung corners of the internet to suggest a raft of the peculiar, downright batty and unintentionally hilarious book titles,” Bent said. “Our crack squad of judges – well, me, actually – have whittled the voluminous nominations down to this magnificent seven of a shortlist.”Administered by the Bookseller, this is the 38th prize. The award was conceived in 1978 by Trevor Bounford and Bruce Robertson, co-founders of publishing solutions firm the Diagram Group, after they spotted that year’s winner – Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice – while bored at the Frankfurt book fair.This is the second year that the prize has allowed self-published titles to be entered.According to the Bookseller, the prize was not awarded in “two very dark years - 1987 and 1991”, due to a lack of odd titles.Whichever title wins this year will join a peculiar elite that also include Greek Rural Postmen and Their Cancellation Numbers (1996), The Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories (2003) and last year’s winner, Strangers Have the Best Candy. As is tradition, the winner will not receive aany money, but a “passable bottle of claret” will go to the person who nominates the winning entry.The shortlist is now open to a public vote, with the winner announced on 18 March. “As with the US Republican presidential primaries, Tivnan said, “we can always rely on an electorate to make the sane and rational decision”.The shortlist:Behind the Binoculars: Interviews with Acclaimed Birdwatchers by Mark Avery and Keith Betton (Pelagic Publishing)Paper Folding with Children by Alice Hornecke and translated by Anna Cardwell  (Floris Books)Reading from Behind: A Cultural History of the Anus by Jonathan Allan (Zed Books) Reading the Liver: Papyrological Texts on Ancient Greek Extispicy by William Furley and Victor Gysembergh (Mohr Siebeck)Soviet Bus Stops by Christopher Herwig (Fuel)Too Naked for the Nazis by Alan Stafford (Fantom Films)Transvestite Vampire Biker Nuns from Outer Space: A Consideration of Cult Film by Mark Kirwan-Hayhoe (MKH Imprint)
