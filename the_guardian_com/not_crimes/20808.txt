Speeches were made from every stage in Dublin on the night Anita Reeves died of cancer, aged 68, a mark of the popular affection in which the actor was held. Small, vivacious and red-haired, she was as much a musical theatre star as she was a leading exponent of Seán O’Casey and Brian Friel. And when she played the long-deceased adoptive mother in Hugh Leonard’s autobiographical Da, the author said she was the closest to the real-life Maggie Tynan as anyone had ever been in the role.Her acting personality was imbued with the warmth and generosity she displayed in everyday life. Her family came first – she did not, for instance, go to Broadway with Friel’s great hit Dancing at Lughnasa in 1991 because of family commitments – but she had a terrier-like devotion to a new play, however small or uncommercial, if it engaged her mind and spirit; she would travel with a piece such as Elaine Murphy’s Little Gem (2008) – a litany of love, sex and death for three generations of women speaking in a dense northside Dublin idiom – on tour in Ireland and to Edinburgh, London, New York, Australia.The youngest daughter of Jack Reeves, a sergeant in the Dublin police force, and his wife, Kay, Anita was educated at St Louis high school, Rathmines, and trained as an actor for four years at the Brendan Smith Academy in Dublin, having worked briefly as a vet’s assistant and in an old people’s care home. She appeared as a principal boy in pantomime in a small theatre in Dún Laoghaire owned by the gas company, several pantomimes at the Gaiety with Eamon Morrissey and, in 1966, in a mass pageant of students celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising in Croke Park, hallowed home of Gaelic football.She became a favourite in the Dublin revues of the mid-1960s, many of them written and produced by Fergus Linehan and also starring his wife Rosaleen Linehan. This prepared her for such later triumphs as Mme Thénardier in the Dublin premiere of Les Misérables in 1993, or a bewitching Mrs Lovett in Stephen Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd at the Gate in Dublin in 2007. She chilled the audience’s collective marrow, too, in a musical moment in Joe Dowling’s 2012 production of James Joyce’s The Dead, adapted for the stage by Frank McGuinness, at the Abbey.Dowling had first directed Reeves in the Irish premiere of Alan Ayckbourn’s Absurd Person Singular at the Gate in 1974 and, although she had many successes at both the Abbey and the Gate, she remained a non-aligned employee. She was a quintessentially Dublin actor, and defied all other categories. Dancing at Lughnasa (1990), first directed by Patrick Mason, is Friel’s magical, mystical memory play about his mother and aunts during the long hot summer of 1936, and Reeves embodied the spirit and tenacity of those “five Glenties women” as Maggie, the good-natured family clown; the scene of them all dancing around the kitchen is securely lodged in Irish theatre folklore.The play came to the National Theatre in London and transferred to the West End. Over the following five years, Reeves revisited the West End in two Dowling productions of O’Casey political classics: in the Gate revival of Juno and the Paycock at Wyndham’s in 1993 (with Niall Buggy and Mark Lambert), she was surely the definitive Juno Boyle; and in a touring revival of The Plough and the Stars at the Garrick in 1995 she was revealed in bustling, comical form as Jinnie Grogan the charwoman, lamenting her marriage while excavating ear wax.She adorned one of Nicholas Hytner’s first productions as artistic director of the National Theatre in London when, with Dearbhla Molloy, she played one of the chatty aunts in the grocery store in Martin McDonagh’s extraordinary The Cripple of Inishmaan (1997) and returned in the following year to play a figure of comparative rectitude, a landlady, in the Almeida theatre’s version of Pirandello’s Naked starring Juliette Binoche – who drew a fine caricature of Reeves as a first night gift.She was back in Dublin as Mrs O’Kelly in a well-remembered revival of Dion Boucicault’s The Shaughraun (2005) and toured to the Edinburgh festival and New York in 2013 with Deirdre Kinahan’s two-hander These Halcyon Days in which, opposite Stephen Brennan as a former actor, she played a retired primary schoolteacher in a nursing home with her customary humour, grace and large, watery eyes.Her last stage appearance was as Juno again, directed by Dowling in his farewell production in charge of the Guthrie theatre in Minneapolis last summer. She had, said Dowling, grown even greater in the role, bringing an added elegance and finesse to the spirited mouthpiece of the Dublin tenements during the nationalist schisms of 1922.Reeves’s films included Neil Jordan’s remarkable debut, Angel (1982), as well as the same director’s The Miracle (1991) and The Butcher Boy (1997), Mike Newell’s Into the West (1992) and Alan Archbold’s The Life of Reilly (1995).She was briefly married to (and divorced from) the actor Barry McGovern and lived for more than 30 years with Julian Erskine, the executive producer of Riverdance, whom she married in 2000. She is survived by Julian, their two children, Gemma and Danny, and her siblings, Maureen, Tom and John.• Anita Reeves, actor, born 24 June 1948, died 7 July 2016
