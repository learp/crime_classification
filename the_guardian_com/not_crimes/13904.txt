Wolf Hall star Mark Rylance has said no broadcaster other than the BBC could have made the acclaimed BBC2 drama as its director Peter Kosminsky accused the government of an ideological attack on the corporation.Kosminsky launched an impassioned defence of the BBC as he picked up the first of two prizes for Wolf Hall at the Broadcasting Press Guild awards in London on Friday.He said British broadcasting was “under sustained attack on all fronts. The BBC is being clobbered and Channel 4 threatened with privatisation. A lot of this feels ideological, a bit doctrinaire. Our heads are down”.Oscar-winner Rylance, who accepted the best actor prize in a video message, quoted one of the show’s US co-producers in telling the audience: “I don’t think there’s any company in the world other than the BBC that could have made this incredible film of Wolf Hall.”Russell T Davies, the Queer as Folk creator, who won the innovation award for his Channel 4 drama Cucumber and its spin-offs Banana and Tofu, joined in the defence of the BBC and Channel 4.He said his drama “didn’t particularly work, it wasn’t a huge success, and when they privatise Channel 4 this is exactly the sort of risk-taking that will cease to exist. That’s what’s under attack, a strange ideological attack”.The BBC faces big cuts after it took on the £700m cost of free licence fees for the over-75s, with its future shape likely to become clearer after a government white paper in the summer. The government is also exploring a possible sell-off of Channel 4.BBC presenter Sue MacGregor, who picked up best radio programme for Radio 4’s The Reunion, said: “I have been working for the BBC for four decades so I have seen the BBC go through all sorts of crises, but this I think is the most dangerous time for the BBC.”Channel 4 comedy Catastrophe was another double winner. Rob Delaney, its co-star and co-creator with Sharon Horgan, said: “British TV is the envy of the world so you have to defend the BBC and Channel 4 and protect that ecology.”Other winners included The Great British Bake Off, Peter Kay comedy Car Share, Doctor Foster star Suranne Jones and Poldark’s Aidan Turner.
