Stop this Nurturing a fine crop of cordon tomatoes, particularly outdoors, is an annual challenge, so if you have three or four trusses (the set of mini-stems where flowers and then fruit grow) developing on a plant, now is the time to stop it putting its energy into making new ones and focus on growing the existing fruit. Do this by chopping off the top of the plant, above the topmost truss. Feed weekly with organic seaweed feed.Visit this If you need inspiration for drought-resistant planting, visit the annual flower show at Hyde Hall in Essex, for a chance to buy from more than 60 specialist nurseries, plus an intergalactic trail to keep children occupied.Plant this Bergamot is one useful plant.
