What is it about writers and huts? Dylan Thomas, Virginia Woolf, Roald Dahl all worked in them. Authors so often long for the solitude, the escape from distraction, the scent of wood sap in which to create. Yet, as a novelist, I can’t use this as my only excuse. I have simply, most of my adult life, longed for a hut of one’s own.In an ideal world, this would have been a treehouse, if not a hollow oak. But as the owner of a single spindly tree that is, in fact, a shrub, my notion of writing hidden in leaf shade and sleeping among owls belongs with the clouds and cuckoos. This folly, I know, is a form of regression, an eternal fantasy clearly fuelled in childhood by Arthur Rackham’s twisted bark, Laura Ingalls Wilder’s little houses, tales of rope ladders strung between branches, driftwood and tumbledown cabins up mountains. It’s the profoundly gorgeous feel, smell, almost taste of wood that gets to me. Patently, I have a problem. In fact, initially scornful of this enterprise, my daughter threatened to write an article for this magazine’s Experience series: My Mother Has Turned Into A Child. Despite this, I knew with all certainty that the family would use and love a wooden bolt hole at the end of the garden.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Joanna Briscoe. Photograph: Antonio OlmosMy voluntary urban exile is tinged with both rural nostalgia and with some need to experience the seasons among the carbon monoxide, even in a London garden whose average measurements are 30ft x 16ft. My soul won’t rest unless mainlining the scent of sun-warmed cedar. For me, a rustic wooden hut is a very different concept from a contemporary she-shed, Shoffice, garden-room or purely functional space: it is more the incongruous log cabin of a city dweller with children.Wild notions and reality are so often hard to marry, and sourcing a sufficiently loggy cabin in this country is much harder than you’d think. The quest to match a crooked rural aesthetic with a miniature garden that is largely patio, in a terrace with no street access, provided difficulties. Commercial “log cabins” are, by and large, simply not that. They are sheds with a tiny bit of cosmetic work. And something as small as mine (the interior is 5ft x 7ft) is hard to find.

Photograph: Antonio OlmosIn my search, I encountered the cheap but flimsy; the overpriced and aspirational; the sheddy, the super-modern or and the just plain dull. Stark glass and timber cubes and pretentious summer houses with carriage lights proliferate. Shepherd’s huts on wheels are charming but too large and not sufficiently bark-covered. Keops makes good sheds, and Blue Forest makes outstanding treehouses and cabins, but at a price and for bigger areas. Also, with a shed near neighbouring walls, you have to stick to the regulation maximum height of 2.5m, so there are serious restrictions.I perused books and checked out the Cabin Porn website, increasingly frustrated. By and large, this is a very American phenomenon: a Vermont aesthetic, the territory of off-grid backwoods hippies, or a historic idea based on Thoreau’s Walden. Although as a nation we revel in this idea, the wild and wonderful sheds of the world are largely not here.Then I read Shedworking, by Alex Johnson, a brilliant resource for all things hut in this country, and stumbled upon Mark Burton’s Tiny House Cabins company ; I fell in love with a website. Here was my vision of a minuscule family cabin in real bark and shingle. I took on extra work and put the money aside for the madness.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Antonio OlmosBurton sucked his teeth at my tiny jungle of a garden, and quailed at the logistics. The initial sketch was disappointing. It looked too shed-like. Overnight, Burton, who has a vision and a passion, had another idea. I was enamoured of his plan for a gingerbread cottage, however crazily Hansel and Gretel. He emailed me a photograph of a pile of larch trunks with the message, “Went shopping for a tree today”, and I knew we understood each other.As the hut was being built, I fully appreciated that, however minuscule, this was no thin, spidery shed: its walls are an astonishing 18cm thick, with wooden tiles laid over 19 layers of insulation. With its front gable, crooked cedar shakes, bark and tiny windows, it does indeed resemble a peculiar child’s dwelling, a fairytale cabin that should be in the woods, or even a playhouse. My daughter was right, but she and I are both enchanted. Homework and writing occur side by side.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Antonio OlmosThe neighbours’ reactions have varied, from two complaints to a rendition of, “If you go down to the woods today”, along with the offer of a Little House On The Prairie box set. “I thought it was a Wendy house, but I want one,” the woman next door said, while comments about Red Riding Hood’s cottage and Hobbit Holes keep coming. But the further I’ve embraced it, the more I realise I’m far from alone. It has brought out the sheddies, cabin enthusiasts and dreamers, keen for a look – and they are out there in droves.A nautical New York apartment With a house that is impossible to extend, the cabin has proved a delight: a tiny study, a teenage escape and a children’s sleepover retreat. I wanted the interior to be rustic but restrained, without going the gingham or polka dot route: strictly no bunting, barge ware or Hunter wellies are allowed near it. It is just big enough for two adults to squeeze in and sleep side by side, and oh the joy of waking among the dew and vegetables, with birdsong in the cold air; of lounging on the sofa reading; and, as my next deadline approaches, of writing in the tranquillity and resin scent of a real cabin. I can only recommend it. Wherever you live, the woods can come to a place very near you.
