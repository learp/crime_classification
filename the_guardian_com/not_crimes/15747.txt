The Present review – Cate Blanchett and Richard Roxburgh ageing disgracefully The Sydney Theatre Company has announced that Andrew Upton’s critically acclaimed 2015 production The Present – an adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s unfinished and untitled first play – will be taken to Broadway later this year, starring Cate Blanchett and Richard Roxburgh in their Broadway debuts.Although Blanchett has toured to New York with STC previously – she appeared in its productions of Hedda Gabler, A Streetcar Named Desire and The Maids, and starred alongside Roxburgh in Upton’s adaptation of Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya – this will mark the first time Sydney Theatre Company has opened a show on Broadway. The play, usually called Platonov, was not discovered until 1920, 16 years after Chekhov’s death. Upton’s adaptation, which received a five-star review in the Guardian last year, sets the stage in the mid-1990s of post-perestroika Russia, where a group of friends – led by an acerbic, womanising school teacher, Mikhail Platonov (Roxburgh), and his wife, Sasha – gather in the country to celebrate the 40th birthday of the one that got away from him: Anna Petrovna (Blanchett).Cate Blanchett and Richard Roxburgh: two decades on stage for the Sydney Theatre Company – in pictures Upton was at the creative helm of STC until last year, serving with Blanchett as co-artistic director for the first five years of his six-year run. In 2015 he announced he would step down from the role because the couple had decided to move to New York.“The deciding factor was that our children are still of an age where they can be mobile without disrupting their education too much,” he said. “It won’t be a permanent move. Sydney will always be our home. But it will be an adventure.”Most recently, Upton was executive producer of the critically acclaimed feature Carol, starring Blanchett alongside Rooney Mara in two Oscar-nominated roles.The Present will be directed by John Crowley, who also directed the original production, and will be produced by Stuart Thompson and STC. Complete casting and an opening date will be announced soon.
