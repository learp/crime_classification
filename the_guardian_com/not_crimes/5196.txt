The cat’s eye flick has become almost a neutral. No longer seen as ultra-glam or retro, it can be dieted down to a subtle line or, as on the Dior couture catwalks, blown up into a big, bold wing. Black nods to punk, gold nods to disco. Use the end of the eyebrow as an anchor, and head towards there from the top of your lashes with a felt-tipped eyeliner. Draw another line from under the lash line to the point of your wing, then colour in the gap.Get the lookDior Addict Fluid Shadow, £25 johnlewis.comAvon Liquid Chrome, £6 avon.uk.comUrban Decay Razor Sharp Liquid Liner, £16 urbandecay.co.ukTopshop Glitter Liner, £7.50 topshop.comMary Kay at Play Bold Fluid Eyeliner, £7 marykay.co.ukRMK Ingenious Liquid Eyeliner in EX-02, £15.50 selfridges.comEmail Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman
