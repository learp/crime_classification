Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Snoop Dogg and Pharrell – What’s My Name / Drop It Like It’s Hot (2005)I remember how the room went wild for this performance: two consummate showmen delivering an absolute masterclass in this awards show mashup.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Spice Girls – Wannabe (1997)This Brits performance captured an era, a mood and a spirit like no other has before or since.
