It’s been five long years since Ridley Scott’s Prometheus left us hanging, desperate for answers to its achingly nebulous questions. Who created mankind? Who are the alien race of human-like Engineers, and why do they seem to hate us? Who created the xenomorphs? What’s that funny black goo stuff that seems to turn everything it touches into something monstrous? And why would someone trying to escape from a giant rolling wheel not simply run to one side or another to avoid being crushed to death?In truth, sequel Alien: Covenant only answers some of these posers. But the critics seem to be impressed nonetheless, with the movie picking up a solid 76% “fresh” rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Here’s a chance to give your verdict on the movie’s key talking points.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Alien: Covenant trailer: Ridley Scott returns with sci-fi thrillerAlien: Covenant review – Ridley Scott's latest space exploration feels all too familiar The return to Alien-style slasher-in-space territoryIn terms of sheer, kidney-curdling, slice-your-guts-open horror, is Covenant the most electrifying instalment since Scott’s game-changing 1979 party-starter? After a long and occasionally tedious opening act on board the colony ship, the movie tumbles headlong into a blitzkrieg of slaughter pretty much as soon as the crew arrive on David the android’s horrible home planet. Both Prometheus and its sequel are rated 15 (R in the US), but the follow-up seems to take way more pleasure in gruesomely ripping apart the crew of the Covenant in all manner of devastatingly inventive new ways. I loved the way the new xenomorphs (being referred to as protomorphs) now seem happy to burst out of any available orifice. And yet for all the grim destruction on show, was it quite so shockingly scary as the movie that spawned it? Or does familiarity with the saga’s conventions ultimately mean we are less fazed by its abominations?David’s dastardly machinationsScott seems to have worked out that Michael Fassbender’s David the android was by far the most interesting thing about Prometheus, a freewheeling, malignant enigma who is both Frankenstein’s monster and Frankenstein himself. And oooh, what a meanie he is in Covenant. Not only did the android murder Noomi Rapace’s poor Elisabeth Shaw with a facehugger, but he seems to have killed off an entire planet’s worth of Engineers – the alien race that Prometheus hinted may have helped to create mankind by unleashing black goo on them, before retreating to his hideous cave of horrors to breed all sorts of new demons. Is this all about destroying humanity, as David seems to suggest in conversation with Walter? Or is the android simply bent on creating as much icky death and destruction as possible? And is his relentlessly random behaviour a glimpse into the rabid malignancies that lurk within unfettered artificial intelligence, or just the result of murky screenwriting?

If so, that’s a very convenient way for Scott to avoid having to answer Prometheus’s burning questions. The opening scene of Covenant, in which David discusses life, the universe and everything with his “father” Peter Weyland, suggests that this film series still hopes to eventually reveal where mankind comes from, and perhaps why the Engineers seem to hate us so. But it’s incredibly frustrating that the film-making team chose to (apparently) write the alien race out of the new episode’s script altogether after placing so much emphasis on them last time around. Sure, David’s devilish antics lit up the otherwise unwieldy Prometheus, but by choosing to zero in on the devious android at the expense of the Engineers, Scott seems to have made 50% of the previous instalment completely redundant. Will we now have to wait another several years to find out if these baldy CGI mega-humans really are our space daddies? And does anyone really trust this series not to simply jettison all those loose threads out into the nothingness of space when we’re all looking the other way?The final twistYou knew something was up the moment David chopped off those grungy locks for no apparent reason. Did anyone fail to spot that the android meanie had made a switcheroo with the identical Walter in order to trick the remaining crew members into trusting him? And how did he pull it off? Was it merely a case of swapping clothes and chopping off his own hand to complete the subterfuge, or did David somehow take over Walter’s body? And could the twist have been better handled, to make it a genuine shock on a par with the moment Ash is revealed as an android in the original?

That’s the job’ Where to next?As the credits rolled on Covenant, David’s ship is on course for the planet the crew had originally planned to colonise, with 2,000 souls on board, not to mention several mini-facehuggers presumably primed to use them all as incubators for a new brood of xenomorphs. It’s a more open-ended denouement than we’ve seen in previous films, which might be a good thing given Covenant’s complete failure to deliver on Prometheus’s final payoff. Will whoever is tasked with penning the next film now be faced with the unappealing task of writing the Engineers back in, as we know one of them turns up on planetoid LV-426 some 20 years later to help set in motion the events of Alien?Covenant’s place in the pantheonDespite its many flaws and frustrations I would place Covenant (a long way) behind Alien and Aliens, followed by Prometheus, Alien 3, Resurrection and the execrable versus movies.
