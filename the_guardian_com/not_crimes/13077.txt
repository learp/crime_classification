Morrisons appears to be the biggest winner from the horsemeat scandal after the supermarket chain reported an 18% rise at its fresh meat counters in the wake of revelations over tainted food.The retailer said it had posted the double-digit increase since horse DNA was first identified in Tesco value beef burgers. It published the sales data as another study found 45% of shoppers would avoid the meat aisles of chains found selling the contaminated meat.Morrisons has around 1,700 butchers across 500 stores and anecdotal evidence from staff points to customers seeking out fresh meat at its stores instead of frozen food.Fresh beef burger sales have jumped 50%, fresh pork sales are up 124%, beef mince is up 21% and lamb rose 15% over the past two weeks, compared with last month, the company said.Morrisons' chief executive, Dalton Philips, said: "Because we work direct with farms, even owning our very own, our counters and expert staff can confidently offer the most reliable meat to customers." Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's declined to comment on their meat sales.Morrisons has a business model which sources meat through a variety of local farm communities, which means bosses have closer knowledge of the supply chain. As a result, during the horsemeat scandal the company's response has been limited to removing Findus-branded lasagnes from shelves after tests found some contained 100% horse.By comparison, Tesco and Aldi have found horsemeat in their value lasagne and bolognese ranges because the meat was supplied by the same French supplier, Comigel, which supplied Findus. Tesco later admitted some samples contained more than 60% horsemeat.Horsemeat was found in burgers processed at factories owned by ABP Food Group in Yorkshire and Ireland. The same company supplied burgers to Lidl, Iceland, Tesco, Aldi and Dunnes stores, as well as Burger King restaurants.Even Waitrose has been implicated for mislabelling, when pork was found in its beef meatballs.A poll by Retail Week magazine found that 45% of shoppers would avoid the meat aisles of the chains found to be selling horsemeat labelled as beef. Nearly three-in-four customers said they felt suppliers were most at fault for the contamination, but stores including Tesco, Asda, the Co-operative and Iceland are likely to suffer, the survey found.The Food Standards Agency has ordered all meat suppliers and sellers to test their meat products, with the first tranche of results expected to be released on Friday.
