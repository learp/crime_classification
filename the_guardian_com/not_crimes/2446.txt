Films without a cinema release have the chance to be considered eligible for the British film industry’s most prestigious awards, following a rules changed announced on 19 August. Previously, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts had required competing titles to be released in cinemas. As of the 2017 awards, movies released only digitally will be able to be submitted.Speaking to Variety, Bafta’s Jim Bradshaw confirmed that the film committee will decide on a “case by case” basis which movies will be considered for awards. “This is to do with making sure that we continue to recognise the best in film-making,” explained Bradshaw, saying Bafta was eager not to “penalise films, especially international content, because of how they are funded or who has picked it up in the UK”.Why Emma Watson's £47 flop wasn't meant to be a box-office hit Increasing numbers of smaller films enjoy a day-in-date digital and theatrical release to capitalise on the media coverage that comes with opening in cinemas, but rely on streaming and download for the bulk of profits. This has led to striking headlines in which new films by stars such as Emma Watson and Al Pacino take dismayingly low figures at the UK box office, masking the real revenue.The news comes in a week when the UK distributor Metrodome went into administration. The company, which specialised in intelligent awards fare, was thought to have suffered from a falloff in cinema attendance among arthouse audiences. Other Bafta rule changes included increasing the number of nominations from three to five in the animation category. The next ceremony will take place on 12 February 2017, following nominations on 10 January.
