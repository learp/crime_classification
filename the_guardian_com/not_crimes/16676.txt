The actor Nigel Havers has accepted undisclosed damages from Mirror Group Newspapers after its journalists intercepted his voicemails for stories about his grief as he nursed his dying wife.A statement read out on Havers’ behalf in the high court in London on Friday described how evidence had shown that Mirror journalists and private detectives working on their behalf had targeted him between 2000 and 2004, but particularly between April and August 2004. “[This] was the period when Mr Havers was nursing his late wife, who was then in her final stages of her battle with cancer, the time of her passing and her funeral,” the statement, read out by his barrister, David Sherborne, said. “This was a horrific and traumatic time for Mr Havers, during which all sorts of sensitive and private information would have been accessible through his voicemails and those of individuals who were close to him, including his details of his late wife’s medical condition and treatment, as well as his own welfare and emotional state at the time.”The hearing marked settlements reached between Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) and nearly two dozen claimants, including Davina McCall, Kym Marsh and Rhys Ifans, after the company admitted its journalists hacked their voicemails for stories. The claims concerned stories and investigations by reporters from the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror and the People, which were based on details about the claimants’ work and personal lives obtained through accessing their voicemails.In each case, Chloe Strong, MGN’s barrister, relayed the company’s “sincere apologies” and acknowledgement that the “information should never have been obtained in the manner it was”.Many of the claimants said the stories had led to a breakdown of trust between them and their friends, who suspected they had been leaking stories to the tabloids. Henry Fox, representing Ifans, an actor, said: “The claimant is upset that since he was targeted by the defendant, over a decade ago, he has lost a number of close friends as a result of the distrust created by the defendant’s activities. “Had the defendant’s conduct come to light at an earlier stage then these friendships may not have been damaged. This is something that the claimant bitterly regrets.”A statement Sherborne read out on behalf of the actor Caroline Chikezie, a star of the ITV drama Footballers’ Wives, said: “The claimant has never spoken out to any journalists by telephone. She is devastated to think that the defendant’s conduct caused a great deal of distrust between her and her partner at the time and also her close friends, many of who suspected the claimant of leaking private information to the press.“The claimant now realises that the distrust, upset and problems she experienced with her relationships during this period were caused by being targeted by MGN journalists who were systematically hacking her voicemail messages and listening to her private information.”Others who reached settlements with MGN and whose statements were read out in court include Christopher Parker, an actor who has appeared in Eastenders; Samia Ghadie, a former Coronation Street star; Kym Marsh, the Hear’Say singer and soap opera actor; Lisa Maxwell, the Loose Women panellist. Cases previously settled against MGN include those of the fund manager Nicola Horlick for £25,000, model Emma Noble for £40,000, stuntman Bobby Holland Hanton for £75,000 and Interior designer Kelly Hoppen for an undisclosed sum.A spokesperson for Charles Russell Speechlys, which represented seven claimants whose statements were heard in Friday’s hearing, said: “We are delighted that the statements in open court have been read out today in relation to many of our clients’ claims against MGN Limited, the publisher of the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror and the People.“In addition to awards of damages and payment of our clients’ legal costs, MGN has offered its apologies to each of these clients for the distress caused to them by hacking into their voicemail messages, obtaining private information about them and using that information.”Anjlee Saigol of Taylor Hampton solicitors, who represented Havers, said: “Nigel’s case really does highlight MGN’s truly callous behaviour and how its journalists ransacked voicemails no matter what their victim was going through in search of a ‘good story’. “To do this to someone during the time when their wife was in the final stages of cancer, her then passing and the funeral shows a complete lack of human empathy. My client is therefore very pleased to have received this apology today.”
