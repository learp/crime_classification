Molly Meldrum’s close friend and former personal assistant says the music guru is receiving the best care possible following a fall.There were concerns the 73-year-old’s health had deteriorated since the accident in Thailand with reports on Monday that Meldrum’s brother was making attempts to fly him home.Meldrum, who just celebrated his birthday, slipped while getting out of a cab at a hotel in Bangkok last month.He has been in excruciating pain since the fall and now faces spinal surgery.Entertainment reporter Peter Ford tweeted on Monday that plans were in place to bring Meldrum back to Australia for treatment.“Molly’s brother has flown to be with him. Possibility he may be flown out on medivac flight home,” Ford tweeted.Ford also told Melbourne radio station 3AW that Molly’s condition is “a lot more serious” than first thought.But Meldrum’s long-time friend Michael Gudinski said the reports that he would be flown home were incorrect, saying the whole thing had been “blown out of proportion”.“He’s not flying back to Australia at this stage,” the Mushroom Music boss said.But Gudinski admitted Meldrum’s situation was not good.“He’s in hospital. He’s in pain. He’s broken a few bones which in his situation is not a good thing because he’s had trouble before,” Gudinski said on Monday.In 2011, Meldrum took a nasty fall at his Richmond home while putting up Christmas decorations. He suffered a fractured skull and spent months in rehabilitation following the near fatal accident.Yael Cohn, Meldrum’s former personal assistant, was unable to confirm any details on his condition.“I know that he’s safe and well and that’s the most important thing at the moment,” Cohn said. “I’m confident at least he’s been well looked after.“That’s the most important thing to me as a person who cares for him, as a friend, that he’s in the best possible care and I’ve been assured of that.”The first episode of two-part biopic Molly, starring Samuel Johnson as Molly Meldrum, premieres on Sunday 7 February on Seven.
