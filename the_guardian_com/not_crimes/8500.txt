Fumio Sasaki’s one-room Tokyo apartment is so stark friends liken it to an interrogation room. He owns three shirts, four pairs of trousers, four pairs of socks and a meagre scattering of various other items. Money isn’t the issue. The 36-year-old editor has made a conscious lifestyle choice, joining a growing number of Japanese deciding that less is more.The extraordinary survival of the boy left in a Japanese forest  Influenced by the spare aesthetic of Japan’s traditional Zen Buddhism, minimalists buck the norm in a fervently consumerist society by dramatically paring back their possessions. Sasaki, once a passionate collector of books, CDs and DVDs, became tired of keeping up with trends two years ago. “I kept thinking about what I did not own, what was missing,” he says. He spent the next year selling possessions or giving them to friends. “Spending less time on cleaning or shopping means I have more time to spend with friends, go out, or travel on my days off. I have become a lot more active,” he says.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Minimalist Naoki Numahata talks to his two-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Ei, in their living-room in Tokyo.

Definitions vary, because the goal is not just decluttering but re-evaluating what posessions mean, to gain something else – in Sasaki’s case, time to travel.

Some say minimalism is actually not foreign but a natural outgrowth of Zen Buddhism and its stripped-down world view. “In the west, making a space complete means placing something there,” says Naoki Numahata, 41, a freelance writer. “But with tea ceremonies, or Zen, things are left incomplete on purpose to let the person’s imagination make that space complete.”Minimalists also argue that having fewer possessions is eminently practical in Japan, which is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
