I thought that Mr Gum was a little silly, because he didn’t like children. I thought that was a bit silly of him to think that. Anyway, he was supposed to live in a nice house but he grew it into a stinky old yucky house.Everything was just messy, his bed wasn’t even made. That doesn’t mean he hadn’t pulled up the covers, he just threw the bits of wood on the floor and put an old mattress on top! He kept his garden clean because there was a very angry fairy that lived in his bathtub, and if Mr Gum did not clean up his garden he would get whacked by the fairy’s frying pan, which Mr Gum did not like! This book was so exciting that one night I did not even sleep that well because I absolutely wanted to know what happened. Now there was a dog that was called Jake, and that was who I was worried about that night! Mr Gum had a plan to finish off Jake the dog, and if you’re wondering why Mr Gum thought that, it was because Jake was full of happiness (and he wrecked his garden by chewing up the flowers, and running around and squashing all the grass). The book is so funny. Why would a fairy live in Mr Gum’s bath tub? I don’t know! There’s all sorts of other nonsense in this book that made me laugh a lot. There was a little girl who you could call Polly if you were her friend, but if you weren’t her friend you would have to call her... sorry I’m not going to tell you, go read the book and see for yourself! I liked Mr Gum, he always said “Shabba me whiskers!” This is one of my favourite books! Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
