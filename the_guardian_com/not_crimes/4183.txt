When people think about life’s most transformative moments, births, deaths and weddings are what often come to mind. But something as simple as quitting a job, a talk in a bar or an unexpected move might make all the difference.That’s how it started for Jonathan Hirsch, whose podcast Arrvls tells the stories of unexpected changes, whether leaving an unsatisfactory job, coping with a heartbreaking student exchange, or surviving a plane crash. Each episode tells the story about the revelations that unfurl after a life-altering experience, whether mundane or massive.Why You Should Listen: Fittingly, Arrvls began with a departure: Jonathan Hirsch’s move from San Francisco to New York City. “My wife and I realized that if we wanted to take a stab at living in New York that now was the time,” he said. They packed up and drove to the city. Hirsch, who had applied to graduate school to become an editor, got an entry-level position doing just that.

Panic attacks struck in the middle of the night, and he didn’t get into grad school. It was a career crisis at 29. “I would call my wife every lunch break out on Fifth Avenue, just losing it,” he said. His wife told him that if he would rather work in a coffee shop, he should quit. “I walked out of the building where I was working and never looked back.”Though Hirsch walked boldly off into the sunset that day, he woke up the next one knowing this was not a fairytale happy ending. “I was 29 years old, recently married, in a new city that I wasn’t particularly enjoying. I expected something very different for my life and I didn’t get it,” he said. “I started panicking.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Jonathan Hirsch: ‘I expected something very different for my life.’ Photograph: Melissa LockerHirsch applied for a job in a bar and got caught up in conversation with an employee who had also struggled through an unexpected turn. “He was grateful for that time when he had struggled,” Hirsch recalled. “While he was talking, I felt relief. There was some comfort or solace in that person’s story, and I wanted more of that.” Hirsch asked him to come over for an interview – even though he had no experience in radio or documentary filmmaking.“It became clear to me that I needed more of these stories – lots more,” Hirsch said. “Hopefully each one would provide me with a sense of clarity about what happens in these moments when you don’t know what your next step is in life.”That’s how Arrivls was born. “It was all entirely new to me, but I just took it on and it became everything to me,” Hirsch said. He started work at a restaurant at night, waking up early to work on the show, learn about podcasting, find stories and build episodes. “The bar for entry to radio is really low, but the bar to making good radio is really high.”As he’s learned the ropes, he’s told stories along the way, all on the themes of migration, transformation and change. “Those three anchors for the stories makes it feel like a very creative and fun process,” he said. “I sit with those themes and they are constantly renewed as I think about them and I think about the stories I would like to hear on those themes.” Listen to this: Story Collider reveals the human stories behind the science Something as innocuous as a plane flying overhead can give Hirsch an idea. “I started looking for stories of plane crashes, because I wanted to know what it was like to be in that,” he said. “I found a Facebook group where people were sharing their stories.” That’s how he met Robin Holleran, whose story is documented in the episode Ricochet.Another episode tells the story of the Blazing Echidna, a self-made superhero whom Hirsch had met on a train years ago. “I’m looking for the places where stories I’ve heard, places I’ve been, people I’ve met resonate with the themes of the show,” he said. In addition to tracking down stories through news clippings or word of mouth, Arrvls also now takes submissions. As the show turns a year old, Arrvls has branched out into live shows. “My goal is to tell a wider breadth of stories. My goal is tell stories from every walk of life, every type of background, every type of experience.”Currently, though, Hirsch is on a migration of his own. He has left New York for Los Angeles in pursuit of his next story and another transformation. Where To Start: The Blazing Echidna, January 1, 1982, Miss EvaSubscribe to Arrvls on iTunes or Acast
