British gin is synonymous with London. However, in recent years, more than two-thirds of the UK’s total gin production has moved outside the capital – and outside England altogether. Scotland is now at the heart of the British gin industry, home to two of the world’s largest brands (Gordon’s and Tanqueray) but also to an array of craft gin distillers: currently more than 25. In the past two years, half a dozen new craft gins have reached the shelves, from names such as Crossbill and Heather Rose. There’s even a fresh venture to celebrate from the Isle of Jura, where three women have established Lussa Gin, using 15 botanicals from the hills and lochs, woods and coastline of the island.

Photograph: AlamyTo reflect this rise in Scottish craft gin, the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) has launched the Scotland Gin Trail. The route’s 17 stopoffs include craft distilleries and gin bars across Scotland, from the bright lights of Glasgow Distillery (a young producer that launched its first spirit, Makar Glasgow Gin, in 2014) to the dark skies of Shetland Reel Gin (the UK’s most northerly distillery).Those who follow the trail can discover the diversity of Scotland’s gins. For example, on the north coast, Dunnet Bay Distillery creates the delicate, aromatic Rock Rose Gin, which has earned awards for husband-and-wife team Martin and Claire Murray. Meanwhile, Eden Mill in St Andrew’s prefers to challenge palates with one-of-a-kind craft creations such as Golf Gin, which is “flavoured with retired golf clubs” – hickory shavings from clubs are added to the botanicals.

Gin enthusiasts can tour the distillery (tickets from £10), peeking into the two copper stills, Flora and Caledonia, before heading into the Heads and Tales basement bar for a tutored tasting of the navy-strength Cannonball Gin, Seaside Gin (which incorporates coastal botanicals) and or its own eponymous gin, which is distilled with heather, milk thistle and pine.

The juniper-flavoured Dutch spirit genever first arrived in Edinburgh in the 1600s, and was gleefully embraced. When a tax on imported spirits cut off the supply, entrepreneurial locals began to craft their own cheap, readily available versions, and helped usher in an era of mass drunkenness and moral hand-wringing across the UK, known as the Gin Craze. But then in the late 18th century, Scots discovered a taste for whisky, and gin lost out.Until now. The release of the South Ayrshire-made Hendrick’s Gin in 1999 signalled the start of a new era for gin in Scotland, and the past few years have seen further development and new ventures. The WSTA trail puts gin back on the map – and enables visitors to see and enjoy so much of the great landscape that inspires the producers.• Follow the Scotland Gin TrailGin up: 12 stops to discover on the Scotland Gin Trail      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Boats on Norwick beach at sunrise, Unst, Shetland Islands Photograph: Alamy Stock PhotoGordon Castle, Fochabers, MorayThis famous Highland estate uses the produce of its own walled herb garden to create Gordon Castle Gin, an award-winning, small-batch aromatic gin.• gordoncastlescotland.comArbikie Highland Estate Distillery, Inverkeilor, AngusArbikie is owned by a family of farmers, so everything that goes into Kirsty’s Gin, named for its master distiller, is grown on site.• arbikie.comShetland Reel Gin, Unst, ShetlandOn the UK’s most northerly island, this distillery infuses its gins with the scents and tastes of Shetland, from seaweed to apple mint.• shetlandreel.comBalmenach Distillery, Cromdale, MorayBalmenach’s Caorunn Gin walks on the wild side, with infusions of 13 foraged Highland botanicals, from heather to dandelion.• caorunngin.comCrossbill Highland Distilling, Inshriach, AviemoreLaunched in 2014, Crossbill lays claim to be the only gin made from 100% Scottish juniper and rosehip.• crossbillgin.comEden Mill, St AndrewsThis combined brewery and distillery revels in unorthodox craft gins, from the pink-tinted Love Gin to the beer-inspired Hop Gin.• edenmill.comEdinburgh Gin Distillery, EdinburghEdinburgh Gin produces a superb selection of handcrafted gins, including seasonal bottlings such as a frankincense- and myrrh-distilled Christmas Gin and a floral, pink-tinted Valentine’s Gin.• edinburghgindistillery.co.uk      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Gin Still, known as Annie, at Glasgow DistilleryGlasgow Distillery, GlasgowHead to Scotland’s largest city for Makar Glasgow Gin; the distinctive juniper kick makes it ideal for dry martinis.• glasgowdistillery.comDunnet Bay Distillery, Dunnet, CaithnessDunnet Bay’s Rock Rose gin, a traditional gin with clear notes of juniper and citrus, was released in 2014, but has already collected a host of awards.• dunnetbaydistillers.co.ukGin71, GlasgowGlasgow’s first dedicated gin bar serves 71 gins in an opulent Victorian setting of high ornamental ceilings, tiled walls and chandeliers.• gin71.comFirkin Gin and The Jolly Botanist, EdinburghOpened last year (a symbol of gin’s growing status in Scotland), the Jolly Botanist has a 72-strong gin list, including the oak-infused dry Firkin Gin.• thejollybotanist.co.ukStrathearn Distillery, Methven, PerthStrathearn specialises in gins with a twist, from Heather Rose, which turns pink when tonic is added, to Oaked Highland Gin, with a smokiness reminiscent of scotch (it is even served in a whisky glass).• strathearndistillery.com
