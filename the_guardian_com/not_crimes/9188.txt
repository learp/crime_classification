A first taste of autumn up on the high ground west of this south Pennine settlement. The best of the heather show has passed; the curlew and dunlin are packing their bags for a winter on lower ground. The moortops are virtually silent. Up here South Yorkshire's largest river, the Don, is born but the exact spot is a subject for debate.When John Holland, a local writer, followed the entire course of the river on foot in 1830 he decided that the actual source was what he christened Don Well – "a hole in the bank side … about twenty inches in diameter". Such a feature cannot be located nowadays, only a boggy outflow or seepage that trickles down to a main channel draining from the head of this broad hollow which some think the legitimate source of the Don. This is Great Grains Clough, and on a recent day we came up here to reach the wild watershed which is the boundary between South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and Derbyshire. Various mounds and piles of stones mark the line of the boundary, and on dull days the prospects can appear dreary and forlorn.On this occasion, though, the sun warmed us and the slopes that support great swaths of nardus and molinia grass – not the most nutritious fodder for the hardy flocks that haunt these upper Don-lands. Away to the north-east, we could make out the white trig pillar on Snailsden Edge and a bit farther off the dimple of Cook's Study Hill. This is the site of the unique tower-cum-folly that served as a gamekeeper's house (and lookout) until set alight long ago by poachers. It stood as a gaunt ruin with a reputation of being haunted well into the 20th century, only to be later demolished, its site now marked by overgrown rubble beside the lonely lane between Dunford Bridge and Holmfirth.
