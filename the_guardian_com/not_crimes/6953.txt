A groundbreaking project to give thousands of sub-standard homesa dramatic green makeover has finally won EU approval, but only after a massive downgrading of its ambition.The Energiesprong project had hoped to provide a wave of 10-day makeovers for over 100,000 British housing association and council homes, installing wraparound insulating facades, solar panels and Ikea kitchens.But to get an initial €3.6m (£2.6m) of EU support, the group had to scale back their ambitions and now plans just 5,000 retrofits in the UK, and the same number in France. Ikea kitchens help sell insulation to Dutch – and UK could be next “The British government should step in to add funding and a willingness to make this happen because in the end you need money to get it running,” said Jasper van den Munckhof, the project’s manager.Energiesprong is calling for UK government funds to mitigate spiralling costs caused by the government’s planned cuts to solar power incentives, and high banking interest rates on long term loans.A ComRes survey for the thinktank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) yesterday said that more than eight in 10 Britons support subsidies for home insulation as a way of cutting energy waste. But energy efficiency projects have suffered from a policy paralysis in the UK, since the demise of the ill-fated green deal programme in July. “With insulation rates falling to their lowest level since 2013 there’s a clear rationale for ministers re-invigorating policies that cut energy waste, and one obvious approach would be to make energy efficiency a national infrastructure priority,” said Richard Black, the ECIU’s director.Buildings are responsible for around 36% of Europe’s carbon emissions, and poorly insulated homes also have a social dimension. Campaigners at Age UK say that this winter, like every other, tens of thousands of elderly people will suffer illnesses or die as a result of cold, leaky homes, and high energy bills. “The only sustainable solution is an ambitious programme to bring all our homes up to a high energy efficiency standard,” said Caroline Abrahams, the charity’s director. “We are calling on the government to reform its energy efficiency schemes to help insulate older people and families on a low income against the cold weather and the high cost of energy.”In the Netherlands, Energiesprong is already delivering on a contract to renovate 110,000 prefab homes built in the 1960s and 70s. This is being paid for by the estimated €6bn of energy bill savings it will bring tenants, and under-written by government guarantees over a 40-year period.“The big difference there is that interest rates on capital loans for housing associations are lower, and feed-in tariffs for solar panels – which we need – are not under political pressure,” Munckhof said.At present, Energiesprong is setting up in the UK with no contracts, and no guarantee that its totemic Ikea kitchens – which won tenants associations round to the retrofit idea in the Netherlands – will be repeated in Britain.The European commission last night began consultations on extending its energy efficiency directive for a decade after 2020, and will next year publish plans to improve revenue streams for small renovations projects.“The difficulties facing important and innovative projects like Energiesprong reflect the unfavourable investment climate for energy efficiency in general, and that is exactly what should be tackled by national and EU policies,” said Stefan Scheuer, the secretary-general of the Coalition for Energy Savings.Marilyn Haines, the vice chair of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes added: “By rolling out insulation, double-glazing and better boilers more of us could be living in cosier homes with lower bills and less polluting carbon emissions.”
