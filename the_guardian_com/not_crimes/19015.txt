The BBC has unveiled the first official glimpse of the new-look Top Gear featuring Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc.The 60-second trailer, which was released on Thursday, features a host of supercars including the moment when Evans is sick on a trackside in California after going for a spin in an Audi R8 V10 with co-star, Sabine Schmitz.Top Gear: Chris Evans says Cenotaph stunt should not be broadcast The clip also features former Friends star LeBlanc driving a Reliant three-wheeler from London to Blackpool and a Dodge Viper ACR with a Browning machine-gun attached to its roof being driven at a military base in Nevada.The new series of BBC2’s Top Gear – the first since the departure of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May – is one of the most anticipated shows of the year.The clip includes footage shot in the UK, US, France, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates and features cars including the Aston Martin Vulcan, Ferrari F12 TDF and Ariel Nomad.Stylistically, at least, the trailer offers up a familiar mix for Top Gear fans including cars racing jets, machine guns, celebrity guests (Jenson Button) and a presenter - in this case LeBlanc - being the butt of the joke.The song - in case you are wondering - is I Just Want To Celebrate, a 1970s US top 10 hit for American band Rare Earth.The show has already proved controversial after LeBlanc and rally driver Ken Block were filmed doing “doughnuts” close to London’s Cenotaph. Evans later apologised “unreservedly” for the scenes which May later described as “ill-advised”.It also suffered the loss of its executive producer Lisa Clark after five months, and the BBC was moved to defend Evans’s stewardship of the show after reports had suggested he had objected to the signing of LeBlanc.James May: ‘We are not in a race with Chris Evans’ Top Gear’ The new series is expected to air towards the end of May and may be shorter than its original intended run of eight episodes. The BBC is yet to confirm a start date or the length of the new run.Clarkson, May and Hammond are working on a new series for Amazon Prime after signing a reported £160m deal with the subscription video on demand service last year following Clarkson’s axing by the BBC.May said in an interview with MediaGuardian last week he was not in a race to beat Evans on screen, with the Amazon show expected to debut in the autumn.There is much riding on the new series of Top Gear for the BBC, worth £50m a year to its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, and BBC2’s most popular show.
