Also known as the Kaufmann Residence, the house is built on top of a waterfall in the Bear Run stream in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. Although Wright is one of America’s most famous architects and Fallingwater is now a national historic landmark, Wright’s lack of experience in using reinforced concrete and the adventurous cantilever design caused lots of disputes between Wright, his client and the contractor during the construction.

Lasdum said: “Concrete is a very intractable material, but it can be a beautiful material if it is used in the way its own nature intends it to be used... It is a sort of sculpture that you can only do with reinforced concrete, but you need to work to a certain scale... It is not a cosy little material”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Zvartnots International Airport, Yerevan, Armenia.7 | Zvartnots International Airport, YerevanM Khachikyan, A Tarkhanyan, S Qalashyan, L Cherkezyan, M Baghdasaryan, H Tigranyan, Arthur Meschian, 1971Suggested by tiojoLocated 7.5 miles west of the Armenian capital Yerevan, this airport is one of the country’s most recognisable modern buildings.
