The leaders of the UK’s two main opposition parties say they hope the Paris climate summit will encourage prime minister David Cameron to reconsider green policies.UK energy and climate chief Amber Rudd has been handed a key role at the UN talks, helping to mediate between almost 200 countries on global plans to boost greenhouse gas cuts before 2020.But critics point to a government bonfire of support for the solar and wind sector, an end to plans for thousands of ultra-efficient houses and the cancellation of a $1bn investment in carbon capture technology.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, on a one-day visit to Paris, said he wanted the UK to be at the “heart” of a proposed global climate deal, “not tagging on behind”.“I hope she will be listening to the expert opinion around her which is saying we should be doing more to accept just electricity in the UK, more in promoting renewables rather than fossil fuels,” he said.

We all have an obligation to do everything we possibly can.”
