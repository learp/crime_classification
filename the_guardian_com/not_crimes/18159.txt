A biopic of celebrated war correspondent Marie Colvin is set to get off the ground after producers were reported to have approached Matthew Heineman, maker of hardhitting Oscar-nominated documentary Cartel Land, to direct.According to Screen, Heineman is due to take the reins of the film (based on Marie Brennerâ€™s 2012 Vanity Fair article); the shoot is planned to start towards the end of 2016. Charlize Theron, whose Denver and Delilah company is on board as part of the production team, is in prime place to take the lead role, but has not yet decided either way.Colvin was an American-born journalist who joined the Sunday Times in 1985 and covered a string of conflicts including Chechnya, Sierra Leone, East Timor and Libya. She lost an eye in 2001 while working in Sri Lanka (resulting in her distinctive eyepatch), and died in 2012 in Homs in Syria, after the building she was sheltering in was allegedly shelled by the Syrian army.
