Samantha Bee opened up this week’s episode of her TBS show with a takedown of Donald Trump’s lewd leaked tape from 2005.'This is on you': John Oliver ridicules Republicans over Trump groping tape In Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, she criticised the presidential candidate and his “locker room talk” with small screen personality Billy Bush.“That 2005 Access Hollywood tape wasn’t just lewd remarks, Trump was literally explaining a time-tested strategy for sexual assault,” Bee said. “In fact, take a Tic Tac and grab them by the pussy is the closest thing to a plan Donald Trump has described this entire election.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest She referred to the “adolescent boner bus” and called the video a “hostile work environment training module” before going on to critique Trump’s apology which he shared via social media soon after. She called Rudy Giuliani “the only surrogate not hiding behind a hay bale” and then went in on the party members who have only now distanced themselves from Trump.“Meanwhile, a whole lot of Republicans have been grappling with their Muslim-banning, Mexican-insulting, race-baiting, disability-mocking, alt-right-channeling demagogue might not be such a good guy after all,” she said. In the same episode, Bee also covered the second debate, which she calls “the night we gave up”. The debate saw a battle between “a well-prepared if uninspiring public servant” and “a crotch-fondling slab of rancid meatloaf”.

Trump did to Hillary, the moderators and the viewers what he did to that chair and insulted us all the while.”
