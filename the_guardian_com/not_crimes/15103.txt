Heathrow has appointed an insider to replace Colin Matthews as chief executive. The development director of Britain's largest airport, John Holland-Kaye, will take charge in July.The airport has plumped for the only prominent internal candidate. Holland-Kaye joined the company in 2009 from the construction firm Taylor Wimpey. He has since overseen the building of the new Terminal 2, due to open next month.He has impressed the airport by boosting retail income and passenger satisfaction.Holland-Kaye will now spearhead Heathrow's push for a third runway, which is being considered by an independent commission headed by the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Sir Howard Davies.Matthews, who has been chief executive since 2008, announced his resignation last month.He said: "John has played a pivotal role in the delivery of the new Terminal 2, which is a further important step in the transformation of Heathrow. John has also been heavily involved in developing the new approach to Heathrow expansion which has been shortlisted by the Airports Commission."Holland-Kaye said: "I am very proud to have been chosen to succeed Colin. We have worked closely together for the last five years to improve passenger experience, efficiency and resilience, to a point where Heathrow is increasingly seen as Europe's hub of choice."Both the incoming and outgoing chief executives will be unveiling Heathrow's detailed plans for a third runway next week, as the airport enters a critical phase in persuading the Davies commission – as well as government and the public – of the feasibility of an expanded hub.
