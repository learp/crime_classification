Mexican author Yuri Herrera and his translator Lisa Dillman have won the Best translated book award for Signs Preceding the End of the World, which tells the story of a young woman crossing the Mexico border into the US.The novel charts how Makina sets out in search of her brother, striking a bargain to deliver a package for a local gang leader in return for safe passage across the Rio Grande. Maya Jaggi’s Guardian review hailed it as a “marvellously rich, slim novel” that works “on many levels”.Herrera is the first Spanish-language author to win the $10,000 (£7,000) award for fiction, which is split equally between writer and translator, seeing off a shortlist including literary stars such as the bestselling Italian author Elena Ferrante and the Brazilian short story writer Clarice Lispector.Signs Preceding the End of the World by Yuri Herrera review – a lyrical Mexican migrants’ tale In a statement to the Guardian, Herrera praised Dillman’s translation skills, saying: “Lisa prepares for a translation the way she prepares to run marathons, knowing that it looks like an impossible task at the beginning but that she will ace it. She reads carefully, she asks lots of questions and she makes the right decisions... Translators deserve much more recognition, and, of course, much better payment.”Judge Jason Grunebaum also praised Dillman’s translation, saying she had “crafted a dazzling voice in English”.“This novel of real pathos and unexpected displacement in self, place, and language achieves a near perfect artistic convergence of translator and author,” Grunebaum said, “while giving readers an urgent account from today’s wall-building world.”The Portuguese poet Angélica Freitas and her translator Hilary Kaplan won the best poetry category with Rilke Shake. Freitas and Kaplan each won $5,000, for a collection warmly endorsed by judge Tess Lewis:Reading Mexico - books podcast “[Kaplan captures] the many shifts in tone in and between the lines, from playful to wry to sardonic to pathetic, even sentimental, to deadpan and back to playful, sometimes within a single poem,” she said. “For all of Freitas’s lyric clowning, it’s clear she takes poetry too seriously not to dismantle it and use it to her own purposes.”Freitas and Kaplan won the award ahead of a shortlist of six poetry collections, including China’s Liu Xia – the wife of the imprisoned Nobel peace prize winner Liu Xiaobo – for her collection Empty Chairs, and Load Poems Like Guns, the work of eight Afghan women poets.The awards are administered by the University of Rochester’s Three Percent blog, and funded by Amazon.com’s literary partnership programmes.
