There are 27 separate areas, sprawled across more than 1,000 acres, at Glastonbury festival each year. You could quite easily spend an entire week there and never visit the same place twice. And yet, when news emerged last week of The Sisterhood – a relatively tiny venue – it was met with a tidal wave of outrage. The Guardian’s news story alone amassed 2,368 comments. Why? Because The Sisterhood is a female-only venue, the first in Glastonbury’s history.Glastonbury 2016 to introduce women-only venue Billed as a “revolutionary clubhouse”, The Sisterhood is an “intersectional, queer, trans and disability-inclusive space” open to “all people who identify as women”. Its organisers’ rationale, outlined in a mission statement, is that “women-only spaces are necessary in a world that is still run by and designed to benefit mainly men”. One of the most common arguments against the idea is that it’s reverse sexism. That if it were the other way around, and the festival announced a male-only venue, there would be uproar. It is a specious argument, wheeled out whenever a group that faces discrimination attempts to carve out a safe space for itself, and one ignores vital context. Take personal safety, for example. Almost every woman has a memory or two imprinted somewhere in the edges of her mind – that tend to crawl their way to the centre when she’s walking alone at night – that keeps her pace high and head low as she passes men she doesn’t know. Festivals are no different. Sometimes, when that unique combination of inebriation and escapism curdles, they can be worse. My own negative experiences at festivals are relatively mild – a drunk man ran at me from behind, picked me up roughly and started running until a male friend insisted he put me down; a group of men sat shouting marks out of 10 at every woman who crossed their visual path; I became trapped in an aggressive, male-dominated crowd of David Guetta fans (as if seeing David Guetta live wasn’t punishment enough). My experiences are not, as it turns out, unusual.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   St Vincent … not a fan of female-only Lilith Fair. Photograph: MediaPunch/REXI posed a question on Twitter: “Have you ever felt unsafe or uncomfortable, as a woman, at a music festival?” Of the 146 people who responded (a fairly small sample size, but enough to paint a picture), 127 answered yes. Some offered specific examples: “At my second festival I remember a man shouting, ‘Give us a tit wank, love,’ at me and I was mortified,” said one. “Pretty much relentless unwanted touching from men – stops me getting deep into crowds, keeps me from many festivals entirely,” said another. One person had been elbowed in the face, deliberately, by a man she didn’t know, and another walked into a cinema tent that was showing a film involving graphic rape scenes “to cheering drunk crowds”. Perhaps, then, the idea of a female-only space isn’t so ludicrous. To paint The Sisterhood’s raison d’etre merely in terms of physical safety, though, does it – and the women who wish to visit – a disservice. Because, for the most part, festivals are an inimitably wonderful experience. But it’s a matter of representation and solidarity in a world whose default is still white, straight and male (for proof, look no further than the vast majority of festival bills). In the words of the organisers, The Sisterhood is a chance “for women to connect, network, share their stories, have fun and learn the best way to support each other”. Yes, it means these stories and lessons will, for a couple of days, be out of reach of men, but soaking up women’s knowledge and experience is important for other women, too. After all, the female experience is a mutable and wildly varied thing. Garbage’s Shirley Manson had a different concern. “Why doesn’t Glastonbury invite more of us on to the stage with our male peers,” she asked, “rather than shove us women into a ghetto type of situation?” It’s a valid question. Though Emily Eavis was right, relatively speaking, when she said that this year’s lineup is “strong on women”, male artists still far outnumber female ones. But Manson is presenting something of a false dichotomy. None of the female artists already on the bill (which was pretty much complete when The Sisterhood was announced) are being transferred to this venue. It is an addition, not a substitution, and there are complex and deeply entrenched reasons why more women aren’t playing festivals.

Photograph: Sven Hoppe/EPAGiven much of the disbelief over The Sisterhood’s very existence, you’d be forgiven for thinking it was a new and unique concept. It isn’t. The history of female spaces in music is extensive and controversial. There was Lilith Fair, a festival with only women on the lineup, created by Sarah McLachlan in 1997 in an attempt to redress the gender imbalance at festivals, and which St Vincent once disparaged as “bummer town”.“Hey, hop aboard the marginalising train,” St Vincent said back in 2009, a year before the festival’s ill-fated comeback. “It was just white people who wanted to see the Indigo Girls. It also helped perpetuate this idea that what women do in music is acoustic, sincere, sentimental and without an edge to it.” Despite its noble intentions (or, perhaps, because of them), Lilith Fair lost its charm. Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival, an annual event that began in 1975, was more radical, extending its female-only policy – just as The Sisterhood has done – to staff and attendees as well as performers. But its steadfast commitment to an increasingly outdated trans-exclusionary stance quickly rendered it unpopular. Last year’s edition was the last, occurring to a background noise of protests and boycotts.Glastonbury plans final encore for David Bowie, Prince and Lemmy Though both are ostensibly similar to the concept of The Sisterhood, neither captures its intentions as well as the unofficial “girls to the front” policy, espoused by Bikini Kill’s Kathleen Hanna. “There physically was not the space for young women to be safe at riot grrrl shows,” said Sleater-Kinney’s Corin Tucker of Hanna’s insistence that the front few rows of her gigs be reserved for women. “All girls to the front,” Hanna would demand, unapologetically. “All boys, be cool for once in your lives.” And this is what The Sisterhood is too. A space for women to feel safe, to feel represented, and to share their experiences. Not somewhere to be confined to – there is no either/or here – but somewhere to find joy and knowledge and comradeship.And, if you fancy it, to learn how to use power tools.
