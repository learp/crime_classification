Early next month design duo Studio Swine heads to the Milan Furniture Fair. They are not there to present a new sofa or lighting range like many of their contemporaries, but instead to unveil a 6m high blossoming tree sculpture crafted from recycled scaffolding metal. Every five seconds the tree will dispense vibrating vapour bubbles from its 30 branches. These bubbles will bounce on certain textiles, but pop on skin.“We really looked into Milan as a city,” says Azusa Murakami, one half of Studio Swine. We loved the palazzos with blown glass rather than cut Murano chandeliers. That seemed to cast a new light and we wanted to capture that, but also think about this time of year, and how you can experience nature and seasonality.” The interactive installation is a collaboration with Cos. The brief from the fashion brand was entirely open, but the brand’s values work well with Swine’s: minimalism, modernity and a delight in interesting materials.Swine is an acronym for Super Wide Interdisciplinary New Explorers and was co-founded by Murakami – a Japanese-born architect – and her British artist husband Alexander Groves back in 2011. “We see ourselves as designer agents of transformation,” says Murakami. “We transform something that could be seen as undesirable into something desirable.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Take a seat: their bench for St James’s Market in London.

I was a really poor student and I struggled, coming from an art background and doing design. It was a leap for me. She helped me a lot.”It’s a good thing they did get together. Studio Swine’s thought-provoking work has captured the imagination of both the design and art world. While they have produced beautiful permanent products – such as benches for London’s St James’s Market – a lot of their creations feel like limited-edition artworks. There are chairs made from discarded plastic dredged from the Pacific Ocean, a Hair Glasses collection (biodegradable frames containing human hair) and display cabinets made from aluminium foam which showcase China’s modern industry and tradition in one bubbly package.

We’ve always self-initiated projects. After graduation we went to Brazil. In São Paulo we didn’t have any space, so we made a project completely on the streets. The project wouldn’t exist if we could’ve done it the way we wanted to. The same thing happens when you’re working at sea gathering plastic, or in China collecting hair.”Murakami describes her husband as “obsessed with materials”, while her approach is more holistic. “It’s quite hard to separate,” Groves explains. “We wake up and talk about design until we go to bed. That drives something forward much quicker, because it’s based on back-and-forth rapid dialogue, and trying to convince each other of a particular direction.” We wake up and talk about design until we go to bed. That drives something forward much quicker Next, they are considering a move to New York. “We really like the culture of crash-and-burn or go big, no safety net and comfort. That’s quite liberating,” explains Groves. They are also continuing with a project started last year exploring Fordlandia, the abandoned city Henry Ford built in the Brazilian jungle in the late 1920s. In September there’s a solo exhibition at Pearl Lam’s Hong Kong gallery. The pair have also recently signed to Pace Gallery as part of the Future\Pace programme, which explores public space and urban installations.Their long-term ambitions are far removed from product design. “Because we make films in tandem with the objects, we see that as an integral part of each project,” says Groves. “Ultimately we’d like to make a feature-length film. We’ve seen a great trajectory over the years of artists like Steve McQueen and Julian Schnabel making Hollywood films. Why not designers?” Why not indeed?studioswine.com
