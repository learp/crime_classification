I can honestly say that's the most fun I've ever had in the Guardian building. My DVD, What Do I Do Now? is out now, and will make an ideal Christmas present/drinks coaster.Updatedat 2.09pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.07pm GMT14:07royleslie asks:Which do you prefer – writing your own stand-up routines or writing for your sitcom?  Guardian contributor JoshWiddicombe 06 December 2016 2:01pmI find writing is the most fun I have in comedy. I think writing for the sitcom more fun, because I get to do it with someone else - my co-writer Tom Craine. However, writing a sitcom is far more time-consuming and far more difficult than I think anyone realises. Sitcom writing is difficult because it's not just about writing jokes - there's a very fine balance between characters, plot, and comedy, that if you get one thing wrong, the whole castle comes falling down. This wasn't the case when I was writing football quizzes for the Guardian.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.06pm GMT14:06TomBryant asks:Do you regret the Glendenning-shaped fallout from your valedictory quiz for the Guardian football desk? And his subsequent attack on your good name in the Fiver?  Guardian contributor JoshWiddicombe 06 December 2016 1:58pmI stand by it. Correct me if I'm wrong... didn't Barry used to do standup? So he'd definitely know what funny is.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.03pm GMT14:03michanson asks:How do you feel about attracting more female attention?  Guardian contributor JoshWiddicombe 06 December 2016 1:56pmI think that they think my life is very different to what it is. The most attention I've had was in a supermarket in Frome.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.02pm GMT14:02HongKongBlue asks:Two questions: First, what is your favourite cheese? Second, are you a posh boy like Jack Whitehall or do you just have a posh name?  Guardian contributor JoshWiddicombe 06 December 2016 1:56pmFavourite cheese: Emmental. Which would hint at me being a posh boy. However, sorry to disappoint you, but I went to a comprehensive school (admittedly quite a nice one in the middle of Dartmoor). So I'm not very posh. Not that there's anything wrong with that – I think Jack Whitehall is brilliant, and one of my current tour supports, Ivo Graham, went to both Eton and Oxford. Yet somehow is still a nice guy.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.59pm GMT13:59Akkarrin asks:Have you been attempting to be more neutral for UK political issues like Brexit and the US election recently? I think back to earlier series of Last Leg and the long speeches against the inequality, minority bashing, and hypocrisy of the Tories and UKIP …  Guardian contributor JoshWiddicombe 06 December 2016 1:54pmSpeaking personally, I have never really given any strong political views on television, be it Last Leg or Celebrity Pointless. I see myself primarily as a comedian, and my aim on the Last Leg is to be as funny as I can about the news. But I think Adam has been opinionated on Brexit and Donald Trump, the two big stories of the year, and I don't think anyone would question what his views are, and that is what Adam is brilliant at. I have never bought into this view that some people have that the job of the comedian is to espouse opinions and change the world - I think the job of a comedian is to be funny. If they want to offer opinions and talk about politics, that is great, but I never set out to do that, and I am fully aware there are people far more informed and politically intelligent than me. So I'll stick to what I'm good at.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.56pm GMT13:56michanson asks:Do you enjoy being recognised and all the trappings of fame? Or is it a major drag?  Guardian contributor JoshWiddicombe 06 December 2016 1:50pmIt's neither, really. I'm not walking down the street hoping that people spot me, but I'm certainly not complaining if people come up to me. Because it's part of the job I have which allows me to do my comedy around the country and on TV. However, there was one person in Frome did make me question if this was the career I wanted.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.55pm GMT13:55Niloufas says:Hi Josh. A few years ago you played the Cheese and Grain in Frome. I didn’t go, but our paths crossed in the Co-op that starry night. I walked in and saw you browsing the chocolate aisle. Didn’t realise it was you at first, you didn’t realise it was me either. Our eyes met, there was a fleeting of recognition, you saw me and I saw you, it was magical. I held a loaf of bread and lifted it in your direction as an acknowledgement and then you appeared to just run out of the shop like a shop lifter. I always imagine with fondness that you went back into your gig and told the story of the time you had to run for your life from a goggled eyed local, with a toothy smile, who showed you his loaf. Ah happy times. See you soon. PS. I’ve still kept that loaf …  Guardian contributor JoshWiddicombe 06 December 2016 1:48pmI think this speaks for itself. Was it wholegrain?Niloufas says:I’ll go check.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.47pm GMT13:47Jonathan Chadwick asks:I heard you’re a big Blur fan. What would be in your dream set list?  Guardian contributor JoshWiddicombe 06 December 2016 1:43pmPutting aside all the obvious hits they would have to play, if contractually obliged when I booked them for my garden party, I would insist on the following songs: Sing, Miss America, Trouble in the Message Centre, One Born Every Minute, Swallows in the Heatwave, You're So Great, and Trimm Trabb. NB My garden isn't even big enough to fit Blur in.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.45pm GMT13:45tommy1976 asks:Is the panel show dead?  Guardian contributor JoshWiddicombe 06 December 2016 1:41pmDespite the annual blog on the Guardian claiming this, the panel show seems to be going very well. There are loads of successful panel shows on TV, and while they maybe aren't getting the viewers they got five years ago, neither is any other TV show, because people are watching less TV and have a wider range of channels. The news is getting less viewers than it once did, but I'm pretty sure that'll continue as a genre. A lot of people found panel shows too competitive and blokey, and I genuinely think in the last few years, the tone of panel shows and the ones that have launched have been a lot more discursive and friendly, and I think that can only be good for the genre. But then I would say that - I'm on every bloody one of them.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.44pm GMT13:44selosra asks:Why do you take the piss out of Devon when it’s a wonderful place to live?  Guardian contributor JoshWiddicombe 06 December 2016 1:38pmBecause I spent some very boring teenage years there. Everyone has the right to slag off where you come from in the same way that only you have the right to slag off your own family. If anyone else slags off Devon, I get very prickly about it. But come on - what a boring place to grow up. At my primary school, there were four people in my year. The case rests.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
