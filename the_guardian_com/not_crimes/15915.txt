Sun Kissed, the third book in Jenny McLachlan’s series, is a story of Sweden, summer and finding your true self.Kat is packed off to Sweden for the Summer to visit her crazy Auntie – with no WiFi, no friends and no electricity. Yet, she soon finds out that life is not just about looking beautiful and boys, but that it is meant for living: embracing the cultures, people and things that surround you.But when Kat finds herself entering tuff troll, an endurance race, will one of her friends come to the rescue?After having read both of the other books in the series, I am certain that Sun Kissed, though it may still carry some of the conventional and traditional stereotypes of the romance/comedy genre, has a deeper meaning to it. It tells us to embrace the real you and all the world around you, and free yourself of all of your materialistic traits.Although this book does seem to end on a similar note to the other two (which I am hoping will be different for the fourth book), there is also the fact that the protagonist learnt much more about herself and the world than all the other characters in the first two books. But then again, who am I to say that a woman cannot get it all in the end?On the other hand, keeping in mind that there are many good qualities to this book, I feel that the story could have been improved in terms of its originality. It should’ve been more of an eye catching read – not just enjoyable but more excitable. I believe this is because there is always that feeling that you know exactly what is going to come next, and I was often correct (and when I was incorrect, it always felt like an empty surprise).This is a substantial flaw because whenever you are reading a book, or at least to me it seems, you are searching for something original, or different, that really stands out compared to other books (specifically of this comedy/romance genre).How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? This book, through all its ups and downs, was an enjoyable read and I will give it a solid 7 out of 10. It is certainly a good book for young females to be reading.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
