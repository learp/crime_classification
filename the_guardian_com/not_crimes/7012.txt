Starting this week, a pioneering venture has taken to the night skies in Cumbria. Low Gillerthwaite Field Centre, the educational charity in the Lake District's western valley of Ennerdale, has become the first Dark Sky Discovery Site in north west England to be accredited by the International Dark Sky Association. The association was set up to campaign against light pollution through wasteful energy consumption, and to address its impact on our environment. The goals are to stop the adverse effects of light pollution and to educate local authorities, together with the general public, about the values of appropriate outdoor lighting. The project is inspired by the successful Dark Sky Scotland partnership which has been in operation since 2009 at Galloway Forest Park. The centre at Gillerthwaite will use the awesome Cumbrian night sky as an educational resource to spread the word. Those who visit, we hope, will spread the message back home.  None of these for miles - another of Ennerdale's attractions.

It is said that an estimated 70 percent of us have never seen the Milky Way. Here at Low Gillerthwaite, we are endowed with the most spectacular night skies in England.For us, the Way appears as an endless, illuminated band of countless stars stretching across our night sky. Given Gillerthwaite's absence of any municipal lighting and mountainous setting, the Dark Sky undertaking is likely to make the centre a site of special interest for night sky observation and astronomy. It should widen our educational scope to the benefit of local schools and add to learning opportunities for young people - in particular to appreciate the wonders of the universe and our place in it. We're also hoping to give a boost to local communities, astronomical societies and other enthusiasts. The main funders of the Dark Sky Discovery project for England are Natural England's Access to Nature programme together with the Science and Technology Facilities Council. You can find the other five Dark Sky Discovery sites in England, and the 12 Scottish ones here.
