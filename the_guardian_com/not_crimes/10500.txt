Victorian Labor has pledged to set an emissions reduction target separate from the federal government’s but has dashed the hopes of conservationists by refusing to commit to a new national park that could save the Leadbeater’s possum, the state faunal emblem.In a belatedly-released environment policy platform ahead of the Victorian election on Saturday, Labor said it will “review legislation and programs to commit to an achievable carbon emissions reduction target.”Victoria had a target to reduce its emissions by 20% by 2020, based on 2000 levels, but the policy was dumped by the state Coalition government in 2012. The federal government has a target of reducing emissions by 5% by 2020, on 2000 levels.A concerted push by environmentalists, including Sir David Attenborough and Jane Goodall, to create a new national park north of Melbourne has failed to sway Labor, however.The proposed Great Forest national park would cover vast areas of the central highlands region of Victoria, including some of the tallest, most carbon dense trees in the world. The area is home to the endangered Leadbeater’s possum, with scientists warning the species and ecosystem as a whole will soon collapse due to current logging practices and bushfire trends.The Labor platform commits to a “consensus approach in the establishment of any new national parks.” Labor would set up an “industry taskforce”, comprised of timber workers, unions, environmental groups and scientists to advise it.“A Labor government will consider any reasonable recommendations and proposals reached by consensus of the major stakeholders through the industry task force, but will not impose solutions,” it states.It is understood the CMFEU, an influential union ally of Labor, is opposed to any new national parks that may impact forestry jobs. The current Coalition government set up a similar advisory group, which recommended a minor reduction in logging but no new national park earlier this year.Prof David Lindenmayer, who has extensively studied the central highlands region, was scathing of the lack of a Labor plan for a new national park.“It’s a weasel word policy that’s about as much use as an ashtray on a motorbike,” he told Guardian Australia. “This would be a taskforce interested in the status quo, it’s the same old rubbish the Liberal government gave us.“The system is close to collapse so to sit around talking about consensus is rubbish. It’s a pathetic policy that doesn’t acknowledge the science. We don’t need more science here, I’ve been doing this for 31 years.”Lindenmayer said the timber industry should be transitioned to plantations rather than logging the next generation of old growth trees that provide habitat for species and store vast amounts of carbon.Recent research contributed to by Lindenmayer states that the trees currently logged in the central highlands each year contain as much carbon as one third of the emissions of Yallourn, one of the dirtiest coal plants in Victoria.“Under the federal government’s Direct Action plan, keeping those trees would mean tens of millions of dollars for carbon abatement,” Lindenmayer said. “When you think about the national park for more than two minutes, you realise what a good idea it is.”Amelia Young, campaigner at the Wilderness Society, said: “Time is running out for the Leadbeater’s possum. If Labor insists on pursuing the taskforce option and wants any chance of the saving the state’s animal emblem from extinction, it must commence this taskforce within the first 100 days of government.”The commitment to reinstate the emissions reduction target was better received by environment groups, although it’s uncertain what level Labor would set the target. The policy document also makes no mention of phasing out Victoria’s carbon-intensive brown coal plants.Mark Wakeham, chief executive of Environment Victoria, said the plan for a new emissions target was a “positive step.”“Australia is drifting on climate change so we need this kind of leadership from the state government,” he said. “We welcome Labor’s willingness to be in this space. We’d want a science-based target, certainly more than the 5% national target.“Coal continues to be the elephant in the room. Neither party wants to talk about the fact we have some of the dirtiest power in the world.”In its other environmental commitments, Labor said it would establish a new marine and coastal act and a new Yarra river protection act. Development plans for Point Nepean national park will be scrapped, along with the ability to issue 99-year leases for developers in national parks.Under Labor, restrictions on new wind farms will be eased, cattle grazing in the alpine region will be stopped and there will be an investigation into the Environment Protection Agency in relation to the Morwell mine fire.“It looks like Labor would wind back some of the worst attacks on the environment by the Coalition, but it has left a lot of work to do for itself on climate change,” Wakeham said. Greg Barber, the leader of the Victorian Greens, said: “The policy contains nothing on coal, nothing on coal seam gas, nothing on forest logging and nothing on a Victorian renewable energy target. We are looking at another long four-year fight for environmentalists.”
