Lately, like many areas of the country, the islands have been repeatedly drenched with rain and blasted by gales. As is sometimes the case, these conditions have affected travel plans as ferry services have been disrupted, despite the best efforts of the operator.But while humans on the move have merely been delayed by the winds, for some avian travellers, the weather has had far more seriously implications, delivering them to destinations far from those they had intended to reach.As islands are often the first land that the lost and exhausted wanderers find, many birds rarely seen in Britain turn up on their shores. The Scilly Islands and Fair Isle, with their astonishing records of rare birds of all types, attract hundreds of birdwatchers each year, especially at peak migration periods.The Outer Hebrides are quietly building a reputation as a place where rare American vagrants regularly turn up. This autumn they have been recorded the length of the islands, from the north of Lewis, where a chimney swift was seen for several days, to Barra, where a scarlet tanager – a first for Scotland – brought birders flocking to the island at the beginning of the month.Then it was the turn of the thrushes. Barra came up with a grey-cheeked thrush, while a hermit thrush spotted on North Uist provided splendid photo opportunities both for local birders and for those who braved the weather to fly to the islands for a chance to see it.But while the arrival of unexpected rarities is a matter of excitement for many birders, with truly dedicated twitchers occasionally going so far as to charter planes in the hope of adding a particular species to their lists, there is a sadness about these sightings, for the outlook for the majority of birds when driven so far off course by storms is not bright.A few may survive to move on when conditions improve. But for many, weakened by exhaustion, these island landfalls, so far from their intended destination, will prove to be their last.
