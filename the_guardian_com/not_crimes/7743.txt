It goes by many names, but in today’s pop, it’s always there. Jesse Lacey from the band Brand New calls it the “mom calling you inside from the porch interval”. More recently, it’s become known as the Millennial Whoop, and it’s a standard of big pop songs from Katy Perry to Justin Bieber to Kings Of Leon to will.i.am to Fall Out Boy.Now, the Whoop has become more than a far-off niggle about all modern pop sounding the same, thanks to a recent forensic dissection of the phenomenon by Patrick Metzger on his website, The Patterning. Metzger isolates it as: “A sequence of notes that alternates between the fifth and third notes of a major scale, typically starting on the fifth. The rhythm is usually straight 8th-notes, but it may start on the downbeat or on the upbeat in different songs. A singer usually belts these notes with an “Oh” phoneme, often in a “Wa-oh-wa-oh” pattern. And it’s in so many pop songs it’s criminal.”The cleanest example of what he means came right at the start of the millennial era, with the monolithic hook for the Rasmus’s 2003 hit In the Shadows. The most recent comes from the sainted Frank Ocean’s Ivy, released a week ago. The funniest is a track cut from the Lonely Island’s forthcoming movie Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, satirising the teen-muppet jingles of the Bieber-wave.In between, there have been lawsuits over whether anyone can truly own the Whoop. In 2013, songwriter Ally Burnett tried to sue Carly-Rae Jepsen and Owl City over their collaboration Good Time, which she said plagiarised her own Ah, It’s a Love Song, a case based mainly on the Whoop they shared. Jepsen settled out of court, but Owl City held out, and won $500,000 plus legal proof that the Whoop is for everyone.Pop music, as Metzger points out, is always based on a measure of comforting familiarity. We like the Whoop (and songwriters especially like it) because it gives us enough orientation to allow us to get our heads around a piece of music we may not already be familiar with. In the slavishly playlisted, gnat’s-attention-span world of daytime radio, the Whoop has become a signalling device, often cropping up bang on cue around the one-minute mark, saying: “Hey wait! Don’t run away just yet!”Naturally, the Whoop is not the first time pop music has eaten itself – there was the Bo Diddley Beat as far back as the 1950s. Some melodic ideas transcend all cultures. Axis of Awesome’s 4 Chords speared the I-V-vi-IV chord progression that underlies hundreds of hits. And there are never going to be more than 12 notes on the western scale. But given that a 2012 study concluded that the diversity of melodies used over the preceding 55 years had shrunk dramatically, the ubiquitous Whoop’s smothering two-note baby-talk emotional register means that your sense of pop music dumbing down may not be entirely down to ageing.
