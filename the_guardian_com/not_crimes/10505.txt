Like a cruel lover or spiteful mistressNo-Sleep demands my restless attentiveness.No-Sleep prefers me stripped –a dark projectionistwinding and unwinding the reel of my thoughts.An old grained movie I can’t switch off –a starring of loves and loss, TV footage,soft tears, mortifications, smothered laughs.Then, one night comes like a blessing.A visitation of wings that sees me falling.Whoever wants me now, I am swimmingtowards my House of Dreams.Let no one disturb this peace.Let no one shake meeven from the branches of nightmares.Come morning I am reborn again –a fresh-faced Eve – emerging from the rib’s shadow –ready to meet the daily pandemonium of living.• From The Insomnia Poems by Grace Nichols (Bloodaxe £9.95).
