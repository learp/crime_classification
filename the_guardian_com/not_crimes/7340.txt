Liv Tyler is on her second capsule collection with Belstaff for spring/summer 2017. She was at London fashion week on Sunday to showcase it but made time to have a chat with us first. Here is what we learned.She’s a big fan of capes“I love capes,” she says. “So we made a cape.” Indeed. Said design shows she is a cape pro: it has a lovely cut, pulled in at the back with a sweet button at the neck. Enough to convince even the biggest of cape sceptics. J.W. Anderson and Versace's Versus play with femininity at LFW She is from rock ’n’ roll stockThe collection is partly inspired by the Rolling Stones and features Belstaff’s signature bikers with a feminine silhouette. “I grew up with rock ’n’ roll, leather pants and everything, so I was almost allergic to it,” she says. “This collection allowed me to embrace my inner rock child.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Liv Tyler with models at the Belstaff show.

With those raven tresses and translucent skin, she’s basically an advertisement for the gothiest shade of the palette. “I love colour,” she says “but black has an elegance.” It features heavily in her Belstaff collection: a floral print on a black bomber is a highlight.Stealing Beauty influenced her style more than any other of her filmsThe actor remembers graduating high school and flying to Italy the next to star in the 1996 Bernardo Bertolucci film. She wore custom-made Armani, and dresses created just for her by the costume designer. A floral one inspired this season’s Belstaff collection and features on the moodboard.Tyler has an archive of clothes to envyIt includes that dress from Stealing Beauty, several Ghost bias-cut dresses, two made for her by Alexander McQueen, and some thrift finds. “I have clothes that weren’t vintage but now they are because they’re from the 90s,” she says. Tyler says she enjoyed the decade – currently a favourite of fashion – because “there was a nice freedom pre-social-media, people could let their freak flag fly more”.Those ears in Lord of the Rings were custom-made prostheticsTyler’s role in the trilogy as elf Arwen Undomiel saw her in hair and makeup for up to three hours. That was nothing on the hobbits. “They had much longer,” reveals Tyler “because of their feet.”
