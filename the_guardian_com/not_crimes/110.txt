The contract giving Hinkley Point C the formal go-ahead is to be signed this week, with the UK government and its commercial partner, EDF, putting pen to paper on the £18bn nuclear power project.EDF will sign a “contract for difference” on Thursday, an agreement governing the amount of money that the French state-owned energy company will receive for electricity produced by Britain’s first new nuclear power station in a generation.The signing will mean that the controversial project, the approval of which was delayed by Theresa May after she became prime minister in July, is all but certain to go ahead.Hinkley Point C nuclear power station gets government green light The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy refused to confirm that a signing ceremony would take place on Thursday. But well-placed sources said arrangements were being put in place for an official announcement.Representatives from the government, EDF and China General Nuclear Power (CGN) – the French firm’s 33.5% partner in the mammoth construction project – are expected to attend.The Green party’s co-leader Caroline Lucas has written to business secretary Greg Clark, objecting to the sign-off on the basis that the National Audit Office has said public subsidies for electricity from Hinkley could rise from £6.1bn to £29.7bn.In the letter, Lucas says the change is a “significant deviation” on the cost of the project and that there is a “strong case” for a revised estimate to be put before parliament.The plant, which will meet 7% of the UK’s energy needs, is to be built near the existing Hinkley Point B station in Somerset and will run for 60 years. The project is set to cost £18bn and is scheduled for completion in 2023.EDF will earn a guaranteed price for its energy of £92.50 per megawatt hour, a sum that some opponents of the project say is high compared with other nuclear projects around the world.Security concerns have been raised about the role that CGN, a Chinese state-backed company, will play in the project and future nuclear reactors. Those fears were thought to have been behind a surprise decision by May to delay approval on the project.China plans central role in UK nuclear industry after Hinkley Point approval Hinkley Point C has faced fierce opposition from EDF union leaders, while the company’s finance director resigned amid fears that the project would cripple it financially. Projects in France and Finland using the same technology – the European pressurised reactor – have also faced cost overruns and lengthy delays.It emerged on Wednesday that Areva, the EDF-owned firm due to build the reactor, was facing court action over the EPR it is building in Finland, which is a decade behind schedule. Finnish utility Teollisuuden Voima said it was seeking legal assurances that the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor would be completed on schedule in 2018.The executive director of Greenpeace UK, John Sauven, said: “On the eve of the official signing of the Hinkley agreement, this is a cautionary tale that should make our government think twice before putting pen to paper. The UK government is about to sign away billions of pounds of billpayers’ money to a project bedevilled by legal, financial and technical hurdles.“Theresa May cannot build a 21st-century industrial strategy around an outdated, dodgy, and ludicrously expensive technology.”
