Climate Change Authority chairman and former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser has criticised the lack of political consensus over climate change, arguing that rolling contention and policy “flip-flopping” is impeding Australia’s ability to deal with the inevitable costs and consequences of global warming.Fraser told a briefing of reporters on Wednesday there was no current political consensus in Australia that the science of climate change was real, and he said policy reversals would only create uncertainty for private investors, who must do most of the “heavy lifting” in terms of investing in clean technology.The Climate Change Authority on Wednesday concluded that Australia’s current 5% emissions reduction target was not credible, and proposed two potential alternatives: 15% or 25%. Fraser said the conclusions were not “doomsday scenarios”, they were an effort to point out that with such a slow start, Australia would not contribute a fair share to the global effort to reduce carbon pollution.He also argued that the Abbott government’s current policy, to rely on domestic emissions reduction alone and not to purchase international carbon credits where that alternative was economically efficient, represented an “extreme” position.Fraser said he did not intend his remarks to be provocative. He said the Climate Change Authority had no agenda beyond fulfilling its duty statement in “an objective and independent way”, and he said he anticipated a deal of community discussion about the findings and recommendations published on Wednesday.“We are trying to provide independent advice in an objective way on what we think are important issues for the government and the community to be aware of,” he said.Fraser said it was not provocative to point out there were extremes in the climate change debate about the use of international permits and to advocate for a compromise position. “There’s a better way, and that’s a balance somewhere between those extremes,” he said.He declined to apportion blame for the fractured nature of the political debate on climate change. “I’m just making again what I think is a fairly clear observation,” he said. “We, in my view, would have a much better chance of having community support for the inevitable adjustments and costs involved in coming to grips with climate change if we had a broad political consensus on the main science and the implications of that science.”He said there was a “distinct gain to be had from having the community follow the leadership of a political consensus”.“Importantly, if we have a political consensus and some degree of certainty about the policies that are going to be pursued over the years ahead this would be vitally important information for private investors,” he said.“We have to remember that a lot of the hard lifting in responding to climate change has to be undertaken by private investors whether it is in alternative energies, or cleaner technologies, or in more efficient appliances and vehicles and processes or whatever.”Fraser confirmed that the authority had engaged in a “couple of chats” with the environment minister, Greg Hunt, after his swearing-in.The Coalition proposes to abolish the authority as part of its efforts to repeal Labor’s clean energy package.The chairman said there had been no negotiations concerning any role for the authority in the future. The report released on Wednesday was a draft report. Fraser said whether the authority would release a final report had not been discussed.He said it did not necessarily follow that the new government would ignore the report because it intended to abolish the authority. Fraser said in terms of proposing courses of policy action to best position Australia to deal with climate change, the authority had given it its “best shot”.After the publication of the report on Wednesday, Hunt told reporters the Coalition was proceeding with its policy, and would make any judgments about adjustments in the lead-up to 2015.“We have a commitment to the current targets and we will assess any change in the context of what the world is doing as we’ve always said we’d do in the lead-up to the 2015 conference,” Hunt said in Gladstone.He described the report as “one input” and a “draft”. “I respect and appreciate the contribution. Our timeframe remains unchanged,” Hunt said.
