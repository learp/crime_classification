9.34pm BST21:34Candice wins GBBO 2016!Oh CANDICE WINS! I‘m meant to make a bigger deal of that. But as discussed, I need the toilet very badly.All good things come to an end. And all bad things. Everything dies, that’s what I’m saying. I didn’t want that to be the last notable thing I said on here. But what the hell.Anyway, you people have been magnificent. Thanks for being so supportive, and welcoming me in. Get yourselves over to the incredible Heidi’s Strictly blog, where she continues to do all of this backwards, in heels.I’ll resume my Inspect A Gadget ‘job’, and will mainly be procrastinating on twitter, so come say hi there, or on Instant Gran, or in real life. Unless I’m gesticulating wildly at passing cars, in which case I’m busy.Goodbye, you soggy bottoms. Miss youxFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.19pm BST21:19“Candice and Jane are planning a baking road trip together...”Thelma And Genoise...MikeMoonlight I’m giving you the last word here because that is unbeatable. And sums up how funny and lovely this community is, you BTL heroes. They said it couldn’t happen on the internet. We proved it can, as long as you hide the destination url, so it’s occasionally difficult to find!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.15pm BST21:15“If at first you don’t succeed, try another two times so that your failure is statistically significant”. Aratan this is magnificent, nihilistic-statistician’s advice. I like.I’m gonna miss you people very much. I’ll just chuck that on the GBBO sadness pile, which is already towering.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.10pm BST21:10Smart move BBC, hooking us with that Sherlock trailer. Just when you thought you could have a little break from TV. Val as Moriarty is inspired, HCollider. Also you’ve been to a royal garden party?

Ahh! Why? What even is that? I hope their rooms are on different floors. I read a Sherlock Holmes story where a dude killed another dude by feeding a little snake through the air vent. I’m just saying that, apropos of nothing.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.58pm BST20:58Val in Ayia Napa!

It look like it’s stained with the blood of her foes!But well done, CB! She really is an artist, and I consistently wanted to eat her creations right off the screen. In fact I invalidated my TV warranty for that very reason.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.53pm BST20:53Here we go...FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.53pm BST20:53Andrew’s mum is wearing such green.

Candice’s scone was her only weakness, but they all shared that. She was the only one to achieve the pastry bake. Personally I preferred Andrew’s presentation. But the good money must be on the PE teacher. They’re a very competitive people.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
