Josh and Jordan are twins, champion basketball players, and best friends.But when Jordan meets a girl, their bond is tested.This is a fascinating novel in verse, an interesting format that allows the fuller meaning of the words to flow through it clearly. Josh’s personal definitions of words and the rules of the game add an extra layer of interest and remind us that life really is just like a game. I really enjoyed reading this book about the nature of family and jealousy and how the bonds of brothers can be tested and bent, but still spring back into place.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Crossover left me with a poignant reminder to value what you have, due to the metaphorical resonance of a crossover– bouncing the ball hard across to confuse your opponent. If it is done right, it can even break their foot; meaning that things change, and you have to be able to adapt too.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
