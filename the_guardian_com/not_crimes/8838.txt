Under grey skies and spitting rain, a group of teenage refugees are helping to set up a garden with dying trees, a moat, barbed wire and a razor-topped wire link fence, and featuring a wildflower meadow.The five Eritreans and one Afghan were volunteers on one of the more unusual “conceptual gardens” for next week’s Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) Hampton Court Palace flower show, which receives 130,000 visitors annually.Visitors to the garden, named Border Control, will have to go past an outer ring of dead or dying pomegranate trees, aloes, thistles and stipa (Mexican grass) and a turnstile to reach “safety” – a gazebo ringed by a lush wildflower meadow. On the barbed wire will be items collected by the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, from the beaches of Greek islands – life jackets, backpacks and lost toys.Tom Massey and John Ward, the two London-based designers, believe it is the first time the RHS flower show has featured razor wire. Their first show since graduating from the London College of Garden Design last year, Border Control is a gardening metaphor for the greatest humanitarian crisis since the second world war. As millions flee war in Syria and Iraq, repression in Eritrea or instability in Afghanistan, 10,000 have died in the Mediterranean trying to reach Europe since the start of 2014, with 2,886 dead or missing this year.

It’s very hard to describe, but this garden shows the picture very well. It took me six months to get here. I went through Ethiopia, Sudan, Libya, Italy, France, and smugglers put me into a lorry at Calais.”The theme of them and us, danger and safety, and the refugee crisis was something Massey and Ward wanted to convey to visitors in the stately confines of Hampton Court.“The inner ring represents shelter with an engraved piece of stone – nobody left outside – in the gazebo, but the fence and turnstile show how difficult it is to gain entry and a border guard provides a sense of theatre,” said Massey.

You are in a safe environment but you look out at what you came through.”Even the use of native and non-native plants is designed to make visitors ponder on the arrival of foreigners, a burning issue in the EU referendum. Ward and Massey used non-native Spanish bluebells as a horticultural metaphor for fears of “foreigners taking over”. But pointedly, the wildflower meadow, representing nirvana or the promised land is a “rich mix” of native and non-native plants – British wildflowers and some plants originating from the Middle East creating a kaleidoscope of blues, greens and reds.In helping in the installation of Border Control, Josi and his fellow refugees were following in the footsteps of another refugee gardener at Hampton Court. One of the palace’s main architects was Daniel Marot, a Hugenot, who fled France in 1865. Marot designed the gardens at Hampton Court and much of its furniture.Daniel Green, the RHS show’s manager, said: “The refugee crisis is a terrible situation and RHS Hampton Court flower show is a powerful platform to raise awareness of the suffering of so many. I hope the garden makes a difference to people’s perceptions and reinforces the idea that there are people all over the world who are in desperate need of help and support.”
