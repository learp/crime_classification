Audiences turned out in droves for the horror movie Don’t Breathe, which brought in $26.1m on the last weekend of August, according to studio estimates released on Sunday.Don’t Breathe review – a clever, gross master class in tension That was more than double early predictions for how the film would perform and far above the modest production budget, which was reportedly less than $10m. Stage 6 Films produced and Sony’s Screen Gems oversaw distribution.Don’t Breathe is about a group of Detroit teens who chose the wrong house to rob – that of a blind, vengeful veteran. It stars Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette and was directed by Fede Alvarez, who is known for the Evil Dead remake.Sony Pictures marketing chief Josh Greenstein noted how rare it was for a film in this genre to resonate so deeply with critics – its current Rotten Tomatoes score is 87%. It also continues Sony’s summer of success with original films that cost very little to make.“This marks a string of very profitable hits for Sony with very modest budgets. The Shallows, Sausage Party and now Don’t Breathe were all incredibly profitable because they were made for modest budgets and did incredibly well at the box office,” Greenstein said.Don’t Breathe is also the latest horror success for Hollywood this summer, which has seen films like Lights Out, The Conjuring 2, and The Purge: Election Year thrive while bigger budget, spectacle-driven counterparts flailed.“As it turns out, horror is the least scary genre this summer, especially to the bean counters in Hollywood,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for box office tracker comScore. “[They] can almost always be counted on to make money.”Horror films, Dergarabedian said, perform very well on home video too.Don’t Breathe effectively unseated Suicide Squad from its three-week run atop the box office.
