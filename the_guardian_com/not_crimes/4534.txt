At the closing of Milan fashion week, Dolce and Gabbana looked to the future with a collection that boldly goes for the pocket of Generation Z. To set the mood the pre-show music was Justin Bieber, which must have been a bit awkward for his ex Sofia Richie who was sat on the frow alongside Vine celebrity Cameron Dallas, model Lucky Blue Smith and Lily Rose Depp.Fashion world balance of power shifts to social media superstars in Milan When the show began it was just that, a show, featuring a stage set straight out of a 1980s Top Of The Pops (palm trees and a sign reading “Tropico Italiano”) plus street dancers who came out of the crowd and started krumping on the catwalk, flash mob style.

This listicle approach was in keeping with the influence of Buzzfeed and Wikipedia in the lives of its intended audience, even if some items felt more end-of-the-pier than end of Milan fashion week. Happily some of the collection was not just fun-fun but smart-fun: silk pyjamas featuring ice-cream patterns, distressed jeans with trinkets sewn on them, slipper loafers and a Dolce & Gabbana T-shirt that referenced the bootleg-shirt industry.

Another label that went in an unexpected direction was Marni. Formerly the last word in “richster” – rich hipster – Marni has wandered off-script. Sunday’s show felt as if its creative director, Consuelo Castiglioni, had drifted into Stranger Things’ Upside Down; a creepy parallel universe.The first section focused on the idea of surgical utility – white all-in-ones, trench coats and boiler suits featuring high sleeves, rigorous folds and precisely positioned buttons – suggesting Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest. Meanwhile Marni’s trademark orthopaedic shoe was imposingly reptilian this season, the familiar winklepicker moulded into something dense and beetle-like. Other details that added to a sense of dissonance included massive nose-bag-like outer-pockets on dresses, trenches and boiler suits, rope belts and a boho dress worn with one arm missing.The key piece of the show, a black “Post-it note” dress made of squares of fabric towered together, could have been a Curtis Jere sculpture come to life. This says it all: Marni is in a wonderfully creative dimension all of its own.
