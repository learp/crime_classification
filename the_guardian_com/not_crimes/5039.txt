Unilever, the owner of brands including Dove and Lynx, has pledged to drop all sexist stereotypes from its advertising after research suggested just 2% of ads show intelligent women.The world’s second-biggest advertiser, which spends €8bn (£6.3bn) a year on more than 400 brands from Sunsilk to Knorr, will unveil a global strategy to “unstereotype” its advertising and eradicate outdated portrayals of gender.While some ads are obvious candidates for accusations of sexual stereotyping – in the UK Protein World’s “Beach Body Ready” adverts sparked widespread protest and hundreds of complaints – Unilever’s research found that stereotypes can be much more subtle and widespread across all forms of ads.Unilever said its global ad study research found that the issue of stereotyping, conscious or otherwise, is most acute in the portrayal of women.The research found that 40% of the women surveyed said that they do not identify at all with the women they see in advertising.Two years of global ad research revealed more surprising, and shocking, findings.These include that women are rarely presented as having authority – just 3% of ads feature women in managerial, leadership or professional roles – and are “disproportionately” represented in domestic roles.The ad industry appears to believe that the life of a woman is dour in the extreme, with just 1% of the ads surveyed showing women being funny.

We believe advertising can take a lead position and ignite the advertising and content industries to jump on board and embrace this movement.”
