The British Fashion Council has announced plans to revamp its annual fashion awards, with an emphasis on global fashion. In the words of the BFC chair, Natalie Massenet, it will be “bigger and better”, with an emphasis on glitz.

In its new, souped-up surroundings, the awards are being described as to the UK’s answer to the Met Ball. Proceeds from the awards will go to the BFC’s education foundation, which helps fashion students who are struggling financially.Sarah Mower and Meribeth Parker, the presidents of the BFC education pillar and trustees of the foundation, said: “The money raised will underpin work in schools, support apprenticeships and enable BA and MA students to continue their studies.” Massenet said: “As a global industry, we should make a commitment to support talented people from all backgrounds to fulfil their dreams and access the best universities in the world. Over the next 10 years, our ambition is to raise and invest £10m to support young people.”The awards began in 1989 and have always been considered the industry’s most prestigious event. Last year’s ceremony was typically star-studded, featuring Victoria Beckham, Naomi Campbell, Stella McCartney, Lady Gaga and Lily Allen. J.W.Anderson was named the menswear and womenswear designer of the year, the first time any designer had won both categories. Previous years have been eventful: in 2014, Anna Wintour received an outstanding achievement award from John Galliano in one of his first appearances after being sacked from Christian Dior in 2011.
