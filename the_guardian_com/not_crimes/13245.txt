The February fair maids are out for Imbolc, for Candlemas. Imbolc is the Celtic pagan cross-quarter day, halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox; Candlemas is the feast of the purification of the Virgin Mary; and the fair maids are snowdrops. In the churchyard of St Peter's in Stanton Lacy, Corvedale, jackdaws and rooks rattle from the high trees â€“ and beneath them, around the headstones, are sheets of snowdrops.The story goes that the beautiful Saint Milburgha, the Saxon princess who founded the priory of Much Wenlock in 680AD, was being chased by a Welsh prince, "a would-be suitor" in the coy language of the story. On her flight back to Wenlock, Milburgha had to cross the river Corve. With her pursuers gaining, she knelt to pray for deliverance and the little river suddenly became a raging torrent, saving her. In gratitude, she established a church at the river crossing.Remnants of the Saxon church can still be seen in the medieval and Victorian building. The churchyard was once raised and circular, not dissimilar to the tumuli and other ancient burial sites nearby. This landscape has been a sacred place for thousands of years.The Corve has been raging again. The flood meadows are full of water and puddles spread across the road. The river continues to protect the place by the bridge, which surely belongs to a much older story than Milburgha, and its snowdrops are locally famous.How long the snowdrops have been in this churchyard is hard to guess. Snowdrops may be native further south; they may have been introduced from across the Channel or have been brought by crusaders from further east, but they are so prolific they give the place a kind of radiance. Like the mistletoe in the trees and the river Corve in spate, they speak of wilder magics here. (Twitter: @DrPaulEvans1)
