For the past two months, California has been brimming with pumpkins. From country lanes to freeways, the agricultural fields that surround us are dotted with orange. The occasional scarecrow flaps crookedly on its pole, overseeing its seasonal crop.Since coming here with my family, we have visited as many farms as possible – a good distraction for my small baby, not to mention being super‑interesting for her parents. In the Napa Valley, they grow prize-winning pumpkins, some the size of a small electric car and weighing in at almost two tons. Growing vegetables this big without them rotting in the process takes great skill.Another farm we visit has creamy white, blushing pink and faded green pumpkins – all with differing levels of sweetness and density of flesh: an inspiring array of winter squash.Cooked and pureed, pumpkin or squash adds a lovely moisture to cakes. Butternut squash is available almost everywhere in the UK. It is a delicious, dense variety that works well in baking – ideal for cakes, pumpkin pies and this week’s bundt cake, combined with added spices, maple syrup and a cream-cheese frosting – a quintessential, and American-inspired, autumn cake. I use spelt flour for this as I love its nutty flavour. It’s also an ancient grain, less refined than other flours, giving it better shelf life and disease resistance.I had read before about making caramel from sweet potatoes, harnessing the intense natural sweetness of the root, and thought I would try it with squash. The technique of cooking squash in water, then caramelising its natural sugars while stirring produces a thick, sweet and concentrated paste which is delicious folded through ice-creams, dolloped on almost any cake as a topping, or served with roasted meats.Claire Ptak’s halloween recipes for meringue bones and bonfire toffee | Baking Pumpkin maple bundt cake (main picture)Serves 8-101 large butternut squash or sweet pumpkin (about 500g), halved, seeds scraped, baked cut-side down, cooled200g vegetable or mild olive oil100g caster sugar100g maple syrup100g light brown sugar4 eggs100g ginger, peeled and finely grated280g fine/white spelt flour ½ tsp salt2 tsp bicarbonate of soda2 tsp cinnamonA grating of nutmeg For the icing250g cream cheese1 tsp vanilla200g icing sugar1 tbsp maple syrup1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Throughly grease the inside of a 20-23cm bundt cake tin, then lightly dust with spelt flour and tap out any excess. Set aside.2 Scrape the cooked and cooled squash from the skin and blitz in a food processor until smooth. Transfer the puree to a large bowl. Add the oil, sugars, syrup and eggs, then whisk well to combine. Add the grated ginger and whisk again.3 In a separate bowl, add the remaining ingredients and whisk together. Add the dry to the wet and mix just until incorporated. Scrape into the prepared baking dish and smooth the top.4 Bake for 50-60 minutes. The cake is done when a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean and the cake springs back to the touch. Allow to cool for 15 minutes before running a paring knife along the edge of the bundt pan to release the cake. Put a plate on top and invert the whole thing to release the cake on to the plate. Allow to cool for another 20 minutes before icing, when it should still be a little warm.5 Whisk the icing ingredients together and spread over the top of the cake, allowing it melt slightly and drip down the sides. Keeps well in a sealed container in a cool spot or in the fridge for up to a week.
