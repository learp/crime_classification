The Environment Agency said it was forced to lift a flood barrier allowing water to flow into the Ouse and flood part of the city, after a pumping station was “overwhelmed by water”.In Leeds, main roads in the city centre were underwater in what local MP Hilary Benn said were the worst floods the city had seen.In Greater Manchester, 7,000 homes were still without power after rivers burst their banks.More than 200 flood alerts and warnings were in place for England, Wales and Scotland on Sunday afternoon including more than 20 severe warnings, indicating danger to life.Among the worst-hit areas were Pennine towns between Leeds and Manchester which saw rivers hit record levels – up to 5ft over their previous peak in some places.Environment secretary Liz Truss admitted flood defences had been overwhelmed and would be “reviewed”.Kerry McCarthy, the shadow environment secretary, said the “government must drop its complacency over the need for climate change adaptation” as well as “invest in maintaining flood defences, rather than cutting them as they had planned.”Accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicts that the cost of the latest floods and those that hit Cumbria earlier this month could be as much as £15bn.Forecasters say another band of heavy rain is likely to sweep in from the west on Wednesday and is likely to hit southern Scotland and parts of northern England.Updatedat 4.56pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.19pm GMT15:19Labour’s former environment secretary Hilary Benn, an MP in Leeds, said it was the worst flooding the city had seen and called for more investment in flood defences to tackle the impact of climate change.“The need for improved flood defence is increasing really, really fast because the climate is changing.”He said the debate about climate change was over because there was “no doubt” the world’s climate is now different, adding that countries needed to prioritise reducing emissions by honouring promises made at this month’s climate change negotiations in Paris.He added: “The second thing is we’ve got to adapt to the changing climate, and improving our flood defences is one of the urgent ways we need to do that.”Updatedat 3.42pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.14pm GMT15:14Kerry McCarthy, the shadow environment secretary, said the priority now was to protect people’s homes and businesses, but added that the government needed to address flooding as a climate change issue.  It is increasingly clear that so-called ‘unprecedented’ weather events are here to stay. The government must drop its complacency over the need for climate change adaptation. It must also invest in maintaining flood defences, rather than cutting them as they had planned, as well as look urgently at what else can be done to reduce flood risk in future.Updatedat 3.17pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.35pm GMT14:35My colleague Ben Quinn has more on the situation in York. Homes in York were evacuated after a flooding barrier protecting the city was lifted to allow high levels of water to be released.The decision to lift the barrier in order to bring down water levels in River Foss was taken on Saturday night after a pumping station itself was “overwhelmed” by water, according to the Environment Agency.Experts were still working on Sunday to re-activate the pumps at the Foss Barrier building after water came in to its electrics.“When the Foss is high the barrier will be lifted to let water levels flow into the River Ouse, and that’s what happened in this case,” said a spokesperson.”The pump station was overwhelmed by water and the barrier had to be lifted to allow the high water in the Foss to come through.”Warnings were given to residents - with some reports suggesting that thousands of home were affected - to move valuables upstairs and make preparations to evacuate the area.The Environment Agency spokesperson added that it “too early” to determine what the impact of the decision to raise the barrier would be.”At the moment the priority is to get the pump station up and running again as soon as possible.”Water levels would have been “much higher” if the barrier had not been raised, she added.Updatedat 3.12pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.34pm GMT14:34Thousands of people remain without power in flood-affected areas. Engineers have restored services to a further 1,062 customers in Lancashire and Greater Manchester after the flooding, but almost 6,500 homes currently remain without electricity. Some properties are expected to remain without power until Monday, Electricity North West said, and customers in Rochdale are being asked to turn off Christmas lights and ration the use of appliances such as washing machines and dishwashers to conserve electricity. Power has been restored to 15,765 properties in Rochdale, and around 4,500 remain without electricity after a substation there was flooded – five years after flood defences there received a £470,000 upgrade to protect against a “one-in-200-years” flood. Mark Williamson, operations director for Electricity North West, said: “Our engineers are continuing to work hard and have restored power to a further 1,000 customers today in Lancashire and Greater Manchester and we are working to get the remaining 6,462 customers back on as soon as possible. “We are still asking our customers in Rochdale to reduce their energy use to prevent further power outages while our engineers repair the damage. Simple things like turning off your Christmas lights or not using your washing machine or dishwasher for a while would make a huge difference. “We are doing everything we possibly can to access our substations, assess the damage caused by severe flooding and restore supplies.” Updatedat 3.16pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.01pm GMT14:01Environment Agency lifted York flood defencesIn York the Environment Agency said it was forced to lift a barrier that was in place to protect the city centre overnight after water entered one of the flood control centres.The flood poured into the Foss Barrier building in one part of the city, putting it in danger of failing.If the barrier had became stuck in the ‘down’ position, it would not have been able to discharge water into the river Ouse.So the agency made the decision to lift it, warning residents in the city centre to move valuables to upper floors and prepare to leave their homes.Updatedat 3.18pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.48pm GMT13:48My colleague Helen Pidd has spent the morning in flood-hit Todmorden. Flooded residents of one West Yorkshire town spent Boxing Day night sleeping in the Lord Mayor’s parlour after being evacuated from their homes.The town hall in Todmorden has been open non-stop since the flood waters rose to record levels on Saturday morning. Free legal advice, mops, rubber gloves, cups of tea and bacon butties are available for those in need. “We’ve been absolutely rammed. Babies, dogs, a woman with an oxygen tank,” said Steph Booth, the mayor of Todmorden. “Two people slept in the Lord Mayor’s parlour. They thought it was rather grand.”Booth, who happens to be Cherie Blair’s stepmother, estimated that “a few hundred” homes and businesses had been flooded out in Todmorden, many for the third or fourth time. “It’s the worst one we’ve ever had because of how far the flood waters have gone” she said. “I was speaking to one 86-year-old lady who has lived her all her life in the same house and has never been flooded until now.”Paul Gibbons was grimly hosing away sewage from his factory near the Rochdale Canal on Sunday morning. Asked how it was going, he answered: “Do you want to see me hang myself? Or do you just want to shoot me now?” His firm, NR Components, makes caravan awnings. The factory floor was still a few inches under water, with at least 30 sewing machines worth £6,000 each completely ruined. “They’re goosed. Totally goosed,” he said.Gibbons, 67, has been unable to get insurance since the last floods, 2012, which resulted in a claim with upwards of half a million pounds, he said,adding: “To be fair, I wouldn’t insure me either.”His son, Sam, suggested the many millions spent on improving Todmorden’s flood defences would be better used as a reconstruction fund. “They clearly don’t work so they might as well just dish out the cash to us all every time,” he said.Nearby, volunteers at the Hippodrome theatre were clearing up after their fourth major flood since 2000. Late morning on Sunday the dressing rooms were still four-feet underwater, though they had managed to save most props, costumes and lighting rigs by piling them up on the stage in a dawn operation on Boxing Day. The theatre is insured, though chair David Winslow wondered for how much longer. “In 2000 our claim was £200,000. In 2012 and 2013 it was about £70,000. Now this,” he said.Up on Commercial Street, residents were mopping out their terraced houses for the third time in four years, the smell of raw sewage starting to linger in the air. Adele Leah, a mental health nurse, was incensed that her insurance firm, Halifax, was not open for business until Tuesday.“It’s disgusting. I rang them and was told by a third party answering their emergency line that they can’t deal with our claim until Tuesday. They should hang their heads in shame,” she said, explaining that the delay meant that she theoretically wasn’t able to throw out all of her flood-damaged property: which includes everything on the ground floor of her house. Claimants are supposed to keep everything in situ until the loss adjuster arrives.Leah bought her house in 2010, knowing it was at risk of flooding - “You take the risk, don’t you?” Yet she insists she doesn’t regret the move, even now, after her second major flood. “You know, even with everything that’s gone on, I don’t regret it because the community spirit is amazing. It’s like stepping back 20 or 30 years when people knocked on each others’ doors. We’re in and out of each others’ houses .Money can’t buy that,” she said, as young lads carried ruined suites out onto the street and hosed down the pavement.Not everyone in Todmorden was feeling so optimistic. Inside the Buttylicious sandwich bar, Pat Brierley had decided enough was enough. “I can’t go through this again,” she said, recalling her first flood, in 2012, which ruined the shop within a few days of it opening. But the latest flood was worse, upturning fridges and freezers, smashing through the display case and ripping up the floor tiles. She could not get insurance and so would have to pay to put everything right. “I can’t face it,” she said. “The lease is up at the end of January so I’m off then. I doubt I’ll get the bond back.”Updatedat 3.10pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.42pm GMT13:42John Gummer, a former environment secretry and now Lord Deben, has called for the recent floods to be seen in the context of climate change.John Deben (@lorddeben)Surprising no broadcaster seems to have sought to discuss advice on flooding and adaptation to climate change given to GovernmentDecember 27, 2015Updatedat 3.10pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.50pm GMT12:50More from John Vidal who has been looking at the cuts to the government’s flood spending over the past five years. The government released its capital flood spending levels since 2010 just before Christmas. It took a tumble of nearly 30% after 2010/11 and has only now picked up thanks to “exceptional” funding as a result of the 2013/14 floods. According to the figures, as supplied by Lord Gardiner of Kimble, Defra spokesman in the House of Lords, there was £364.9m spent on flood defences in 2010/11. The following year that dropped to £260.7m. By 2014/15 capital investment on flood defences had fallen to £228m supplemented by a further £125m in “exceptional funding” given as a result of floods.Vidal said: “Defra has been cut to the bone but while saying it is now maintaining its flood defence spending, the figures clearly show it dropped the ball in 2011 and is only spending more now because it is being forced to by circumstance.”Updatedat 1.38pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.49pm GMT12:49Clean up and new defences will cost 'tens of millions'The Guardian’s environment editor John Vidal has been speaking to Innes Thomson, a former flood chief at the Environment Agency, who now heads the Association of Drainage Authorities, the 250 or more public bodies whose job it is to manage water levels and keep water flowing. He was driving north to Yorkshire to help with the relief effort and said what was happening was overwhelming defences. What we are seeing is a whole set of circumstances leading to 100 per cent saturation of the groundwater. River levels in York are now approaching the highest levels ever recorded. [But] It’s not the very worst it could be. We have river, surface and groundwater (underground) saturation but we don’t have have severe tidal or wind issues [which could make it even worse].I do not see this as a failure. We have had perfectly reasonable policy of trying to provide flood risk protection...the question now is do we have to do more if we have climate change - and I believe we are in a period of demonstrable climate change.Thomson called for more money to be spent on maintenance rather than on major new defence projects: If we were to spend more just maintaining and managing water levels it would be money well spent. If we spent a slug of money now cleaning up rivers, it would help. All sort of work needs to be done. We have £22 bn of flood risk assets, but [we need to ask] have we got the right standard, are they in good condition, should we upgrade our pumps, do we need to ensure all our embanments are sound, are our water courses clear of obstacles?I think we are talking about tens of millions of pounds. Now is an opportunity to reconsider where we spend our money. At the moment we spend money on shiny new projects . But is it sensible to spend a lot on them? We have got to be very careful we don’t have a knee-jerk reaction. We need a plan of action . We need to reassess our spending priorities.Updatedat 1.36pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.17pm GMT12:17Grim scenes from Helen Pidd in Todmorden.Helen Pidd (@helenpidd)Backyards in Todmorden have become graveyards for ruined sofas, soggy Christmas presents and flooded fridges. pic.twitter.com/YLlJyBb2aeDecember 27, 2015Updatedat 1.36pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
