Queensland’s land court has dismissed a challenge by conservationists to Adani’s Carmichael mine, Australia’s largest proposed coal project. The land court president, Carmel MacDonald, recommended the state government approve the mine but with extra conditions around monitoring the impact on waterways and a local threatened species, the black-throated finch.The mine has been earmarked for the Galilee Basin region of central Queensland.The Great Barrier Reef and the coal mine that could kill it The ruling legally informs but does not bind the state’s mining minister when deciding whether to issue mining and environmental licences to the Indian conglomerate.The legal challenge - brought by the state Environmental Defender’s Office on behalf of the green group Coast and Country - was among a number faced by Adani while battling to push ahead with the huge project which will export up to 60m tonnes of coal a year.Cross-examination during the case of Adani’s experts revealed a large discrepancy between their estimations of jobs and state government royalties and taxes to flow from the project and those publicly touted by Adani.Coast and Country also called on its expert testimony that the world thermal coal export market was in permanent decline and that emissions from burning Carmichael coal would have a negative net impact on global efforts to combat climate change.However, MacDonald accepted Adani’s argument that there would be “no increase in greenhouse gas emissions” if the mine was approved “because alternative supply will be sourced elsewhere to meet global demand”.In her orders, MacDonald took into account only concerns about management of impacts on the black-throated finch.MacDonald said in her judgment that the “adverse impacts of the mine will be outweighed by the economic benefits flowing from it”.However, she said she would draw state mining minister Anthony Lynham’s attention to the fact Adani had “overstated certain elements of the benefit of the mine both in the (environmental impact statement) and in evidence before this court”.The EIS also stated it would create more than 10,000 jobs a year from 2024 when it would in fact result in 1464 net jobs in Australia, MacDonald said.She found Adani had also “probably overstated” the selling price of coal and therefore the royalties and taxes generated by the project, which the company had claimed would top $22bn. However, she rejected claims that Adani would not profit from the project because of its offshore tax minimization strategies, and found that Adani had “the necessary financial capacity to carry on mining operations”.She said it was unlikely that Adani and its parent company would have spent over $850m to date “unless they were confident of a successful outcome”.MacDonald said she was not prepared to accept that the world thermal coal market was in permanent decline. Uncertainty as to the future market for thermal coal in the next 35 years was not enough to show the project was “unviable”, she said.On emissions, MacDonald ruled only those from the company’s operation, not from the burning of the coal by its customers, should be taken into account when assessing the mine’s impact.“These emissions will account for 0.01% of the world’s and 0.25% of Australia’s remaining carbon budget having regard to the 2C target [to limit climate change impacts globally],” she wrote.Coast and Country spokesman Derec Davies said outside court it was “unfortunate” that Adani and the mining industry at large continued to successfully push the “drug dealer’s defence” in justifying thermal coal sales, arguing if they did not sell it, someone else would.“We reject this claim outright. The international agreement on climate mitigation signed days ago has signed the death of fossil fuels, the death of thermal coal in Queensland and this mine needs to be rejected.”EDO principal solicitor Jo Bragg said once the burning of Carmichael coal was taken into account, the mine would take up 0.5% of the world’s carbon budget.Debi Goenka, the executive trustee of the Conservation Action Trust, which joined the legal action as a separate objector, said the group was disappointed by the decision.The group argued that coal burned in India would threaten the health and livelihoods of poor rural people close to Adani’s power plants.“These people can’t afford the electricity that will be generated – all they’ll get will be damage to their health and the land, water and the natural resource base on which their survival depends,” Goenka said.The Conservation Action Trust claims that coal contributes to up to 115,000 premature deaths and 20m new asthma cases a year in India.Goenka said renewable energy was a faster, cheaper and healthier solution to “energy poverty” especially in rural areas beyond the existing power grid.Shadow Queensland mining minister Andrew Cripps said the “common sense” decision vindicated the former Newman government’s move to restrict community objection rights “to limit frivolous and vexatious objections to resource projects”, since overturned by the Palaszczuk government.“Today’s recommendation by the Land Court reinforces the glaringly obvious problem the resources sector faces in Queensland and that there must be reasonable and practical limits placed on this abuse of the legal system, with challenges based on ideology rather than fact,” he said.Davies said it was “outrageous” that Adani had publicly stood by its claims about 10,000 jobs and royalties and taxes of $22b.“I think what Adani is doing is stepping well into the territory of false advertising and really need to be looking at pulling their head in in relation to who it’s advertising to and what numbers it’s using,” he said.Coal from Carmichael mine 'will create more annual emissions than New York' The Australia Institute, whose then chief executive Richard Denniss was called as an expert witness during the case, released a report last month claiming emissions from Carmichael coal – an average 79m tonnes of carbon a year – would be more than New York city’s.MacDonald concluded that “major economic benefits will flow from the project to the local region, Queensland and Australia”.Although those benefits would come at the cost of some environmental damage, the conditions she imposed “should result in the adverse environmental impacts being appropriately managed and mitigated”.Adani’s promoter, Gautam Adani, recently complained that legal challenges had deterred financiers from backing the project. Adani told Indian media he had met Malcolm Turnbull last month to urge him to follow through with legal changes to prevent “lawfare” by green activists mooted under the former prime minister, Tony Abbott.However, EDO’s Bragg said the case, which led to important revelations about the true benefits of the mine and its impact on the black-throated finch, showed the importance of maintaining community objection rights to mines.“If Coast and Country hadn’t gone to court, the flaws in the EIS would not have been exposed,” she said. “The black-throated finch would be in serious trouble, it wouldn’t have even been known that its core habitat was the mine site.“All of this valuable information would not have come out if there hadn’t been this community objection process.”Adani still faces two federal court challenges, including that by the Australian Conservation Foundation against the decision of the federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, to approve the mine.Hunt says Australians 'should be proud' of Coalition efforts on climate change Hunt reapproved the mine after his first decision was ruled invalid when the Mackay conservation council successfully argued that he had failed to consider advice on the impact on endangered species, the yakka skink and ornamental snake.The other federal court challenges comes from representatives of the mine site’s traditional owners, the Wangan and Jagalingou people, who argued the native title tribunal erred by overruling their objections and granting Adani approval in “the public interest”.
