Dr Hans-Dieter Sues of the Smithsonian Institution and colleagues have discovered a new species of dinosaur that demonstrates that theropod dinosaurs were more diverse toward the end of the Triassic period than previously thought. Theropods were the bipedal carnivores that included one of the best known of all dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex. Theropods had sharp teeth and claws and evolved hollow, thin-walled bones that may have contributed both to their agility as running predators and paved the way for the evolution of flight. You may think about birds differently when you see them as highly derived theropods, which they are.Previous fossils had shown a number of basal branches of theropods that were thought to have become extinct long before the end of the Late Triassic. Daemonosaurus chauliodus demonstrates that remnants of the early radiation of theropods survived to the end of the Triassic. Available fossils, however, still suggest that it was only the related lineage called Neotheropoda that survived into the Jurassic. The neotheropods were characterised by the loss of one finger and reduction of another to form effectively a three-digit foot. The southwestern US is proving to be a rich source of Late Triassic dinosaur fossils and will no doubt continue to yield exciting finds.The genus name comes from the Greek daimon meaning "evil spirit" in reference to Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, where the fossil was discovered. The specific epithet means "with prominent teeth". I think it safe to say that those prominent teeth were the last thing that a lot of smaller animals saw.Quentin Wheeler is director of the International Institute for Species Exploration, Arizona State University
