Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This book is one of my favourite books written by Stephen King. The thing that I like about this book is that it makes you feel like you are the one in the forest fighting for survival. I never thought that a book could scare me this much. You know that kind of book when you just one to rip the page off, because of all the thrill that is going on in it? Well than this is that kind of book. If you are a fan of mystery, thriller or horror than put everything down and go read this book.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
