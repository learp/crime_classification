Paying homage to Mexican drinks of old, but with new-wave sweetness, this goes perfectly with everything taco. It’s good enough to stand on its own two feet, too. Serves one.40ml vodka (I use the East London Liquor Company’s)15ml crème de pêche (try Merlet)30ml pink grapefruit juice15ml fresh lime juice10ml simple sugar syrupSoda water, to topPut everything bar the soda in a tall glass (give it a salt rim first, if you like), add cubed ice and stir. Top with soda and stir again. For extra kick, finish with a chilli flake or two.• Chris O’Neil, Temper, London W1
