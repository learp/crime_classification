How Soon Is Now?, the old Smiths song, could work now as an anthem for high-speed online deliveries, which are, in turn, increasingly raising questions about workers’ rights.In the same week that the Department for Transport reported a crisis in road congestion, owing primarily to online deliveries – in some parts of Britain, a horse and cart would be faster – an undercover BBC report revealed that Amazon delivery drivers are forced to deliver up to 200 parcels a day, working illegal hours and breaking speed limits.A supervisor told the undercover BBC reporter that he didn’t need to wear a seatbelt as the police didn’t stop delivery drivers, while fellow drivers advised him to urinate into bottles and defecate into bags to save time.It’s no surprise that Amazon (where drivers are classified as self-employed and thus not entitled to minimum wage, sickness benefit and other rights and protections) is also one of the companies implicated in the “gig economy”, highlighted by the recent Uber tribunal, where drivers won basic employment rights.All of which may feel a bit too much to take in when you’re just returning home to find that your driver has flung your parcel into your front garden, like a paperboy in an American drama.However, while it’s Amazon’s responsibility to sort out how it is conducting its business, taxes and treatment of all staff (not just drivers), perhaps it is also time to acknowledge that our growing culture of unreasonable customer demand is part of the problem.There is a fundamental disconnect in the British psyche that means that people get rightly exercised about kids slogging in sweatshops in Asia, but remain wilfully underinformed about the disgusting way that workers in Britain are treated – and disgusting is the operative word.All that stuff about defecating in bags and urinating in bottles made me feel sick and not just for the obvious reasons. It renders these drivers subhuman, almost like a form of “battery workers”, where the only goal is to keep driving and delivering.On the other side of the equation, there are consumers demanding ever-faster service and I’m no exception. Bone idle in the extreme, I adore the ease of next -day delivery, and not just with Amazon. Now you can even get things delivered on the same day.However, while there’s much to be said for swiftness, surely it can’t be at the expense of drivers’ dignity or, indeed, their safety or the safety of others they might encounter on roads while they’re speeding or pissing in bottles to save time.While it’s up to Amazon to sort this out, consumers could do worse than addressing our own bratty demanding culture of “I want it NOW!”Let’s face it, while some deliveries are urgent, usually it’s just a bonus. Most of us rarely need to have books, DVD box sets, or whatever, slammed into our hands within hours or even the next day.If that were the case, we could undertake the retro ritual of going to the shops, which in turn might stop British town centres evolving into eerie, almost empty coffee-place-and-eyebrow-threading super-zones.This is not letting the likes of Amazon off the hook – it’s up to them and companies like them to address the issues raised by the BBC report, which, once again, seems to require hiring more people, respecting their labour and paying them properly.In the meantime, just as people should be concerned about labour outrages overseas, let us also spare a thought for our own frazzled, powerless, almost invisible workforce.Unreasonable customer expectation and demand is nothing new, but when it is automatic and unthinking it plays a part in worker exploitation.Leonard Cohen’s final gesture typified a truly great life      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Cohen’s last album could be read as an artistic statement of intent. Photograph: Diego Tuson/AFP/Getty ImagesThe damned year of 2016 has claimed another significant creative scalp, this time, musician and poet Leonard Cohen. Judging by the heartfelt wails of grief, many consider Cohen, even at 82 years old, to have been taken too soon.However, Cohen recently said that he felt that his own death was imminent, writing a letter to his dying muse, Marianne Ihlen (for whom he wrote Marianne, Bird on a Wire and So Long), saying: “Know that I am so close behind that if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine.”Cohen also released an album, You Want It Darker, so close to his death that it could almost qualify as posthumous. Certainly, like David Bowie’s Blackstar, it could be read as an artistic statement of intent, a final defiant cry that says: “This is the last of the real me, not the slew of greatest hits packages that are bound to follow.”Perhaps it takes era-defining musicians of this calibre to refashion the hackneyed, but thriving rock’n’roll death industry, a mischievous yet determined refusal by Cohen and Bowie to let third parties entirely own the posthumous narrative.At last my Labour pains are at an end       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Sorry, Jeremy, but I’ve finally managed to get my way out. Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/ReutersFor those who are interested, I’ve finally managed to escape from the Labour party. I don’t use “escape” lightly. At times, it felt akin to a personal remake of The Great Escape – not quite carrying soil out in my trousers, scurrying under searchlights or jumping over barbed wire fences on my Steve McQueen motorbike, but it was still bad enough.I now know what it feels like to be stalked by a British political party. It took me about five minutes to join the Labour party and several months to leave – sorry, I mean to be allowed to leave – to free myself from what appeared to be their desperate frenzied (“Please don’t leave us here alone with Jeremy!”) grasp. As I’ve stated before, stopping the money isn’t enough, you’ve got to write to the Labour party to resign, but it doesn’t end there.You end up fielding emails asking you to reconsider and others saying you’ll be given time to reconsider (subtext: whether you like it or not). Even when, finally, the termination letter arrived, it was still wondering whether I’d like to reconsider.Well, I’ve considered, reconsidered, maybe even re-reconsidered, if that’s grammatically possible, but I’m still off, most probably to join the Liberal Democrats, if they keep making anti-Brexit noises, and I can source unfashionable enough knitwear.Will the Labour party miss me and my inconsiderate non-reconsidering? It’s unlikely. Still, let my experience serve as a warning to anyone else thinking of leaving Labour. Make sure you take extra vitamins and get proper sleepy-byes, because, while parting is such sweet sorrow, it’s also exhausting. If you have any holiday left, you may need to use that, too.
