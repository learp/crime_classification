Mary Berry will tour Britain’s stately homes in what is likely to be her first BBC1 outing after The Great British Bake Off moves to Channel 4.In Mary Berry’s Secrets From Britain’s Great Houses, the cooking judge will meet the custodians and staff at some of Britain’s grandest properties, exploring their culinary histories and creating her own recipes.Berry said: “I am so excited to be doing this new series with the BBC. I have always had an inquiring mind, so I know I will be inspired by the great houses we visit.”The BBC’s director of content, Charlotte Moore, said: “This series will be a real treat for BBC1 viewers.”Berry is to appear in two Bake Off Christmas specials but, along with presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, has said she will not follow the programme – and fellow judge Paul Hollywood – to Channel 4.Last month, a new Saturday night entertainment show hosted by Giedroyc and Perkins was announced, weeks after last year’s Bake Off winner, Nadiya Hussain, who had been tipped to become a presenter or judge for Channel 4’s version, committed to making the BBC her home.Channel 4 has been criticised for failing to ensure the show’s most recognisable faces were signed up before agreeing a £25m a year deal with the show’s creators, Love Productions.Berry recently said she would be reunited with Giedroyc and Perkins, joking that they could host a gardening programme together.Tanya Shaw, managing director of Shine TV, producer of Mary Berry’s Secrets From Britain’s Great Houses, said: “Following the success of Mary Berry’s Easter Feast last year, we are delighted to be working with Mary on this exciting new series. “I can’t think of anyone more perfect to tell the stories of these great households and to bring us such a unique insight into Britain’s rich culinary past.”
