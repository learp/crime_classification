If the potatoes in these parts have thriven lately as much in the root as they have in the haulm we shall enjoy a wonderful crop. Passing through a field white and pink in flower to-day, one was knee-high among the earthed-up rows, and a trial with the prong showed that the acres of soil covered tons of sound, delicious food. In the corner of this fifteen-acre plot, there is a spread of turnips which also promises well; all the roots are helped by the intermittent rain and sunshine. From among the green tops which glistened in the light - these young leaves hold the clear rain water like small saucers - there went away with a whirring noise, but rather slowly, a dozen or so of brown birds, a covey of partridges. It was one family; a week or two ago the youngsters could only have run, now they were across the hedge and lost in the tall grass out of which it would have been unkind to dislodge them.The grass ought by this time to have been hay, but when the rains came it was thought better to let the “tops” wither so that the richer “bottoms” might spring anew. But it is now all overripe; the white-flowered clover has faded to brown, the intruding thistles are sere above their roots, and the hedge-side, where the haws are beginning to ripen, as do mellow apples, would bear a premature touch of middle August were it not for the livening of these showers. It is greener, however, where the young rabbits have come out to feed. They nibble within sight of their run, and very little will make them scutter.
