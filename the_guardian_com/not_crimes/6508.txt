1965: The White House first acknowledges the risks of climate change, just a few weeks after Lyndon Baines Johnson becomes president. “This generation has altered the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale through radioactive materials and a steady increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels,” Johnson tells Congress on 8 February 1965. That November, he tells Congress the burning of coal, oil and gas is adding 6bn tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every year. Global emissions of carbon dioxide stood at about 36bn tons in 2013.1988: James Hansen, a climate scientist at Nasa, tells Congress increased concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases in the atmosphere are causing higher temperatures. The first five months of 1988 were warmer than any other period since record keeping began, and Hansen was 99% certain the trend was caused by the buildup of carbon dioxide. Tim Wirth, a Democratic senator from Colorado, urges Congress to consider how to halt that trend.1992: The first president George Bush attends the Rio Earth Summit, and supports the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to reach a global agreement to end global warming. “The United States fully intends to be the world’s pre-eminent leader in protecting the global environment,” Bush tells a press conference in Rio on 13 June 1992.1997: Al Gore, then vice-president, attends the UN climate meeting in Kyoto, and agrees to a deal which would require the US to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 7% below 1990 levels by 2012. But conservative Democrats, Republicans, and industry argue for curbs on developing countries as well, and say the cuts would hurt the US economy. The US never ratified the Kyoto Treaty.2001 - relapse: The second president George Bush makes it known the US will abandon any effort to bring Kyoto into force, and will officially withdraw from the agreement. The Bush White House goes on to silence or distort the science behind climate change, gut environmental protections, and approve a highly destructive method of coal production known as mountaintop removal.2009: Barack Obama enters the White House, and takes his first steps to fulfil a campaign promise to make his presidency the moment “when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal”. On 17 February, Obama signs a stimulus bill containing more than $90bn (£60bn) for clean energy, including investments in high-speed rail and energy retro-fits. On 18 May, Obama invites car makers to the White House lawns to announce the first cuts in climate pollution from cars and trucks. On 26 June 2009, Congress votes for a cap-and-trade bill. The measure passes the house 219-212.2010 - relapse: On 31 March, Obama proposes to open waters off Alaska, the Atlantic coast, and the Gulf of Mexico to offshore oil and gas drilling, much of it for the first time, as part of an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. Two days later, he notes that oil rigs are advanced and generally don’t cause oil spills. On 20 April, a blow-out in a BP deepwater well kills 11 and spews millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. It will take three months before BP regains control over the well.2010 - relapse: On 21 September, Democrats give up on trying to pass a climate bill through the Senate. The decision comes after a series of meetings with the White House in which it became clear that the White House has decided to focus on healthcare legislation. Climate change takes a back seat for the duration of Obama’s first term.2012: On 29 October, Hurricane Sandy roars out of the Caribbean and makes landfall in New Jersey, killing 159 people, inflicting $65bn in property damage, and knocking out power to New York City for days. On 1 November, Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor, endorses Obama for the White House, saying he would do more to fight climate change. 2013: Emboldened by his re-election, Obama promises in his inaugural address to make climate change one of the top priorities of his second term. He uses his State of the Union address to warn Republicans he will use his executive authority to fight climate change, saying: “If Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will.” On 25 June, in another landmark speech Obama says he will direct the Environmental Protection Agency to cut emissions from power plants.2014: Obama Administration unveils rules cutting climate pollution from power plants, the biggest single source of carbon dioxide emissions. The proposed rules would cut emissions 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. On 12 November, Obama and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, agree to joint action to cut emissions.2015: Obama’s year of climate action. Since the start of the year, the White House has produced a climate-themed announcement or event every four days. The EPA has moved ahead on plans to cut climate pollution on power plants. Meanwhile, Obama pivoted away from earlier policy, pulling the plug on new oil drilling in Arctic waters on 16 October and rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline on 6 November.
