On Sunday morning, I hear my wife deep in discussion with a group of strangers downstairs. Or they may be friends; some of the voices are familiar. But I didn’t hear anyone come in and the conversation doesn’t sound that friendly.I go down to find my wife on the phone in the sitting room. The tense discussion, meanwhile, is taking place in the kitchen.“Anyway, I can’t talk now,” my wife says into her phone. “It’s The Archers.”She walks past me into the kitchen and shuts the door behind her, the better to become one with the radio.Two days later, we attend a party given by the Radio Times. The hotel ballroom where the party is taking place has cloakrooms segregated by gender, and after we separate, I soon lose track of my wife. Scanning the room for familiar faces, I encounter a problem peculiar to the event: all the faces are familiar. One of them comes from Poldark, another from Downton’s servant’s quarters. I recognise everyone and know no one.Eventually, I locate some other journalists to talk to in a corner by the bar, but my thoughts keep returning to my wife. I imagine her on her own, scanning the crowd with mounting alarm, never daring to venture as far as this corner. After a few minutes, I excuse myself to go and look for her. I find her in the foyer, chatting to Nadiya from The Great British Bake Off.“Look!” my wife says, pointing at Nadiya. “Look who I found!”A ceremony follows, during which many television personalities are presented with framed magazine covers. Doctor Who gets one, as does Lenny Henry. At one point, the cast of The Archers takes the stage.“Oh my God,” my wife says, sinking her nails into my forearm.When the presentation ends, my wife hands me her wine glass. “Get me a drink,” she says. “I’m going in.”“OK,” I say. “Where will I find…?”“Wait!” she says. “Where have all the Archers gone?”I see her problem: in a room full of TV actors, radio actors just look like people. “You’d better hope they stick together,” I say.The queue for drinks is long. When I return to the spot where I last saw my wife, Jeremy Paxman is standing there. I wander through the crowd, holding up one drink in a perpetual greeting, as if I’ve just made eye contact with a friend. I finally spot my wife standing beside the stage, shouting at a woman who I will later learn plays Ruth in The Archers. Only when I’m up close can I hear what my wife is shouting, which is, “Do the voice!”My wife introduces me to Helen, and Rob, who is really called Tim. Tim introduces me to David, who is also called Tim.“That’s weird,” I say to Rob-called-Tim, “I’m called Tim, and my real first name is Robert.”He looks at me for a moment, as if trying to gauge the precise extent to which I understand that Rob isn’t a person. Behind us, Ruth, who’s called Felicity, is being made to bleat, “Daaaaavid”, by my wife.Readers suggest the 10 best Archers storylines I chat to Susan, who is called Charlotte and has a PhD in psychology. I feel as if I’m at a cocktail party taking place in two universes at once. I’m out of my depth in both of them.“I was actually in favour of the Ambridge bypass,” I say.“Were you?” Charlotte asks in a voice that suggests I’ve chosen the wrong universe.Watching my wife take a selfie with Rob and Helen, I realise I should have seen this coming: that one day she would present herself to the Archers, and they would claim her.@IAmTimDowling
