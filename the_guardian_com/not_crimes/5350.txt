A naturalist will return time and again to favourite places. In Wales there's a term for this ritual of habituation: dyn ei filltir sgwar – someone of their own square mile. Being thus brings rewards. When I look back over visits to one precious landscape, where Afon Dwyfor sidles into the sea a mile west of Cricieth, the gifts have been glorious: a marsh harrier hunting across saltings; monochrome flicker of knot scouring across a sunset sky; soft whistlings and purrings of pintail and wigeon at pre-dawn; swirl of otters in pursuit of salmon; reed-buntings and bearded tits among phragmites beds; the Glaslyn osprey flouncing down on a seethe of mullet; goosander and merganser arrowing upstream; gleam of little egrets in the tide-flow; even a great skua – all these illustrations of memory.Soon, perhaps, that's all they'll be. A consultation document just issued by the British Association for Shooting and Conservation supports an application to lease for shooting crown estate land along the tidal river. This land is traversed by the new Wales Coastal Path. The farmer, Peredur Parry, who leases fields behind and keeps them in good heart through unstinting labour, does not want the shooters here. Nor do walkers who exercise here throughout day and year. Nor do I. This is a special place. The association lists species of goose, duck and wader permissible to shoot. It includes wigeon, pintail, golden plover, snipe, woodcock. Look up their status and you'll find a recurrent vocabulary: rare, declining, irregular visitor, threatened.When will we learn? The association outlines plans to breed and introduce more mallard as quarry. They'll become a dominant, excluding species. Extinction's tipping points? Shooting and conservation? In this instance, that structure strikes me as oxymoronic. The lease application's being made last-minute, in hope of slipping through unnoticed before new gun legislation due next month. If you want to preserve this little piece of heaven and all that inhabits there, you'll need to act quickly.
