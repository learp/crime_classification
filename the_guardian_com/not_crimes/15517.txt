Two colourful macaws have been temporarily removed from an art installation at the new-look Tate Modern on welfare grounds because of record numbers of visitors to the museum.'A real-life game of The Sims': readers review Tate Modern's Switch House Tate said there had been 143,000 visits since it opened on Friday, 54,000 of them on Saturday – about double the usual number, and the London museum’s highest single-day attendance.As a result, two macaws that were part of an installation called Tropicália, by the late Brazilian artist Hélio Oiticica, have been removed. On Monday their cage was empty and a sign read: “Due to high visitor numbers expected this week, the macaws have been temporarily returned to their owner.”The installation allowed up to eight visitors at a time to walk on sand – a tropical respite, perhaps, from the bad weather outside. A sign asked visitors not to feed or touch the birds and to remain a respectful distance from them. Tate Modern's Switch House review – brain-fizzing art to power a pyramid  A spokeswoman said the macaws had been taken out before the public opening in anticipation of high numbers. A statement read: “Tate has undertaken a number of rigorous processes to ensure the welfare of the birds in Oiticica’s Tropicália. Their care is of paramount importance to us. They are temporarily with their owner because of the high volume of visitors expected in the opening weeks.”The high visitor numbers over the first few days were not a surprise. A 10-storey, £260m ziggurat extension has increased the gallery’s size by 60%.Frances Morris, the director of Tate Modern, said: “We are absolutely delighted that so many visitors experienced the new galleries and performances over the opening weekend.“Although we have almost doubled the number of regular visitors to the galleries during our opening weekend, we have space for it to feel comfortable even when busy. There has been a tremendous response from the public and we look forward to welcoming many more visitors over the coming months.”
