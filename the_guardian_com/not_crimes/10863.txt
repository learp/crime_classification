At 91, I can’t have many more elections to waste my lifelong Labour vote on, so I am enjoying the current political scene as best I can. The possibility of prime minister Boris Johnson facing president Donald Trump across the Atlantic and working in harmony for the betterment of mankind makes me laugh out loud, and I thank the Guardian for giving us Martin Rowson’s wonderful Shakespearean cartoon (23 April), which I shall have framed and hung in my bedroom so that at least, when the time comes, I can die laughing.Hilda HaydenNewland, Worcestershire• Your editor in chief asks “How do we make the Guardian a better place for conversation?” (23 April). Try promoting your letters page online. The letters page of the newspaper was where the best of readers’ contributions could be read, free from abuse or rants, which can fill so much of the comments after articles. So make your letters page a central feature of your online edition; give it a section with a tab on the front page so readers can find it.Nick BionReading• Martin Kettle (22 April) lists “in my mind’s eye” as one of Shakespeare’s invented phrases. It seems here the poet might simply have kept his ear to the ground.

On Monday you finally introduce a daily page of puzzles. Then on Saturday you drop it – the one day when people have time to do them.Greg KnowlesLondon• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
