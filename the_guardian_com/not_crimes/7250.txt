Teaching Polish in Britain (Poland’s PM urges May to put Polish lessons on timetable, 29 November) is not new. I am a Briton of Polish descent. My parents were part of the Polish armed forces at the end of second world war (part of the British armed forces at the time), most of whom stayed here rather than return to possible internment or worse in the then newly Stalinist Poland. I sat O-level Polish in 1973. Though I was at times resentful of having to give up two hours on a Friday evening after school to study with a personal tutor (my school organised the exam), it allowed me to develop a knowledge of Polish language and grammar that has enabled me to keep in contact with my Polish cousins and friends.I hope the children of the new Polish migration, those born here being British citizens, will have the same opportunity to study their parents’ language and culture, and to retain contact with their extended families. Studying Polish did not distance me from my British identity, or make me value it less. On the contrary, it allowed me to see my Britishness from another perspective, a product of complex cultural and historical forces, and to communicate with many more people on this planet.Post-Brexit we will need to be as open to as many cultures and languages as possible. It will get us heard, even liked. Very important.Professor Peter MuchlinskiSoas, University of London • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
