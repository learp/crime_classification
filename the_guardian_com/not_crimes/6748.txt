Every year when the wallflowers come out, I am right back there.Which living person do you most admire, and why?The problem with my job is that you meet people you admire and then you don’t admire them so much. The only one I carried on admiring was Nelson Mandela.What do you most dislike about your appearance?Absolutely everything.What is your most unappealing habit?I interrupt people when I think I’ve understood what they’re saying.If you could edit your past, what would you change?I would have behaved better to my first wife, and the girl I lived with afterwards. I was always away.What does love feel like?Comfort, warmth and security.Which book changed your life?If I hadn’t read a duff first world war novel called King Of The Khyber Rifles as a teenager, I don’t think I would have gone to Afghanistan.What was your most embarrassing moment?In 1979, we went to film the Queen at an agricultural show in Zambia. We were late and had to climb over a barbed-wire fence, which ripped my trousers off, revealing my bright blue underpants. Two days later, the Queen came over to me at a reception and said, “I’ve been seeing a lot of you lately.”What is top of your bucket list?To go to South Georgia and see the grave of Ernest Shackleton.To whom would you most like to say sorry, and why?I’d like to say sorry to my mother. I had to choose between my parents, and I chose my father because he didn’t have any other kids. (My mother was a war widow and had two children from her first marriage.) I thought, in a childish way, that one had to be fair. It was very difficult for my mother and me, and we never really got over it.Melanie Chisholm: ‘To whom would I like to say sorry? The other Spice Girls’ Who would you invite to your dream dinner party?Rogues: I find them fascinating. Robert Mugabe, Putin, Saddam Hussein (Saddam gave instruction that I should be killed, but I don’t hold that against him). Someone I wouldn’t invite is Colonel Gaddafi: I interviewed him three or four times, and it was boring because he was so mad.What is the worst job you’ve done?Reading the news. It’s a dull job.How often do you have sex?As often as I can, but less than before, sadly.What is the most important lesson life has taught you?Don’t leave a story before it’s over.
