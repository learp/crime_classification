It is worrying to hear the government's proposal to savagely reduce subsidies for solar power (Report, 1 November). Solar panels are a great option – they are accessible to anyone with spare roof space and, unlike most energy sources, can be installed at little risk to wildlife. The scale of subsidy reduction puts the scheme at grave risk and calls into question the coalition's commitment to carbon reduction. Existing subsidies may be too high, but that does not excuse the proposal to make such large changes at short notice – indeed, before consultation has even ended. This is likely to leave householders facing the prospect of meeting firm financial commitments, but with much lower financial returns. The RSPB's own solar programme, which would have seen solar car parks and roofs at 22 of our nature reserves, has been cancelled and the considerable time, effort and money we have put into the project has been lost.Critically, it is not the principle of cuts that we are objecting to, but the lack of clarity and the opaque decision-making that has left us and the entire industry operating in a cloud of uncertainty. We now need urgent action to take the sting out of these proposals – to win back the confidence of investors and credibility for the coalition's commitment to the environment.
