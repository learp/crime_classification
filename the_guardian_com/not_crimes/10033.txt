Imagine clearing out that bathroom cupboard bursting with bottles and tubes and replacing them with just three products.That’s what US-based personal care startup Akamai is trying to persuade people to do, in an unusual business move – asking customers to buy less.The company, which started trading earlier this year, sells three products which it claims can meet all personal care needs: toothpaste; a soap bar for the face, body and hair; and oil spray for fragrance and moisturising the hair and body. It is also encouraging customers to wash less often.If having more no longer satisfies us, perhaps we’ve reached ‘peak stuff’ | Will Hutton Co-founder Vincent Cobb, who previously set up an online store selling reusable bags and homeware, says the concept is a reaction against an industry set up to drive over-consumption.“Typical personal care product companies want you to consume more of their products, so they say wash your hair and body every day,” says Cobb. “We have been led into this false sense of what is required to have healthy skin, teeth and hair.”Steady expansionIn the UK, the beauty and personal care industry is worth £17bn, according to research company Mintel. Apart from the luxury end of the market, most of its products fall into the “fast moving consumer goods” category, meaning manufacturers and retailers rely on selling high quantities of them.The rise of e-commerce, beauty blogging and selfie culture have also encouraged steady expansion of product lines, enabling the industry to grow even in periods of economic uncertainty, according to market research group Euromonitor.That growth comes at an environmental cost. More beauty products mean more chemicals and water used in manufacturing, and more plastic packaging. Much of that ends up in landfill, since the containers used are often hard to wash out, or to recycle, says Dustin Benton, acting policy director at environmental charity Green Alliance. So much scrubbing and dousing is not good for our bodies either, says Cobb. He believes that people who rinse often but avoid frequent use of soap and other products, smell less as their bodies self-regulate – even those who sweat or exercise a lot. It’s a stance shared by the growing no shower movement.Rejection of modern hygiene assumptions also has historical grounding, says Katherine Ashenburg, author of Clean: An Unsanitised History of Washing. “It is all pretty recent that we have to be so clean and worry about smelling,” she says. “We are not working up that much of a sweat compared to people in the past, yet we are using more and more products.”But convincing people that less is more when it comes to beauty and personal care is no easy task, says Ashenburg. “That sense of insecurity, especially among women, that I might not be smelling perfectly is deep within our culture – and advertising makes enormous use of that insecurity.”Even companies focused on ethical consumption stock vast product ranges. Lush, for example, which has built a reputation for using natural ingredients, sells more than 100 different products.As campaigners against cotton buds have found, consumer habits can be hard to change. Despite being an environmental menace and serving no clear purpose (medical professionals strongly advise against using them to clean ears), they remain a bathroom staple.The consumption conundrumHow probiotics are fueling a toxin-free skincare revolution Assessing the impact of those habits is also complex says Kate Sandle, community manager at B Lab, the charity arm of sustainable certification organisation B Corp. “It’s not necessarily consumption that’s the problem, but how you consume and what you consume.” A company’s product range will only tell you so much, she adds. For a fuller picture consumers need to look at the whole business practice.The example of palm oil (used in Akamai’s products) is an illustration of this complexity. The controversial ingredient is linked to deforestation. But there is a wide gulf between the practices of different businesses when it comes to sourcing it, according to Greenpeace.Akamai is not the first company to engage with problems associated with consumerism. Clothing company Patagonia, for example, famously ran a Don’t buy this jacket ad in 2011, and encourages customers to repair garments rather than throw them away.Such companies face the question of whether calling for reduced consumption while actively marketing their products is really a viable fix for consumerism. Patagonia’s sales, for example, went up following its campaign.Cobb argues that companies can use their products to change consumption habits for the better, however. People are always going to buy stuff to clean their teeth, skin and hair, he says, but they can be encouraged to buy less of it.
