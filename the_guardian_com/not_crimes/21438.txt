The BBC has unveiled a new CBBC logo that its controller has admitted “doesn’t scream ‘children’s TV’”.CBBC – home to Blue Peter, Horrible Histories and the new-look Danger Mouse – was given its first makeover for nine years on Monday, replacing the familiar green and black logo introduced in 2007.Like the recently unveiled new look for BBC3 – which doesn’t actually say BBC3 – neither does the new-look CBBC logo clearly say CBBC.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   BBC3’s recently unveiled new logoViewers expressed fears last year that CBBC – the older of the corporation’s two dedicated channels for children – would follow BBC3 online after the BBC announced a new digital portal for its children’s TV offerings.But BBC director general Tony Hall said last year the corporation had no plans to axe either CBBC or the CBeebies channels.CBBC controller Cheryl Taylor said: “Our new logo is not overt, it doesn’t scream ‘children’s TV’ but its various iterations are fun and unpredictable and have broad appeal.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest CBBC’s new lookTaylor said the new look was a “colourful and versatile identity that is box fresh and fit for purpose in a mercurial and constantly shifting media landscape” and a “badge of quality that our older viewers can appreciate as much as younger ones”.“Our old logo just wasn’t devised to perform in a variety of digital spaces which means that it doesn’t work in the way that we want it to today,” she said.Hacker T Dog (@CBBC_Hacker)Just your average #MondayMorning.
