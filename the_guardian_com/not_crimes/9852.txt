The British Fashion Awards, which take place in December, will include several new categories this year. To increase the international focus, 11 out of 16 awards will now be open to global talent. New awards introduced for 2016 include urban luxury, which focuses on streetwear designers, and creative influencer, for a behind-the-scenes talent such as a stylist or set designer. There is also the Swarovski award for positive change, which will be awarded to a brand or person who used their profile to promote a cause outside the fashion industry. These new awards reveal changes the fashion world wishes to make to become less insular, with catwalk designers no longer the pinnacle. Streetwear brands such as Yeezy and Palace have arguably more influence on the wider public than high-fashion luxury. And, with social media now a vital part of the fashion world, people behind-the-scenes, such as Kim Kardashian’s stylist Monica Rose or Alexa Chung’s hairstylist George Northwood, have their own profile.

Edun, a fashion brand produced in Africa to encourage industry in the continent, is now owned by LVMH. And Stella McCartney, who campaigns against the use of fur, is one of the UK’s most successful designers.The shift towards a more international focus shows how the British fashion industry wants to become more outward-looking in the wake of the Brexit vote. A panel of 1,500 international industry insiders will vote on the shortlist for each category. The British Fashion Awards were founded in 1989 and will take place on 5 December. It is often a star-studded event with celebrities including Lady Gaga, David Beckham, Naomi Campbell and Lewis Hamilton in attendance last year.
