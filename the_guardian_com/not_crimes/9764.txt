The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has rejected his environment committee chairman Craig Kelly’s assessment that the Paris agreement on climate change is dead with Donald Trump as president.But just an hour after Frydenberg’s comments, the high-profile conservative backbencher George Christensen backed in Kelly’s view that the agreement was “cactus”.George Christensen (@GChristensenMP)Parliament should approve treaties. With #ParisAgreement my vote would've been NO. Aus has ratified but US withdrawal means Paris is cactus.November 10, 2016Kelly used the same word in a Facebook post  as the Turnbull government ratified the Paris agreement.Turnbull signals Australia won't follow Trump's lead on Paris climate agreement Frydenberg said while Trump had expressed “strong views” on climate change, the United States had already ratified the agreement, as had more than 100 other countries.Asked about Kelly’s statement, Frydenberg said: “I don’t think Paris is dead. No country can unilaterally end the agreement.“It was a watershed, to use the prime minister’s term yesterday, because more than 190 different countries adopted the agreement and now we are going ahead and implementing domestic policies to meet those emission reduction targets.”Frydenberg said it would take the US four years to pull out of the agreement.He said Australia would want to see the US “at the table”, given that the US was an important partner and emitted 16% of the world emissions.World leaders are meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, to decide the global rules towards achieving net zero emissions.The goal was set in train by the Paris agreement in December, which produced commitments for all countries to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of limiting global warming to between 1.5C and 2C.Paris climate deal thrown into uncertainty by US election result Climate groups have been critical of the Coalition’s emissions reduction fund, which is the centrepiece of the Coalition’s climate policy and has set aside $2.5bn to pay polluters to pollute less.In May the Clean Energy Regulator announced the results of its third emissions reduction fund auction. It revealed the government had spent two-thirds of its emissions reduction fund but had achieved only 7% of the emissions cuts it would need to reach its 2030 target, according to analysts.Frydenberg said there was still $100m to spend in the emissions reduction fund and another auction was due this month.“We have a suite of mechanisms in order to meet that [Paris] target,” Frydenberg said. “That includes the emissions reduction fund, which has been very successful to date with the cost of abatement at about $12.10 a tonne. “Our renewable energy target as well as our national energy productivity plan, which is aiming to boost the efficiency of energy use by 40% by 2030.“We are very confident, as we have beaten our first Kyoto target and we are on track to beat our 2020 target, that we will meet our 2030 target with the suite of mechanisms we have if place, together with the review we will conduct next year.”
