The winner: Don’t BreatheWith Sausage Party retaining the top spot at the UK box office, several new releases battled for second place. Honours go to Ben-Hur, with £1.05m from 509 cinemas, but that number includes Wednesday and Thursday previews totalling £265,000. Strip those out, and Ben-Hur’s tally falls to £783,000. Don’t Breathe earned all its £1.03m opening number from the three-day weekend period.Don’t Breathe is shaping up to be highly profitable. Production budget is a reported $10m, and the film has already grossed $67m in the US. The UK opening number isn’t anything special – Warners’ Lights Out debuted a few weeks ago with £1.13m – and was probably hit by the sunny weather on Sunday. On the other hand, rain on Saturday gave all films a boost.The loser: Ben-Hur   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Ben-Hur trailer: Roman epic gets a greenscreen rebootBen-Hur’s weekend takings of £783,000 would have put it in fifth place for the weekend period, behind Sausage Party, Don’t Breathe, Bad Moms and Kubo and the Two Strings. Production budget is a reported $100m.Even if previews are added to Ben-Hur’s opening tally, 56 films have opened bigger in the UK so far in 2016, and its box office is far from the blockbuster numbers it needs to achieve profitability. US box office is a calamitous $26m so far, but foreign is helping to stem the losses, with decent numbers in Brazil and Mexico.Laika dips with Kubo   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest September has traditionally been Universal’s favoured slot for a Laika animation, with Kubo and the Two Strings following the pattern set in 2012 by ParaNorman and in 2014 by The Boxtrolls. (Coraline, in 2009, was a May release in the UK.) Kids are back at school, and competition from other family films is less intense. ParaNorman debuted with £1.39m, and The Boxtrolls with £1.31m plus £689,000 in previews. Coraline was even stronger, beginning with £1.56m plus £872,000 in previews. Kubo falls below these earlier Laika hits, with a debut of £844,000 from 520 cinemas.Bad Moms and David Brent: a tale of two comedies   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  David Brent: Life on the Road trailerWith third-weekend takings of £898,000, Bad Moms falls just 22%, the smallest decline of any film in the Top 10. This follows a drop of just 5% in the previous session. Compare that with the performance of David Brent: Life on the Road, which has been on release one week longer, and has fallen by 65%, 63% and now 82%. You’d expect bigger drops for a film based on a familiar character, as fans will tend to rush out and see it in the first week of release. Still, Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa achieved a final box office of £6.17m, after a debut of £1.43m plus previews – a multiple of 4.3 times its opening. David Brent kicked off with £1.45m plus negligible previews, and is looking set for a lifetime total of about £3.7m – a multiple of just 2.6 times the opening number. Bad Moms (£5.74m so far) is an interesting case in that the film was not glowingly reviewed but is winning UK audiences. While comedy Sausage Party is providing some competition, Bad Moms faces more of a challenge with the arrival this week of the female-skewing Bridget Jones’s Baby. Julieta cracks £1m   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest In 2015, for the first time in many years, no non-Bollywood foreign language film earned £1m at the UK box office; top title was Argentina’s Wild Tales, with £728,000. That result provoked plenty of gloomy analysis of the seemingly beleaguered foreign-language sector. So the arthouse realm will take cheer from the fact that Julieta has now passed £1m – the first non-Bollywood foreign-language film to do so since The Raid 2 in 2014.With £1.08m including Monday’s takings, Julieta is neck and neck with The Raid 2, and has overtaken 2013’s The Great Beauty. This means it is set to be the UK’s biggest-grossing non-Bollywood foreign language film since the French mismatched-buddy comedy Untouchable, in September 2012 (£2.04m).Hell or High Water is director’s biggest debut   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Over 14 years, director David Mackenzie has delivered pictures admired to greater (Young Adam, Hallam Foe) and lesser (Spread, You Instead) degrees. But box office success has tended to elude him. In 2014, Starred Up brought a commercial breakthrough, achieving UK cinema takings of just over £1.5m, following a debut of £495,000 (including £17,000 previews) from 316 cinemas.Now the critically admired Hell or High Water, starring Chris Pine, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges, raises the bar again, starting its UK run with £552,000 (including £36,000 previews) from 264 cinemas. Hell or High Water faced direct competition from Captain Fantastic and Anthropoid, two films that similarly straddled the indie/commercial divide. Anthropoid, which began with £228,000 (including £7,000 previews) from 132 cinemas, delivered by far the biggest box office so far for director Sean Ellis (Metro Manila). Captain Fantastic, with a tighter release at 105 carefully selected venues, achieved the highest screen average of the three films, with £2,092 (if previews of £61,000 are excluded from its £281,000 total).Nick Cave documentary burns brightly   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Initially conceived as a filmed performance of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds’ new album Skeleton Tree, One More Time With Feeling was originally set to play cinemas only on September 8, the day before the record’s release. The creative evolution of the film under Andrew Dominik’s direction, and acclaim at the Venice film festival, helped the picture achieve significant encore showings over the weekend. Total box office for the four days is £343,000 in the UK, and $1.7m across the globe.The future   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  The Beatles: Eight Days a Week - The Touring Years: exclusive clip – videoLargely due to the underperformance of Ben-Hur, takings are 29% down on the equivalent session from 2015, when a double ration of Tom Hardy in Legend led the box office charge. This ends a nine-week run where box office was either ahead or level with the 2015 equivalent weekends. Cinema bookers are now hoping that the arrival of two belated sequels – Bridget Jones’s Baby and Blair Witch – can remedy the situation this weekend. Alternatives include Bryan Cranston in crime thriller The Infiltrator and the widely admired New Zealand comedy Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Thursday sees several hundred cinemas nationwide play the Ron Howard-directed The Beatles: Eight Days a Week – The Touring Years, followed by a more focused full release from Friday.Top 10 films, 9-11 September1.
