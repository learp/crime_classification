Earlier this month, a group of Canadian uniformed officials descended on a roadside lemonade stand with flashing lights and bureaucratic frowns, because the owners – Ottawan siblings Adela and Eliza Andrews, aged five and seven respectively – had failed to secure a permit. Ottawa’s been known as the city that fun forgot since the late 1960s and this sorry tale only reinforces that reputation. Who in their right minds sees two kids in pink sundresses – all gappy smiles and floppy hats – selling pop they’ve made themselves, and doesn’t promptly pull up a chair and have a glass? That Canadian National Capital Commission’s gloomy outlook on life in general notwithstanding, homemade soft drinks are a marker of happy times. We urge you to get muddling.The winning recipe: Mandarin-basil shrubI love that this is called a shrub. I love that it requires vinegar. And I love that ColonialCravings has opted for the unexpected citrus, and the unsuspecting herb.Serves 10-12For the shrub2 mandarins20g basil leaves100g sugar120ml white wine vinegarFor the cooler40g demerara sugar120g basil leaves plus extra small leaves, to garnish1.5-1.7 litres cold soda water, to tasteA few slices of mandarin (optional)1 To make the shrub, remove the zest from the mandarins, trying to keep the amount of white pith to a minimum. Muddle the zest thoroughly with the basil and the sugar before covering and leaving it for 1 hour (this allows the sugar to extract the citrus oils from the zest).2 Squeeze the juice from the fruit and combine it with the oily sugar mix and vinegar. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then strain the liquid into a clean jar and give it a good shake. Put the shrub in a cool, dark spot and leave it for a couple of days for the flavours to mellow and mingle together.3 When it is ready, store it in the fridge until you want to use it – the sugar and vinegar combined with the cold of the fridge should keep it fresh for a long time.4 To make the cooler, muddle the sugar with the basil in a jug. Add the shrub, then add the soda water slowly, so it keeps its fizz. Add a few slices of mandarin, if using. Serve in glasses with a garnish of small basil leaves.Spiced teaLouise Johnson’s chai syrup stirred into a cup of cold milk is all kinds of excellent: warm, creamy, sweet and cool, all at once.Makes 250ml 500ml water4 black tea bags 3 cardamom pods6 cloves1 tsp fennel seeds225g caster sugar1 Bring the water to the boil in a saucepan, add the teabags and spices, then simmer for 5 minutes.2 Take the teabags out and throw them away, then add the sugar. Turn up the heat and boil until the syrup is reduced by half. Cool, then strain out the spices. The syrup keeps for a couple of weeks in the fridge.3 Dilute the syrup with water to taste, but start with 1 in 10 or weaker – it’s strongly flavoured.Grapefruit crushNatascha Leonie sometimes uses this as a mixer for vodka or gin, but I found the bitterness of the grapefruit, the heat of the chilli and the absence of any added sugar to round out the flavours made for quite enough of a buzz.Serves 2-4Juice of 1 grapefruitA handful of crushed ice1 chilli, finely slicedA few mint leaves1 Blend the grapefruit juice with crushed ice, the chilli and a few mint leaves, then serve.Plum and ginger muddleSuch a pretty tumbler, Anna Thomson, and such delicate flavours. This is one to drink by the gallon. To make your own plum syrup, boil some plums in a little water until mushy (about 20 minutes) then strain in a colander overnight. Measure the resulting juice and add the same volume of sugar (plus 1 tsp of lemon juice for every cup of juice) and bring to the boil, then set aside to cool.Makes 1 litre2 ginger tea bags500ml boiling water2 ripe plums2cm knob of ginger, gratedIce1-2 tbsp plum syrup500ml sparkling waterMint leaves and slices of ginger, to garnish1 Infuse the ginger tea in 500ml boiling water, then leave to cool completely.2 Slice the plums and muddle in the grated ginger.3 Add some ice to a jug with the plums (keep the grated ginger bits or strain them out later, if preferred). Pour the tea over the top.4 Sweeten to taste with the plum syrup, and top up with sparkling water.5 Garnish with mint leaves and slices of ginger.Cherry fizzI know this was meant to be a soft-drink swap, but Rachel Kelly’s submission had me reaching for a bottle of bubbles. And what a fine drink it made – boldly sweetened and blushing like a secret.Serves 6350g cherries, pitted, 12 cherries reserved and frozen 175g caster sugar200ml water1 tbsp fresh ginger, finely chopped 1 bottle of sparkling mineral water (or sparkling wine), chilled1 Blitz the pitted cherries in a food processor until coarsely chopped.2 Add them to a saucepan along with the sugar, water and ginger. Heat and stir until the sugar has dissolved, then bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool a little, then blend again in the food processor. Strain to remove any stringy bits, then set aside to cool.3 To serve, divide the cherry syrup among 6 glasses. Top up with chilled mineral water (or sparkling wine). Serve immediately, topped with a couple of frozen cherries.Orange watermelon freezeExactly as sweet and as satisfactory as Jan Costea’s wonderfully concise list of ingredients suggests.Serves 2-4 225g watermelon cubes, frozen120ml orange juice, freshly squeezed 2 tbsp honeyA splash of orange juice and caster sugar, for decorating the glasses1 Blend ingredients in a blender until smooth. Pour into a glass rimmed with sugar (dip the rim of the glass into orange juice, then into caster sugar). Lime sodaLaCoccinelle rustled up a 1950s Egyptian childhood memory with this handmade pop. I found that this much lime zest made it a little too bitter, so I added some honey. You might prefer to simply up the sugar content.Serves 4-6Juice and zest of 8 limes, plus 1 lime, thinly sliced25g sugar, or more to taste1 litre soda or sparkling water1 Heat the juice, zest and sugar together – without boiling – until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat, add the water and set aside to cool in the fridge.2 Serve over ice with slices of lime or with ice-cream.Tropical coolerTynegal’s cooler makes a delicious breakfast drink – pink and perky.Serves 2-4500ml pineapple juice100ml coconut milk2 ripe apricotsA handful of strawberries1 Whizz everything together in a blender and serve over ice-cubes.
