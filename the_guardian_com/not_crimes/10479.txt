And so to a new occasional series “You’re A What Now?”, wherein we celebrate new career directions for unlikely celebrities.Typically, this sort of thing involves the children of models becoming the face of a marshmallow concierge firm or something. This week, however, our featured player is Duchess Fergie, who explains of a businessman with whom she is frequently seen: “I’m the ambassador for his new lifestyle app.”What a hire! Admittedly, there are those who might regard Fergie as a slightly eccentric choice as a lifestyle ambassador. But consider the evidence: she lives in a £13m chalet in Switzerland, keeps a flat in London’s eye-wateringly expensive Eaton Square, and jets around the globe from party to party despite owing money all over town. Is there any greater testament to digital democracy than the knowledge that all this is now available via the App Store?
