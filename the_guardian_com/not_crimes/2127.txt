 Standing at the viewpoint, we overlooked the inner Dornoch Firth and then to the west the distant Kyle of Sutherland. The Struie road runs south from where we stood to the Cromarty Firth and is one of the old drove routes coming down from Sutherland and Caithness. No doubt the drovers and their cattle would have rested in the shelter and mild conditions of the low ground. The way ahead was over high ground of open moorland with little shelter for man or beast.In such wild terrain the dogs would have earned their keep in stopping the cattle from straying. Straying cattle were a major problem for the drovers. In this part of Easter Ross there were relatively rich, cultivated farms, and as late as 1831 some drovers refused to go this far in the north-east, because the landowners were renowned for confiscating any cattle that strayed off the recognised drove roads.The Highland cattle would have been smaller than their modern counterparts and mostly black. Some drovers had a Highland pony although these were mainly used as a pack animal rather than to ride. The drovers had one advantage over this part of their long journey to the mart or tryst at Muir of Ord just north of Inverness: the roads this far north would not have been hard until they went south of Inverness and then the cattle would need cattle shoes.The journey between the two firths was a long one, although there was a drovers' inn, the Aultnamain Inn, about half way along. The cattle would have needed a nightly resting point and the Drove Stance is still marked on the current Ordnance Survey map. We stopped to look at the stance, which is a narrow strip of land with shelter on two sides. The cattle would have been restless, perhaps homesick, and the men would take it in turns to guard them through the night.
