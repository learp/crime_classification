Author and poet Marcus Clarke defined a certain type of Australian culture back in 1869: “They are not a nation of snobs like the English or of extravagant boasters like the Americans or of reckless profligates like the French, they are simply a nation of drunkards.”Certainly, there’s evidence to suggest that Clarke’s analysis has some contemporary currency. Despite the NSW premier, Mike Baird’s, energetic efforts to impose restrictions on the drinking habits of our nation’s first colonial settlement, a culture of boozing remains vibrantly alive across the continent. I have written elsewhere of Australia’s negative achievement in this arena; as of last year, alcohol abuse was killing 15 people and hospitalising a further 430 each day, and was categorised as one of “the more prominent health risks” faced by the community, in the short and long term, by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.But while “Casino Mike” pursues a kind of East Coast puritanism – prohibiting takeaway alcohol sales after 10pm, barring patrons from entering venues after 1:30am, and enforcing a last call at 3am – a more organic reaction to Australia’s drinking culture may be evolving in an equal-and-opposite response, without heavy-handed interference or authoritarian instruction.

Photograph: Simon ShiffI refer to the delightful emergence of Australia’s tea culture, in vibrant and visible display at last weekend’s inaugural Melbourne Tea festival, where 53 stallholders took over the Melbourne Conference and Exhibition Centre, catering to more than 4,200 ticket buyers.The festival is actually a Sydney export, started in 2014 in partnership between Perfect South – a green tea specialist company – and the Rabbit Hole Organic Tea Bar, based in Sydney’s Redfern. Both businesses are booming, their wares popular with customers who’ve perhaps refined their tea palate through years of shopping at T2. Unsurprisingly, T2 is among the stallholders at the festival as well. It’s likely the now-internationally successful chain was the first indication that there was something steeping in the water of the Australian beverage market; beginning in a colourful shopfront in Melbourne’s Fitzroy, the creative collaboration between two friends who’d initially planned to open a homewares store has been retailing a rainbow of different boxed brews for 20 years now. Recently sold to multinational Unilever for an undisclosed but plainly comfortable sum, T2 now employs more than 700 staff worldwide, and is franchised in New Zealand, the UK and US. Even for those who grew up in tea-drinking families like mine, the idea that the Australian retailing of tea would extend beyond a bagged Bushell’s or Lipton – or the rare treat of a Twinings – into a competitive international market of boutique tea blending marks a most visual cultural shift.Darjeeling by Jeff Koehler review – a history of the world’s best tea At the tea festival, the diversity that can dazzle on the shelves at T2 is far superseded by the offerings of many other tea vendors. As a tea fanatic, the tasting bowl I’m given with my admission ticket is rapidly coated with the flavours of tea diversity; five chai vendors offer variations, from a turmeric-based health chai to the enterprising brewer of Chai-Walli, whose personal blend of the traditional Indian tea she infuses beyond tasty cups into (delicious) doughnuts and candles. An organic herbal blend from Oovio is so rich with berry flavours a sip tastes like French-kissing a liquid blueberry. Mass-market vendors Madame Flavour engage an act of marketing genius by including a sample of their “Paris Afternoon Blend” – single-origin Keemun blend infused with vanilla and rose petals – in the festival goody-bag. As a tea connoisseur, I’m forced to admit it’s delicious.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Tell your oolongs from your matchas: tasting notes from a tea appreciation workshop. Photograph: Van Badham for the GuardianAnd just in case you can’t tell your oolongs from your matchas, the festival runs workshops in tea appreciation all day. My tasting notes from a session with Rabbit Hole’s impassioned owner Amara Jarratt are heavy with her specific instructions for temperature rates and brewing times, alongside verdicts of “delightful!”, “delicious!”, “amazing!” after a procession of samples from white tea through oolong, Japanese and China greens ,as well as gorgeous black blends. It’s interesting to compare, too, the Australian state cultures that inform the tea vendor’s offerings. Jarratt retails her Sydney tea bar with the enthusiasm of a high-end sommelier. Hannah Dupree from Melbourne’s Storm in a Teacup imports her speciality blends to a bespoke space in Northcote, where she’s available to chat you through her passions on a drop-in basis on Wednesdays. Former scientist Samantha Brown, from Tasmania’s Art of Tea, sells blends mixed with the juicy produce of her home state from a stall in the Salamanca markets, and bespoke varieties at the Museum of Old and New Art.The day-long tea adventure is so intoxicating, I’m in something of my cups when I burn far past my budget and leave with my army laden with new teas and samples. It makes me think; maybe instead of persecuting the denizens of Sydney’s booze bars, Casino Mike could champion the lifestyle alternative offered at the Tea festival instead? There’s one coming up at Carriageworks in Sydney on 21 August, for a start.It would be great for New South Wales if its premier could take a moment to be stirred by the reflective persuasion of some good steamy tannins. I’m not the first to suggest the man may need a cup of tea and a good lie down. • Sydney Tea festival will be held at Carriageworks on 21 August
