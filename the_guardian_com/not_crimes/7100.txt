The spacecraft used by Tim Peake on his journey to and from the International Space Station is to go on display at London’s Science Museum.The Soyuz TMA-M that launched the British astronaut into orbit in December 2015 and returned him to Earth in June will be put on show for the public from early next year.The capsule, which has been refurbished but was singed by the heat of re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere, will join other exhibits charting the history of space exploration.Among them is the suit worn by the first Briton in space, Helen Sharman, during her mission to the Mir space station in 1991.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Astronaut Tim Peake says return to Earth ‘like world’s worst hangover’The museum bought the Soyuz craft from its Russian manufacturer, Energia, for an undisclosed fee. Peake is said to be absolutely delighted.“Hopefully it may act as an inspiration for the next generation of scientists and engineers,” he told BBC News.“Flying into space is a huge privilege, but it also comes with risk and one of the highest risk areas are launch into space and re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere.“The Soyuz spacecraft is designed to protect the crew from these harsh conditions. So you get very attached to your spacecraft, because it definitely does save your life.”Sharman said it was significant that people would see the capsule Peake travelled in, rather than a lifelike model or similar spacecraft.“I think it is a tremendous thing to have Tim’s capsule,” she told the BBC. “Not just a Soyuz capsule, but it is Tim’s. And the fact that we know that our astronaut was actually inside it – he physically sweated inside that suit, he looked outside of that window and saw what it was like to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere – it really provides us with the link to our own astronauts.”Ian Blatchford, the chief executive of the Science Museum Group, said he hoped the acquisition would help inspire future generations.“It is a great honour to ... officially acquire the first flown human spacecraft in the Science Museum Group collection, one which allowed Tim Peake to make his historic journey to the International Space Station, which we plan to share with the public,” he said.Peake came back from the International Space Station onboard the Soyuz capsule with his crewmates, Tim Kopra of Nasa and the Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko.The seven-hour return journey, during which the exterior of the capsule heated up to 1,600C (2,900F) as it travelled through the Earth’s atmosphere, ended after the Soyuz opened its red and white striped main parachute and landed on the Kazakhstan steppe.
