7.56pm BST19:56So that’s IT for another Strictly week! Thank you as ever for your brilliant comments, they make my week. I’ll be back next week for the HALLOWEEN SPECIAL, so join me at 6.45pm next Saturday and we’ll get our freak on. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, so come and say hi. Have a brilliant week!

Just as it should be.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.53pm BST19:53Craig saves Daisy and Aljaz, as does Darcey. Bruno does likewise, and Len would have done the same. So LESLEY AND ANTON are going home.Ah, I’m sorry to see Lesley go, she was incredible. But she didn’t have the best of weeks and was never going to survive a dance-off against Daisy and Aljaz.

The timing on this looks better too, but still a bit lacklustre for my liking. I suspect they’ve done more than enough, however.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.48pm BST19:48But first we have to get through another round of Mystic Meg and Rupert The Bear do the Tango. Lesley’s footwork looks considerably better, but she’s still wearing her shoulders as earmuffs. A big improvement, however.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.46pm BST19:46See this is the problem with the Dance Off – you have to see through the two dances you enjoyed least. I’m going to watch Daisy and Aljaz’s Charleston carefully, as I didn’t think it was all that, but the judges really enjoyed it.

I’m already over it.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.42pm BST19:42Crikey, the Ed Balls train has got up a head of steam – how high up the public vote must he have been to beat Daisy and Aljaz? I can’t actually answer that as my maths is terrible, but I’m guessing he must have been pretty near the top. He’ll stay until Halloween, and then the backlash will begin, happens every year.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.42pm BST19:42So who is joining Lesley and Anton in tonight’s bottom two? Ed and Katya are safe! Goodness me. They’re joined next week by Danny and Oti, Anastacia and Gorka (YAY GORKA) and Greg and Natalie!Which means DAISY AND ALJAZ are in the bottom two! Bye Lesley, we loved you very much.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.38pm BST19:38YES I KNEW IT WAS LEANN RIMES I WAS MAKING A FUNNY.
