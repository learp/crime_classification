The king is back, and this time he’s got a backstory. Kong: Skull Island is the unexpected addition to the giant ape saga that began in 1933 with the classic monster movie King Kong, then returned in 1976 with the Dino De Laurentiis-produced remake and more recently took the form of Peter Jackson’s lovingly made 2005 iteration. But iconic franchises never truly die in Hollywood, and it was only a matter of time before we got another look at the colossal beast.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  ‘Man is not infallible’: Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L Jackson on Kong: Skull IslandThis being 2017, Kong: Skull Island delves deep into monster monkey mythos, adding a Ben Gunn figure (John C Reilly) who has been living on the island for 25 years and knows all about its terrifying ecosystem. It’s an approach that has paid off with some critics, with Jordan Vogt-Roberts’ monster epic having picked up an impressive 82% “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes – though UK reviewers have been less kind. So which is it? Here’s a chance to give your verdict on the movie’s key talking points:The Vietnam-era setting and uneven toneJackson’s remake restored the action to the original 1930s setting, while the 1976 version was set in the contemporary period. Riffing off the latter, Vogt-Roberts chooses to imagine humans’ first visit to Skull Island taking place against a Vietnam war backdrop, with scientists and journalists accompanied by jaded US troops taking a detour on their way home. If the aim was to add a dose of realism by bookending the fantastical action scenes with old-school newsreel-style footage, the ploy half works. But it also adds to the generally uneven tone: one minute we’re being cuddled up in a warm blanket of nostalgia, the next Vogt-Roberts seems to be adopting a B-movie approach – playing the admittedly camp material for laughs. The movie riffs heavily on Apocalypse Now in its depiction of an exotic wilderness riven by fire and desperate men, yet lacks the searing authenticity of Francis Ford Coppola’s sublime war movie.Welcome to Skull Island: on set with Tom Hiddleston and the biggest King Kong ever The cast appear equally confused. Bar a few early scenes in which his role as the villain of the piece is firmly signposted, Samuel L Jackson is in full Snakes on a Plane mode, while Reilly’s turn as the last survivor of a previous landing on the island seems like it belongs in a Will Ferrell comedy. Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston take things much more seriously, the latter adopting a tough former armed forces persona that’s almost indistinguishable from the role he played in The Night Manager. Still, the impressive ensemble – the excellent John Goodman also deserves a mention – do a decent job with lightweight material, wouldn’t you agree?

But the new movie vastly expands the scale of the ape’s home, a churning maelstrom of giant CGI beasts with Kong sitting pretty at the top of the food chain. Hats off to Industrial Light & Magic for the remarkable effects: I loved the huge arachnid, its spear-like legs camouflaged by its bamboo feeding ground. But does this really feel like a King Kong movie when we never get to see the giant ape in New York, scrambling across Manhattan skyscrapers while batting helicopters out of the sky?The shonky plottingThere is always one character in King Kong movies who demonstrates the worst of humanity, illustrating our fear of nature and the sense that we might not, after all, be the Earth’s alpha male species. Presenting Jackson’s Colonel Packard as an emblem of America’s post-Vietnam bitterness certainly helps move the plot forward, as well as ensuring a level of titanium-strength scenery-chewing not seen since Nicolas Cage met the bees. But do you buy Packard’s Colonel Kurtz-like refusal to accept defeat?Kong: Skull Island review – only de-evolution can explain this zestless mashup Critical matters: The transatlantic splitWhy has Kong: Skull Island found so much more approval in the US than the UK? Is there something about these big franchise movies that’s quintessentially American? “Run for your lives! It’s a 700ft turkey, making squawking and gobbling noises and preparing to lay a gigantic egg,” says the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw in his one-star review, while Little White Lies’ Adam Woodward, GQ’s Helen O’Hara and the Independent’s Clarisse Loughrey are among the other British critics lining up to take aim. Are they being harsh, or were you also distinctly underwhelmed?Kong v GodzillaWhat are we to make of the potential for Skull Island to help spin off yet another Hollywood cinematic universe, this time based on Legendary’s King Kong and Godzilla movies? Surely neither Gareth Edwards’ middling 2014 reprise for Toho’s giant radioactive lizard nor Vogt-Roberts’ film, are quite on a par with the first Iron Man movie or Star Wars: The Force Awakens as saga-building party starters? And is Kong really Kong if he makes it to the end credits to fight another day rather than suffering a tragic demise as a symbol of humankind’s destructive impulse to conquer nature? Hollywood doesn’t have a great track record so far for “versus” movies: last year’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was notoriously badly received, and ended up winning four Razzies. Godzilla and Kong have both been heroic figures in their most recent big-screen adventures, which ought to make deciding who’s going to be the villain of the piece an interesting creative fandango. At the very least, wouldn’t you agree these films need to embrace their B-movie roots a little more enthusiastically if Godzilla v Kong is to roar its way to victory at the multiplexes?
