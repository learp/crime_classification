Police are appealing for information following the discovery of the body of a man who went missing after last weekend’s T in the Park festival in Perthshire, Scotland.Police Scotland said the body of James Richardson, 29, was found near Forteviot on Tuesday morning, and the death was being treated as unexplained.The father of three had not been heard from since he got off a bus leaving the Strathallan Castle festival site on Monday to smoke a cigarette and failed to get back onboard. Officers are appealing for information from anyone who may have seen a man wearing a grey waterproof Regatta jacket, red shorts and black work boots near Forteviot between 2.15pm on Monday and 9.15am on Tuesday to contact Police Scotland on 101. Police are continuing their inquiries into the possibly drug-related deaths of two teenagers and an alleged rape at Scotland’s biggest music festival.Music fans leaving the festival on Monday were warned that a number of potentially toxic green Rolex-type pills had been recovered at the festival and that others may be in circulation.In 2013 the green pills – some of which were found to contain the dangerous stimulant para-methoxyamphetamine, known as PMA – were linked to 15 deaths across Scotland and Northern Ireland.Police Scotland said there was no evidence to link the pills, which are stamped with the distinctive Rolex crown, to the deaths of two 17-year-olds at the campsite on Friday.The families of the two victims spoke of their losses on Wednesday. Police Scotland can confirm that the two teenagers who died at T in the Park are Megan Bell, aged 17, from Sunderland and Peter McCallum, aged 17, from Lochgilphead.The deaths are not being treated as suspicious and a report on the circumstances has been sent to the procurator fiscal.The family of Peter McCallum said that he was a “kind and caring brother and son”, as well as a talented singer who had ambitions to become an architect.“We hope that people, especially the younger members of society, learn a lesson from Peter’s death and that they don’t put their families through the devastation we are experiencing just now.”The family of Megan Bell described their devastation at their loss. “Her death leaves an irreplaceable gap in our lives and she will be so sadly missed by all her family and friends.”
