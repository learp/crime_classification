Despite claims by its director, Michael Bay, that it has “no political agenda”, Libyan-set military thriller 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is being marketed specifically to rightwing audiences, it has emerged.According to the Hollywood Reporter, distributor Paramount has targeted its promotional efforts for the film towards conservative-leaning media outlets, as well as favouring “red state” audiences for previews and special screenings.13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi review – Michael Bay plays politico for the Fox News crowd 13 Hours follows events surrounding attacks in Benghazi in 2013, which resulted in the death of the US ambassador to Libya, as well as another diplomat and two US security contractors. The incident has been a focus of controversy as Republicans have used a congressional select committee to attempt to embarrass Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the attack. The Guardian’s review described the movie as “fuelled by paranoia and hate” and having a “not-very-subtle screenplay where Fox News viewers are cued to hiss at a phantom Hillary Rodham Clinton”.Evidence of the political nature of the film’s publicity includes a sponsored blog by the National Review’s publisher Jack Fowler, in which he describes 13 Hours as “awesome” and says that he “can’t wait to see it again, with my friends, and my sons”; an exclusive interview with the film’s lead, John Krasinski for the conservative Townhall.com, and a TV ad that ran on Fox News straight after President Obama’s State of the Union address.

This film has those same elements of military heroism – elements that appeal to a conservative audience.”13 Hours had its premiere at the Texas stadium that is home to the Dallas Cowboys football team, with the so-called “patriotic rock” act Madison Rising among the supporting acts, and preview screenings on military bases have been scheduled. “Conservative and military tend to have a significant overlap,” Moore said.The film is attempting to replicate the impact of American Sniper, which opened at Christmas 2014, but began its unexpectedly stellar box-office run after going on wide release on 16 January 2o15, the Martin Luther King holiday weekend. 13 Hours is being released on the same weekend this year.
