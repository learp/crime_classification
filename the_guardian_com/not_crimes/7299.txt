I’ve always been a clothes horse, and I spend a lot of money on designers. Over the years, I’ve veered from Vivienne Westwood to Marc Jacobs, but more recently I’ve spent all my money on the Swedish brand Our Legacy. I wear only black: I like nice fabrics, but I don’t like to be too showy. I find clothes fascinating. It’s a bit of a private hobby, because there is a stigma attached to an interest in fashion.I see clothes as an art form, and also a statement: no matter how vociferously people protest that they don’t care what they wear, they sort of have to. There has to be a decision in the morning (or, in my case, the night before). I always plan what I’m going to wear, although I hope my clothes say that I look really good and I’ve not thought about it! Ironing is part of the preparation, so I don’t mind it.Joanna Lumley: ‘I like a bright lipstick in a “Patsy red”’ I won’t leave the house without having a shower and, as much as it makes me a terrible anti-conservationist, I often have two a day. My hair is short and neat, brushed to the side and fixed with hairspray. I’m usually clean-shaven, but if I’m doing errands or writing I might have some sort of beard.I use the Benefit Porefessional range on my face. I had acne from the age of 22 to 24 and was on Roaccutane, which left my skin quite sensitive. My default skin tone is pink, so anything to reduce that is good. The range is aimed at women, so I pretend it’s for someone else. I heard that Beyoncé uses Porefessional all over her body. It comes in tiny tubes because you’re only supposed to use it on your face, so she must have vats of the stuff.• Horne stars in Agatha Raisin, which is available on DVD from 1 August
