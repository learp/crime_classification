At 15 I was reasonably good at squash – borderline county standard. But at that age other things took over and I did no sport for the next 32 years. Suddenly I was in my late 40s and overweight. There’s a history of heart disease in my family, so I thought I had to do something about it. I couldn’t face the idea of a gym, and squash meant not having to start from scratch, so I picked it up again. I don’t think I’ll be as good as when I was 15, but 10 months in, I’m 90% there.Squash is a racket sport played in an enclosed court. You’re attempting to hit the ball against the wall in front of you in such a way that your opponent isn’t able to hit it back. The fact that there are four walls makes it easier to get to a reasonable standard than something like tennis, because the ball isn’t going out of court, but bouncing back to you. And the contact with the ball – the thwack of it – is a satisfying sensation. You usually play the best of five games, which lasts about 40 minutes. That’s a good workout.I’ve spent almost 30 years doing a sedentary job, so it’s not surprising that the first time I played I couldn’t get out of bed the next day. That’s not an exaggeration – I actually couldn’t straighten my legs. Squash is a vigorous sport. The court is bigger than it looks and you’re moving constantly, from front to back, back to front. It’s like doing a series of repeat sprints. It uses all your muscle groups. Physically, I’ve totally changed. In the first three months I lost about a stone; I’m now down to the weight I was when I was 21, and feel fantastic.The psychological effect has been even more profound. It invigorates me. I feel brighter, sleep better and am enjoying my work more. I think I’m delaying the ageing process, too. I’ll play against people who are 20 years younger than me and good; I’m just really pleased to be able to play at that level. I don’t feel there’s any reason to stop. I’m hoping that I can keep going until I’m 70.My weekend workoutHow often do you play? Three times a week, for an hour and a half each time.Favourite shot? A backhand drive to the back of the court: you hit it hard and straight.Five ways to get started1 From leisure centres and members’ clubs to schools and universities, there are thousands of squash courts all over the country. To find your nearest facility, use the court finder tool on the England Squash website.2 Don’t worry if you don’t have any squash-playing friends: box leagues and other more informal beginners’ sessions offered by clubs will connect you to players of a similar ability. It’s a sociable sport.3 Most squash centres will have rackets and balls for hire for a nominal fee. Wear standard gym or sports kit, and a pair of trainers with non-marking soles.4 The “double dot” balls used by the pros are small and don’t bounce much. If you want long rallies (which are more fun and better for fitness) use a bigger, bouncier “blue max” ball.5 During play, try to position yourself on the T where the lines intersect in the middle of the court. Get to the ball as quickly as you can, then return to the T. These short, sharp movements are tiring but give you the best chance of winning.The essential kit      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   From left:Dunlop squash balls, £9.99, store.dunlopsport.com; Wilson Impact Pro 500 racket, £10.99, amazon.co.uk;Adidas Court Stabil 11 shoes, £65, pdhsports.com
