Mac played Gavroche in Les Misérables and took the part of Warner in the musical version of Legally Blonde at Leicester Curve. Stenson played Elle Woods in the West End production of Legally Blonde and Princess Fiona in Shrek the Musical.A statement said the Sleepless postponement was caused by an “illness within the producer’s family and overwhelming unexpected circumstances”.
