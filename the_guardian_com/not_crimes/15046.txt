Do you feel more sneezy after it has rained? Conventional wisdom suggests that rain showers bring a freshening influence: dampening down the dust and pollen in the air. But not all rain is so benign. Spring and summer rain can help to explode pollen grains, triggering “thunderclap asthma” for some.Now research shows that these rainy pollen bursts could also be responsible for bringing more rain.Allison Steiner, of the University of Michigan, and colleagues, soaked pollen from oak, pecan, birch, cedar and pine trees, along with ragweed, for an hour. They found that as soon as the pollen became wet it fell apart easily, making lots of tiny grains. Using an atomiser they sprayed the moist fragments into a cloud-making chamber, and discovered that the little particles attracted water and encouraged cloud droplets to form.“It’s possible that when trees emit pollen this makes clouds, which in turn makes rain, and that feeds back and influences the whole growth cycle of the plant,” said Steiner, who published the findings in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.It may well be beneficial for plants, but for the one in five people in the UK who suffer from hay fever the process brings added misery during the hay fever season (roughly March to September in the northern hemisphere).Rain showers help fill the air with miniscule particles, which irritate the lungs and make noses and eyes stream. And worse still, those particles encourage more rain, so the cycle is repeated. Right now it is oak, with a smattering of birch and ash pollen that is to blame.Kate Ravilious @katerav
