I would give this book 6/10. This story is about a boy who is sent to a wild school on an island and hates it!The boy is terrified of water, but in an attempt to escape the island, he has to learn how to swim and in doing so he makes friends with seal who looks after him. This is a story about friendship and nature. This is a sad story with a happy ending. I liked this book and would recommend it to kids aged 7-11.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book youâ€™ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
