Judging by Bad Habits, the first track to be released from second album Everything You’ve Come To Expect (out 1 April), Alex Turner and Miles Kane’s sort-of supergroup The Last Shadow Puppets are headed in an increasingly noirish, garage rock-based direction (perhaps in an effort to tie in with Turner’s sartorial leanings). They’re also heading out on tour for the first time since 2008 (26 Mar to 3 Apr, tour starts Usher Hall, Edinburgh) …More names have been revealed for this summer’s Reading and Leeds festivals. Alongside previously announced main stagers the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Disclosure and Foals will rotate headline duties on one of the other evenings; the mainly teen audience will also be treated to a set from author of crack-manufacturing anthems Fetty Wap (Richfield Avenue, Reading & Bramham Park, Leeds, 26 to 28 Aug) …In further festival news, Green Man has Belle And Sebastian, James Blake and Wild Beasts topping its bill (Glanusk Park, nr Crickhowell, 18 to 21 Aug) …While east London’s Lovebox plays host to LCD Soundsystem and Major Lazer (Victoria Park, E3, 15 & 16 Jul).
