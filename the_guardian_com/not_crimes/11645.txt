It's hot in the eastern United States. For those that live here, sweaty shirts and panting have become the norm. For those that don't, let me just tell you that for everyone, except air conditioning salespeople, it is a rather unpleasant experience. But just how hot is it?There have been no fewer than 40,113 high temperature records set or tied this year already, compared to only 5,835 low records. With more weather stations recording data than ever, that stat might be somewhat misleading, but a 7-to-1 ratio is quite striking. On average, the number of low and high temperatures should be equal.The past few weeks have been particularly toasty. Record high temperatures have not only been set in many cities for individual days, but also for months and even all-time. Elsewhere, many cities, such as Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina, have equalled their all-time records. The fact that these temperatures are being reached in June rather than the traditionally hotter months of July and August is also unusual.Along with the depth of the high temperature record breakers in individual cities, the extent of the heat – from the plains to the mid-west to the south to the mid-Atlantic to New England – is a relatively rare event.Here are 11 of the record temperatures:• Atlanta, Georgia: 106 degrees on 30 June, breaking all-time record of 105 degrees set in 1980• Nashville, Tennessee: 109 degrees on 19 June, breaking all-time record set in 1952 of 107 degrees• Knoxville, Tennessee: 105 degrees on 30 June, breaking all-time record set in 1930 of 104 degrees• Little Rock, Arkansas: 107 degrees on 28 June, breaking record for the month set in 1936, 1988 and 2012 of 105 degrees.• Washington, DC: 104 degrees on 29 June, breaking record for the month set in 1874 and 2011 of 102 degrees.• Burlington, Vermont: 95 degrees on 20 June, breaking daily [ie for the date] record set in 1988 of 94 degrees.• Chicago, Illinois: 103 degrees on 5 July, breaking daily record set in 1911 of 102 degrees.• Queens (La Guardia), New York: 98 degrees on 20 June, breaking daily record set in 1953 of 96 degrees.• St Louis, Missouri: 108 degrees on 29 June, breaking daily record set in 1952 of 104 degrees.• Toledo, Ohio: 103 degrees on 28 June, breaking daily record of 101 set in 1934.• Wilmington, Delaware: 95 degrees on 20 June, breaking daily record set in 1988 of 94 degrees.The record heat has many asking "why?". Some might says it's just the type of deviation you would expect to see every so often. Others might retort that it simply isn't normal for cities like Washington to equal a record for the most consecutive days over 95 degrees.This latter group would argue that this record heat is one of many signs that global warming isn't merely coming, but that it's already here. Most experts agree that while the current heat wave is "consistent" with what climate change might look like, it's tough to assign global warming to individual events.One question we can try to answer with some rigor is whether Americans believe that heat waves like the current one are because of climate change. The answer is yes.A March survey conducted by Yale University sought to determine whether or not Americans thought recent extreme weather phenomena had been affected by global warming. Some 69% of Americans said that they somewhat or strongly agreed that it was. From hurricane Irene to the heat waves of last summer to the warmth of this past winter, a majority of Americans agreed that global warming made these events worse.This data makes the following polling unsurprising: amajority of Americans want higher emission and pollution standards for business and industry, imposed mandatory controls on carbon dioxide emissions, and federal environmental standards enforced more thoroughly.But a different set of questions also trying to attain what Americans' true opinions on what's going on with our climate and what to do about it paints a different picture.A 2011 Pew poll asked Americans whether there is "solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not". Although 63% said that yes to this question, only 38% said that it was because of human activity, 18% said it was because of natural patterns, and 6% didn't know why. Meanwhile, 28% said that there was not solid evidence.What's more interesting is that the percentage of those ascribing climate change to human activity dropped from the upper 40s to 50% from 2006 to 2008 into the mid to upper 30s since 2009. The drop is driven by growing Republican skepticism of global warming. The percentage of Republicans claiming that news of global warming is exaggerated has risen in Gallup polls from the 50s from 2003 to 2008 to the upper 60s since 2009.What about the question that Americans wanted higher stricter and great enforcement of environmental standards? The answer is also different when framed in other terms.Back when the economy was strong in the last 1990s and 2000, 65% to 70% of Americans in Gallup polls believed that "protection of the environment should be given priority, even at the risk of curbing economic growth". That number has dropped significantly to the upper 30s to the low 50s from the mid 2000s to 2010. It seems that all Americans would like higher standards, but not at the risk of hurt to a weak economy.These numbers in their entirety help to explain why climate legislation has stalled in America. The message has become very muddled. Americans on average have little doubt that climate change is upon us, but they aren't agreeing on the exact cause. Because skepticism is concentrated mostly among Republicans, it gives one side of the political aisle reason to fight against greater regulation. The fact that the economy has been a weak state for a while has further aided Republican arguments against regulation.Will this summer's heat help to aid climate change legislation in Congress? I would be surprised. People's opinions haven't changed since 2009, despite some pretty phenomenal weather events. Americans who don't believe human activity is causing global warming will merely say that this summer's heat is either normal or just part of a natural cycle.
