She-Devils – ComeI found out about this duo from a friend of mine. They have four tracks out and I have been playing them all to death. I love it all, and hope there is an album soon.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Le Volume Courbe – The HouseThis is from Le Volume Courbe’s second album and it was my album of the year last year. A fantastic record which so much attention to detail. Very beautiful.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The Girobabies – Late Night SketchyI have known about this band for some years but they have suddenly jumped up a league with this record. Intelligent, funny and full of change. This is my favourite track from a very good album.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Charlie Hilton – PonyI do not know much about Charlie Hilton artist, but I am going to investigate her. This track reminds me of French guitar pop very much. I love that about it, plus the synths and guitars are used well!    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Jenny Lee – Boom BoomI like the fact this song is lead by the baseline. It makes sense as she is the bass player in Warpaint. I like the production, and while some of the bits are very clear I like that the drums feel rough and dirty.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest
