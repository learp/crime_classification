The recipeSet the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Wash a couple of large sweet potatoes, dry them and cut into thin slices. Lay the slices snugly on a baking sheet in a single layer. Brush the potatoes with a little olive oil and melted butter, and season lightly with salt. Bake the potato slices for 30 minutes then turn them over, return them to the oven and bake for a further 30 minutes or until they are golden and lightly crisp to the touch. They must be thoroughly tender – you should be able to effortlessly push a knife point through them.Season 250ml of soured cream with 2-4 tsp of harissa paste, tasting as you go. Add a little salt if necessary. Serve the sweet potato slices hot from the oven, with a spoonful of the harissa cream and a scattering of chives.The trickYou will need a large baking sheet. The potatoes need to be baked in one layer, not overlapping. Be generous with the oil and butter.The twistYou could do this with everyday baking potatoes instead. They will need an extra 15-20 minutes, if not more. Instead of the harissa and soured cream, use a mixture of herbs, parsley, tarragon and mint perhaps. Swap the soured cream for crème fraîche. They will also benefit from a second brushing with oil and butter.Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
