The forest receives over 13 million visitors a year. Its car parks take a pounding, and every winter some are closed for maintenance. We failed to check the closure programme and found ourselves parked at Tilery Road, a little distance from our intended starting point at Standing Hat.Our pace quickly slowed when the first earthtongue was spotted. These small, erect, black, oar-shaped fungi were dotted along the north-facing banks, emerging from the short turf every few inches. The largest did resemble a tongue and felt tackily waxy. Others, perhaps older, had a drier, granular surface. Clusters of yellow meadow coral fungi are almost hidden in the turf along the top of the bank. Vivid yellow waxcaps, few larger than a penny, provide bright spots of colour against the background of dark-hued grass and moss. In a drainage cleft, a swarm of tiny, orange-yellow fungal saucers decorate a dog's deposit. The close-cropped grassland is almost devoid of floral colour. Woody whiskers sprouting from the tops of hummocks are all that remains of the flowers that adorned the area in warmer months. These ancient mounds were formed through the intense grazing of purple moor grass. A few ground-hugging mauve scabious sheltering among them still offer insects a nectar refill.As we press on into the woodland beyond Standing Hat, the season's advance becomes all too visible. On one side, the conifers are booted in brown bracken and the larches shed needles with each passing breeze. On the other, most of the beeches have lost their leaves, exposing a squirrels' drey camouflaged during the breeding season. One beech has yet to catch up. Its green, yellow and rust tones create a patchwork of autumnal tints that light up as the sun catches them.
