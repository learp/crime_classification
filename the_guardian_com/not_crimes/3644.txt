The Jonathan Ross Show9.35pm, ITVGame Of Thrones’s Kit Harington brings his tousled locks to the last in this current series. He’ll be wanting to chat about his forthcoming turn as Marlowe’s antihero Dr Faustus in the West End, but there’s a crushing inevitability that the talk will soon turn to the situation of his Thrones character Jon Snow. Also on the couch tonight are former Brookside star Anna Friel, controversy-courting comic-turned-Guardian-columnist Frankie Boyle, and Tinie Tempah on the music duties. Ben ArnoldThe Voice UK7pm, BBC1It has been an above average year for The Voice in terms of both the singers and liveliness of the coaches, so these semi-finals should be worth a watch. After four sharp exits last week, only eight acts remain in the competition and they need to perform live with a solo number as well as singing with their coaches. Former Liberty X crooner Kevin has been one to watch from the start, but Jolan and Jordan will give him a run for his money. Viewers then vote on which four acts go through to the grand final. Hannah VerdierBeatrix Potter With Patricia Routledge8pm, Channel 4Actor Patricia Routledge, who has played Potter on stage, draws on artefacts in the V&A archive for a doc celebrating the children’s author. More than a century before Kindle, Potter was a successful self-publisher: having created Peter Rabbit to soothe a family friend’s ailing child, she screwed up her rejection letters from publishing houses and put the book out herself. She stayed in control after her death too, bequeathing swaths of the Lake District to the National Trust. Jack SealeYou’re Back In The Room8.30pm, ITVSaturday night’s strangest primetime distraction – an unsettling splice of The Generation Game and The Manchurian Candidate – continues. Pro mesmeriser Keith Barry puts five civilian contestants under before the cameras start rolling, enabling him to rewire their behaviour on the fly as they tackle a series of simple challenges in pursuit of a £25,000 prize. Smoothing over the most erratic behaviour is unflappable host Phillip Schofield, this week joined by superbike star Carl Fogarty and docile reality hunk Joey Essex. Graeme VirtueFollow The Money9pm, BBC4The Danish drama exploring financial crime and work/life balance continues. In the first hour, the engagingly flaky Mads and taciturn Alf take a trip to industrial Poland, following a lead from journalist Mia. In the second hour, their hunt continues. The fallout from the publication of Mia’s article is toxic indeed, and now the pair must try to locate her anonymous source. Over at Energreen, Sander’s day is ruined when Nicky shows up with a printout from the stolen iPad and a ransom demand. John RobinsonChic And Nile Rodgers: Jazz A Vienne9pm, Sky ArtsIf this isn’t the most joyous thing you’ll see on telly all day we’ll eat our berets. Living legend Nile Rodgers and his old band performs Chic’s greatest hits alongside those he produced for others, such as Sister Sledge’s Lost In Music and Duran Duran’s Notorious. If Bowie’s Let’s Dance suddenly pierces the heart (this was recorded in 2013), fear not; a scintillating Le Freak makes everything right again. Watch out for the little kid breakdancing to Good Times at the end. Ali Catterall  Pyramid scheme: Sid James and Amanda Barrie in Carry On Cleo Photograph: Allstar/ANGLO/Sportsphoto Ltd./AllstarFilm ChoiceCarry On Cleo(Gerald Thomas, 1964, 10.30am, ITV3The chirpy team knocked out this cheeky response to Joseph L Mankiewicz’s Egyptian epic, Cleopatra, in no time: a garden-shed version of the pyramids. Sid James is Mark Antony, Amanda Barrie the Queen of the Nile, and with Kenneth Williams’ Julius Caesar – who utters the immortal: “Infamy! Infamy! They’ve all got it in for me!” – this ranks as one of yer classic Carry Ons. Paul HowlettAlien(Ridley Scott, 1979), 9pm, Film4Ridley Scott’s gothic sci-fi horror, with its terrifying alien stalking the crew of the decrepit spaceship Nostromo, remains a nerve-shredding classic. Sigourney Weaver’s space-heroine Ripley became a screen icon, while HR Giger’s gloomy sets and the chest-busting alien itself are works of gruesome genius. Now, where’s that Alien 5 we keep hearing about?
