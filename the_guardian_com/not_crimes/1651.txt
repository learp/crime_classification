This should be a bumper year for the common frog rana temporaria. Every pond, ditch and other suitable breeding site is full of water after record rains, and the mild winter has helped survival rates.Most frog spawn has already been laid in the south of the UK but in the midlands and north the breeding season is still in full swing, and will go on for another few weeks.Although the frog is our most common amphibian a large part of the population has disappeared from the farmed countryside and moved to urban garden ponds, parks, woods and industrial areas with "water features." Many frogs lost their homes when farm ponds were filled in and others were wiped out accidently by farmers' overuse of chemicals on their crops.Frogs tend to return to the same place to breed each year but are obviously adaptable, increasing their chances of survival by laying eggs in any suitable place. Create a shallow pond in garden or wood and frogs will probably find it and lay spawn. Using these opportunities frogs have migrated gradually to the safety of suburbia over the last 50 years and thrive.Frogs breathe through their skin during their winter hibernation in the bottom of a pond, compost heap or other damp place but once they emerge become energetic and set off to reach their chosen breeding site. Males arrive first and croak loudly after dusk to attract the females.Females commonly lay 1,000 to 2,000 eggs with males clasping them round the waist in a position to fertilize them. If all tadpoles survived to become adults then there would be a problem of biblical proportions, since 20 lots of spawn or more are laid together at popular breeding sites.Newts, dragonfly larvae, fish and many other pond dwellers eat tadpoles, so to avoid all their offspring being devoured frogs often lay their eggs in shallow pools and ditches that dry out towards the end of summer. This avoids fish and other predators but is a gamble, because if the pond dries out before the tadpoles turn onto tiny frogs then a whole breeding season is lost.Tadpoles have a remarkable facility of changing very rapidly into tiny adult frogs when they sense the pond is drying out. They will also eat smaller siblings in order to survive themselves.Even so, in a dry year many tadpoles do not make it to be adults unless they happen to be spotted by a passing child who will be prepared to spend happy hours rescuing tadpoles from almost dried out pools.That is why the recent wet winter and the high level of groundwater promises a good year for the frog population. In a successful year a wet summer evening can bring hundreds of frogs, the size of a thumbnail, climbing out of ponds and setting off into the flowerbeds.The vast number of eggs produced by each frog seems to be the key to its success â€“ if more than one in a thousand of the eggs becomes an adult frog and lives long enough to breed there should be an increasing population.And modern gardeners are on their side. Many now actively encourage frogs to breed in a small garden pond because slugs are one of their staple foods.
