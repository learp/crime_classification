Cambridge University Library is celebrating its 600th anniversary by putting some of its greatest treasures on display – including volumes that have become more precious because their owners scribbled all over them.Sir Isaac Newton did not so much add notes to his own first edition of Principia Mathematica as an entire extra text, gluing in additional pages running to hundreds of words. William Morris spoke for generations of enraged authors when he scored out a line in the printed text of his translation of Beowulf, and wrote savagely in the margin: “I can’t have my best lines spoiled!”Cambridge University celebrates library's 600th anniversary – in pictures Sheets of paper which are now national treasures were of no further interest to Charles Darwin once he published the theories that would change the history of science. His children drew on the back of some of them, and after his death a bundle of the documents was found parcelled up and shoved under the stairs.In contrast, the typescript of Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time – on display with the judiciously phrased letter asking if he felt minded to present it – is poignantly immaculate. By the time it was printed, Hawkings could no longer have held a pen to annotate it.The library’s wonders include 3,000-year-old Chinese fortune telling bones, which survived because the inscribed bones were being sold in traditional medicine shops to be ground up and consumed; and a 2nd century fragment of Homer’s Odyssey, discovered after it was reused in a mummy case.The library is, as several of the staff pointed out, far older than the British Library, and centuries older than its great rival, Oxford’s Bodleian.The head librarian, Anne Jarvis, explained that although 10 March 1416 is the institution’s accepted birthday – two wills were found to have bequeathed books on that date – it must be even older because the wills refer to “the common library of all scholars”. She suspects it was then no more than a chest of books, and the first catalogue listed only 122 volumes (just six of which survive in the collection today, it being assumed the rest went home with scholars).Over the centuries it has grown prodigiously, taking 500 years to reach its first million books, and another century to double that. It is now full, despite the huge, rather grim 1930s building (“we prefer to describe it as striking,” the associate director of research collections, Mark Purcell, said) designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and closely resembling his power stations.

The “penny dreadfuls” include the magnificently titled The Bloody Tragedy, or A Dreadful Warning to Disobedient Children. “The title would have been an excellent tip-off to any child that there must be good gory stuff in it,” the keeper of manuscripts, Suzanne Paul, said.• Lines of Thought: Discoveries that Changed the World is at Cambridge University Library, 11 March-30 September• This article was amended on 8 March 2016.
