The untimely passing of a promising young actor can generate a sense of loss in audiences whose closest connection to the man was seeing him on screen. Obviously this loss is as a gnat-bite compared to the bereavement of family and friends, but the tragic death of Anton Yelchin is making me appreciate how much I’d been taking him for granted.He was at ease and totally convincing in drama, comedy, horror, rom-com, action thrillers, SF blockbusters, The Smurfs, even Shakespeare, yet gave the impression that he had barely got started. His “guiding factor”, he once said, was: “How many different people can I play, and how different can I make them every time.” There were surely so many other different people to come, and now we will never see them.While he seemed content to leave the grandstanding to others (Tom and Tilda in Only Lovers Left Alive, Colin Farrell in Fright Night, Christian Bale in Terminator: Salvation), Yelchin never allowed himself to be pushed into the background. He provided films with their backbone, pluck and point of view, embodying the perfect straight man for all of us to empathise with – a role much harder to fill without disappearing altogether than it might appear; Johnny Depp did it surprisingly well in Donnie Brasco, Dead Man and Nick of Time, before he started camping it up.

Photograph: DreamworksYelchin wasn’t as classically handsome as Depp; he was easy on the eye without having traditional film-star looks, and I don’t recall his name cropping up in the sort of messageboards bursting with giddy declarations of devotion to Tom Hiddleston or Tom Hardy or Idris Elba. Yelchin wouldn’t have stood out in a crowd – unless, of course, he was required to do so for professional purposes, since standing out was well within his abilities, if the role required it.But it started me thinking – now we have lost Yelchin, how many other young actors of his generation have the range and talent to follow in the footsteps of such a versatile leading man? Which of them command the screen sufficiently to carry a film on their shoulders without recourse to a Samson-esque (if not Samsonite) physique or Adonis profile?Anton Yelchin: key roles in clips, from Star Trek to Like Crazy In Hollywood’s first golden age, amid the sheer otherwordly beauty of the Gary Coopers and the Tyrone Powers, there would always be a Humphrey Bogart or James Cagney to straddle the gap between leading man and character actor. But films such as Marty (1955), in which a “fat, ugly” Bronx butcher grabs at a chance for romance with a “plain” schoolteacher, were the exception that proved the rule; in the world according to the movies, leading men just weren’t supposed to look like Ernest Borgnine.

Johnny Weissmuller won five Olympic swimming golds before he played Tarzan, but his midriff now looks almost flabby compared to Alexander Skarsgård’s six-pack in The Legend of Tarzan. Today’s dominant genre is the superhero movie, and superheroes by their very nature tend to flaunt muscular physiques. For every weedy Peter Parker or Tony Stark sans Iron Man armour, there are armies of demigods looking ripped in latex and leather, many of them played by people called Chris. Some of them are pretty good actors as well, but I’m constantly reminded of Tim Roth’s words: “I’m sick of very white teeth and lots of gymnasium practice. I’m bored, you know, send in the next one. I wanted a real man that I could believe was my brother, my father, you know, my next-door neighbour – a real person.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Paul Dano in War & Peace, 2015. Photograph: Laurie Sparham/BBC/Laurie SparhamIt might be argued that “a real person” is not necessarily what you go to the cinema to see, and yet there seems to be a dearth of them even in non-superhero movies (and let’s not even get started on the shortage of those). Matt Damon used to look like a Regular Joe, though even in The Talented Mr Ripley his bared torso looked more gym-honed 1990s than 1950s beachboy, and now, thanks to the Bourne franchise, his physique is as unfeasibly Herculean as that of every other Captain America. Where are the young Gene Hackmans and Robert Duvalls de nos jours?'I never knew how much I'd write crying': Peter Bradshaw on film star deaths It’s not as though Hollywood takes its musclemen seriously, as it sometimes did back in the days of Fat City (1972) or Stay Hungry (1976). More often than not, they’re the butt of a feature-length joke - Zac Efron in Bad Neighbours 2, or Dwayne Johnson in Central Intelligence, or Johnson and everybody else in Pain & Gain. Central Intelligence (which I haven’t seen, though it sounds like fun) displays its game-plan on the poster - the physical discrepancy between The Rock and the normal-looking Kevin Hart. The corporeally mismatched buddy formula is a tried-and-tested comic formula as old as Laurel and Hardy, and there’s mileage in it yet, but will Hart ever be allowed to go it alone?

Photograph: Moviestore/REX/ShutterstockOne could point to The Geek Squad, currently headed by Jesse Eisenberg, who took over from Michael Cera as Hollywood’s token nerd and seems to be cornering the market in protagonists who don’t look as though they’ve been cloned in the superhero lab. Otherwise, like Hart, you can be a regular-looking leading man – so long as you stick to comedy. Even Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill, who have shown signs of wanting to broaden their range, will forever be typecast as funnymen. There are worse things than being thought funny, but it’s always thrilling when performances turn one’s preconceptions upside-down.Anton Yelchin obituary Meanwhile, I’m keeping a hopeful eye on Paul Dano, whose career to date has been full of surprises, from evangelist to Hitler impersonator to Pierre in War & Peace. As for Yelchin’s contemporaries, Alden Ehrenreich was so endearing as the cowboy star in Hail, Caesar! that even though I’ve never been a Star Wars fan, I’m looking forward to seeing him as young Han Solo. And the British contingent shows promise. Perhaps Spider-Man: Homecoming will give Tom Holland the necessary leg-up into other protagonist roles. Hogwarts graduate Daniel Radcliffe, who started off in the biggest franchise he will ever be a part of, helped make a huge hit out of The Woman in Black without being an Action Man type, and seems to be consolidating the clout that Harry Potter gave him by flexing his character-acting skills and showing a willingness to experiment, as indicated by his role as the farting corpse that keeps Dano company in Swiss Army Man.

Photograph: Everett/REX/ShutterstockMy personal antipathy towards Kingsman: The Secret Service almost – but not quite – blinds me to the appeal of Taron Egerton, who was bags more fun as the lovable doofus in Eddie the Eagle. Will Poulter is shaping up as a terrific character actor, if not a leading man, though was obliged to drop out of the potentially iconic role of Pennywise the Clown in the remake of Stephen King’s It. Jack O’Connell has been going from strength to strength, from Starred Up to ‘71 to Unbroken, and – for me – was the MSP of Money Monster, simply because he was a fresh face among the Hollywood cliches.Nicholas Hoult, too, is having an intriguing career, and though Nux wasn’t the hero of Mad Max: Fury Road, he provided the film with its most compelling character arc. Hoult’s recurring role as Dr Hank McCoy in the X-Men films has already awarded him his superhero badge, leaving him free to branch out into interesting areas such as off-the-wall westerns (Young Ones) and black comedies (Kill Your Friends). I’m looking forward to seeing how he tackles the role of JD Salinger in Danny Strong’s Rebel in the Rye.But in the end, all this sort of parlour game does is bring home to you even more acutely how there was no one quite like Anton Yelchin. He was irreplaceable, and he’ll be missed.
