The government has marked International Women’s Day by announcing increased financial support for survivors of domestic violence, help for parents returning to work after a career break and funds for next year’s centenary of women receiving the vote.An extra £20m will be provided to organisations battling domestic violence and abuse, which increases the total state funding for the initiative to £100m over the course of the current parliament.This is on top of the proceeds of the tampon tax, which will provide £12m this year to a range of women’s charities. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, also repeated the government’s commitment to introducing a domestic violence and abuse act.Hammond’s announcement on budget day was pre-empted by the prime minister, who had revealed the details to the Mumsnet website. Theresa May told the parents’ network: “Tackling domestic violence and abuse is a key priority for this government ... There are currently thousands of people across Britain who ... suffer at the hands of abusers.“I know they feel isolated and do not know where to turn for help. Raising awareness as well as strengthening the law will prove crucial in the fight against this life-shattering and abhorrent crime.”The Mumsnet founder, Justine Roberts, said: “More funding for organisations who provide a safe haven for survivors is crucial and with two women a week on average being killed by a partner or ex-partner in England and Wales, there are many lives at stake.”Polly Neate, the chief executive of Women’s Aid, welcomed the extra funding, but pointed out that one-third of domestic abuse organisations run a service with no dedicated funding.“The services that deliver the specialist support survivors need must be protected, and survivors themselves must be at the heart of all decisions made on how this fund is spent,” she said.The chancellor also promised £5m to help promote returnship schemes, which help people back to work after a career break by providing internships with an opportunity of a permanent role at the end. They will be open to men and women, but May said: “More often than not, it is women who give up their careers to devote themselves to motherhood, only to find the route back into employment closed off – the doors shut to them.“I want to see this scheme extended to all levels of management and into industries where women are underrepresented.”Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Encouraging people back to work is crucial for providing businesses with the skills and talent that they need. Companies across the UK are facing skills shortages and will welcome efforts to help those who have taken career breaks get back into business.” Meanwhile, with 2018 marking 100 years since women first received the vote, money will be found to celebrate the landmark event. Hammond told the House of Commons: “Next year is the centenary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act, the decisive step in the political emancipation of women in this country.“I will commit a further £5m to projects to celebrate this centenary and to educate young people about its significance.”
