The oversight committee of the US House of Representatives devoted several hours on Wednesday to grilling the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about online porn viewing, rampant absenteeism, accusations of assault and other alleged workplace improprieties.In truth, the investigation did not come up with much – at least nothing to match last year's sensational disclosure that the EPA had for years been duped into paying the salary of an employee who masqueraded as a CIA spy. Or revelations that a former administrator, Lisa Jackson, had used a fake private email account in the name of Richard Windsor.But the zeal with which the committee's chair, the California representative Darrell Issa, pursued the investigation suggests Republicans are trying to disqualify the EPA from carrying out President Barack Obama's climate-change agenda. “This is truly a broken agency,” Issa told the hearing.Republicans in Congress redoubled their attacks on the EPA and Obama's climate plan on Wednesday, following the release of a sweeping new scientific report.The hearing was told: one EPA employee devoted four to six hours a day to watching internet porn; one employee got a hefty pay rise despite being in charge of a hotline that did not respond to a caller in 2009; one supervisor paid a bonus to his own daughter; another authorised telecommuting for an employee in a nursing home; a number of employees were paid even though they rarely turned up for work; one employee got a $62,000 bonus.Committee members also identified by name employees alleged to have used EPA accounts to send private email.In all, the hearing was told that some 80 personnel were under investigation for workplace impropriety.If the evidence of wrongdoing seemed microscopic relative to the size of the 16,000-person agency, Issa was undeterred. “This is going to be an ongoing daily part of communications with the EPA,” he told the hearing.Tim Walberg, a Michigan Republican, said the allegations demonstrated the agency could no longer perform its job. “The atmosphere and environment around the EPA is polluted and it's affecting your impact,” he said.The most serious revelation involved a breakdown between rival investigation units which led to a shouting match and accusations of assault. The Justice Department declined to intervene.The clash involved two competing units. One, which focuses on security, works out of the office of the EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy. The inspector general's office of the EPA claims the 10-person cell was obstructing its efforts to investigate workplace improprieties.Elisabeth Heller Drake, an agent with the inspector general's office, said John Martin, an agent of the EPA's homeland security office, invaded her personal space and angrily jabbed a finger at her following a testy interview.The Justice Department declined to press assault charges following Drake's complaint. It emerged at the hearing that Martin is making a counter-allegation of assault.
