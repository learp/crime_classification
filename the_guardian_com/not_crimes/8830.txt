Name: Hello!Age: Dead at birth.Cost: £35,000.Hello! Oh, a hello! This is nice. Nobody ever says hello to each other any more, do they?Yes they do. People say hello to each other all the time. No they don’t. They avoid eye contact and pretend you’re not there, and bump into you because they’re too busy playing Candy Crush to see you.Ah, I think I see your problem. You’re from London, aren’t you? Yes, yes I am. Why, what does that have to do with anything?That only happens in London. Take literally just one step outside the M25 and you’ll be bombarded with hellos from people. Really? That happens? Oh God.Oh God what? I’ve just spent £35,000 on ‘Share the path’, a South Downs national park authority campaign to get people to say hello to each other while out walking.Is that really a problem? I thought it was! There are people out there on the South Downs, I thought, and some of them might not like saying hello to other people, and changing their behaviour sounded to me like a good use of public funds.Let’s go to … the South Downs, Sussex How exactly did you spend the money? Well, we paid some employees £8,000 to wear bright clothing and walk around the park and disrupt the tranquility of the surroundings by saying hello to strangers.What? That’s a terrible idea! I’d better not tell you about the video, then. We spent £11,500 on a video, too, just to try and make people who probably already say hello to each other say hello to each other.How did that go down? Terribly! It was a disaster! The lead character just walks around the park with his dog, trying to get conversations out of people. It makes him look desperately lonely. The slogan at the end might as well be: “Come to the South Downs: there’s a ton of serial killers here.”Has the campaign worked, though? Of course it hasn’t bloody worked! Everyone was already saying hello to each other in the first place! I’m an idiot.Well, goodbye. You say goodbye to people, too? Christ, there goes my next bloody campaign!Do say: “Hello!”Don’t say: “That’ll be £35,000 please.”  A publicity image for the South Downs national park authority ‘Share the path’ campaign.
