Alla A sublime Algerian lute player. His music is poetry, inspiring and breathing. It is the perfect sound to rest to, or de-stress – music that reminds us of our desert and the big landscapes. The rhythm is very particular, unexpected and takes you out of yourself.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Aziz Sahmaoui – Alf HilatThis Moroccan artist is a stunning musician. His lyrics aren’t that obvious, but you get to understand them with time. They are enigmatic and make you think, before you realise they are very powerful.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Tinariwen – Matadjem YinmixanTinariwen are our very first musical memories, and this is one of our favourite tunes, among many. This is also the song we played at the very beginnings of Imarhan – we learned to play guitars with this song.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Michael Jackson – Beat ItWe’ve always listened to him, through the TV, on the radio. He was and is everywhere, part of everyone and today’s culture. This is a great rock song and a stimulating call to dance.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Daft Punk – Giorgio By MoroderWe discovered them a short time ago, we like their fusion of styles and the captivating development of this track. You can feel the high level of the musicians; there’s an alchemy we like in their playing and the construction of the music.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest
