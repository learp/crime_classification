“Do you know what makes me weep?” James Blunt asks, like we don’t already know that it’s composing those pithy Twitter replies to people who hate him. Here he is, promoting the National Lottery, and telling us that he actually sheds tears over the general public’s lack of self-confidence. He wants to win the Lotto and boost the morale of the “ordinary man” with his winnings.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Interestingly, James Blunt hasn’t met the “ordinary man” since he took a wrong turn at Live Earth in 2007 and ended up having to ask a runner for directions back to the VIP area where he left Fearne Cotton. His plan for a UK-wide big-up plays out like a Black Mirror episode rejected for being too bleak. Megalomaniac Blunters wants to broadcast his face on to flat surfaces up and down the country so he can tell the public “you’re beautiful” en masse. “Can you imagine trudging through your life and out of nowhere, James Blunt appears?” he asks, his face hovering in a men’s toilet mirror. I remember Back To Bedlam mania so can attest that a sudden Blunt occurrence is not to be dismissed. Luckily it’s one that passes soon enough, leaving little to no trace.
