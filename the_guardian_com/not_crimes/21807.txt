You could hardly bill it as having one careful owner, even if it is fully serviced, clean as a whistle, and has a surprisingly low mileage given its age. On the other hand, if you want car with a bullet hole in one of the seatbelts, and a grisly place in hip-hop history, then it’s the 1997 GMC Suburban for you.The vehicle in which the Notorious BIG was shot dead is on the market, priced at $1.5m, making it one of the rare cars that has increased in value despite clocking up 114,000 miles.The car was bought at a public auction in October 1997, and the buyer only became aware of its history in 2005, when Los Angeles police told her of its past. She had bought the car to fit her family of six.The reason she wouldn’t have noticed the car was riddled with bullet holes in the drive-by shooting in LA on 9 March 1997 is that the passenger door through which the rapper was shot was taken by police as evidence in the original murder investigation, and was later replaced. Police will return the original door in the event of the car being sold.The sale is being handled by the memorabilia seller Moments in Time, which was approached after the seller saw they were also handling the sale of the car in which Smalls’s great rival Tupac Shakur was shot dead in September 1996.In strictly vehicular terms, Tupac’s 1996 BMW 750iL might be the better buy. It is selling for the same price, but has only 90,000 miles on the clock. However, one dealer told Complex that the same model in similar condition would normally sell for around $2,500.
