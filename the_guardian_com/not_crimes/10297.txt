Global coal use is on an upwards march despite calls to halt fossil fuels demand at a UN climate summit in Peru and will hit a record 9bn tonnes by 2019, according to the International Energy Agency.A proposal for greenhouse gas emissions falling to zero by 2050 surfaced at the Lima summit, attracting support from Scandinavian countries, island states and some central American nations, and an obligation on countries to announce their plans to tackle emissions by spring 2015 was intensely debated.But the final agreement merely asked member states to announce their emissions plans by 31 March.Fears that these will not keep global warming below the 2C rise that governments have agreed to hold it to will be stoked by the latest real-world energy trends, showing a large rise in coal consumption fromthe 7.2 bn tonnes used in 2010. “We have heard many pledges and policies aimed at mitigating climate change, but over the next five years they will mostly fail to arrest the growth in coal demand,” said the IEA’s executive director, Maria van der Hoeven. “Although the contribution that coal makes to energy security and access to energy is undeniable, I must emphasise once again that coal use in its current form is simply unsustainable. For this to change, we need to radically accelerate deployment of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS).”China has promised to diversify its energy production with a “staggering” increase in gas, renewables and nuclear energy generation expected before 2030, the IEA’s annual medium-term coal market report says.Even so, Beijing is still expected to account for 60% of growth in the global coal industry by 2019 and, along with India, and other countries in south and east Asia, will be “one of the main engines of growth in coal consumption.”The IEA predicts that global coal demand will grow at an average rate of 2.1% per year through 2019. This is less than last year’s forecast of 2.3% – and the actual growth rate of 3.3% per year between 2010 and 2013.Following the Lima summit, the EU’s climate action and energy commissioner Miguel Canete said that the world was now “on track to agree a global deal in Paris next year.” But Darek Urbaniak, an officer for WWF Europe said that the new forecast was a “very dangerous development” after the Lima summit failed to agree emissions curbs.“Coal-fired power plants account for just 40% of global electricity production, but they are responsible for more than 70% of its emissions,” he told the Guardian. “Therefore, we need to urgently introduce legislation that ensures a speedy halt to the construction of new coal plants and the immediate phase-out of highly inefficient coal plant.“Governments must ensure a full phase-out of all subsidies for coal mining, production and use immediately, and develop progressive Emission Performance Standards.”Since 1999, the EU’s top 10 countries have spent €78bn (£62bn) in fossil fuel subsidies, according to a report last week by Climate Action Network and CIDSE, an alliance of Catholic charities. The five biggest fossil fuel subsidisers were Germany (€47.5bn), the UK (€12.8bn), France (€7.6bn), Spain (€5.8bn) and Poland (€4.2bn), the study found.
