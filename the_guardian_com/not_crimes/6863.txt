The highlight of Jeremy Corbyn’s latest speech now appears to be the imperceptible “smile” he allegedly let loose during the brief booing of a journalist. The Sun has even promoted the Telegraph’s “smile” to a “smirk”. Mail on Sunday columnist Dan Hodges thinks it was a “grin”.

But isn’t privatisation of the Land Registry evidence to the contrary?Alec GordonLondon• Janet Russell (Letters, 30 May) is totally correct in her assessment of the importance of women in protesting against fracking.
