The funniest standup I’ve ever seenJohn Early. His body and brain were made for the world’s entertainment and pleasure.The funniest book I’ve ever readLouise Rennison’s Confessions of Georgia Nicolson books make me horny with laughter.The funniest heckle I’ve ever hadA man once came backstage during a show and offered to give me £2 and a scotch egg, but that’s more the answer to the question: “What’s the most turned on you’ve ever been?”The funniest person I knowMy dad makes me hiss with laughter. My parents let my old room out to students studying abroad and my dad can never remember their names. They had a boy called Gerchen staying for over a year once and my dad called him “courgette” the entire time.The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever hadBefore I went to Canada to do a ski season. It was going to be the trip of my life. Sadly the hairdresser decided to give me a fringe that was 2cm long and went from ear to ear. I looked indistinguishable from Friar Tuck and monks can’t even live in mainstream society let alone après-ski.The funniest film I’ve ever seenProbably Best in Show or Waiting for Guffman. Catherine O’Hara all the time, e’rytime.The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever ownedI tried to pull off a pair of thigh-high suede boots once, but my legs just looked like two big trouts wrapped up.The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funnyWhen my dad accidentally pooed himself on Christmas Day. He was furious but it made me and Jamie [Demetriou] fly round the house with laughter.The funniest wordThe usual suspects: chicken, farts, bum, willy, toilet, poo, knickers. If someone said something like: “I saw a chicken in knickers with a poo hanging out its bum,” you would get a laugh from me.Natasia Demetriou is at Rich Mix, E1, 13 May
