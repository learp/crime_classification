Danny Huston is to make his UK theatre debut in The Kid Stays in the Picture at the Royal Court in London. The show, directed by Simon McBurney, is an adaptation of the bracingly candid memoir by actor turned movie mogul Robert Evans. Huston comes from Hollywood royalty: his half-sister is the actor Anjelica and his father, John, directed The Treasure of the Sierre Madre which starred Danny’s grandfather, Walter. Huston hailed Evans as a maverick who “produced some of the most iconic American films including The Godfather and Chinatown, in which my father played one of the greatest movie villains of all time”.In the 1960s and 70s, Evans turned around the fortunes of the ailing Paramount Pictures with other hits such as Rosemary’s Baby and Love Story but his career declined and he had personal problems including cocaine addiction. His 1994 memoir, which also details his multiple marriages, was turned into an acclaimed 2002 documentary film. Huston met with Evans in Los Angeles to discuss the project before arriving in London this week for rehearsals. Huston is chiefly known as a film and television actor and is no stranger to projects about Hollywood, having played Orson Welles in Fade to Black (2006) and appeared in the biopic Hitchcock (2012). The Kid Stays in the Picture reunites him with McBurney, his co-star in the 2009 film Boogie-Woogie, a satire about the London art world.The predominantly American cast for The Kid Stays in the Picture includes Heather Burns, Max Casella, Ajay Naidu and Madeleine Potter. British actors Clint Dyer and Thomas Arnold also star. The show is a co-production by the Royal Court, Bond producer Barbara Broccoli, producers Patrick Milling Smith, Michael G Wilson, Brian Carmody and McBurney’s Complicite company. It runs at the Royal Court from 7 March to 8 April.
