Quebec’s top film awards have been renamed – at least temporarily – after the renowned film-maker whose name they bore for 17 years was posthumously accused of being a paedophile.Film historian Yves Lever sent shockwaves through the Quebecois film industry earlier this month when his new biography noted that Claude Jutra, arguably Canada’s first great film director, regularly slept with underage boys. In the wake of the allegations, the annual Prix Jutra awards organiser, Québec Cinéma, reportedly held an emergency meeting to discuss changing the name of the ceremony. The awards will now be known as the Gala du Cinéma Québécois until further notice, CBC News reports. The decision was announced by Québec Cinéma’s board of directors on Tuesday.Since Lever’s initial allegations were made, the picture painted of Jutra’s abuse has only become worse. Two men have come forward to say they were molested by the director of Mon Oncle Antoine and Kamouraska while under age.'Grandfather of Quebec cinema' Claude Jutra accused of paedophilia The first man, who remains anonymous, told La Presse he was first abused by Jutra at the age of just six in the 1960s, but said the molestation escalated over a 10-year period. The second man, screenwriter Bernard Dansereau, said in a letter to La Presse on 20 February that he was abused by the director known as the “grandfather of Quebec cinema” in the early 1970s when he was 12 or 13 years old.Lever’s previous allegations suggested that Jutra had sex mainly with underage prostitutes, some as young as 14 and 15, and in one case under 14. Prior to the abuse allegations, a number of the director’s friends and peers defended him, saying the film-maker’s proclivities were nobody’s business, or suggesting it was unfair to tar a man who was no longer around to defend himself. Many, including the author and screenwriter Guy Fournier, have reversed their positions in the wake of victims coming forward.Quebec has moved to remove the name Claude Jutra from parks and streets since the allegations emerged. Another film prize, the Claude Jutra award, has also been renamed – as the Canadian screen award for best first feature – in the past week.Jutra was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease in the early 1980s. He is believed to have committed suicide by jumping from the Jacques-Cartier Bridge linking Montreal and Longueuil on 5 November 1986, though his body was not recovered until April the following year.
