The actor Matt Damon has declared himself unconcerned about the prospect of being replaced in the action franchise with which he’s become synonymous.Speaking in South Korea ahead of the premiere of the fifth Jason Bourne film, Damon declared himself “totally fine” with someone new taking over the role.“I’m definitely going to be replaced some day by some new young Jason Bourne,” he said. “That happens to everybody and they reboot these things, and that’s totally fine.”Damon, now 45, said he found the action sequences more taxing than he had at 29, when shooting the first Bourne film. “It’s difficult when you’re 45 compared to when you’re 29, but you still have to run as fast as you can. That part was a challenge but to get to revisit the people was wonderful. “But I said, let’s smell the roses and appreciate that we get to be here together, and make sure we have fun.”In 2012, an attempt was made to continue the franchise with Jeremy Renner and Tony Gilroy replacing Damon and Greengrass. But The Bourne Legacy only made marginally more than the 2002 original, and about half the total of 2007’s The Bourne Ultimatum. Damon’s remarks come as debate still rages over casting for the next James Bond, despite Daniel Craig not having officially thrown in the towel.
