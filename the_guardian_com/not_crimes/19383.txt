Don’t you feel that, due to the lack of funding in all the arts, such as the removal of grants and increase course fees, that it’s becoming less diverse? That there isn’t the healthy mix of students from different backgrounds that there once was?On a less serious note:I watched an old episode of A Touch of Frost on television the other evening and was a bit surprised to see that you were in it. You looked about 12! And I also read somewhere that you’re somewhat grumpy before your years and prone to get annoyed at all sorts of things, such as littering. I’ve just deliberately thrown a crisp packet on the floor - what are you gonna do about it?  Guardian contributor DamianLewis 19 April 2017 3:01pmYou're right, we have to protect against lack of diversity. If theatre, film, TV, dance, opera, ballet are going to remain true artforms, they must be reflective of all society. but that's a different point from saying that only privately educated actors are becoming dominant in acting, because statistically that's not true. A handful of actors from privileged backgrounds have done well, very well, and of course that's high profile news. But whenever I work, wherever I work, as an actor educated at Eton, I'm still always in a minority. What is true and always rewarding about the acting profession is that everyone has a similar story about them being in a minority. From whatever background. And that coming into the acting profession is when we all finally find likeminded people. But it goes without saying, I hope, that theatre and the arts generally in my view are a fundamental and important part of any child's education, and to see any more cuts would be sad.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.01pm BST15:01TimmyP99 asks:As a theatre goer, I absolutely hate the noise made by sweet packets. Does it annoy you as an actor, or are you able to completely block out distractions?  Guardian contributor Damian Lewis 19 April 2017 2:55pmIt annoys me intensely. We haven't asked for them to be banned as they have in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? There were a lot of phones going off the other night, and someone took their vey annoying ringtone out of their bag, and it got much louder briefly, and for some reason this person just took it out and let it ring loudly. I was so dumbfounded by that, that I did stop performing briefly, and ask if they were going to get it. We went straight back in - Sophie was with me on stage, she was incredibly focused, and it actually was kind of electric. We carried right on and the audience didn't miss a beat with us. And were fully engaged immediately.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.01pm BST15:01Sterling Burke asks:You mentioned something about roles being nourishing? What exactly does that mean?  Guardian contributor Damian Lewis 19 April 2017 2:57pmWhen you play a role for a long time, you hope that the themes, the issues, the politics, the humour of the story continue to feed you. Great pieces of writing are never entirely knowable, and that's what you hope for on stage, you continue to discover the play. And in that way, it sustains you over a longer period of time. All your roles stay with you in some form or other.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.57pm BST14:57LawrenceWindrush asks:Really impressed by Keane. What research did you do for this role?  Guardian contributor Damian Lewis 19 April 2017 2:51pmI read a lot of literature about schizophrenia, I read a lot about homelessness, and went to a home up in New York and met people there who were suffering from mental illness and/or had been homeless. I spent a lot of time in Port Authority bus terminal, hanging out with homeless people - one woman believed she was Tina Turner and would tell me every morning about her gig the previous night with Ike at an imaginary club, and how she slept on the subway every night in the parked trains in the tunnels. She'd get up, use the public showers, and take up her position on the sidewalk directly outside the terminal every morning.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.56pm BST14:56LinaGr asks:For you, what is the biggest difference between film and stage acting?  Guardian contributor Damian Lewis 19 April 2017 2:49pmVolume. In the olden days, when lighting was less sophisticated, as was makeup, one needed to make adjustments to one's performance physically, so that all 900 people could see it. It's less necessary these days. It's also tempting to be more presentational when you have 900 people sat in front of you, and ignore the fourth wall of your set, if you're inside. But I have found that the work in front of the camera I've done for film and TV has made me more specific and more detailed on stage. But I've always enjoyed the stage, for its greater physicality, athleticism. It feels more like sport than film or TV.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.55pm BST14:55'London's ability to change is a good thing'lynxmanuk asks:I live in Camden Town and I see you around fairly often, I’ve also seen you embrace and push community efforts which is in my opinion amazing. As a Londoner what do you think about the big changes that the city is facing like pollution, gentrification etc?  Guardian contributor Damian Lewis 19 April 2017 2:46pmI'm quite interested in the diesel ban in Paris. I wonder if we could follow suit here. The gentrification of world cities is not unique - it's happening in New York too. I'm in two minds about change - the romantic, the nostalgic me, longs for things not to be lost. But one of the great things about London is its ability to change, morph, and become different cities for different eras, in a way that some European cities don't. And interestingly, they can feel quite provincial when you visit them as a result. Albeit beautiful. But I think London's ability to be a constantly changing, breathing organism is a good thing. We have to protect its soul, that's true.Updatedat 3.15pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.55pm BST14:55OzMogwai asks: Is Paul Giamatti as intimidating in real life as he is on screen?

Guardian contributor Damian Lewis 19 April 2017 2:40pmI think The Goat is a modern American classic. I think it's a play about love and tolerance, and I think an exploration of different expressions of love, different manifestations of love, and what we're prepared to tolerate and accept seemed apt for now. We're surrounded by examples of rejection at the moment, on the macro, and on the micro level. A retrenching; a resurgence of nationalism. I think there's a degree on unease, of uncertainty around - I think that always makes people feel anxious. I think building bridges with Europe is preferable to taking them down, but we'll have to see what it means in actual terms over the next couple of years. I resent the amount of political time, space and money it's going to take up - I think that's unnecessary. In terms of what's going on in America, whilst it can be frustrating when we feel politicans don't say anything of consequence, or seem to obfuscate always,s we've seen how damaging and dangerous it can be when someone uses language irresponsibly. And we've seen it really does matter what you say. Words have power; they are what give meaning to our experience. It's how we understand, shape and recount our experiences, collectively. Which is another reason this play is so good to do right now, because in it, words as used as weapons. Language is of paramount importance in the play. There's a pedantry in the play about language and how it should be used. It should be used with precision. The Goat, as a metaphor, represents other. For Albee it was his own homosexuality as a young man in the 1950s, but it can be taken to mean anything that we don't understand or are ignorant of.It's also a brilliant theatrical experience, both to perform and to watch - it's laceratingly funny, sad, and totally absurd at times.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.38pm BST14:38Stoorie19 asks:Do you think the current Liverpool team is good enough to win the league?  Guardian contributor Damian Lewis 19 April 2017 2:32pmNo. We need a world-class centre half, and a holding midfielder, and left-back, although I love James Milner but he's not playing in his natural position. I love Klopp too.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.35pm BST14:35Meeting the real heroes of Band of BrothersBigDukeSix  asks:Band of Brothers is your best work, I feel. It is a fantastic series that will stand the test of time, and even more astonishing in that it is all true. Did you become close to Dick Winters as a consequence?  Guardian contributor Damian Lewis 19 April 2017 2:30pmThank you. At the time it was the most expensive TV show ever made, and it was a labour of love by Tom Hanks and HBO. Interesting bit of trivia: after they had made Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg and Hanks decided they wanted to make a TV series, and Steven Spielberg had read another book he said he wanted to turn into a TV show, but Tom said to him, you've got the wrong book, read Band of Brothers. And in Band ofBrothers there is a four line reference to a private Ryan, who is extracted from the second world war, and so Band of Brothers was made instead.Dick was quite a difficult person to get close to. He was suspicious of Hollywood, rightly so, that they would in some way bastardise the story. And grew in confidence when he realised how sincerely Tom and HBO were approaching it. I went and stayed with him on his farm in Pennsylvania, where he lived in great comfort because he used his agricultural science degree which he had already got before D-Day - he was 26 when he jumped, a lot of the other boys were only 19. And he came back to America after the war and developed a recipe for chicken feed which made him a lot of money. He was not given to long emotional anecdotes about his experience of the war, he was unlikely to sit in a bar with you til 3 in the morning drinking whisky, unlike Wild Bill Guarnere. His recollections of the war were more tactical, more dry. Which is why in my view, the single most moving moment of the entire series is when you see Dick recounting a letter than one of his soldiers gets from a grandson who asks: grandpa, were you a hero in the war, and the grandfather replies no, but I served in a company of heroes. And Dick's lip quivers and his voice breaks, and it's the closest I've ever seen him to showing real emotion.  Epic … Band of Brothers.
