The sun rose without the faintest breeze to disturb the water droplets that hung from every ripe fruit of the bird cherries along the hedgerow. It has been a wonderful summer for this tree hereabouts. Bud-burst in May was unremarkable but then in early June its foliage disappeared under long racemes of almond-scented flowers, in the finest display of blossom that I can remember. Individual trees became beacons in the landscape, hedgerows frothed with its flowers. But such flamboyance might not have been enough to produce a good crop if small ermine moths had been abundant. In some years they breed so prolifically that their armies of caterpillars, feeding safely inside their woven silk tents, defoliate whole branches, sometimes whole trees and even lengths of hedgerow, leaving them sheathed in a ghostly silken shroud.This was not a small ermine moth summer, but there was one final trial facing bird cherry before its fruits could ripen: pocket plum disease, which turns the cherries into soggy, greenish bags of liquid. So far I haven't seen a single instance of the disease and so now, after perfect flowering weather and few pathogens, the trees bear an unusually heavy crop of black fruits, as shiny as polished jet. Their stalks are crimson but the cherries, unlike elderberries, retain no hint of purple when they mature. Only ripe blackberries equal their blackness, but they lack the cherries' mirror-smooth finish; you can watch passing clouds reflected on the skin of a bird cherry fruit.We watched the last act in the annual cycle played out in the largest of the birdÂ cherries that arched over the footpath. A raucous flock of young starlings swooped along the hedge and landed in the branches. Greedy and inexperienced, they struggled to retain their balance on the whippy twigs as they lunged at the fruits and shook down cascades of water droplets.
