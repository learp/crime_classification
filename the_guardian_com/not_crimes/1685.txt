The new director of the British Museum, Hartwig Fischer, who took over after a record-breaking year at the museum just 12 weeks before the Brexit vote, has predicted that its role will be more essential than ever in the wake of the referendum.“I think in uncertain times the British Museum becomes ever more important in helping us understand how we got here and how we proceed in the future, within this country and in the context of Europe and the world,” Fischer, who is German, said.The museum in Bloomsbury, central London, had just under 6.9 million visitors, and a further 7.7 million people saw objects from the collection at touring exhibitions and loans outside London. The figures make it the leading visitor attraction in the UK for the ninth year, and the second most visited museum in the world.The museum’s trustees are still trying to tease out the implications of Brexit in terms of EU-funded research projects, corporate and private funding and international loans, but Fischer pledged that both free admission and its partnerships with other museums in the UK and across the world would be maintained.Fischer gave his personal backing to keeping the Parthenon marbles in Bloomsbury, the bitterest running dispute in the entire collection. Greece has repeatedly demanded the return of the sculptures taken from Athens by Lord Elgin, and has built a new museum to house them, currently displaying replicas.The Parthenon marbles could be seen in the British Museum in the context of world culture, Fischer said. “There are many, many people who cherish the fact that they are here – and by the way, I am one of them.”Although Fischer is still learning his way around the collection and his new staff – the chairman, Sir Richard Lambert, said he occasionally returned white in the face with shock from visits to basement stores, though Fischer insisted that was mere excitement – he said decisions would be made about displaying the collection. High on his list is what to do about the Round Room, one of the most famous rooms in the world, the former Reading Room of the British Library used by luminaries including Karl Marx and George Bernard Shaw, now it is no longer in use as a temporary exhibition space.Plans include new galleries on China and South Asia, and a major exhibition on South African art opening in October. The displays will include some of the earliest objects ever made by man, dating up to 3m years ago, to contemporary works covering the birth of the rainbow nation of South Africa.Fischer took over from Neil MacGregor, arguably the most famous director in the history of the museum, who is now based mainly in Berlin. His portrait has been added to the collection, in the form of a striking photograph by Turner prize winning artist Wolfgang Tillmans – Lambert joked that it had been impossible to get MacGregor to sit still for long enough for a conventional painted portrait.
