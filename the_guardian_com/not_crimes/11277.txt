This toad is not the storm bringer but it's in the wrong place to find sanctuary. How the toad got into the rusty tin we use for dog food is a mystery. The best guess is that it was intercepted in the garden by the dog and, judging by fibres sticking to its body, spent some time in the dog's basket before being dropped in the empty tin. The toad in the tin is small: its body would fit on a 50p piece. Its skin, as lumpy as gravel in a sock, is the rich autumnal colour of wet leaf mulch. One of this year's generation, it was on its first migration to find a safe haven for the winter when it was toadnapped.This is a dangerous time for amphibious migrants. One large, veteran toad on the lane lies squashed, the beautiful pink and white innards squiggling into a puddle. At first the little toad tries to make itself as small as possible to become just another patch of rust. Then it begins to throw some moves against the sides to try to escape, but freezes as if invisible and I shouldn't be able to see it. I oblige, pretending not to notice.Out on the hill. the stallion screams. It's raining and something has spooked him. He gallops uphill at me with surprising speed for a stumpy little pony, threatening and kicking. I ignore him and carry on. so he returns to the others, obviously freaked out. I pretend not to notice the buzzard flying out of a hedge so close that I feel its wing-swish. I pretend not to notice the flock of fieldfares whoosh so low overhead. I ignore the sharp shower lobbed by a squall out of a blue sky which soaks me for the third time this week.The build-up to this storm is a time of suddenness, rapid comings and goings, a gathering anxiety or excitement. The toad is not the storm bringer. We gently tip it out of the tin under the shed where it can meditate as storms rage: toad-in-the-void.
