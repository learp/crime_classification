Chris Evans is to unveil the new-look Top Gear TV show for the first time at the BBC’s biggest annual event in a crucial pitch to international television buyers.BBC Worldwide has called in Evans to front the official unveiling of the show in a PR offensive to win over more than 700 programming buyers which have made it a £50m-a-year global TV juggernaut for the corporation.Evans will headline BBC Worldwide’s annual showcase, which takes place in Liverpool later this month, in a test of the new-look show’s popularity following the departure of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.Evans has spoken about the show at events in San Francisco and Cannes, France, but the BBC’s event will mark the first time he will unveil the new Top Gear.“The event signals the international trade launch of the new look Top Gear,” said BBC Worldwide. “More than 700 international television buyers will get the chance to see Chris Evans offer a glimpse of what’s in store for the new series of Top Gear.”BBC Worldwide says it will be “teasing the new-look Top Gear”.Despite the trade show marking the most important sales pitch for the show ahead of debut in May, BBC Worldwide is understood to have decided not to sweeten its pitch to buyers by showing the first episode, or even significant clips from the new-look Top Gear.The BBC has also elected not to unveil the much-speculated-about co-hosts, despite Evans saying late last year that they had been chosen following auditions. Names attached to the roles include German racing driver Sabine Schmitz, motoring journalist Chris Harris and ex-F1 star David Coulthard. Coulthard was subsequently ruled out when he chose to sign a deal to front Channel 4’s Formula One coverage last month. Top Gear has been beset by problems including the departure of its executive producer Lisa Clark, script editor Tom Ford and BBC2 controller Kim Shillinglaw. And the media has been full of reports of difficulties with practical aspects such as Evans’s ability to drive while addressing the camera, although the BBC denies these reports.BBC Worldwide’s 40th showcase event will also see stars including James Norton of War and Peace and Happy Valley, Ben Miller and Keeley Hawes attend to promote BBC shows.“We’ll be teasing the new look Top Gear, celebrating the full spectrum of British crime drama, launching the follow-up to one of the BBC’s most successful natural history programmes and introducing a stunning slate of UK dramas,” said Paul Dempsey, president of global markets for BBC Worldwide.
