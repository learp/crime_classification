I’ve been a vegetarian for almost 15 years, but I still dream about meat sometimes. I can almost taste it when I wake up. The salty taste of the peppercorn rind on a perfectly grilled sirloin. The subtle sweetness of a hunk of chorizo. At a restaurant a few years ago, I ordered a spicy lentil burger but was accidentally served a real one. I didn’t notice until I was halfway through it, and my heart broke a little when the waiter appeared – horrified and apologetic – to replace it. I still think about that moment. The lentil burger was good, but not meat good, you know?It’s never meat good.I miss a lot of things about my wild meat-eating days, but I miss hot dogs most of all. To hell with smoked salmon or roasted chicken or filet mignon. I miss those delicious little meat tubes so much that it hurts. And now that we’re in the middle of barbecue season, my longing is more intense than ever.To this day I avoid Ikea whenever humanly possible. People think it’s because I prefer sustainable or second-hand furniture – and I do! Oh, I do – but mostly it’s their hot dogs that keep me away. They cost 75 cents. Seventy-five cents. That’s too good a deal to resist. For under five dollars I could buy myself six scrumptious hot dogs neatly nestled into their simple white bread buns, a single squiggly line of mustard adorning each one of their glistening skins. Don’t you dare talk to me about veggie dogs. I will happily ramble on about the benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle until you unfollow me on Facebook, but veggie dogs are some real bullshit and everyone knows it.  I am happy to ramble on about the benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle, but veggie dogs are some real bullshit “But Madeleine,” you say, “hot dogs are disgusting! They’re filled with lips and anuses!” I see. You think you’re too good for hot dogs?No. No one’s too good for hot dogs. Hot dogs are the great equalizer. The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council (this is a real thing – what a time to be alive!) estimates that Americans eat 20bn hot dogs each and every year. They’re festive barbecue food, American as apple pie. They’re a main course for families on strict budgets, like mine was growing up. Everyone eats hot dogs – Beyoncé eats hot dogs! Here’s a picture of Beyoncé eating a hot dog. See that look in her eyes? That’s democracy. And are they filled with lips and anuses? No!Well, yes. I mean, sort of. Hot dogs are typically made from offal and trimmings. If you have no idea what that means, that’s deliberate. The more precise definition breaks it down thusly: “The raw meat materials used for precooked-cooked products are lower-grade muscle trimmings, fatty tissues, head meat, animal feet, animal skin, blood, liver and other edible slaughter by-products.”Edible. Slaughter. By-products. Are you drooling? What? No, god, me either. Gross. An investigation into hot dog manufacturing tells me that hot dog makers are doing one of my favorite things: recycling. Upcycling, even! Taking “head meat” and “edible slaughter by-products” and turning it into the stuff of dreams. Sweet tasty little temptresses. Upcycling is so seriously hot right now – everywhere you look someone’s wearing shoes made from scarves, or repurposing mason jars into menstrual cups. It’s no wonder that hot dogs, the poster child of making something from nothing (low-grade muscle trimmings!), have grown incredibly popular in the niche food market. Upscale hot dog restaurants have been popping up in cities all over the world (and I can’t eat at any of them). Seattle-based Tokyo Dog offers what may be the world’s most expensive hot dog, a $169 fancy-schmancy version that they serve in a ceramic dish and require you to order two weeks in advance. Not that this concerns me in any way, but I disagree with this on principle alone. $169? This is no longer the food of the people. And who plans to eat a hot dog two weeks in advance? Eating a hot dog is almost always the result of a spontaneous decision, usually one poorly made and quickly regretted. Also, do you know how many hot dogs you could get for $169 at Ikea? Two hundred and twenty-five. Officially, I am a proud vegetarian. I’ll tell you things like how pigs are smarter than dogs, chickens have personalities and cows like to cuddle. Officially, I avoid processed food jammed with nitrites and packaged in plastic.Likewise, if you’re barbecuing on the Fourth of July or any other day this summer and hot dogs are on the menu, I officially encourage you to eat something else instead. Quinoa, perhaps. Roasted cauliflower? Grilled caesar salad? (OK, actually try this one – it’s life-changing.) But it’s also national hot dog month. And if you don’t take my advice, I understand. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. (And tasty. How is it even legal for fatty tissue and animal feet to be so goddamn tasty?) Go ahead and be like Beyoncé. When has it ever been wrong to be like Beyoncé? Savour every bite of your offal and trimmings and when you do, please think of me.
