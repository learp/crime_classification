The first full trailer for the much-anticipated superhero-team movie Justice League has been released onto the internet.Directed by Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice’s Zack Snyder, Justice League has been heavily hyped as DC Comics’ answer to Marvel’s The Avengers, which provided a gateway into multiple character spin-off movies and allowed its superhero “universe” to mushroom. Justice League features the likes of Batman, Aquaman and Wonder Woman, and is due to be followed by films giving each character solo outings. Wonder Woman, released in June, stars Gal Gadot, while Aquaman should be arriving in December 2018. The Batman has been beset by well-publicised production troubles, and is not likely to start shooting until next year.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Warner Bros set the trailer up with a series of short teasers, released on Thursday and Friday, that featured the likes of Batman, Aquaman and Wonder Woman in brief 15-second clips. This follows over two minutes of specially prepared footage from the film that was debuted at the Comic Con festival in July.Justice League is released on 16 November in Australia and 17 November in the US and UK.
