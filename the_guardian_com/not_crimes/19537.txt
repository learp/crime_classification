Bradford’s National Media Museum is to change its name as part of a major revamp, with more than 400,000 photographic treasures transferring to London and a new focus on science.The new name, National Science and Media Museum, will reflect its focus on the science behind still and moving images. It is the second name change for the museum, which opened in 1983 as the National Museum of Photography, Film & Television.To compensate for the loss of its 400,000-strong Royal Photographic Society (RPS) collection to the V&A in London – a controversial decision last year which generated protest from politicians and the public – the museum will open a £1.8m gallery at the end of March. Later in the year, it also hopes to lure visitors with the arrival of Tim Peake’s spacecraft – when Londoners have finished with it.The new Wonderlab gallery explores the science of light, sound and images through state-of-the-art exhibits. Visitors will be able to see their body split from their head as they walk, hear their voice echo through a 15-metre tube, and experience an anti-gravity mirror and a musical laser tunnel, as well as watch one of the world’s first 3D-printed zoetrope installations.Based on an interactive exhibit of the same name at the Science Museum in London, the Wonderlab will open to the Bradford public on 25 March.The Bradford museum has also confirmed it will host the Soyuz TMA-19M spacecraft that carried Peake to the International Space Station and back to Earth. Visitors will be able to see the vessel this September when it travels outside London for the first time since it was acquired by the Science Museum Group in 2016.The Bradford museum’s director, Jo Quinton-Tulloch, said: “These announcements are not only incredibly exciting, but a significant statement of intent – that we are aiming to be one of the leading museums in the UK and worldwide. The museum has a bright future and we are confident people are going to be wowed by Wonderlab and the state-of-the-art exhibits within, along with many other events we have planned like the arrival of Tim Peake’s spacecraft.“We want to draw in new visitors, encourage existing ones to come more often and open a whole new chapter for the museum. Our collections across the technology and culture of photography, film and TV are unrivalled, and Wonderlab explores the science behind what makes these things magical in a very hands-on way.”There was much controversy in February last year when the Bradford museum agreed to relinquish its RPS collection to the V&A to create an “international photography resource centre” in London, with one politician describing it as “an appalling act of cultural vandalism”.Simon Cook, leader of the Conservative group on Bradford council, told the museum directors then: “I know you are incredibly excited by all this but, trust me, you could – had you had the guts and vision – have based this new resource centre in the north, in Bradford, where they would have been loved and cherished in a way you in London can never understand. We don’t have much up here and it fills me with a kind of sad rage that you felt able to visit this act of cultural rape on my city.”
