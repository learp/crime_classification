Trump’s First 100 Days 9pm, BBC1 The US’s audacious if somewhat bracing experiment with government by giant, belligerent baby continues. And after 100 days, it has become clear that – to bend over backwards to be charitable – the Tango Tyrant is mightily adept at keeping the world on its toes. Jeremy Paxman took his contemptuous bafflement to the US in the run-up to last year’s presidential election. Tonight, he returns to try to make sense of what has ensued. Good luck with that. Phil HarrisonMasterChef 7.30pm, BBC1Two visits to the MasterChef kitchen tonight as the culinary competition heats up. At 7.30pm, the blue team are rustling up dishes inspired by their childhoods and families, with the reds attempting the same task an hour later. Two contestants will then get the boot from no-nonsense judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace – but not before they’ve both had their fill of all 14 contestants’ grub. A tough job, but someone’s got to do it. Hannah J DaviesWarship 8pm, Channel 4Final instalment of this absorbing voyage aboard HMS Ocean, the Royal Navy’s soon-to-be-retired flagship. This was filmed late last year, on the helicopter carrier’s deployment to the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. In this episode, it finds itself intermittently harassed by Iranian gunboats, taking over command of a US task force in the Middle East for the first time in the Royal Navy’s history, and preparing to host a visit from the prime minister. Andrew MuellerAmazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby 9pm, BBC2Giles Coren and Monica Galetti continue their exploration of the world’s swankiest hotels with a trip to Newfoundland. In the cosy Fogo Island Inn, they soak up a warm welcome from staff with part-Irish, part-American accents. Coren plays with the high-tech toilet and helps to clean the windows before he and Galetti go fishing. But despite the gorgeous location, the population is dwindling as locals leave in search of employment. Hannah VerdierLittle Boy Blue 9pm, ITVThis new drama, starring Stephen Graham, tells the story of the fatal shooting of 11-year-old Rhys Jones in Croxteth, Liverpool, in 2007. Jones was caught in the crossfire of a gang feud while walking home from football via a pub car park. Detective Superintendent Dave Kelly is charged with bringing his teenage killer to justice. Identifying him is no problem; gathering the evidence to press charges against him, however, proves rather more complex. David StubbsSilicon Valley 10.10pm, Sky AtlanticThe boys of Pied Piper are back for a fourth season of tech-larks, with Richard back in the spot of CEO and their new app now rapidly gaining traction as well as a growing user base. It should be great news, but issues with securing the funding that will match their growth are causing problems. Meanwhile, at rivals Hooli, Stephen Tobolowsky’s “Action” Jack Barker, ousted from Pied Piper, is having hisown workplace clashes. Ben ArnoldBig Little Lies 9pm, Sky Atlantic Having begun with a murder, David E Kelley’s Monterey-set drama concludes by revealing who committed the deed. But of course, Little Big Lies is as much about backstories as whodunnit, a kind of turbocharged Desperate Housewives without the giddiness. Tonight, as we head towards the Fall Fundraiser, that means Celeste yet again clashing with Perry, Madeline dealing with fallout from her past, and Jane discovering who has been tormenting Anabelle. Jonathan WrightFilm choicePredestination (Michael Spierig, Peter Spierig, 2014) 9pm, Film4Ethan Hawke reunites with the Australian brothers behind the clever vampire film Daybreakers for another ingenious fantasy. This time, Hawke is a time-travelling government agent hunting a serial killer called the Fizzle Bomber. While posing as a barman in 1970 New York, he meets a mysterious transgender character (Sarah Snook) with a weird tale to tell, which proves to be the precursor to a mind-bending adventure around the “predestination paradox”: you meddle with time at your peril. Paul HowlettSource Code (Duncan Jones, 2011) 10.55am, Film4A sci-fi whodunnit with a large helping of Groundhog Day. Jake Gyllenhaal is an army captain who, through the wonders of future technology, enters the mind of one of the victims of a train bombing, re-running his last eight minutes repeatedly in order to unveil the culprit and prevent a larger act of terrorism, while falling for cute fellow passenger Michelle Monaghan. Intelligent and gripping.
