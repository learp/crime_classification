Millions of householders across southern and eastern England are banned from using hosepipes from Thursday as drought grips parts of the country.Seven water companies are introducing restrictions on water use following one of the driest two-year periods on record, with domestic customers facing a Â£1,000 fine if they use their hosepipe in defiance of the ban.Thames Water, Southern Water, South East Water, Anglian Water, Sutton and East Surrey, Veolia Central and Veolia Southeast are bringing in the restrictions, affecting about 20 million people.Customers will no longer be able use their hosepipes for watering their gardens, washing cars or boats, hosing down patios and paths and filling swimming pools, ponds, fountains and paddling pools. Public parks and allotments are also affected.The firms insist the bans are necessary to preserve essential water supplies and protect the environment, in the face of a drought that has left groundwater below 1976 levels in some places and rivers running dry.Despite some rain in the past few days, March was another dry month and the whole of the south-east and East Anglia and parts of Yorkshire are officially in a state of drought.Yorkshire Water has said it does not anticipate bringing in hosepipe restrictions as yet.The Environment Agency said most reservoirs were below normal levels and river flows were decreasing. All rivers are experiencing lower than normal flows, with two-thirds "exceptionally" low.The water firms bringing in restrictions say they are investing significant resources in fixing leaks, moving water resources from wetter to drier areas and encouraging their customers to save water.The Environment Agency has urged companies to do more to tackle leakage rates.Water companies across England and Wales leaked more than 3.3bn litres a day in 2010/11, according to Ofwat, the economic regulator of the water and sewerage industry. Anglian and Southern were among the companies to fail to meet their water leakage targets last year.The water companies say the main problem is that it has not rained enough in the past two winters to restock supplies.Peter Simpson, the managing director of Anglian Water, said: "Two dry winters have prevented rivers, reservoirs and aquifers from refilling with the water we treat and supply the rest of the year, especially during the hotter months when demand rises."Martin Baggs, the chief executive of Thames Water, said: "Imposing restrictions on the use of hosepipes, although regrettable, is the most sensible and responsible next step in encouraging everyone to use less water so we can maintain supplies for as long as it stays dry, and reduce the risk of more serious restrictions later in the year."Southern Water estimated that the hosepipe ban would reduce water demand by around 5% while Thames Water said its last ban in 2006 reduced demand by 10%.Mike Hegarty, Sutton and East Surrey Water's operations director, said: "We have said from the outset that we very much regret having to impose this bar but this drought is becoming increasingly serious."We have no choice if we are to protect our customers by ensuring the long-term security of their water supply."He warned the drought could continue, saying: "We must be mindful of the possibility - albeit unprecedented - of a third dry winter."Companies have warned of wider restrictions, including extending the hosepipe ban to businesses.Gavin McHale, the head of operations at Veolia Water Southeast, urged customers to do everything they could to save water, but stressed there was no likelihood of standpipes being needed.Thames Water said prosecuting customers for breaching the ban, which is a criminal offence, was the "last thing we want to have to do" and urged people to work with wthe companies to use water as sparingly as possible.The environment secretary, Caroline Spelman said: "These temporary restrictions will help protect the public's water supply in the areas most affected by the record low levels of rainfall we have experienced."Thames Water has been running its desalination plant in Beckton, East London, which was built to convert sea and fresh water from the Thames Estuary into drinking water in times of drought.The plant, which can supply enough water for a million people, has been taken offline for a service, but will be treating water again shortly. Thames Water plans to keep it running throughout the summer if needed.
