Comic books are arguably the most vital source material available to TV producers in 2017. Adaptations of the celebrated graphic novels The Walking Dead and Preacher have become unmissable TV, the former now the highest-rated show on cable. And the explosion in popularity of costumed crimefighters has seen even second-string superheroes such as Netflix’s Luke Cage and FX’s Legion getting their turn in the spotlight.Alt-right comic book villains? Comics have moved on from punching Nazis There’s plenty to come, moreover, with the CW having ordered a pilot for a new series based on the African American vigilante Black Lightning and plans for a Superman prequel, titled Krypton, about life on the man of steel’s home planet before it exploded into space dust.With Netflix set to release its latest Marvel show, the controversial Iron Fist, on Friday, here’s our list of the top 10 comic book and graphic novel shows of all time.Preacher      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Matthias Clamer/AMC/Matthias ClamerJust one season in, Preacher already shows signs of being quite possibly the greatest graphic novel adaptation yet, a testament to the medium’s status as a breeding ground for spiky innovation. Dominic Cooper’s Jesse Custer is a superhero for our times, a grimy lowlife turned man of God who suddenly finds himself empowered to shake up his poverty-stricken neighbourhood with a gift from on high. Speaking of revelations, Joseph Gilgun and Ruth Negga exhibit effortless rock-star cool as the hard-drinking vampire Cassidy and the 21st-century gunslinger Tulip, while the supporting cast, from Ian Colletti’s pitiful Arseface to Jackie Earle Haley’s uncompromisingly atheistic slaughterhouse owner Odin Quincannon, are heaven-sent.Batman: The Animated Series      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Allstar/WARNER BROS. TELEVISIONAny show that can boast what many fans of the caped crusader believe is the definitive Joker performance, courtesy of Mark Hamill’s cackling, maniacal clown prince of crime, as well as introduce that vicious little scream queen Harley Quinn, deserves its place in history. Batman: The Animated Series offers the timeless noir stylings of the Tim Burton films but with a hugely detailed tapestry of supervillains and Gotham lowlifes, from a Rita Hayworth-inspired Poison Ivy to Richard Moll’s deranged Harvey Dent, the version of Two Face that popularised the classic black and white split suit. This is the definitive animated comic book show, its traditional hand-drawn techniques adding sumptuous charm and verve to a wonderfully old school take on the dark knight’s broodingly baroque world.Daredevil      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Patrick Harbron/NetflixMarvel’s debut effort for Netflix, and still arguably its best. Charlie Cox is a model of taciturn charisma as Daredevil/Matt Murdock, the blind lawyer who patrols the streets of Hell’s Kitchen by night as a costumed crimefighter. But thus far, the show’s real achievement has been its ability to blur the lines between comic book hero and villain via multifaceted antagonists such as Vincent D’Onofrio’s wonderfully sympathetic crime boss the Kingpin/Wilson Fisk, and Jon Bernthal’s equally pathos-drenched vigilante the Punisher/Frank Castle. These are bad guys you can’t help rooting for. The Walking Dead      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Gene Page/AMCFrank Darabont’s bloodthirsty zombie saga has shown endurance as impressive as that of Andrew Lincoln’s Rick Grimes himself over the past seven seasons. Just when you think it’s treading water, the show finds a way to viciously knock you out of your comfort zone. Carl’s forced matricide; Michonne’s revenge against the Governor; Negan’s uncompromisingly brutal game of eeny, meeny, miny, moe. The show’s makers know exactly how to keep you caring about its not-so-merry band of survivors. Its greatest achievement might be that anyone who watches even a handful of episodes soon finds themselves mulling over their own plan to live through the zombie apocalypse.The Incredible Hulk      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Snap/Rex ShutterstockMark Ruffalo may have made the role his own in the Avengers movies after a brace of disappointing big screen solo outings for the grumpy green giant, but for Marvel fanboys of a certain vintage, Lou Ferrigno’s bestial turn as the raging force of nature will never be beaten. A big part of the 1970s show’s appeal was the 6ft 4in bodybuilder’s ability to play the monster without the requirement for special effects – beyond a lick or two of green body paint. Meanwhile, Bill Bixby’s poignant turn as David Banner, the Hulk’s alter ego (strangely, the series did not use the name Bruce as the comics did), always on the road, never able to settle thanks to his darkly gothic secret, conjured up the powerful sense of pathos that surrounds this most eccentric of superheroes in a way Hollywood has yet to equal. Jessica Jones      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Myles Aronowitz/NetflixKrysten Ritter has rarely played the sardonic private eye as though she were a superhero, and herein lies Jessica Jones’s strength as a show. Sure, she may be able to leap around with the dexterity of a spider and bat enemies away with the brute force of a bull, but our hero is far more fascinating for her internalised self-defence mechanisms. David Tennant’s Kilgrave made for an operatically creepy first season villain, the show’s decision to venture into grim territories such as rape and Stockholm syndrome duly rewarded with a slew of darkly visceral two-handers in its climactic episodes.Legion      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Michelle Faye/FX NetworksDan Stevens stars as David Haller, the powerful titular mutant, a troubled young man whose telepathic skills have been confused with mental illness throughout his life. The fractured nature of David’s identity, not to mention those of the people surrounding him, makes Legion hard to watch at times, as reality is prone to melting in front of our eyes like ice on a hot stove. The Fargo creator Noah Hawley has brought an offbeat sense of 60s-inspired style and a willingness to use Lynchian visual cues in place of conventional storytelling to the superhero show. It’s early days yet, but Legion could yet manifest as a contemporary answer to the evergreen Twin Peaks.The Spectacular Spider-Man   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest A victim of Disney’s 2008 buyout of Marvel Studios, this Sony-produced animated effort only ran for two seasons but perfectly realises the bright and breezy, primary-coloured verve of the best Spider-Man adaptations. The wall-crawler himself is at his witty, wisecracking best, and the show has just enough self-reflexive smarts to reflect the superhero’s half-century of storylines, while avoiding the constant grating fourth-wall-breaking antics of more recent efforts. Luke Cage      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Myles Aronowitz/Netflix/PAMike Colter gives a performance of gentle muscularity as the kind-hearted, lady-killing superhero with unbreakable skin, an escaped convict who’s trying to lie low but is forced into using his powers to clean up Harlem. Existing in a colourful netherworld set somewhere between present-day New York and the version essayed in 1970s blaxploitation movies, Cheo Hodari Coker’s show offers a soulful, culturally rich vision of the historically African American neighbourhood. And while this is an adaptation that’s largely kissed goodbye to the comic book Cage’s hokey roots – canary-yellow jacket, tiara and all – hardcore acolytes still get to see him utter the immortal line “Sweet Christmas” every now and then.Gotham      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Everett/Rex/ShutterstockIt has its flaws – too many underwritten villains being the main one – but this flamboyant peek into the early life of Batman’s perennial comrade-in-arms James Gordon is well worth persisting with. Ben McKenzie’s Gordon is such a beautifully rounded good guy that you can’t help rooting for him, while Robin Lord-Taylor’s Oswald Cobblepot is surely the 21st century’s definitive take on the Penguin. Gotham also successfully conjures up the darkling eccentricities of Batman’s home town and its larger-than-life inhabitants without ever descending into the pantomime silliness of the worst screen adaptations.
