Britain’s largest generator of nuclear power said it would be looking at the hacking of a South Korean nuclear operator to see if any lessons could be learned - but the UK industry emphasised that its security standards are high and that it is well-equipped to withstand a cyber-attack.A spokeswoman for EDF Energy, which owns eight out of the nine nuclear power stations in the UK, said it took nuclear safety and security very seriously. “This extends to our stance around cyber-security and while it is not appropriate to go into detail, we work very closely with our regulator and other agencies to ensure that we have appropriate, ‘in depth’ protection measures in place to safeguard information” she said.“Changes in threats to the UK and our industry in particular are kept under constant review and take into consideration recent cyber-events and changes in cyber-threats.“We are monitoring the situation in South Korea and will take any lessons learned from this into account.”The Office of Nuclear Regulation, has in place strict security regulations, requiring sites to have a security plan, which must include details of “the protection of computer-based systems important to safety and security (known as CBSIS)”. A 2012 ONR security review said computer systems must be protected “against cyber-attack, manipulation, falsification and sabotage, consistent with the threats identified in national threat assessments”.Patricia Lewis, research director in international security at Chatham House, said concern was reasonable, even though people were thinking about security“The key thing with all of this stuff is never think you’re invulnerable,” she said. “Always be aware of your vulnerability and put things in place so you can be prepared for an attack. Always be aware that someone unusual that happens could be the result of a cyber-attack.”
