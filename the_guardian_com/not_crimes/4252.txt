It’s okay. We’ve made it. Spring is really here.For me, this time of year is more than a relief. Winter, deep dark winter, while the soil sleeps and animals hibernate, is something that I merely endure. And while I know that many will trumpet the glories of a winter garden, I struggle to see the beauty. Yes, I love the rich red stems of dogwoods and the papery bark of a cherry tree, but what I really long for is spring.Don’t be Sad: how to beat seasonal affective disorder | Norman E Rosenthal Like many people across northern latitudes, I struggle with low mood in the winter months. This condition now has a name: seasonal affective disorder (Sad). Symptoms of Sad – feeling lethargic, tearfulness, loss of pleasure – affect one in three adults in the UK. While the modern world tries to convince us that we are masters of our planet, in truth we are just as vulnerable to changes in the environment as any other organism. And as gardeners we are more attuned than most to the changing of the seasons; we watch the angle of the sun pitch and dip, we stick our hands in the soil to feel its temperature fluctuate, we notice a plant’s first shoots of growth and the first signs of it going over. The changing seasons, for us, are the heartbeats of our lives.NHS special: Sow, Grow, Repeat winter Coming out of winter makes me realise how much the alteration in light levels and lack of access to the outdoors affects my mental state. Yesterday was a perfect example. I was out in my garden doing the most mundane of tasks – edging a border. Even for a keen gardener like myself, tidying up a petulant piece of grass is not the most exhilarating job. And yet, as I looked around the garden at nodding daffodil heads and the tiny rising crowns of grape hyacinths, I felt I had found a part of myself I had forgotten about over the last three months. It’s a difficult feeling to describe. It’s as if, in winter, I begin to tuck little portions of myself away. Maybe it’s a kind of defence, like the way a deciduous tree loses its leaves. Maybe it is a way to conserve energy and save strength. But it happens by increments, in the minutes of sunlight which slip away every day until, one morning, you wake up and it’s dark. Some piece of you is gone. And then you forget to remember. You clear your flower beds and wait. And, just like a herbaceous plant you retreat back to a place of safety. You hold on to roots and weather the storm.Gardening is the best medicine for the mind Now, in spring, as my mood brightens along with the weather, I really understand how hard the winter months were. Of course I know that I am deeply affected by seasonal changes, but it’s the dramatic lifting of my mood in spring that really puts that into perspective. I feel as if my entire view on the world shifts and I become more positive, more willing to interact with others, and more energetic. I feel more like the me I imagine myself to be. Like the garden around me, I start to grow again. That is why this time of year is so wonderful. All the good is before us and the bad is behind. My soil has woken up and so have I.So goodbye Sad, hello spring. Hello to a new growing year. Hello to the sun. Hello to the real me.
