Walkers in the Lake District have been urged to know their limits, as figures show that the number of deaths among walkers has nearly tripled in the past year.According to this year’s Mountain Accidents report by the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association (LDSAMRA), there were 30 deaths in 2015, up from 11 the previous year.Eighteen of the 30 deaths were caused by medical emergencies such as heart attacks, and mountain rescuers warned that people’s enthusiasm for walking to stay fit could be leading them to push themselves too hard.Last year saw a total of 535 incidents in the national park’s mountains, compared with 474 in 2014. That number has only ever been surpassed by the 600 incidents seen in 2010, when there were also 30 deaths.Richard Warren, a member of the Wasdale mountain rescue team and chairman of the LDSAMRA, the umbrella organisation for Cumbria’s 12 rescue teams, said he hoped the figures represented a spike and not a trend.“Of the 30 deaths, 18 were medical, so that’s basically people suffering heart attacks,” said Warren. “If you are suffering from heart problems or recovering from heart problems, it’s OK to go out and exercise, but recognise that if you do have an attack, help is not immediately there.”“People are being encouraged to get out and go up the mountains to keep fit, but if you have a heart attack outside a supermarket you’ll probably get an ambulance within five minutes,” he said. “If you have a heart attack on top of a 3,000ft mountain in the Lake District, you’ll be lucky if you get help within an hour.”England’s 2,800-mile Coast Path to open in 2020 Sixty-year-old Stephen Padden, from Rawtenstall near Blackburn, collapsed and died while walking with friends in Langdale on 27 August last year. Stephen, known as Paddy, was a keen walker and was said to have been fit and healthy with no history of heart problems. “He was walking up Low Fell in the Lake District and he was with two friends,” his brother John told Rossendale Free Press. “They were on their way back down and he hadn’t shown any signs of distress. He just suddenly collapsed and his heart had stopped. The people who were with him tried to help and resuscitate him but it was too late.”Earlier this week a woman was rescued from Britain’s highest mountain, Ben Nevis, after attempting an ascent while wearing summer clothes and carrying just a selfie stick, according to reports.Graham Standring, an area ranger for the central and south-east area of the national park, said that unfortunate accidents would always happen but many people didn’t realise how challenging some of the walks in the Lake District could be. “In the same way that you wouldn’t go out and run a half marathon without any training, perhaps you shouldn’t go up England’s highest mountains without a bit of training,” he said. “I think perhaps some people just take on a bit too much.” “People are obviously being encouraged to get outside and that’s a good thing,” said Standring. “But I think that people need to be aware of their own capabilities and aware of what equipment and what skills they need for going into the mountains.” Insp Jon Sherlock of Cumbria Constabulary’s community safety team urged walkers to check the weather forecast before they set off and to ensure they have the appropriate clothing and equipment. “Equipment is essential; all walkers of all abilities and experience should carry a compass and maps on their walks,” he said. “Do not rely on phones for navigation. First aid kits and blankets are also useful in the event you might need them. In wintery conditions, an axe and crampons is vital on many of our fells and knowing how to use them correctly.”• This article was amended on 2 April 2016. An earlier version said the number of deaths among walkers in the Lake District had risen by nearly two-thirds in the past year.
