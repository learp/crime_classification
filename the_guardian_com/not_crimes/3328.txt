An oil painting of a workshop scene at Europe’s oldest umbrella shop has won one of the most prestigious prizes for figurative art. The Columbia Threadneedle prize was created in 2008 to breathe life into a more traditional art genre which, with the strength of abstract, conceptual and performance art, was falling out of fashion. This very accomplished painting showcases grandeur, confidence, wit and gritty realismTim Knox Lewis Hazelwood-Horner has been named winner for his work Salt in Tea, painted while he was artist-in-residence at James Smith & Sons umbrella shop in the West End of London.Tim Knox, director of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, who was on this year’s selection panel, said the judges admired the “enticing documentary quality” of the painting. “This large and confident painting depicts real people with knotty hands and stubbly muzzles immersed in a timeless, archaic trade which hasn’t changed for hundreds of years. This very accomplished painting showcases grandeur, confidence, wit and gritty realism which truly impressed the judges.”The painting’s playful title, Salt in Tea, suggests Hazelwood-Horner may have been the victim of the workers’ practical jokes. The artist has won £20,000 and a solo show for a wider body of his work at the Mall Galleries in London later this year.He won from 3,828 entries submitted by 1,973 artists from 29 countries. The other judges were Lucian Freud’s assistant, David Dawson, the journalist Emma Crichton-Miller, Arturo Galansino, director general of Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, and Lewis McNaught, director of Mall Galleries.Salt in Tea, along with 93 other works, will be on show at the Columbia Threadneedle prize exhibition at the Mall Galleries from 3-20 February. McNaught said: “Visitors will be delighted by the strength and breadth of this year’s selection. The winning painting stood out for the scale of its ambition, while there are other works in the exhibition that push the boundaries of figurative and representational art into new territory.”
