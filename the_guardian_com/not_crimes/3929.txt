It happens to us all. First day in the office, feeling isolated, and suddenly a crisis strikes. Somehow it is dealt with, a solution awkwardly put together, but it jangles the nerves.At times like these, it is Mikhail Bulgakov who gives me hope. Many years ago, while I was finishing up at university, a friend of mine gave me a copy of A Country Doctor’s Notebook (also translated as A Young Doctor’s Notebook) – a slim, semi-autobiographical set of short stories inspired by the author’s early years as a physician in provincial Russia.It might be a strange sort of literary schadenfreude, but whenever anxiety strikes, I take heart from Bulgakov’s hapless protagonist. Stranded in a remote, pastoral community, which views medicine with suspicion and hospitals with dread, Bulgakov’s hero Dr Vladimir Bomgard finds himself taking charge in all manner of medical emergencies, from horrific amputations to outbreaks of venereal disease.

Unsurprisingly, he is struck by what we would diagnose as impostor syndrome today. “I forgot about deliveries! Incorrect positions. What on earth will I do? What a fool I was! I should have refused this job, I really should,” he frets. “I’m like Dmitry the Pretender - nothing but a sham.”But he struggles on, doing his best, learning, improving, making mistakes – as we all do – when disaster strikes: his worst nightmare, a difficult childbirth, turns up. In what is possibly my favourite moment in the book, the doctor, panicking at the idea of having to carry out a complex procedure to turn the baby in the womb, comes up with a flimsy excuse of needing a cigarette (that wouldn’t wash these days) and dashes back to his rooms.“There it was – Döderlein’s Operative Obstetrics. I began hastily to leaf through the glossy pages,” he says, reading out all manner of appalling outcomes that could occur should he make a mistake. “For a moment I was convinced that I understood nothing,” he despairs, but nonetheless returns to the theatre, sets to work, and with a few hints from his midwives, performs the necessary procedure. Yet despite his heart “brimming with joy”, the doctor is human enough to retain just a little tinge of doubt. “What about a rupture? How would it show? And when would it show – now or, perhaps, later? Better not talk about that.” There’s something in that wonderfully honest self-doubt that must, surely, speak to our own society: almost 20% of those aged 16 or older showed symptoms of anxiety or depression, according to a 2013 survey.

It’s what makes him so good at his job. It is what helps him to learn, bestows him with compassion for his patients, brings him satisfaction when the sick recover. For Bulgakov, the anxiety experienced by this doctor is not necessarily something to be “cured” as much as managed and even, at times, celebrated.At one point, Bomgard remembers an alarming moment when, while attempting to extract a soldier’s tooth, he heard a terrible crunching sound: “At first I could not understand it, then I almost burst into tears: although the jaws of the pincers held a tooth with a very long root, there was also dangling from the tooth an enormous, jagged piece of gleaming white bone.”In the days after the extraction the doctor’s thoughts leap from catastrophe to catastrophe. The man might die, he might lose his job, the villagers will gossip. Eventually the doctor heads to the district hospital to collect his pay, and in the process, spins a paper-thin yarn about hearing of a case whereby a doctor removed a tooth.“You broke off the tooth-socket ... Don’t worry, you’ll make a fine tooth-puller in time … Forget the tea, let’s go and have some vodka before dinner,” he is told. And it turns out to be sage advice. “I don’t break the socket any more, and if I did I would not lose my head,” Bomgard admits.Doris Lessing on Mikhail Bulgakov's gift for survival Life might throw up many things to worry about, countless disasters to tackle, but with the right support, the upshot can be a wealth of experience, a sense of survival and a dose of compassion for the experiences of others. And, if you are lucky, a glass of vodka to boot.
