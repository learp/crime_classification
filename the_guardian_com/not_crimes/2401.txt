The National Trust has branded the wet summer of 2012 "apocalyptic" for British wildlife. Citing the number of species – including butterflies, bees and puffins – adversly affected by the rain and lack of sunshine, the trust's conservation adviser warned of "local extinctions" of vulnerable animals and plants. The big winners appear to be slugs and snails, and mosses have also done well in the damp.Tell us what you've noticed in gardens, parks or the countryside near you. Are we experiencing a "silent summer", free of the buzz of bees and croak of frogs? And what of our friends the gastropods?
