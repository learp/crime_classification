Dollmaker Liz Lee fondly remembers the thrill of visiting her grandmother’s house and peering into the glass-fronted cabinet of treasures she kept.Surveying her own collections today gives her a similar tingle of delight. “My style is an eclectic jumble of antique, kitsch and nostalgia,” she says. Dainty china tea sets are a particular weakness. “I have boxes of chinaware – I can’t help myself. If I spot a beautifully decorated 40s tea set, I’ll grab it and clasp it to my bosom! I have so many saucers that one stack is set aside just for feeding my chihuahua, Pixie.”The kitsch finds in Lee’s seaside cottage in Ramsgate, Kent, were won at amusement arcades and found in charity shops. Her horse brasses, copper pans and display cabinets crammed with all manner of mementoes are firmly rooted in an old-school tradition.

Her own collection not only features Italian handpainted dolls but also Tammys and Sindys – Britain’s more “wholesome” answers to Barbie. Pride of place on the landing goes to her Spanish doll. “When I was young, we all had pen friends abroad and there was a fad for sending each other dolls in national costume,” she says. “I longed to get a flamenco dancer, but never did – so I bought myself this one recently to make up for it.”So what does Lee think lies at the heart of her ongoing love affair with kitsch? “I think it’s very comforting,” she says. “Particularly in times of recession, there’s an urge to look back and try to reconnect with a past that seems much more appealing and safe.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘More wholesome than Barbie’: vintage dolls.

In the bathroom and guest bedroom, sherbert pink adds a more romantic 50s filter, while the bedroom is resplendent in the yellow, hot pink and black of a box of liquorice allsorts.

I’d just like to say: ‘Plenty of other colours are available…’”Lee has lived in Ramsgate for five years and says that, like its neighbouring towns in this corner of the Kent coast, the place is slowly changing. But the area remains a good hunting ground for all things vintage, including wool and fabrics, which Lee turns into clothes for the collectable dolls that she makes by hand. “Every few weeks another new shop or restaurant opens here,” she says. “One day it will become gentrified, but it’s a fair way off yet – thank goodness.”
