We are all relieved to hear that Love Actually star and Perfect Moment diva Martine McCutcheon narrowly avoided being in the vicinity of the terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge last month. During a discussion about “spooky sixth sense” experiences on ITV’s Loose Women on Wednesday, host Christine Lampard revealed that, thanks to an onset of intuition, she had pushed her husband, Frank, out of the way of some wonky scaffolding, mere seconds before a chunk of it fell on the exact spot where he had just been standing.McCutcheon solemnly recalled that after a recent meeting in London, she and her husband had decided not to take their usual route and drive over the bridge, opting instead for another, usually more busy road, right at the last minute. “We were supposed to be on that bridge at that time,” she declared, nodding when Lampard suggested to her that she had responded to a feeling that something was off, and a “flutter” (not that kind of flutter, as we all know from her Activia ads). “I did think, ‘Oh my God, what was that about?’ We never go the other way,” she said.Far be it for LiS to doubt the mysterious workings of the cosmos, but McCutcheon does also explain that the change of plan was down to the couple’s satnav suggesting they switch routes. Perhaps it had simply sensed that there was more traffic ahead than usual.Or perhaps MI5 may wish to look into its powers of prophecy. I know this government may balk at accessing the private information of its citizens, but it is in the national interest to find out what this satnav can do for all of us.
