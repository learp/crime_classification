Inside this book is a heart warming story of a girl called Melody who would love to be able to talk and walk. But sadly she cannot for she has cerebral palsy, preventing her from speaking and having control over her movements.As you follow this girl through her life, she will show you the hardships of cerebral palsy. But when Melody has finally found a way to talk, the normal kids are unsure of her. As you read this book you will learn to understand how hard it must be for those people who can’t talk or walk even though they might be dying to tell somebody so many different things.This book is beautifully crafted and written with understanding for those people who have disabilities. The description and the story are well thought out and there are parts that make you cry and parts that make you laugh. The twists and turns make you gasp and jump and the variety of ideas are fabulous.This is one of those books that is simply perfect and makes you want to read it over and over again.I recommend this book for ages 10 and up, seeing as there are some parts that might frighten young children. If you love a good story of friendship and seeing the main character fight for their right – then this book is for you. By the end of the book your heart will have warmed up towards Melody and remember that next time you see someone who has autism or a disability, smile and wave to show you understand them.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
