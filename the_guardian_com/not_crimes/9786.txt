This Friday we're joined at 1pm for an hour by birder and TV presenter Mike Dilger to answer your questions on birdwatching and the RSPB's Big Garden Birdwatch this weekend.With over half a million people counting birds in their gardens each year, the Birdwatch is the UK's biggest public wildlife survey. Participants are encouraged to download a recording sheet and then take one hour on 28 or 29 January to note the species they spot. The resulting data produces an annual snapshot of the health of Britain's birds.  Ecologist and TV presenter Mike DilgerDilger will be on hand on Friday for a live 'clinic' on your bird questions. Want to know the best food to attract birds in your garden, or the best time of day to do your spotting? Concerned about identifying species correctly? Or worried that you'll have trouble spotting them because of the mild winter which has seen garden birds stay in the country? Whatever your question about birds, birdwatching or the Big Garden Birdwatch, just post it below; please note anything off-topic will be removed.â€¢ Get the Guardian's environment news on your iPhone with our new app. You can also join us on Twitter, Facebook and Google+
