It was always intriguing to see how Nasir Mazhar would bring his style to the high street. As his last menswear show displayed, he mixes heightened street culture with silhouettes of sportswear to create clothes that look like a Sims version of an illegal rave in east London. This sense of walking through a video game is carried through in his capsule collection for Topman. Blurred rainbow tops and Global Hypercolor-blue meet football kit shorts and tops. The best of the bunch, though, is a pink towelling zip-up top. Twinned with a pair of shorts, it not only taps into the menswear tone of the moment but is also part of the mission to bring the towelling trackie out of the shame closet after Vetements collaborated with Juicy Couture for their Paris couture show. Mazhar’s top features a subtle, souvenir jacket-like paisley design and makes you look like you’re wearing Bagpuss. What’s not to love?
