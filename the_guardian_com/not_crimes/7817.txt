At last, chapter and verse on how Tesco treats its suppliers. For decades, farmers have been complaining about the exploitative practices of the big supermarkets. Now it is clear that, at least in Tesco’s case, there was an abuse of buying power. It was not even so consumers gained from low prices; it was all about impressing the financial markets with good profit margins. The inquiry by the groceries code adjudicator, Christine Tacon, found evidence of payments delayed to disguise missed targets, and suppliers left waiting for million-pound payments for up to two years. Sometimes there were arbitrary or unfair deductions from payments too. But although Ms Tacon found serious breaches of the groceries code, she was unable to impose a fine because at the time the offences were committed she did not have the power to impose financial penalties.Most of the evidence Ms Tacon investigated relates to the period before September 2014 when Tesco’s new boss, David Lewis, took over. He has apologised and insists that the days are over when his predecessor allegedly flattered Tesco’s bottom line with questionable accounting procedures. That matter is still under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.Encouraged by successive governments’ focus on cheap food and big profits, an unsustainable business model has become deeply rooted. Only last summer, nearly a third of the suppliers of the biggest supermarkets reported that the big chains rarely if ever observed the terms of the groceries code that was introduced in 2010. Now the groceries code has an adjudicator with real powers. That is an important first step to redressing the balance. But it is only the beginning of untangling a system where squeezed suppliers in the food industry employ workers, often from the countries of eastern Europe, on zero-hours contracts and the minimum wage. Bringing in a “national living wage” is another useful step. For as long as we buy most of what we eat from a few retail giants that can bully suppliers and ignore exploitation in the supply chain in order to make fat profits, the food industry will be based on a deceit. This is a system that perpetuates the big five’s advantage. Only strong regulation can mandate decent pay and a fair price for producers.• This article was amended on 28 January 2016 to add quotation marks around the words “national living wage” in accordance with the Guardian’s style guide.
