If it hadn't blinked, I might have trodden on the toad, whose olive green skin matched the mossy rocks at the entrance to White's Level lead mine. The on-off warning signal from its orange eyes caught my attention just in time.The amphibian, unmoved by its narrow escape, seemed to be surveying its domain, a shallow rectangle of pondweed and rushes. A century ago this was a reservoir, supplying hydraulic energy for crushing and washing lead ore hewn from the tunnel that stretches deep into the hillside. Now, like most of the mine ruins in this valley, it has become prime wildlife habitat. The horseshoe-shaped entrance to the mine level, just high and wide enough to accommodate a pony, hosts a luxuriant forest of ferns. A constant trickle of crystal-clear water flows out through a bed of watercress, into the swamp beyond, where the toad's spawn had long-since hatched.This is also a high-quality dragonfly-breeding site. As I knelt and peered into the water I could see a drama unfolding, as a predatory nymph stalked tadpoles among the water weeds, ready to impale its prey with needle-sharp jaws. In a month, fully fed nymphs will begin to climb the rushes and transform into aerial predators.Despite the mineral riches of this valley, its thin soil is starved of the soluble nitrogen and phosphorus that are essential for plant growth but so easily washed away by rainfall. On the edge of the reservoir, I found two plants that had evolved their own solutions to the challenge. Sickly yellow-green rosettes of butterwort, whose glutinous leaves trap and digest small insects, were unfurling along the boggy water margins. In late June they'll have accumulated enough nitrogen from their prey to produce dainty violet flowers. Nearby, parasitic marsh lousewort, whose roots tap into those of other plants, had already begun to form deep pink inflorescence, fuelled by nutrients stolen from surrounding grasses.Twitter: @seymourdaily
