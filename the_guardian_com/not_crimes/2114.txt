Boycotting unethical companies isn't the only way to exercise consumer activism (Only boycott for change, not to keep things the same, 17 January). Across the world – on high streets, in markets and online – a revolution is bubbling away. People are using their purchasing power to buy from social enterprises – a growing movement of businesses 68,000 strong in the UK alone – that sell products or services but reinvest profits for social good.Social enterprises like Pants to Poverty, Divine Chocolate and Belu water, to name a few, offer consumers an alternative to the companies driven only by short-term profit for their hungry shareholders. Next time you're thinking about buying underwear or groceries from the usual retailer, buy social instead and line the pockets of society rather than the wealthy few.Peter HolbrookChief executive, Social Enterprise UK• In common with Zoe Williams I have been boycotting Amazon since I learned about its tax affairs last year. However, unlike Zoe, this has proved to be a revelation rather than an inconvenience as I have obtained better deals from other suppliers, such as John Lewis and Waterstones Marketplace than I would have done from Amazon.I still check Amazon's prices before buying as this adds to my satisfaction of knowing not only that I have saved money, but in the last few weeks they have lost about £600 of my custom.Jennifer BrownWoodham Ferrers, Essex• Zoe Williams need not be inconvenienced by boycotting Amazon. I am boycotting it too and I checked my local independent bookshop's website and found a link to Hive.co.uk. It delivers for free to your local shop and I was pleased to find my book was cheaper than on Amazon. A proportion of the price is paid to the bookshop. I ordered my book last Saturday and it arrived on Tuesday.John WicksReading
