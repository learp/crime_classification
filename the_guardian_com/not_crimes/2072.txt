David Tennant is to return to the West End stage, playing a lothario in Patrick Marber’s play Don Juan in Soho.Tennant will star in a new production of the play at Wyndham’s theatre in London next spring, directed by Marber himself.Marber’s contemporary take on the classic Molière comedy Dom Juan, premiered at the Donmar Warehouse in December 2006, directed by Michael Grandage. Despite some good reviews and praise for its then leading man, Rhys Ifans, there was no West End transfer, meaning few people would have seen it.The Guardian’s Michael Billington said it offered “a rutting rake’s modern progress” but it lacked the “subversiveness” of Molière’s original.The Daily Telegraph’s Charles Spencer was far more enthusiastic, calling it “savagely funny, disturbingly dark and disgracefully sexy”.Tennant, helped by Doctor Who, is firmly established as one of the UK’s most popular actors. His last stage role was in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s production of Richard II, part of its King and Country cycle of plays presented at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York last spring.He is thought to have spent much of the summer and autumn filming what will be the third and final season of Broadchurch for ITV, reprising his role as DI Alec Hardy alongside Olivia Colman as DS Ellie Miller.The last time he appeared in the West End was also at the Wyndham’s, playing Benedick alongside Catherine Tate’s Beatrice in a memorable Josie Rourke version of Much Ado About Nothing in 2011.
