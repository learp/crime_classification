Samantha Bee took aim at the white voters who elected Donald Trump as president, claiming they have “ruined America”.Late-night hosts on Trump victory: 'It feels like the end of the world' On Full Frontal, Bee discussed the post-election hand-wringing that followed Trump’s victory. “Once you dust for prints, it’s pretty clear who ruined America,” she said. “White people. I guess ruining Brooklyn was just a dry run.”She continued: “The Caucasian nation showed up in droves to vote for Trump, so I don’t want to hear a goddamn word about black voter turnout. How many times do we expect black people to build our country for us?”Bee also spoke of the damaging effect that the result will have around the world. “Our democracy just hoicked up a marmalade hairball with the whole world watching,” she said. “What we did was the democratic equivalent of installing an above-ground pool. Even if we’re lucky and it doesn’t seep into our foundations, the neighbors will never look at us the same way again.”She also rejected the idea that a Trump presidency will lead to a great era for comedy. “Jokes don’t write themselves. Jews write jokes, and they are scared shitless,” she said.But she reminded viewers not to lose hope. “America is still a great country and it’s still worth fighting for,” she said. “It has Shonda Rhimes shows and peanut butter and Beyoncé and Lin Manuel-Miranda rap-weeping at award shows and it has the beautiful US constitution, which we should probably start teaching in schools.”Given that the majority of white women decided to elect Trump, she said: “Let’s get off the floor and get busy, especially you, white women. We’ve got some karma to work off.”
