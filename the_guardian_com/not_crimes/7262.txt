The first claim from the Russian authorities back in September, when FSB agents boarded the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, was that it contained high explosives and that the activists were planning a terrorist attack. A week later, despite Vladimir Putin admitting it was obvious they weren't pirates, the 28 activists who were part of a protest at oil drilling in the Arctic, along with two journalist observers held with them, were denied bail by the court in Murmansk while investigations into piracy charges continued. The jails where they are held are bitterly cold and the conditions basic. In a letter last week, one of the six British detainees, Alexandra Harris, described marking off the days "like slowly dying". A month on from their arrest, and the charge is now the lesser one of hooliganism, but there still seems to be no prospect of bail, let alone discharge. These are young idealists, not criminals, and they deserve praise, not prison.
