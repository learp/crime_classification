I’d want to have a dinner party at my home in New York. It has pale blue clay walls; the colour was mixed for me based on a Hopper painting in the Whitney. I wanted it to feel like you were in the sky …The room is dotted with Indian fabrics and bric-a-brac – silver candlesticks; a little ceramic tea set painted various shades of pink that my daughter made in New Orleans when she was quite young; framed photographs; a round terracotta bowl with antique silver Indian tribal bracelets. I’ve hunted and gathered things from all over.I have low, red-lacquered bookshelves everywhere, filled with cookbooks. I’ve been collecting them for 20 years. I’ve never counted them, but I know where they all are – they’re organised by author and cuisine. You want to be able to find your books, don’t you?It would be in autumn, when the light – and the trees – in NYC are at their most beautiful. I like that hinge moment in New England for its produce too: you’re still getting a lot of summer stone fruits and berries, but also the autumn’s fruit and veg; pomegranate, corn, squash, kale …I’d prepare the food myself, with my mother, Vijaya, and my daughter, Krishna. I’m a pretty simple cook, but I don’t like rushing – I want to enjoy cooking – so being well prepared when doing a dinner party is important to me.On the menu, there would be fried masala chicken, marinated in buttermilk, sea salt and sugar, then battered with Indian spices and chilli. There’d be rice, with black beans and spices. And there’d be lots of veg: fire-roasted corn with chilli, lemon and salt; sweet potatoes with cinnamon, maple syrup and butter, lots of black pepper; a mixed veg ratatouille with Indian spices; kale with green apple and pomegranate seeds ...And a cheese board: manchego, ossau-iraty, wensleydale with candied ginger, some beautiful cheddar and a mimolette, with kumquat and ginger chutney, based on a recipe my grandmother used to make. We’d have dessert at the same time: lychee and cardamom sorbet; and pochettes of cardamom creme anglaise with powdered sugar.It’d be a gathering of those close to us with lots of conversation and instrumental music on low: classical Indian violin, Django Reinhardt, Miles Davis.Padma Lakshmi is an actress, author and Top Chef host.
