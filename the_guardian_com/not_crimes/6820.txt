I love the Skulduggery Pleasant books. They are so entertaining and the author has a great sense of humour.The story follows a girl called Stephanie whose uncle dies. At the will reading, she finds out that her uncle has left her everything. There is a strange man at the reading. A few days afterwards, Stephanie is attacked and the same strange man who was at the reading saves her. He is a skeleton. Soon Stephanie finds out there is a whole other world of magic and sorcery living in her home town. She joins Skulduggery (the skeleton) as a partner and as a detective, and finds out that she has magic roots. Stephanie takes the name Valkyrie Cain and saves the world.It is such an amazing book and I would recommenced it to all, to definitely read it and the rest of the series which are all equally hilarious and entertaining. • Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
