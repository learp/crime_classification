Two security guards are in a critical condition after being seriously injured in an explosion at a former colliery in Nottinghamshire.The two men, aged 38 and 26, suffered serious facial burns in the blast at the former Welbeck colliery site, near Meden Vale, on Saturday. They have not yet been identified but are being treated in the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, where they are both said to be in a critical but stable condition.Nottinghamshire police said: "It is understood the men were working at the site as security personnel. Detectives are liaising with the site owners, UK Coal, with the fire service and the Health and Safety Executive to determine the sequence of events leading up to the incident."The explosion was reported at around 7.30pm on Saturday and involved an electrical sub-station above the ground.Nottinghamshire fire and rescue service said the explosion was from an electrical component in the 40m x 30m single-storey building.She added: "The fire itself was very small. The main issue was the explosion itself and the two people injured. Investigations are ongoing."According to UK Coal, the Welbeck site has not been a working colliery since May 2010. Shafts have been filled and a small team has remained on site decommissioning the mine which has exhausted three seams of coal since work on sinking the twin shafts began in 1912.In its heyday, Welbeck employed around 1,400 miners and had an annual output of around 1.5m tonnes.
