Confirmation that a severed head is a good match with an unidentified torso, and that a bent leg found on the Chatsworth Estate in Derbyshire actually belongs to a different body, sounds like the plot of a thriller, but this is the work of restorers preparing a star exhibit for a British Museum show on Sicily.One of the leading attractions of Sicily: Culture and Conquest, the first major British exhibition to examine the early history of the island, will be the reunited marble head and limbless body of a Greek warrior. It is now thought that the impressive statue of a stumbling soldier, a rare piece dating from 470BC, was designed to inspire and entertain people, much as a Hollywood epic might do today. Part of a 3D narrative tableau, it once told the story of a recent conflict, like frozen footage from an action blockbuster.“The ancient Greeks were subtle in their storytelling,” said British Museum curator Peter Higgs. “While the Egyptians and Babylonians tended to depict themselves trampling their enemy underfoot, the Greeks showed themselves fighting. It was very much propaganda, like a cartoon or an epic film. They also had guides at these key sites, who would take people around and explain the relevance of the statues.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The marble statue of a stumbling soldier was put together from a head, torso and thigh, each discovered at a different time.

Something pretty terrible is happening to him in battle and this quite modest restoration has brought it all back to life. It is as if the veins are pulsing again. Properly lit and mounted in the museum, it will almost appear to move.”The marble head was the first to be found, at the bottom of a well in Agrigento. The torso was discovered in the 1940s, and a third piece, a thigh, was located in 1968. “It is very rare to have a marble statue from Sicily at all, as there is no marble there naturally,” said Higgs. “So the stone must have been imported, or the complete statue shipped in. It would have been very expensive to commission. As a result, this torso has always been studied a lot.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Golden bowl decorated with bulls and dating from 600BC, found at a tomb in the hill village of Sant’Angelo Muxaro, near Agrigento.

The curator suspects this leg, although not part of the statue, may well have formed part of the same tableau.British Museum's new director brings lessons of German history “Other marble hands holding weapons have been found on the site,” he said, “and it looks as if they were part of the same work. Generic battle scenes were common at this period, showing Greeks fighting Greeks or in battle with uncivilised barbarians, such as Carthaginians or Amazons. It is how they reminded the people about their mytho-history.”The delicate restoration of the torso, loaned from the Museo Archeologico Regionale Pietro Griffo in Agrigento, has also revealed floral decorations on the helmet that would have been colourfully painted and a rougher area that might once have been bronze. The stumbling warrior, like the others engaged in the battle, would have been depicted with sun-tanned skin and might have been free standing or added to the structure of the Temple of Heracles at a later date.

The torso was initially thought to have been part of the gabled roof of the temple, close to where it was discovered.“These people lived with constant warfare around them,” said Higgs. “So this was an exciting visual entertainment they could all understand.”• Sicily: culture and conquest, 21 April to 14 August.
