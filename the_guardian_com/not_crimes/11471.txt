Photograph: AlamyGovernment officials have been pushing energy companies not to raise prices until after the next election in return for taking £50 of green levies off gas and electricity bills, several industry sources have told the Guardian.The sources confirmed a BBC report that gas and electricity firms are under the impression that they have been asked to keep down prices for an extended period, unless there were changes in international fuel prices - a claim dismissed by Downing Street on Friday as "utterly misleading".The BBC said the government was demanding a price freeze until mid-2015 as part of a wider deal on environmental levies. It is understood there has not been a ministerial letter to this effect but officials are putting pressure on the companies not to announce any more price rises for another 18 months.Sources said some companies are more receptive to this than others, with one claiming a year-long freeze is possible but waiting until after the election would not be feasible. There are also fears that they would then not be able to raise prices for an even longer period if Labour wins the next election, as Ed Miliband has promised a bill freeze for almost two years after that.There are currently intense negotiations between the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the energy companies over the cost of gas and electricity, as bills are due to hit a record of more than £1,400 a year on average when all the recent price rises come into effect.David Cameron is under pressure to ease bills after Labour's pledge to freeze energy prices put Miliband on the front foot on the rising cost of living.George Osborne is expected to unveil plans to cut green charges on energy bills next week, with the government targeting £50 of savings.One source at an energy company said between £20 and £25 could be saved by making changes to the energy company obligation (Eco) – a programme to cut energy usage for the most vulnerable households. Another £12 could be saved by shifting the warm home discount, giving poorer households money off their electricity bills, into general taxation. Network companies are also being asked to find some modest savings.However, Cameron's official spokesman insisted no request for a price freeze had been made during negotiations about the green levies, with Downing Street sources blaming it on a possible misunderstanding."The story is utterly misleading. The government has not asked for a price freeze. People should wait for us to announce our plans," the spokesman said.Miliband seized on the confusion to say Cameron looked like a "weak and flailing prime minister"."What we now know is that while David Cameron has in public been opposing an energy price freeze, in private he has been pleading with the energy companies to get him off the hook," he said."What Britain needs is Labour's strong, credible plan that we're publishing today to freeze energy prices until 2017 and reform a broken energy market so it properly works for business and families."Earlier, Miliband had pledged to "reset the broken energy market", promising that all energy bills will be simplified and use the same method to explain the cost of energy per unit and the precise standing charges.He laid out the idea in a green paper on energy, which included the implementation of its plan for a price freeze, and for how energy profits and trading can be made more transparent. The party also developed its idea for a new energy security board, which would be responsible for ensuring Britain's energy resources do not run out. It would take over the current responsibility from the National Grid and the current regulator, Ofgem.
