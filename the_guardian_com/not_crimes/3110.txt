Alex Marshall’s analysis of Jerusalem is unhelpful to the discussion about a new national anthem for England (Shortcuts, G2, 14 January). He misreads Blake’s intentions. The poem’s strength lies in its radicalism and hopeful expectation of England being a better place when it answers all of the questions in the first two verses with a firm no. The call for change in the next two verses is suitably aspirational: who wouldn’t, after all, want the realisation rather than the fantasy of a “green and pleasant land”.Mike DavisBlackpool• May I suggest we have an instrumental (Letters, 15 January). The Shadows’ Wonderful Land would be ideal – no words to offend and the opportunity for thousands of people at public events to play synchronised air guitar, while doing “the walk” and singing “dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang dang” etc.Toby WoodPeterborough, Cambridgeshire• The perfect anthem is Colonel Bogey. No words (ones you can sing out loud anyway), but players and crowds can whistle if they want to.David BealingCrayford, Kent • There are other contenders: Gilbert and Sullivan, He is an Englishman (Pinafore); or Flanders and Swann, The English, the English, the English are Best. Either should sate the patriotic feeling of superiority.Tim GosslingCambridge• Perhaps Billy Connolly had it right, suggesting the upbeat Archers theme tune instead of the dirge of God Save The Queen.
