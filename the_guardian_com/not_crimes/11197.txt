The RoverThe RSC has a hit on its hands with a revival of the Restoration comedy by Aphra Behn, the extraordinary playwright who predated the current glut of female writers in theatre by several hundred years.

Downstairs, Suzan-Lori Parks’s Father Comes Home From The Wars (to 22 October) charts the story of a slave offered his freedom if he fights on the Confederate side during the civil war; while Upstairs hosts Nathaniel Martello-White’s tale of secrets and hidden prejudices in a south London mixed-race family.Jerwood Theatres At The Royal Court, SW1, to 15 OctLGCCN Ballet De Lorraine      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Cadeau: CCN Ballet De Lorraine.
