How do the Tories do it (Theresa May set to be PM after Leadsom quits leadership race, theguardian.com, 11 July)? Bloody mayhem is established and within a matter of days there is a wholesale closing of ranks before the stupid Labour party can take advantage of the fiasco (did they even notice?). And now we have a summer of Tory consolidation (probably back towards “remain”) and Labour mayhem and bloodshed neatly leading up to the conference season. Wow, that is impressive politics!Gary BennettExeter• I think Andrea Leadsom has made the right decision. She will be able to spend more time with her children.Melanie WhiteReading, Berkshire• Home counties commuters’ problems with their privatised rail franchise (Commuters rail at ‘hell’ on Southern, 11 July) would be solved with railway renationalisation: a key policy of Jeremy Corbyn. Although apparently such policies make him unelectable and unable to connect with ordinary voters’ concerns.Matthew GeeNairobi, Kenya• Kathryn Hughes suggests that George Eliot would not have known the phrase “haves and have-nots” (Review, 9 July). Why not? It is first recorded in about 1739 and was used by E Bulwer-Lytton in his book Athens published in 1837, which she could well have read.Beverley Charles Rowe (Mr)Savernake, Wiltshire• In the 1960s an architect colleague, an émigré from Tito’s Yugoslavia, used to say that he always felt at home in Croydon (National Trust extols beauty and culture of … Croydon, 8 July). It reminded him of Belgrade! (I don’t think that was intended as a compliment.)David HutchinsonLewes, East Sussex• In the depths of post-Brexit gloom, I read (Report, 9 July) that a two-mile beer pipeline has been constructed in Bruges, and suddenly there is hope for the future. Thank you a thousand times.Bob BuryLeeds • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
