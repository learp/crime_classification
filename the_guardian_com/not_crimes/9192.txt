Green beer. Long queues. Silly hats.A tent in which you could learn about investment opportunities in Northern Ireland, manned by a bloke drinking a can of Guinness.Such was the scene two years ago in Yoyogi park, central Tokyo for the St Patrick’s Day “I love Ireland” celebration.

It’s also a day where things can get a bit... average, as this guy knows. But naffness, particularly on this of all days, is nothing to be scared of.
