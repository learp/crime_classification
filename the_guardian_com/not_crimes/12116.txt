Violet Markey is in a really bad place when she meets Theodore Finch on a narrow ledge, six storeys up, on the bell tower of their school. The two characters seem very different. Violet is a popular cheerleader with many friends whereas Finch, who often contemplates suicide, is regarded as a freak by most of the kids in their school. Violet is still trying to come to terms with the death of her sister in a road accident and although her parents are lovely they are a bit over protective because of their grief.You will warm to both characters as they try to save each other from the burdens they are carrying but Finch is the one who really captures your heart even though you can imagine how difficult he would be to live with. Violet is hailed as a heroine for rescuing Finch and makes him promise not to tell anyone why she was really up on the roof.The two of them become close when they embark on a school geography project together. They go wandering to the farthest corners of their state and enjoy amazing experiences together, made more beautiful because of Finch’s uncanny perception of reality. It is so sad that although he has the power to heal Violet through what he does and says, he cannot heal himself. I love the way that the story is told through the main characters in turn and Finch’s words to Violet are incredibly memorable. The ending is predictable but haunting and I became increasingly angry at the fellow students who seemed to be without compassion and the adults who seemed to have no understanding of Finch at all. Although it is sad, this book is beautifully written and its messages of hope and love will remain with you for a long long time.
