A giant naked man and woman have been painted by a controversial street artist on a building in Geelong – but the council says it won’t censor the images.'Classic Sydney': council orders removal of two-storey nude Kim Kardashian mural Melbourne city council has already painted over several paintings by street artist Lushsux, which feature people taking naked selfies.The latest murals appeared on the Geelong Powerhouse building and feature full-frontal images of a man and a woman taking selfies.City of Greater Geelong’s planning manager Peter Bettess said the artworks on the disused power station would not be censored by the council.“These are on a private site, whereas the Melbourne piece was in a public laneway,” he said in a statement.“The human figure has been the subject for countless artists over thousands of years. There will no doubt be strong public opinion about the subject matter.”In March Lushsux painted a giant mural inspired by a Kim Kardashian nude selfie on the side of a building in Sydney. The City of Sydney council asked the owner of the wall, Zigi Ozeri, to remove the artwork after a neighbour complained.
