James Shapiro’s exploration of a pivotal year in William Shakespeare’s life and a novel about a utopian experiment in Detroit by Benjamin Markovits are this year’s winners of the UK’s oldest literary awards.Shapiro and Markovits were presented with the £10,000 James Tait Black prize at a ceremony at the Edinburgh international book festival on Monday night. Founded in 1919 by the widow of publisher James Tait Black, Janet Coats, the prize is awarded annually by the University of Edinburgh, after students and academics read more than 400 books to select the shortlist.1606: William Shakespeare and the Year of Lear by James Shapiro review – a fraught political and cultural moment Seeing off titles by David Hare, Sarah Knights and Ruth Scurr to win the biography prize, Shapiro’s 1606: William Shakespeare and the Year of Lear explores how the events of that year shaped the Bard’s writing as he wrote King Lear, Macbeth and Antony and Cleopatra. The book is a sequel to 1599, about another eventful year in Shakespeare’s life, which won Shapiro, a leading authority on Shakespeare, the 2006 Samuel Johnson prize.“Shapiro quite brilliantly interweaves the material found in the 1606 plays with the historical events of this momentous year, allowing us in the process new perspectives on familiar material,” said biography judge Dr Jonathan Wild. “He is particularly deft in the ways that he writes about often arcane detail for a non-specialist readership. This is ‘keyhole’ biography at its very best, and no reader could put this volume down without feeling enormously enlightened about Shakespeare’s work and times.”You Don’t Have to Live Like This by Benjamin Markovits review – utopianism meets racial distrust in Detroit Former basketball player and author Benjamin Markovits won the fiction category for his sixth novel, You Don’t Have to Live Like This. Set in a semi-derelict Detroit in 2008, around the time of the financial crash and Barack Obama’s election, Markovits’s novel follows a group of idealists who move to the area as a part of a social experiment to drive “the Groupon model of gentrification”. The Texan author, who now teaches creative writing at University of London, saw off shortlist competition from Beatlebone by Kevin Barry, The Wolf Border by Sarah Hall and The First Bad Man by Miranda July.Fiction judge Dr Alex Lawrie called Markovits’s book an “astonishing state-of-the-nation novel … You Don’t Have To Live Like This forces us to re-examine our own prejudices and advantages, and the impact these have on our willingness to behave in an ethical and socially responsible manner.”Previous winners of the fiction prize include Angela Carter, Cormac McCarthy, Ian McEwan and Evelyn Waugh, while famous winners in the biography category include Peter Ackroyd, Martin Amis, Hermione Lee and Claire Tomalin.The winner of a third category, for drama, which began in 2013, will be announced at the festival next week.
