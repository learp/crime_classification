Name: Weekend warriors.Age: You’re as young/old as you feel.Appearance: Saturdays and Sundays.Is this a battle re-enactment thing? Are people still doing that? Or have they all become preppers now? We should all become preppers now. But no. Weekend warriors are people who don’t exercise all week and then go nuts with it at the weekend.That doesn’t sound wise. Experts agree with you.

Still no.By the time I’ve settled for Don’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23 again, my arm can ache like I’ve been doing pull-ups. NO.Fine. It’s still good news. Yes. That said, the study’s senior author points out that, “for optimal health benefits from physical activity, it is always advisable to meet and exceed the physical activity recommendations”.Actually, I think I’m just going to hang around here a bit longer waiting for news about wine gums. I feel as though we’re on a roll. As you and your furry arteries wish.Do say: “I’m off to the gym!”Don’t say: “Can you bring me a Wagon Wheel from the vending machine when you come back? Thanks.”
