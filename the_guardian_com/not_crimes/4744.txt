There has yet to be a more impudent introduction at an awards ceremony than David Letterman’s majestic effort for one former Hollywood couple at the 1995 Oscars. “Here to present the award are Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon,” the host drawled, “Pay attention – I’m sure they’re pissed about something …” Primarily about that introduction, to see Sarandon and Robbins’s stony faces as they made their way on stage.Back to the present day, then, where Sarandon’s pick for the US presidential election is being treated vastly more reverentially. My theory is that Susan coming out for Green party candidate Dr Jill Stein is definitely the most coveted celebrity endorsement since Vote Leave managed to get Emma Thompson to come out for remain. Looking back, that was the six-pointer.So I am amused by a headline in Newsweek reading: “Susan Sarandon’s endorsement of Dr Jill Stein only helps Trump.” Only helps Hillary, surely? I mean, obviously the major endorsement Hillary would want would be for Barbra Streisand to come out for Trump. But in the absence of that big one, Susan is certainly not to be sniffed at.
