Raf Simons has been named as the chief creative officer of Calvin Klein. This appointment was widely expected in fashion, following the announcement in June that Francisco Costa and Italo Zucchelli, women’s and menswear creative directors respectively, would be leaving the brand. Simons – who left Christian Dior in October - will work across both men’s and womenswear for Calvin Klein.The announcement was made on social media – with a black and white image of Simons appearing on Instagram on Tuesday afternoon. The caption said he would be “chief creative officer of the brand, effective immediately” with his first collection for Calvin Klein for autumn/winter 2017, to be shown in September in New York. It looks like Simons will be very much in an overseeing role, to be supported by Pieter Mulier, his studio manager at Dior, who will now be creative director at Calvin Klein.

It now comprises around 25 product categories, with underwear and jeans brought back into the business in 2013. Steve Shiffman, CEO of Calvin Klein, was keen to emphasise the designer’s role of looking at the big picture, and to bring comparisons between Simons and Klein himself. “Not since Mr Klein, himself, was at the company has it been led by one creative visionary, and I am confident that this decision will drive the Calvin Klein brand and have a significant impact on its future,” he said. “Under his direction, Calvin Klein will further solidify its position as a leading global lifestyle brand.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Raf Simons’ collection for spring/summer 2017.

Simons, when leaving Dior, expressed a yearning for a better work-life balance. In a statement, he said his decision was “based entirely and equally on my desire to focus on other interests in my life, including my own brand, and the passions that drive me outside my work”. His own line is likely to continue (it did during his tenure at Dior) but those passions may take a hit with this new gig. The stewardship of a truly global brand – showing in New York, and based in Amsterdam with ambitions to reach worth of $10bn – was clearly a hard offer to pass up.

Similar territory is part of the Calvin Klein DNA, especially during its 90s heyday, when shift dresses designed by Klein were worn by former employee Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and adverts for perfume like Obsession featuring a naked Kate Moss, scandalised the general public. Other ads, with Mark Wahlberg and Moss wearing the underpants with branding on the waistband in 1991, are now infamous.

His was the first designer brand to make jeans. Launching in 1978, the company had sold $70m (£48.6m) worth of women’s jeans a year later. Klein sold his company to Phillips-Van Heusen (which owns Tommy Hilfiger) for $400m (around £300m) in cash, and more in stocks and royalties over the 15 years following the deal. Costa and Zucchelli, handpicked by Klein, have held the creative reins since.  Justin Bieber in the Calvin Klein #mycalvins campaign.

He launched his label in 1995, concentrating on menswear with youth culture references, and abstract shapes influenced by artwork and industrial design. He has worked well with other brands previously. Before signing on to Dior, he was creative director of Jil Sander for seven years.

This was after speculation that designers, including Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen and Christopher Kane, were up for the role. Chiuri will be the first woman to design for Dior in its 59 years. Judging by her work with co-designer Pierpaolo Piccioli at Valentino, where she has been creative director since 2008, she would bring a different, more romantic view to the house.
