BBC revives Tomorrow's World name for season of programmes Festivals have long been cosmic experiences – havens of music and hedonism designed to whisk you away from reality for 72 hours. Of course, those mind-melting moments usually arrive at 6am in the dance tent rather than watching someone in a lab coat wielding a telescope. Not so in 2017. Blame Brian Cox, blame The Big Bang Theory, but music festivals have gone giddy for geekery.“It simply isn’t enough to put bands on in a field anymore,” says Paul Reed, general manager of the Association of Independent Festivals. “Anyone with money who wants to take a huge gamble can do that.” He says areas such as science are a natural step for experiential boutique festivals, which offer alternative activities alongside the music, and who are keen to broaden their audiences and offer them “a more cerebral experience”.One such festival is Deer Shed in North Yorkshire. Since 2013 its science tent has gradually grown into a phantasmagoria of dorky delights, mostly geared towards children. This year forensics and slime-making workshops sit alongside live spectrograms, which allow you to “see” your own voice, modular synth-making sessions and another in which you can solder your own lie detector – perfect for nippers and hungover parents alike.

Events such as Also festival in Warwickshire and Bluedot at Jodrell Bank observatory are aimed more at adults. The former has been billed as a “small festival” with “big ideas” and also been likened to Ted talks in a field. Bluedot, meanwhile, returns this year after its 2016 debut with an astronomy-heavy lineup alongside the musical bill. Its science programme includes talks on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, the future of humans in space and the anatomy of a solar eclipse – as if the complex time signatures of musical headliners Alt-J weren’t boggling enough.Talks such as these bring some sense, says its organisers, to our unsteady world. “People are much more interested in science and its place in our lives; we’re all aware that science and technology will shape the future,” says Prof Tessa Anderson, science-culture director of Bluedot. “It really expresses a new zeitgeist; [science] is the natural counterbalance to the ‘post-truth’ manipulation of information.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Wish you were hair: Brian May, co-creator of Starmus festival.

Four years ago he teamed up with fellow astrophysicist Garik Israelian to create Starmus festival in Norway, designed to enhance our knowledge of the universe via science and the arts.“As a child I was forced to choose between art and science as if they were mutually incompatible,” says May. “I never believed it. I think the Victorians got it right: to be complete human beings, we need an appreciation of everything the universe has to offer.” As for what Starmus has to offer, there’ll be headline talks from Stephen Hawking, Buzz Aldrin and Brian Eno, and performances from guitar hero Steve Vai and the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra.Elsewhere, dance music festivals have taken the tech up a notch to explore the relationship between listening to and making music. North Carolina’s Moogfest has hundreds of sessions with geektastic names such as For the Love of Audio Gear and 3D Audio Space Jam, while, in the UK, Sheffield’s No Bounds preps for the main October event with a launch party in June where there’ll be coding workshops followed by shedding some cells to a set by DJs Nina Kraviz and Helena Hauff.

It’s about change, growth, movement and hopefully progress.” A little highfalutin it might be, but events such as these hark back to the hippy days when festivals were seen as incubators of change: beards and weirds coming together in an attempt to create accord during difficult times.If the geek will indeed inherit the Earth, then, it looks like their benign takeover starts with its festivals.Deer Shed, North Yorkshire, 21-23 July; Latitude, Suffolk, 13-16 July, Also, Warwickshire, 30 June-2 July; Bluedot, Macclesfield, 7-9 July; No Bounds, Sheffield, 9 June, 13-15 October; Starmus, Trondheim, Norway, 18-23 June; Moogfest, North Carolina, US, 18-21 May
