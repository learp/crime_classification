Harriet is recovering from an illness, so to strengthen her weak legs her doctor recommends that she goes ice skating. Harriet is entranced by skating and especially Lalla, an amazing skater who has lived with her aunt since the death of her famous parents. Harriet soon becomes best friends with Lalla and they start to share ice skating lessons but when both girls realise that Harriet has a natural talent for skating, everything changes. Will Harriet save her friendship or carry on with her skating journey?I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to girls aged 8-12. I love this book because the characters are really relatable and the plot has plenty of twists so you never lose interest. Although this book has a lot about ice skating in it, you do not need to know a lot about it to understand the book as most of the skating terms are explained. I would warn younger and less confident readers that the language is quite difficult as the book was written a while ago. I found this book a lovely read and I am sure many other children would too.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
