The Lego Batman Movie has won the weekend for the second week in a row at the US box office, easily holding off the challenge of Fifty Shades Darker (also in its second week) and new arrival The Great Wall.The Lego Batman Movie review – funny, exciting and packed with gags According to estimated figures, Lego Batman came in with $34.22m, a drop of 35% from last weekend’s $53m – holding up well compared with Fifty Shades, which lost 55% to end with $20.97m. The previous weekend’s contest had been much closer, with the latter film managing $46.61m, and going on to top the full week chart (taking $68.69m to Lego Batman’s $64.56m) – presumably due to its popularity on Valentine’s Day, when it took $11m.Both films comprehensively defeated The Great Wall, the Zhang Yimou-directed fantasy action thriller starring Matt Damon, which arrived in America on the back of huge success in China (over $170m) as well as an ongoing row about “whitewashing”. The Great Wall was not expected to set the US box office alight, and performed accordingly – taking $18.1m to land in third – but for a film budgeted at $150m it will count as a nut not cracked.The Great Wall review – Zhang Yimou’s damp squib of a gunpowder plot Hidden Figures, Split and La La Land are still plugging away in the lower reaches of the chart, with $7.1m, $7m and $4.5m respectively: all have taken over $120m each and now appear as box-office evergreens. That cannot be said of A Cure for Wellness, the Gore Verbinski horror film that flopped to No 10 in the chart in its opening weekend, with $4.2m, having failed to shake off controversy over its “fake news” marketing campaign.
