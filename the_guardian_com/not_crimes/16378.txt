Edinburgh festival 2016: comedy shows that should deliver Max & IvanSaunas are a great way of losing weight, but the fringe is the only place you can shed those pounds while fully clothed, crammed in a shipping container and watching an hour of improvised Shakespearean battle rap.Max & Ivan are at Pleasance Dome, to Sunday 28 AugustPajama Men  If you’re worried you might laugh at an upcoming funeral, why not get those giggles out early at a fringe show?Pajama Men are at Assembly, George Square, 22-25 AugustEmma SidiIt’s a place to get adventurous with your drinking. The festival will have a sponsorship deal with a drink you’ve never tried but will now worm its way into your life. Ever since last year’s fringe I’ve been addicted to leading sponsor Disaronno. I mean, Disaronno, guys. Emma Sidi is at Pleasance Courtyard, to Sunday 28 AugustMassive Dad      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Massive Dad.

Studies show that the high altitude means that, when you laugh, you’ll get a workout or, at the very least, one ab. Everyone loves one ab.Massive Dad perform as part of Massive Lazy Girls at Pleasance Courtyard, 24-28 AugustTony LawForget the ‘comedy’, this town is full of geniuses during August. Go to many shows with this ‘comedy’ and chances are the universe’s secrets will be revealed.Tony Law is at Assembly Hall, to Sunday 28 AugustAndrew Hunter MurrayProperty is getting more expensive, and yet for the entire month of August friendly young people offer out rudimentary roofing tiles in the form of flyers. A boon for anyone trying to get on the housing ladder.Andrew Hunter Murray is at Pleasance Courtyard, to Monday 29 AugustStandout success: Edinburgh's Free Fringe is no comedy graveyard Naz Osmanoglu      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Naz Osmanoglu.

By giving just one or two days out of your August to visit these poor souls, you can give them the ego-boost they deserve.Naz Osmanoglu is at The Mash House, to Sunday 28 AugustDeliciously StellaYou might not know that a solid hour of laughter burns as many calories as tossing 25,000 cabers.Deliciously Stella is at Pleasance Courtyard, to Sunday 28 AugustHarriet KemsleyYou should come to Edinburgh because there’s no sunlight so you almost definitely won’t get skin cancer.Harriet Kemsley is at The Caves, to Sunday 28 AugustLazy Susan      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Lazy Susan.

She simply could not compete.Lazy Susan are at Pleasance Courtyard, to Monday 29 AugustJoe LycettThe only reason to go to the fringe is the crepes. Every year I endure horrendous, sleep-depriving heartburn, but it is a cross I am happy to bear in return for the savoury delight of ham, cheese and pesto wrapped in fresh stodge at 3.30am.Joe Lycett is at Assembly Hall, 23-27 AugustEd GambleIt has been scientifically proven that coming to watch comedy at the fringe makes you a better person, prevents grey hair, spices up people’s sexual relationships and in 45% of cases, gives you X-ray vision. Also there are hills, so even after two days your calves will look buff ting.Ed Gamble is at the Counting House to Sunday 28 AugustKieran Hodgson      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Kieran Hodgson. Photograph: PRIn Edinburgh the length of the day decreases by 2:08 hours over the course of the month of August, an average daily decrease of 4:1 minutes, which, coupled with the median cloud cover of 74% and steady decline in mean high temperature, means that your summer is reaching the end of its natural lifespan no matter what you feel about it, and that it’s a great time to see some shows in a series of warm, brightly-lit indoor environments.Kieran Hodgson is at the Voodoo Rooms, to Monday 29 AugustMark WatsonThe fringe is the real thing if you have any interest in comedy. When people say they’re a comedy fan but they don’t generally go to Edinburgh, it’s like someone claiming to ‘love France’ when they’ve only ever seen ’Allo ’Allo. On top of all this, it is a great test of your hill-walking stamina and your liver’s endurance.Mark Watson is at Pleasance Courtyard, to Sunday 28 AugustJoel DommettIt’s the comedians’ Olympics, our World Cup, our Super Bowl. It’s the the culmination of year’s of work finally ready to show the paying public and bored reviewers. You should come and watch comedy in Edinburgh this summer because, frankly, the Olympics would depressing and very costly without anyone watching.Joel Dommett is at Pleasance Courtyard to Saturday 27 AugustAdam Hess      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Adam Hess. Photograph: Edward MooreSpending your summer break relaxing in the sun with a delicious cocktail in one hand and a good book in the other is so obvious. What better way to spend August than walking up overly-congested, rainy pavements while students dressed in second world war outfits put flyers in your hand about their play set in space.Adam Hess is at Heroes @ The Hive, to Sunday 28 AugustShane ToddOne night my entire audience was two American guys and my dad. My dad started texting half way through and it would just be good to get actual audiences in, really.Shane Todd is at Gilded Balloon Teviot, to Sunday 28 AugustRobin MorganWhy should you come and watch comedy in Edinburgh this Summer? I wouldn’t. They’ve banned Russians from attending. And there’s a real chance of contracting the Zika virus if you turn up. Oh, that’s the Rio Olympics, isn’t it. Come along then! It’s filled with Russians and no Zika anywhere.Robin Morgan is at The Caves to Sunday 28 August
