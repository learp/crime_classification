Hands up if you can guess what happens in pay-TV channel TLC’s new show Undressed … yup, you guessed it. Billed as a “courageous dating experiment”, it sees two strangers undress each other and “climb into bed on a first date in an exciting new series that accelerates intimacy and explores the accepted rules of attraction”, according to Katie Hopkins’s channel TLC. The couple have 30 minutes alone together wearing nothing but their underwear, during which they will be given “probing” questions via a screen and tasks “designed to rapidly foster relationships”. Blimey – it makes First Dates look like the Antiques Roadshow. After the 30 minutes the couples decide whether to continue the date or leave the room. According to Discovery Networks International acting head of factual Mark Procter: “It’s a gloriously simple format but an irresistibly watchable show.” Procter said it was created for Discovery’s Italian networks. At the risk of affirming national stereotypes: funny that.
