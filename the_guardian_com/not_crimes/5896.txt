Almost every time I drive through this area, just north of Inverness, I see red kites, although sometimes only one. So last weekend was a surprise, with six different birds seen. No matter how often I see them they are, for me, very moving, as if they typify birds of prey. They just seem to float along, with the ever-twisting forked tails their hallmark.However, last weekend was different, as seeing each bird filled me with sadness, gloom and frustration. I have lived in this part of the Highlands for more than 30 years, so the recent poisoning of at least 16 red kites and six buzzards in one small area seems very personal.Normally, one effect of seeing a red kite is to remind me of my favourite poet, John Clare (1793 – 1864) whose words seemed to embody the image of these birds: "Ah, could I see a spinney nigh, / A puddock riding in the sky / Above the oaks with easy sail / On stilly wings and forked tail." Clare knew these birds as red kites, puddocks or gleeds.Clare's lines did come back to me as I saw the various red kites last weekend but seemed to have lost their depth of meaning after the senseless poisoning.I used to live very close to where the first red kite release cages were, and even shared the same view of the strath that the young birds would have had. I was even privileged to be present when one of the releases of the juveniles took place and they flew for the very first time.One red kite epitomised the poisoning, as it had been a male chick in a nest on the Black Isle; its wing tag, for identification, was D9. It was ringed and wing-tagged with two of its siblings on 19 June 2013 and it was found poisoned on 24 March 2014. The huge reward of £32,000 that has been offered has come from the RSPB, local landowners, an anonymous donor and the public.
