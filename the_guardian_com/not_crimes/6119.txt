Tackling a fraught and nuanced subject in an awards acceptance speech can often be a perilous endeavour, and Star Wars actor John Boyega has become the latest celebrity figure to hurriedly clarify comments made amid the high emotion of a moment of triumph.Diversity in the film industry was the political hot potato grasped by the 24-year-old actor as he accepted the best male performance gong at the Screen Nation Film and Television awards on Saturday evening.“To complain about what is going on is not going to benefit us,” said Boyega, whose career hit global prominence after playing disaffected stormtrooper Finn in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.“Be the change you want to be,” he said. “Be the change. And continue and focus.” In a series of tweets sent in the early hours of Sunday, the London-born actor apologised for those who interpreted the comments as meaning people should not complain about a lack of diversity within the industry, and that he was only targeting those who did not match their rhetoric with action. His comments follow a row over perceived lack of recognition for non-white actors that became the defining controversy of this year’s Oscars, with a series of people opting to boycott last month’s ceremony.Boyega said was “quite fearful” he had inadvertently misled people with the comments.John Boyega (@JohnBoyega)Regarding my comments at the screen nation awards (just to clarify) I am not saying that complaints are invalid or should not be heardMarch 20, 2016John Boyega (@JohnBoyega)I am saying that words without action can't help right now. I agree that we need to be heard but some do the talking and no work.March 20, 2016John Boyega (@JohnBoyega)But I do agree ! I didn't clarify. I was full of emotion receiving the award and just wanted to say that there was work to be done.March 20, 2016John Boyega (@JohnBoyega)I'm not in this position without the people that champion me. I was in Peckham struggling not too long ago.
