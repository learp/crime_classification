The BBC’s rivals have branded its climbdown on mothballing thousands of recipes on its website a “cynical” U-turn, saying it flies in the face of the corporation’s promises to be more distinctive with its content.On Tuesday, the corporation reversed its initial decision to archive more than 10,000 popular recipes from its BBC Food website – following a public outcry – instead saying they would be moved to BBC Good Food, which is run by its commercial arm.The corporation had said it would look to cut so-called “soft” content, such as the BBC Food website, to help commercial rivals which have argued that the corporation’s move beyond its core news remit is damaging their ability to attract digital traffic.BBC climbdown over online recipes after public outcry “This looks like a cynical move now that the government’s white paper is out,” said a senior executive at one BBC rival. “Now it is out they appear to have played the ‘poor BBC’ card to galvanise everyone against changes. Moving recipes to another BBC-branded website is hardly helping commercial rivals.”Unlike the licence-fee funded corporation’s main website, recipes on BBC Good Food run next to advertising, which commercial rivals fear could be a threat.BBC Good Food is the biggest standalone cooking site in the UK, averaging 13 million visits a month, according to figures from SimilarWeb.The second biggest competitor, JamieOliver.com, is less than half the size at an estimated 5.3 million visits per month.A spokesman for Jamie Oliver said the company had “no direct comment” on the BBC’s move to dramatically increase the content on BBC Good Food.Commercial publishers, in particular newspapers, have been vigorous in calling for curbs on the BBC’s expansion into areas such as “soft” news, magazine “lifestyle” content, and celebrity columnists.“It is encouraging to see BBC announcing reductions in competitive websites,” said Ashley Highfield, chairman of UK newspaper trade body the News Media Assocation. “Ofcom needs to ensure this translates to real reduction in users and traffic to content that the market can provide.”The BBC is a behemoth when it comes to attracting eyeballs to its web activities.In April, the main BBC website attracted almost 2bn page views with the corporation holding an almost 30% audience share of the UK online news market, according to SimilarWeb.Mail Online, the next biggest player in the UK, is only just over a fifth the size.In an analysis of the BBC website, SimilarWeb found that of the 8,531 most popular individual web pages visited the food website was ranked 121st.BBC entertainment and arts coverage, another area rivals would like to see cut back but has not been, is ranked by SimilarWeb as the 15th most popular place people visit.After the homepage, and the news landing page, sport and football rank the third and fourth most popular.In his speech to parliament delivering the white paper, culture secretary John Whittingdale, said the BBC should not see commercial players as rivals but should “proactively seek to enhance, bolster and work in partnership”.
