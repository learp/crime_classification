This is a glorious time of year for confectionary lovers, and in a few days time I’ll embark on my annual mission to hoover up boxed chocolates with customary enthusiasm.  My mission includes house visits, so although I would favour Fairtrade artisanal chocolate brands with top notch ethical sourcing, I can’t always choose.The good news is that there is evidence the big chocolate brands are wising up with regard to their supply chain. Ethical labels are now widely used on Christmas chocolates in Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden.It’s true that current standards are still dismally low; West African cocoa production in particular is intrinsically linked with modern day slavery. But this scramble to include “ethical” symbols shows that many chocolate makers have finally realised they must invest in a sustainable supply chain for their key commodity – cocoa.Big Chocolate (the corporations that control the market) has invested in sustainable production programmes. For example Lindt & Sprüngli sources 100% of its West African cocoa bean supply from Ghana and runs a major sustainable farming programme. Ferrero states that by 2020, 100% of its cocoa and sugar cane will be certified as sustainable.But research also shows that in countries such as China, where the festive chocolate box count is now huge, sustainability isn’t under scrutiny and many brands don’t make ethical efforts. This extends to packaging. A chocolate box destined for Germany will be packaged in recyclable materials, but for China is packaged in rigid plastic. This is what we call an ethical pick and mix.Brands should be aware that as chocolate watchers (and eaters), we appreciate your efforts so far, but know you could do better. The big picture: iAnimal      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A world of pain: factory farmed chickens. Photograph: Animal EqualityAnimal Equality, the animal advocacy organisation, wants you to get the big picture with iAnimal (ianimal.uk), a 360-degree virtual reality experience of the lifecycle of factory-farmed animals from birth to death featuring footage from 13 investigators in six countries, including the UK. The experience is narrated by actor Amanda Abbington, who broke down in tears when she watched the footage for the first time.Well dressed: embroidered linens and bags      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Stitched up: many embroiderers are exploited.Embroidery and embellishment is overlooked in fashion – except in the rarified echelons of haute couture – so embroiderers can be among the most exploited. Most consumers assume embroidered products are added cheaply by machine. So it’s cheering to see this skill used as an opportunity.SEP Jordan, a luxury, sustainable accessories brand, has created an embroidery business employing women artisans in refugee camps to embroider linen shawls, keffiyeh scarfs and clutch bags (stocked in the UK by clerkenwell-london.com). Palestinian refugees in Jordan are subject to restrictions on employment and free schooling, and it’s worse for women. Now, thanks to this initiative, these woman can earn using the traditional cross-stitch techniques passed down from one to generation to the next.
