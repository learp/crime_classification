The UK independence party will accuse anti-fracking "eco-freaks" of trying to kill off "the greatest new economic opportunity for our country in our lifetimes" on Friday.In a speech at the Ukip party conference in London, energy spokesman Roger Helmer will say: "I have absolutely no sympathy for the rent-a-mob protesters, the swampies and the Occupy Movement and the anti-capitalists and eco-freaks who have sought to hijack the Balcombe protest."Balcombe in Sussex is the site of the most high-profile protests against fracking company Cuadrilla, whose exploration for shale gas in Lancashire led to minor earthquakes.Helmer, MEP for the East Midlands, is a resolute climate change sceptic who rails against "climate hysteria" and claims "current changes in climate are entirely driven by natural forces", despite the world's climate scientists and governments agreeing there is overwhelming evidence that carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning is driving global warming.Helmer will also propose that tax revenues from shale gas exploitation should be invested in a sovereign wealth fund to ensure long-term benefits for the UK. George Osborne and David Cameron have enthusiastically backed shale gas exploration, claiming fracking will reduce energy bills, but Helmer will concede this may not be the case.The energy secretary, Ed Davey, argues shale gas development can be consistent with tackling climate change and that environmental risks can be managed. Green campaigners say those risks are too great and that fracking distracts from the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.Helmer will say there is no truth behind "scare stories" promoted by green groups and Russian and middle east oil and gas exporters about potential environmental effects from fracking, citing an essay by ex-Northern Rock chairman and climate change sceptic Viscount Matt Ridley."I have no time for Vivienne Westwood and Bianca Jagger and [Green party MP] Caroline Lucas, who subvert residents' proper concerns for their own political ends," he will say. His speech will include a number of jibes aimed at Lucas – who was arrested while protesting at Balcombe."I sometimes think that Caroline Lucas won't be happy until every household in the UK has to subsist on an acre and a cow," he will say. "But then again, the Greens don't like cows, because they burp methane."Helmer will dismiss concerns within the party over its stance in favour of fracking and against windfarms, insisting the turbines are "a non-solution to a non-problem".• This article was amended on 20 September 2013.
