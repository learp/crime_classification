The rough track up from Redmires to Stanage Pole used to be dismal, so deeply rutted that even off-road vehicles were forced out onto the moor alongside. Now it is closed to motorised traffic and the surface repaired. Its folkloric status as Roman is debated, but this is undoubtedly an old road, used for centuries by travellers crossing the moors. It linked Sheffield to the villages of northern Derbyshire and beyond the western moors ringing the horizon to Manchester. There are still worn flags or “pitchings” in a few places, laid in the eighteenth century as horse-drawn carts were replacing pack animals. On the crest of the moor is a tall wooden pole to help the weary and confused navigate in driving rain or blowing snow.Or at least, there used to be. As I toiled uphill, something was nagging at me, but only when the wide views of the Derbyshire moors opened out did I realise what it was. The pole had gone. Its footing had been among a group of boulders at the top of the climb, but the hole was now empty, as though a tooth had been pulled. Someone had laid a small posy of sunflowers on top of the rocks, which I took as an act of remembrance for a familiar landmark.These boulders are smothered in initials, some ancient, some modern. “TM” for example carved his in 1631. A large “H” is likely for Hathersage, the neighbouring parish to those of Sheffield and Ecclesfied that all have their boundary here. Historians have suggested the older initials are those of parish surveyors checking the boundary’s condition; there are claims there was a pole here as early as the 1550s. It was last removed in 1915 – by vandals. This time it was the national park, concerned that its replacement, now a century old and rotten, might fall on someone’s head. A larch from the woods at North Lees will soon replace it.
