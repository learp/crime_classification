An interlude between storms brings realisation of increasing warmth from the sun and the onset of spring. In treetops the sound of chattering goldfinches replaces that of roaring wind. Runoff from the waterlogged fields abates, but farmers with lambing ewes anxiously await a rain-free period and drier pastures for their increasing flock. Drifts of snowdrops thrive on the edges of abandoned market gardens and, now that fallen trees have been cleared off the road beside the millstream, dog walkers and visitors can again converge on the Cotehele estate.Upstream, the rough and sunken lane towards Barrett's Mill is like a streambed. Rain and rabbits have bared earthy hedge banks; leaf-mould accumulates in sinuous shoals beneath overhanging boughs of ivy and leaning hollies. Among the eroded stones are pale lumps of unburnt limestone – remnants from the cartloads of lime once hauled to adjoining fields from riverside kilns. The morning sun peeps above the opposite bank and lights up east-facing patches of shiny pennywort, scaly male and soft shield ferns, green and untouched by frost. Towards the valley bottom, bedrock is worn into channels which reveal the white vein quartz, altered shales and brown oxidised pyrites of the metamorphic aureole around the granite – the zone of altered rocks where lodes were mined for precious ores.Across the fast-flowing stream, beneath the col between Kit Hill and Hingston Down, Wheal Brothers was famed for its rich silver deposits. In the 1830s shares in this venture soared from £5 to £2,200. Ruins of the mine are overgrown and surrounded in mud. Water pours down the walled-in shaft and gushes through the narrow wheel pit which housed the 30ft water wheel. The sheer sides, excavated through rock, are covered in mosses and liverworts, all running with water. Such was the renown of this prosperous mine that an adit and subsequent shaft were dug more than a mile to the south. The resultant Snell's Wheal Brothers produced quantities of sparkly quartz crystals and spar stones (found in hedges and walls near home) but no silver bonanza.
