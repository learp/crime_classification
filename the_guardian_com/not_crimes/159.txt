1 Sculpture In The CityJaume Plensa’s Laura is a spooky colossal head whose dimensions change as you move towards it – is it flat or round, a picture or a sculpture? This powerful and haunting portrait is one of the thought-provoking artworks placed in the plazas of the City of London for its enjoyable sculpture trail. Mat Collishaw, Enrico David, Gavin Turk, Sarah Lucas and William Kentridge all help add a bit of unpredictability and imagination to the hard-headed streets of the capital’s financial district.Various venues, to May 20172 Ragnar Kjartansson      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Bath and guitar... Ragnar Kjartansson’s The Visitors. Photograph: Elisabet DavidsdottirArt has never been so much about performance, happenings, live events, the moment. The 21st-century avant garde has all but abolished the boundaries between art, theatre, music and dance. Icelander Kjartansson is the new king of this radical theatricality. His art can mean anything from a play to personally singing a sad song, backed by full orchestra, over and over again. This exhibition includes his video installation The Visitors as well as an eight-hour performance by singing troubadours.Barbican Art Gallery, EC2, to 4 Sep3 Olivia Webb      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Hear me now... Olivia Webb’s Voices Project.In More Lasting Than Bronze, Webb explores the power of the human voice to awaken memories and preserve the history of a community. This choral sound work commemorates churches that were destroyed by the 2011 earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand. Even if you are not a fan of a cappella sound art, it’s well worth making a detour to Trinity Apse, a medieval church of huge historical significance.Trinity Apse, Edinburgh, to 28 Aug4 Painter’s Paintings      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   In plain sight... Edouard Manet’s The Execution of Maximilian. Photograph: The National GalleryA fascinating journey into the personal art collections of Edgar Degas, Henri Matisse, Lucian Freud and more. It’s moving and illuminating to see the paintings Picasso gave to his rival Matisse, learn that Jasper Johns now owns a Cézanne that once belonged to Degas, and find out why Degas went to heroic lengths to save a ruined masterpiece by Manet. This is a glimpse of the hidden threads of influence and admiration that connect great artists across time.National Gallery, WC2, to 4 Sep5 Graham Fagen      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Into the light... Graham Fagen’s A Drama in Time.Fagen’s neon installation at Jacob’s Ladder is a staircase that ascends from the depths of old Edinburgh to the highest point of the “new” city. One of Fagen’s discoveries is that Robert Burns planned to become a slave overseer in Jamaica. That fact weaves into his historical illuminations along with the vision of town planner Patrick Geddes who rightly called this city “a drama in time”.Jacob’s Ladder, Edinburgh, to 28 Aug
