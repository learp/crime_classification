It is said to be the largest man-made reef in the world. Inspired by Atlantis, it is composed of elaborate cement columns and lion statues, all navigated with a symbol-heavy map that wouldn't disgrace a Dan Brown novel.But this reef is not your average ocean ecosystem; it's an underwater cemetery operated by the Neptune Society, "America's trusted cremation service provider since 1973". Neptune Memorial Reef, 40ft beneath the Florida waves and just over three miles off Key Biscane, is the world's first underwater mausoleum. Only here can you have your ashes set into a plot and, literally, sleep with the fishes in a park that will eventually span 16 acres and 125,000 burials. Meanwhile, the family can visit by boat, snorkel or scuba tank.The society – which has millions of "members" – mainly specialises in "sea scattering", with boats leaving locations on both coasts of the US every week. Earlier this year, the Neptune Society began promoting its services with seminars held in cafes and restaurants, inspired by the "death cafes" seen in France and Switzerland. The organisation offers lunch and an obligation-free chat about the practicalities of the hereafter – and the desirability of a client's "pre-need" plans. And, while the memorial reef isn't yet part of their everyday funeral sales bumf, it's pushed on the society's website as "a new tradition of visiting loved ones". It certainly beats a rose bush.
