The comedian Shappi Khorsandi has withdrawn her novel from the longlist for a new British book prize exclusively for writers of colour because she “felt like my skin colour was up for an award rather than my book”.The 12-book longlist for the inaugural Jhalak prize was announced on Thursday. The prize was established to recognise excellence among British black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) writers and inspire publishers within the industry to “look beyond the present narrow margins”.Longlisted authors include the former children’s laureate Malorie Blackman for her young adult novel Chasing the Stars, the Guardian columnist Gary Younge for Another Day in the Death of America and the historian David Olusoga for Black and British: A Forgotten History. Sunny Singh, the co-founder of the prize and chair of judges, said the longlist demonstrated “the strength, range and promise being produced by writers of colour in the UK today”.On Twitter, Khorsandi, who was listed for her first novel Nina is Not OK, said that while she was “massively flattered”, she was withdrawing the book “because my novel is nothing to do with ethnic identity”.Shappi Khorsandi (@ShappiKhorsandi)Because my novel is nothing to do with ethnic identity. Felt like my skin colour was up for an award rather than my book 😜 https://t.co/MQk9JzmkHWJanuary 5, 2017Singh told the Bookseller she was disappointed by Khorsandi’s decision but respected it.“The Jhalak longlist was compiled with much enthusiasm, love and respect for the extraordinary quality and range of work that was submitted,” she said. “The judges believe that each of the books on the longlist is there on literary merit and deserves as wide a readership as possible.”Khorsandi’s publisher, Ebury, which submitted the book for the prize, said: “Shappi’s decision to withdraw from the longlist is a personal one, which we totally respect.”Khorsandi, who is British and was born in Iran, wrote a memoir, A Beginner’s Guide to Acting English, in 2009. Nina is Not OK follows a 17-year-old who struggles to recall what happened to her during a night out with friends.In one passage, she describes herself as “not ugly, I’m alright looking. My dad was half Moroccan so I’ve got olive skin and big Arab eyes, but my mum’s thin English lips and my Auntie Geanie’s ski-slope nose. On a good day, I’m Pocahontas. On a bad day – on most days – I’m a cave woman.” The author and actor Richard E Grant praised Khorsandi’s novel as “unexpectedly moving, emotional and funny”.
