I think food producers – that webby, anonymous, unaccountable mass of random-mammal slayers – should take heart. Because the most revealing thing about the whole horsemeat scandal is how little it's been about the horsemeat. Most of the outcry surrounding the discovery of Dobbin bits in – well, everything – seems to be over the deception itself and not actually over what we've been deceived into eating. The cry is not, "But it was horse!" but, "You told us it was beef!"This, depending on your point of view, is either a commendably sensible response, bypassing as it does the usual sentimentality that surrounds all animals we are not in this country used to considering as food. Or it is a sign that most of the population is – as perusal of the bottom half of the internet has long suggested – now made up of the perennially-and-automatically-offended-but-only-by-the-nearest-and-most-obvious-thing-and-never-any-kind-of-underlying-moral-comma-cultural-or-other-issue.Either way, it suggests one important thing: that British people are now ready to eat horse. You've just got to label it properly. And sell it cheaply. That's not to say you need to be too brazen about it. It should be given the same advertising spin that would be granted any new product, so that it becomes "the pinto quarterpounder – 4oz of divine equine in every bun!" instead of "diseased nagburger patties" and so on, but actual lies are no longer necessary.The other point of outrage – a deeper, persistent bass note sounding under the shrill screeching of voices like hysterical violins – has not yet resolved into words. But when it does, they will probably read: "Why did you have to go and spoil everything?"Because if there's one thing I can tell you about humanity in general and the great British public in particular, it's that we already knew about the horsemeat and we were just maintaining a polite silence about the whole thing. I mean, not "knew" in the sense of "consciously understood or admitted to ourselves" that the 12p burger we were eating was probably not composed entirely of wagyu beef, but of something rather more lip- and anus-based. But "knew" in the sense that we could tell that the sums surely couldn't have been made to add up without a little creative accounting and Balkan slurry somewhere along the line.No one wanted to let daylight in upon the magic of being able to feed a family of four brown, beef-textured protein at every meal for under a tenner a week, and so a tacit don't-ask-don't-tell policy evolved. It was discreet, civilised and humane. Not for the horse, obviously, and not so great for the remaining cows that were involved either, but you can't have everything.But now the shutters are up and the sun is streaming in. And what it reveals is that, in fact, neither the producers nor the consumers really care what we eat, though we will be outraged if we are made to look like fools; if we seem to have been sold a pup. Metaphorically. Non-metaphorically, even the best ad agency would struggle to spin collie bolognese into the next bestseller. Unless it's really, really cheap, of course.
