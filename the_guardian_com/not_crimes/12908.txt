Most people in northern New South Wales oppose a shark cull, a survey by the University of Sydney has found.The research, released on the eve of an international shark summit in Sydney, found more than 80% of people in the Ballina region opposed lethal methods in response to shark attacks.The state’s premier, Mike Baird, was due to open the summit on Tuesday at Taronga zoo, where more than 70 experts from around the world have gathered share expertise about shark attack mitigation measures.Shark culling could indirectly accelerate climate change, study warns  The head of the study, Christopher Neff, said there was little public support for killing sharks in the area. “A majority of Ballina residents want the government to educate the public about human-shark encounters, invest in non-lethal technology and back more research into human-shark encounters,” Neff said.The minister for primary industries, lands and water, Niall Blair, said the summit was about developing a science-based approach. “We know that the number of encounters has increased but we also want to understand what’s happening in the conditions that may be leading towards that,” he told the ABC on Tuesday morning.“We know that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this and again. We have divers, we have surfers and we have just the everyday beachgoer.“We want to have a look at what’s available, we want to see if there are going to be options for us to trial here in NSW and we’re going to leave no stone unturned to try and do that.” The Humane Society International’s campaign director, Michael Kennedy, has congratulated the state government for reviewing non-lethal alternatives.Real-time shark tracking apps to be trialled at Australian beaches “We see the independent review and the consultation at today’s summit as the first step towards moving away from the archaic idea that killing sharks guarantees to protect humans,” Kennedy said on Tuesday. “The hidden cost of shark nets is the whales, dolphins and turtles that regularly get caught up in the nets. This is simply too high a price to pay for ocean wildlife.”There have been 13 shark attacks in NSW so far this year, up from three in 2014, and one person – a 41-year-old surfer, Tadashi Nakahara – has been killed. Additional aerial patrols will scan for sharks at beaches on the NSW north coast during the school holidays.
