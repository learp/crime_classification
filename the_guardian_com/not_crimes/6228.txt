More than 130 melon-headed whales, a member of the dolphin family usually found in the deep ocean, beached in Japan on Friday, sparking frantic efforts by locals and coastguards to save them.Rescuers were battling to stop the creatures’ skin from drying out as they lay on a beach about 100 kilometres (60 miles) northeast of Tokyo, while some were being carried in slings back towards the ocean.Television footage showed several animals from the large pod had been badly cut, with many having deep gashes on their skin.An AFP journalist at the scene said that despite efforts to get the dolphins into the water, some were being pushed back onto the beach by the tide soon after they had been released.A number of the creatures had died, he said, and were being buried.“We see one or two whales washing ashore a year, but this may be the first time to find over 100 of them on a beach,” a coastguard official told AFP.The pod was stretched out along a roughly 10-kilometre-long stretch of beach in Hokota, Ibaraki, where they had been found by locals early Friday morning.“They are alive. I feel sorry for them,” a man told public broadcaster NHK, as others were seen ferrying buckets of seawater to the stranded animals and pouring it over them.
