Pill testing is unlikely to breach New South Wales drug possession and supply laws, NSW police legal advice has revealed, in contradiction to claims by the police minister that testers were “most likely” to be acting illegally.Details of the advice are contained in a 2005 federal Department of Health and Ageing report, seen by Guardian Australia, which concluded it was unlikely a person conducting pill testing could be found guilty of possessing or supplying an illicit drug in NSW, or aiding and abetting an offence.According to the report, legal advice from the NSW police to the department said testers would not possess adequate knowledge that the substance they were testing was illegal in order to commit an offence, and would not hold the drug for long enough to have control of it.Mike Baird attacks drug experts' vow to trial pill testing even if it breaks the law However, it said “the question of criminality associated with the possession and use of testing kits would depend on the circumstances”.Drug users in possession of a prohibited drug would be subject to normal possession offences, the health department report said.NSW police told Guardian Australia it would continue to enforce the law at music festivals with regard to the illegal supply of possession of illicit substances, but did not respond to questions about its earlier advice that testing was unlikely to constitute supply or possession.The advice seemingly contradicts warnings the NSW deputy premier, justice and police minister, Troy Grant, issued on Monday that those running drug checking programs were in “a lot of legal jeopardy ... that they’re going to most likely end up possessing and potentially supplying these pills back”.“And if these pills go wrong and kill someone they may well be vulnerable to manslaughter charges,” he told 2UE radio.Drug testing advocate Will Tregoning told Guardian Australia the legal advice was cited in a briefing paper he had provided to Grant.Tregoning said the NSW police service advice was “quite different” from what Grant said about the possibility of charges and Grant was “shooting from the hip”. “It’s abundantly clear he doesn’t understand the legal issues”, he said, and urged Grant to read the briefing.A spokeswoman for Grant said the government’s current legal advice is that NSW legislation provides the NSW Police with the power to take action against pill testers at music festivals, but did not address whether this included charges for supply or possession of drugs.The health department report found possession of drugs for the purpose of testing was illegal in other states and territories.The stoush about legality of drug testing follows revelations that advocates and medical specialists plan to crowd-source funds to trial drug checking at Australian music festivals this winterThe group hopes to raise up to $100,000 to fund professional drug testing equipment at a major Australian festival and an independent review, which they say will prove the program can save lives.The drug checking push is being led by Tregoning, the president of the Australian Drug Reform Foundation, Alex Wodak, and emergency medical specialist David Caldicott.The group claims to have a large number of volunteer toxicologists and medical specialists to administer the program who are prepared to work pro bono, including people willing to risk arrest.Caldicott told Guardian Australia he believed the group could test drugs legally because the only people handling samples would be toxicologists who were licensed to do so, and they would not hand drugs back to consumers, only test and destroy samples.The NSW Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act bans possession of prohibited drugs but contains an exemption for people who are licensed or authorised to have possession of the prohibited drug under the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act.Caldicott said “a lot of people are saying we’ll get arrested ... I’m perfectly happy to be arrested, if they do it will cost them a great deal in the long run”.“There is a precedent for what we’re doing – Grant says we can’t, but everyone going into the Kings Cross supervised injecting room aren’t arrested, and police don’t attend overdoses [to arrest drug users],” he said.Caldicott said the group had received messages of support from a number of music festivals which see drug checking as a way to reduce risk at their events. “I don’t think any of them are keen on an arrest frenzy ... I don’t think they’ll buy into it unless they can guarantee people are not tasered or capsicum sprayed.”Tregoning said an undertaking by police that officers would be directed not to arrest and prosecute people for possession of drugs in the testing area would be sufficient to convince festivals to trial drug checking.Wodak said the group would prefer to “avoid the path of confrontation” but he was “personally very mindful of my own experience with civil disobedience” when he and colleagues started a needle and syringe program in 1986 and a medically supervised injecting centre in 1999. Defiance of laws was a last resort in all three instances, he said.Seven young people have died over summer, and the rates of hospitalisation for seriously ill drug takers had increased, Wodak said. “I hate to say it but every death at a music festival from now on will be blamed on the government.”Caldicott and Wodak argued pill testing would persuade people not to take illegal drugs because they would be better informed of the risks of harm of doing so.Adriana Buccianti, whose son died at a music festival after taking drugs in 2012, agrees. Buccianti has started a Change.org petition with 37,000 signatures calling on Australian governments to allow drug checking which she believes will save the lives of young people like her son.Buccianti told Guardian Australia “it saddens me that we’re lagging behind [in trialling drug checking], it’s obviously too late for Daniel but not too late for others”.She said drug checking does not amount to condoning drug use. “Statistics show you people will throw their stuff out, there’s no way anybody will tell the person it’s a good drug and to go off and take it. Nobody is saying that at all, but just [giving them] strategies to protect people.“I understand there is such a thing as self determination ... but we haven’t given people enough information and a strategy to say ‘what am I really taking’. Nobody wants to come out of a festival in a body bag.”A spokeswoman for Grant said the NSW government did not support pill testing because drugs were illegal and inherently dangerous.“We are working on a strategy to reduce harm at music festivals through the promotion of drug-free events with the appropriate police resources to enforce the law and medical staff on site,” she said.If we want to stop drug-related deaths at festivals, we need a new strategy | Bill O'Loughlin The president of the NSW Police Association, Scott Weber, said in a statement that officers must enforce the law and young people taking drugs to be tested could face drug possession charges.“The testing regimes being put forward will not tell a potential drug user whether a substance is safe or unsafe,” he said.“This raises questions about duty of care risks over giving advice on pills that lead to a death or serious injury. Deputy Premier Troy Grant has rightly identified issues around the logistics of large-scale pill testing and legalities for all involved.”
