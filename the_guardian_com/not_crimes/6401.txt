Did you see Hate Thy Neighbour on Viceland TV? A sizeable chunk of the audience at Jamali Maddix’s Soho theatre gig did. His documentary series about the rise of the far right seems to have catapulted the east Londoner to the frontline of young comics, and raised expectations, perhaps, that he’ll be a social commentator as well as a teller of jokes.I saw Maddix’s maiden Edinburgh fringe show last August. He was promising and charismatic, but a bit raw, and some of his crowd interactions felt slightly misjudged. For his week-long Soho theatre run, however, he is on better form. He wasn’t polished then and he’s not polished now; that’s not his style. There’s a scruffy, shooting-the-breeze vibe, he often gets tongue-tied – and his appeal boils down as much to funny manner as to the acuity of any specific thing he’s saying. You get a lot for free when you look as distinctive as Maddix (bottle-bottom glasses, bushy beard, beanie hat and tattoos), speak like a cartoon (dismay and declamation forever propelling him to the top of his register) and gesticulate like a rapper.Jamali Maddix: ‘I saw Bill Hicks and thought, there’s someone like me’ So will fans of Hate Thy Neighbour get what they come for? I’d say so. From what I’ve seen of the documentary, Maddix didn’t claim to be anyone other than who he is: “a regular person, rather than a journalist”, as one interviewer described him. Neither is he pretending to great cultural insight with his stage material. This isn’t the deliberative social commentary of, say, his contemporary Dane Baptiste. But equally, Maddix piles straight into the big questions (race, democracy, capitalism), and speaks about them with no side, no piety and an infectious curiosity. It adds up to a really fresh comedy voice – a young standup of British-Italian-Jamaican heritage, from a working-class background, with a keen sense of how incongruous it is that he’s been given a soapbox. Much of his material generates a charge and he enjoys teasing the audience with our supposed uneasiness about race. As in Edinburgh, he identifies someone grey-haired in the crowd and berates him, throughout the gig, for not enjoying himself. An unnecessary device presumably designed to shore up Maddix’s radical credentials, it landed with a clunk on the fringe and does so again here.As for the material, it’s a mix of very good and pretty crude. His banter with the crowd sometimes ends with a thud, particularly when he’s trying to sound worldly wise. One example is the exchange with a woman who voted for Hillary Clinton, whom Maddix dismisses crudely. Usually, he’s more intelligent than that – even if he frustratingly never lingers on any one subject for long. But the joke about white people’s viability as slaves, say, is a choice one. Likewise the BNP/Ukip gag (whose setup is arduous, admittedly), arguing that the middle-classes have now stolen even racism from the poor.There’s more where that came from – including the new material, which draws on his experiences filming the Viceland documentary, and provides some of the biggest laughs. It whets the appetite for the next offering from a comic who neatly splits the difference between fun-loving goofballery and cultural commentary, and who does so from a perspective too few in comedy share.At Soho theatre, London, until 4 March.
