An auroch’s horn in the visitor centre at St David’s in Pembrokeshire tells a story of our distant past when these now extinct giant cattle roamed the coastal plains.The stumps of trees were revealed in 2014 when a storm scoured away the beach and shifted inland the shingle bank that protects the main road at Newgale. Beneath the sand were the tree stumps, the horn, and footprints of the hunters, carbon dated to 2,500 BC.The devastation was remarkably similar to a 12th century account by Gerald of Wales of a storm at Newgale. He wrote of the sandy shores of South Wales “being laid bare by the extraordinary violence of a storm,” and how “the surface of the earth, which had been covered for many ages, re-appeared”, revealing the trunks of trees “cut off, standing in the very sea itself, the strokes of the hatchet appearing as if made only yesterday.”It was the sea level rise after the last ice age that swamped the forests, and from Gerald’s time until the last 50 years the level remained stable.Not any more. In every sandy bay along the wild coastline of the Pembrokeshire national park the sea is pushing sand and rocks inland, often washing away or overwhelming sea defences.The shingle bank at Newgale was put back to restore the main road to St David’s and protect the tree trunks, but elsewhere this is not being attempted. The National Trust, which owns much of the coast, has information boards explaining the need for managed retreat. Very soon, the sand will be preserving evidence of our own civilisation.
