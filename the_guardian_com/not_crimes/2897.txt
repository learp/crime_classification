Bikes, baths and bullets among items found in country's waterways Plastic bags and drink cans are always a depressing sight for canal walkers. But this waste also has a deeper environmental effect on the waterways. This winter the Canal & River Trust conducted a four month survey to record the discarded rubbish they uncovered, when clearing up local waterways across the country. According to the charity it costs around £1 million to clear up people’s rubbish each year. Tin baths, 16ft dead pythons and a pizza delivery bike still carrying a pizza are just some of the strange objects recovered.We’d like to see what items you have spotted in canals and waterways, either nearby or on your travels.
