I have read that it is now considered feminist to focus on a female athlete’s looks. What do you think?Mark, by emailIt’s an Ask Hadley special, this week, folks, and the theme is “Let’s look at what male columnists are saying about how women look.” Last week, a male sportswriter on another paper tweeted me an article he wrote a year ago about how women get feminism wrong. I missed this at the time, probably because I was so busy doing feminism badly, so I am grateful he has rectified my oversight. He describes his feminism as “radical”, which is interesting, because I thought radical feminism involved exciting things such as describing pornography as rape. Apparently not: it’s talking about how female athletes look.“It is inevitable,” he writes, “that beautiful female athletes should receive comments on their looks.” And so it seems – from this particular writer’s perspective, anyway. He has described women’s tennis as “always [having] a soft-porn dimension … [straight out] of adolescent (and non-adolescent) male fantasy” and he once opened an interview with an Olympic swimmer with the radical feminist sentence: “The first thing to say about Fran Halsall is that she is beautiful.”Wimbledon, as ever, provides us with plenty of examples of male commentators displaying their radical feminism, from Andrew Castle wishing that his dentist resembled Marcus Willis’s partner, Jennifer Bate, to John Inverdale sharing with the nation his take on Marion Bartoli’s face. The argument in defence of this kind of behaviour invariably includes phrases such as: “But women like compliments!”; “This is political correctness gone mad!”; and, “Help me, nanny, I’ve thrown all my toys out of the pram!”Allow me to assist these confused souls. There is a difference between a compliment, and believing women exist solely for you to rub your thighs at. Many women – and this might come as a shock – don’t want to know how much they turn on an ageing commentator. I know! It’s political correctness gone mad!Yes, female athletes wear minimal clothing, but that is so they can do their job, not so that some journalist can share his sexual fantasies about them with the world. I can say with absolute certainty that every female athlete would rather people focused on their hard-won athletic skill than how they look.Truly, it’s a rum old world when a fashion columnist is telling middle-aged men to stop focusing so much on women’s physical appearance. As for the idea that it’s “feminist” to celebrate women’s differences from men, I’d gently argue it’s more feminist to listen to women when they say they feel degraded by this kind of tragic male smuttiness as opposed to dismissing them as humourless feminazis who don’t understand how REAL ladies feel.Did no one ever teach these men which thoughts should be shared aloud and which really should not? I might fantasise about these radical feminists from the sports commentariat fainting due to lack of blood in their brains and falling eye first on top of their microphones, but I don’t vocalise those thoughts, do I? Oh wait – oops.You discussed reactions to Renée Zellweger’s appearance a while back. But why is it in the news again this week?Melanie, by email      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Renee Zellweger. Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImageAhead of the curve, that’s where I live, Melanie. In fact, my whole address is Ask Hadley, Ahead of the Curve, One Step Beyond, Up on the Moral High Ground. Please address correspondence accordingly.I did indeed touch on this subject a fortnight ago. Since then, there has been something of a furore about the discussion of Zellweger’s face – specifically after Owen Gleiberman, the chief film critic of Variety magazine, wrote a weird article about it.What was weird about it wasn’t his claim that Zellweger looks different these days, which is true, but his contention that her appeal has always been that she looks “ordinary”. But Gleiberman does have a slightly odd perspective of the average person’s physical appearance, given that he thinks Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Fontaine and Bette Davis “weren’t beauty contest-winners. They look like heightened versions of us.”Now, I’ve never met Gleiberman but I’ve seen his photo byline and, let me tell you, I don’t look like Joan Fontaine and he ain’t no Bette.But let us address the issue that Gleiberman stirred up, which is: can an actor mess with their face and still have a career? This is a fair question, given how many actors momentarily or otherwise derailed their careers through bad plastic surgery, from Jennifer Grey to Mickey Rourke.But it’s also a damned if you do, damned if you don’t situation, especially for women: they are shunned if they have surgery, and shunned if they show any signs of ageing. And this, really, is what Gleiberman should have addressed, as opposed to writing at length about his personal unhappiness with Zellweger’s appearance, thereby putting precisely the kind of focus on an actor’s face that drives them to plastic surgery in the first place.So let us end with this: instead of sniping at actors for having plastic surgery, let’s instead feel a little sad that we live in a world in which they feel they need to do so. And then, let’s get on with our day and let them get on with theirs.• This article was amended on 11 July to correct the name of Jennifer Bate, who was wrongly referred to as Marisa Bate.
