Full Steam Ahead 8pm, BBC2The last in the series about the impact of railway travel in the 19th century has Ruth Goodman and Peter Ginn travelling to Paignton and Swanage to re-create the newfound experience of excursion trips as workers found themselves with more leisure time. Railway companies took advantage, giving ordinary folk the opportunity to travel to rural areas only previously visited by elites such as the Romantic poets, who didn’t care for their solitude being encroached on by riff-raff. David StubbsClass of 92: Still Out of their League 9pm, BBC1Familiar strengths and weaknesses as this Salford City documentary series resumes. The show’s hook is also its fatal flaw – the involvement of the Nevilles, Giggs and other Fergie fledglings makes it hard to regard the Salford story as a true underdog tale in the context of the lower league realm in which they operate. However, they remain an easy bunch to like. Tonight: a cup run on the pitch and some hygiene problems in the burger van. Phil HarrisonHorizon: My Amazing Twin 9pm, BBC2Presenter Adam Pearson requires no instruction in the complexities of genetics – he was born with neurofibromatosis (type one), which has caused facial tumours that could blind him. Meanwhile, Pearson has a twin brother with the same disease – but that manifests itself in entirely different, largely invisible, symptoms. The film is Pearson’s attempt to figure out why, a task he undertakes with characteristic curiosity and droll wit. Andrew MuellerCCTV: Neighbourhood Watching 9pm, ITVIt costs as little as £100 to install a CCTV system. If this one-off doc is anything to go by, some genuinely need these systems; such as Mavis and Alan, whose neighbour’s abusive behaviour has made their lives a nightmare. Nevertheless, despite some jaw-dropping footage, it’s a film that makes you worry about Britons’ increasing propensity to monitor their surroundings electronically, if only for the hints that those with CCTV find it addictive. Jonathan WrightPolicing the Police 9pm, PBS AmericaShocking dispatch from the mean streets of Newark, NJ, where relations between police and the mainly black youth are toxic. Jelani Cobb joins officers on patrol and witnesses stop-and-search incidents (“field inquiries”) of terrifying ferocity. Much of what we see seems unjustifiable, and yet policing in the US is an under-resourced numbers game – so is the corner-cutting surprising? Outreach initiatives have helped, but can trust be rebuilt? PHThe Circuit 10pm, Channel 4The “new neighbours on the block” premise is given new life in this ambitious, surreal comedy pilot from Sharon Horgan and Dennis Kelly – writing together for the first time since Pulling. Gabe and Nat are invited for dinner by Helena and Sasha, who turn out to be bigger weirdos than they could have imagined. As the pair become involved with their neighbours’ relationship, what the programme-makers describe as a “descent into hell and goulash” occurs. Hannah J DaviesNashville 10pm, Sky LivingSeries four of the enjoyable music soap has found a new place to hang its 10-gallon hat, relocating from E4 to Sky Living. Otherwise, it’s business as usual, with ambitious hit-maker Juliette (Hayden Panettiere) seemingly on top of the world after severing ties with country veteran Rayna (Connie Britton). But even as Juliette duets with cadaverous guest star Steven Tyler, is the volatile siren really OK with leaving baby Cadence back in Texas? Graeme VirtueFilm choiceCarriers (Alex Pastor, David Pastor, 2009) 12.30am, Film4This low-budget horror debut from the Spanish Pastor brothers stars Chris Pine, just as he was headed for the stars as Captain Kirk in the Star Trek reboot. He plays one of two brothers who, with their girlfriends, head across a Texan-Mexican wasteland ravaged by a deadly virus, their destination being the beach where they used to romp as children. It’s a little like The Road, but with much better weather.
