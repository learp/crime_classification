TheatreThe Roman TragediesBack in 2009 when this six-hour version of Coriolanus, Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra was seen at the Barbican, Ivo van Hove was little known on these shores. Now, he’s much in demand with his production of A View from the Bridge transferring from the Young Vic to the West End, and his revival of Hedda Gabler currently at the National. This remarkable multimedia show comes complete with closeups that can be viewed from multiple perspectives.Barbican Theatre, EC2, 17 to 19 MarchJeramee, Hartleby and OooglemoreGary Owen’s latest work Killology opens at Cardiff’s Sherman later this month before moving to the Royal Court. It imagines a world in which a new gaming experience allows players to live out their darkest fantasies but also makes them face up to the consequences. It couldn’t be further from this absurdist, seaside-set kids’ show, whose simplicity belies its complexity. The only words in this piece – directed by Tim Crouch – are the names of its protagonists. But from them, Owen spins comedy gold and philosophical depth.Unicorn Theatre, SE1, 12 March to 9 AprilNarvikSome plays are sleeper hits that gradually gather attention. That’s the case with this haunting memory play by Lizzie Nunnery, which has been attracting quite a following since it was first staged back in 2015. Inspired by the wartime experiences of her grandfather, it’s a love story set partly in the mind of an elderly man, scored with sea shanties and Norwegian-inspired folk songs.Harrogate Theatre, 14 to 18 March; touring to 25 MarchEscaped AloneCaryl Churchill’s play may run for less than an hour but it is likely to haunt you for far longer. In a sunlit garden, three elderly women drink tea and chat. Then a neighbour steps out of the action to deliver Cassandra-like reports of global catastrophe and horror. Suddenly the garden takes on a different hue, and you can’t but be reminded of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.The Lowry, Manchester, 11 March; Cambridge Arts Theatre, 14 to 18 March; touring to 26 MarchThe Far Side of the MoonIt’s a week for great international theatre and none is more welcome than the return of Robert Lepage’s piece inspired by the US-Soviet space race. This is a show that is both emotionally satisfying and intellectually curious, as it considers the human desire to explore new worlds. It’s exquisitely staged, too, full of theatrical conjuring tricks.Theatre Royal: The Lyric, Plymouth, 16 to 18 March; touring to 2 AprilDanceCasanova      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Casanova.
