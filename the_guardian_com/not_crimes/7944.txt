Barbados has an amazing foodie scene, which ranges from flash fine dining to great street food, but a traditional dish not to miss is pudding and souse – a delicious combination of pork and sweet potato, served with pickled cucumber and peppers. An island staple, traditionally eaten on Saturdays, some say the original recipe used haggis which was introduced to the island by indentured servants sent over from Scotland in the 1600s.The “souse” is made from pickled pork. Traditionally, pig trotters, ears, snout and tongue were used but, nowadays, it’s commonly made with lean pork meat mixed with pickled onions, cucumbers, limes, peppers, and parsley. The “pudding” is made from steamed sweet potato with chillies and herbs, stuffed into pig intestine like a sausage, before being boiled.  Pudding and souse.

You can find it at vans and rum shops around the island, or head to The Souse Factory, a restaurant in St John which serves a good variety, with spice levels ranging from mild to hot. Lemon Arbor, a rum shop also in St John, serves a good one – and it’s a fun place to hang out, too.But my tip is to find the van parked by the bus stop on the coast road heading south out of Holetown. The flavours and the heat of the pickle are perfectly balanced here and, for only a couple of Bajan dollars, you can eat your fill. Get there early but still expect to queue, as it’s such a popular spot and the proprietor sells out by midday every Saturday.Paul Wedgwood is chef-patron of Wedgwood the Restaurant in Edinburgh and head chef of the annual Celtic Festival in Barbados
