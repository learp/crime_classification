In the last 18 months, more than 1,600 houses in the poorest parts of Stockton-on-Tees have benefited from free energy efficiency measures to cut local carbon emissions and reduce fuel bills. As well as external cladding, many homes have also received new boilers, central heating systems and internal insulation measures.The scheme is the largest within the community energy savings programme (CESP), which requires energy companies to fund area-based domestic carbon savings.For thousands of people this had made a real difference in the fight against fuel poverty. One Stockton resident, Mary Moran, said she had struggled to keep her home warm, often wearing thick clothing and having the heating running all day. "This was really expensive, often costing between £20 and £30 a week, and made the symptoms of my COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] harder to deal with," she said. After the scheme she is spending just £10 a week on heating.Stockton-on-Tees borough council worked with a social enterprise, GoWarm, to plan the project. We worked up a bid to present to Eggborough power station, demonstrating the huge cuts to carbon we could deliver in targeted parts of the borough, helping them meet their CESP obligations.Stockton council's investment of £700,000 – covering the work needed to proceed, such as tackling rising damp and replacing unrepairable drainpipes – brought in almost £8m CESP funding, made available for the country's 10% most deprived areas.We are entering new territory. Typically these energy savings schemes have only been delivered through housing associations, with one key point of contact for all houses. Our focus on Stockton's private housing meant talking to thousands of individual residents and selling the benefits of major works on their homes. We used community events, door-to-door visits and opened a town centre shop to share information, and built on the trusted brand of the council. We were able to secure a 95% take-up.The project also inspired other events and activities. Residents in St Peter's Road, Parkfield, launched a community gardening project, putting up hanging baskets, replanting green areas and looking after large brick planters. Local people report a rise in community pride, and young people starting to take care of their neighbourhoods.The opportunity for genuine transformation was clear. The health, community, financial and social inclusion benefits of addressing fuel poverty are well documented, but I was also excited by the regeneration opportunities. Our streets could look much better and, though this is still a deprived area, insulation measures add value to local houses.Embarking on this scheme was a bold political decision. In late 2011, no other authority had committed to intervening in poor private housing in this way.Like much of the north of England, my council was hit badly by central government funding cuts — we will have lost £51m from our revenue budget, a cut of roughly 40%, by 2016-17. But we believe in using all the policy levers we can to protect the most vulnerable and improve residents' lives. The scheme created more than 300 jobs, using eight north-east contractors, during the year.While it's been a success, we have also learned many lessons. Retrofitting while people are living in their homes is disruptive, and with 1,600 houses, it is a huge project. Tracking down private landlords for permission can be complex. People living in private rented flats and houses of multiple occupation in deprived areas are sometimes transient, with low incomes, and have little control over their accommodation.We knew it was important to take a public and political lead on the issue. It was vital to be available and accessible for complaints and queries from local people. Local boundaries mean some households miss out, which is difficult to explain to disappointed residents.Councils must be at the heart of all major sustainability projects, as domestic carbon emissions reductions will not be achieved through piecemeal approaches by a range of companies. The much debated Green Deal is certainly unproven as a proposition to householders, but as we have already shown, the involvement of local authorities will help.David Rose is cabinet member for environment at Stockton-on-Tees borough council.
