Any regrets, Harriet?From repealing homophobic Clause 28, to bringing in the national minimum wage, to trebling investment in the health service, to putting children’s centres in every area – none of that would have been possible without winning the support of the public to get elected. The invasion of Iraq turned out to be wrong because there weren’t the weapons of mass destruction that we believed there were, but I acted in good faith and I believe Tony Blair did too.Updatedat 2.33pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.06pm GMT14:06Harriet says: Thanks for the questions!One person also asked:What can be done to encourage more women into the better paid yet more dangerous and physically demanding type of jobs traditionally done by men?It’s not just about encouraging women, it’s about tearing down the obstacles in their way. There are lots of women and girls wanting to go into new areas. The important thing is not to deter and obstruct them. When people say we need to encourage more women to put themselves forward to be MPs, what they’re doing is overlooking the fact that in every area there are great women putting themselves forward but just being blocked. The important thing is to look at the numbers, and make sure if the numbers are not becoming more equal, you have to take action, including positive action and quotas. It’s not that there aren’t enough women – it’s that their way continues to be blocked. No one likes quotas, but if nothing else works, they are necessary.Updatedat 2.33pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.04pm GMT14:04  Harriet Harman with pearly king Tom Johnson, in 1982.

And why do no prominent Labour politicians come out and say that is wasn’t? The country’s debt has risen under the conservatives  Guardian contributor Harriet Harman 06 February 2017 1:59pmWhen we were in government, we paid down the debt that the Tories had built up because of the high cost of unemployment, and the struggling economy, meaning lower tax revenues. With the economy growing and unemployment falling, we were able to pay down debt and increase public spending. When the global financial crisis hit, we had to use public money to shore up the economy. If we hadn't, a recession would have turned into a depression. That's what caused the debt to rise. Once you've lost an election, the media don't want to hear the party who lost saying they got it right. When I was acting leader in 2010, I endlessly argued that the public funds to protect the economy from the global financial crisis was right, and I urged MPs to do the same. But no one was listening; but I never regret the investment in schools, hospitals, childcare, tax credits; investment in industry people and infrastructure, is and remains necessary to build the economy. Which boosts public finances, not drains them.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.57pm GMT13:57Mark Taylor asks:I keep hearing people using the term “credible opposition”. Is this a matter of substance or presentation?   Guardian contributor Harriet Harman 06 February 2017 1:54pmYou only have to take a passing glance at what Tory governments always do, and what Labour governments always do, to see that with the Tories, the NHS is always brought to its knees, people have to work harder to make ends meet, and social mobility is restricted. We're seeing the same now. I don't think the last Labour government was perfect but it did many good things, and the worst Labour government is way better than the best Tory government.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.50pm GMT13:50I don't agree we should sit back and let Brexit be the disaster we fear it's going to be. What's important is to try and make the best of itHawthorn14b says:Do you think by giving Brexit enough rope there will eventually be a public backlash to the whole thing?  Guardian contributor Harriet Harman 06 February 2017 1:48pmI don't agree with the idea that we should sit back and let Brexit be the disaster we fear it's going to be, so that people who voted for it should be forced to recognise they "got it wrong". What's important is to try and make the best of it - that is not going to be easy for the government, because just as we are turning away from our trading relationship with Europe, America, under Trump, is becoming protectionist. And it's hard for us as an opposition to get the government to take our proposals as seriously as they should. It would be easier to get the government to take our proposals as seriously as they should if we had more public support as an opposition. But today, I hope that the government will accept the new clause which I have tabled to the article 50 bill which will guarantee the residency rights of EU citizens who were lawfully here before the Brexit vote. I think it's completely wrong to use them as a negotiating chip, as we try and get other countries in the EU to respect the rights of UK citizens living there.Updatedat 1.53pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.46pm GMT13:46So many men have written their memoirs, and so few women – we have to make sure we're not 'hidden from history'cantthinkofagoodname asks:Many members of the general public are disillusioned with politicians.

Guardian contributor Harriet Harman 06 February 2017 1:42pmI still strongly believe that our "lefty values" are much more aligned with British values, and we have to keep faith with those principles.

What have you done to ensure that this does not happen to other young students?  Guardian contributor Harriet Harman 06 February 2017 1:30pmBasically, no I didn't speak to them. I would have had no idea who to speak to. I was embarrassed as well as horrified. Why would anyone take my word as a young student against that of a senior lecturer? What I've done is to always argue that complaints much be taken seriously and investigated, and the complainant not vilified for making the complaint. That just reinforces impunity for those who would abuse their power. It's striking how, since I wrote about my experience as a victim of "sex for grades", how many in the media have challenged me, implying that I've made it up. They need to recognise that this was a problem, and to a large extent still is, rather than denigrating those who talk about it. And it's not just a problem in universities. It's wherever there's a male hierarchy and some men in positions of power seek to abuse their power over young women - and young men. York University now has given a lot of attention to getting a proper complaints system, and encouraging complaints to be brought forward and taken seriously.A Woman’s Work by Harriet Harman review – a life confronting sexism Updatedat 1.42pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.28pm GMT13:28DeathOfTheOctupus asks:Which was more damaging, the pink bus or the Ed stone?

Guardian contributor Harriet Harman 06 February 2017 1:25pmIt's not just about developing policies. People aren't listening to us even when we are putting forward policies.

How can flexible, high quality and affordable childcare be provided?  Guardian contributor Harriet Harman 06 February 2017 1:21pmClearly women aren't worth less at work than men. The pay gap dates back to when men were seen as the breadwinners and women the homemakers. It's hard for women to be equal at work if we are not equal at home; to be equal, men need to share equally in caring for children and older relatives. Government can help with this by quality affordable childcare, by higher paternity pay so that families can afford for the father to take time off. It can't be left just to individuals to take cases and narrow the pay gap - we need unions to step forward and back them up, and we need the government to reinstate the funds to the equality and human rights commission, which they have cut; they're weakening it and undermining its ability to help women take cases.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.23pm GMT13:23The point about being a feminist is that you can look however you want.

That was wrong then, and it's wrong now. When Labour's in the doldrums, people always talk about realignment, but the point is for us to get our act together, not to throw in the towel. And that starts with recognising that however much people are suffering under the Tories, they won't turn to us unless they can have confidence that we can solve their problems rather than make them worse. That we recognise that just shouting at the public that they're wrong, and that they should change, is not the way to make progress. We need to recognise why they don't want to vote for us, and make the changes in ourselves and change in response to that. And we should be listening to people rather than shouting at them.Updatedat 1.29pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.20pm GMT13:20snaffles asks:Have you seen my keys?
