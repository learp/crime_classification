7.58pm BST19:58So that’s IT for Week One! Some great performances over the last couple of nights, this is lining up to be a corker of a series. Next week’s show kicks off at 6.20pm, and it’s a two hour dance marathon so bring plenty of supplies. Thank you everyone who joined in this evening, am off to drink wine and read your comments. Come and say hello @heidistephens on Twitter if you’re passing, otherwise I’ll see you on Wednesday for Bake Off, or next Saturday for Strictly! Have a great week, HxFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.56pm BST19:56Goodness there’s a lot of them. The beginning of a new Strictly season always feels a bit overwhelming, can’t we just ditch four or five couples in Week 2?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.55pm BST19:55So after Week One, Daisy and Alijaz are at the top of the leaderboard, with Ed and Katya at the bottom. No vote to leave this week, but the scores will be carried over to next week. Time for a recap! I’ve already forgotten what happened last night. Ah yes, Rinder and Ore’s trousers.

Bruno loved the mood and Will’s acting – really focussed and intense. Craig thought Will’s feet were turned out in places, but he loved the intent. Darcey loved the attack and power – but the boys are right about Will’s frame (DRINK).FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.51pm BST19:51Will and Karen are playing chess, with bonus arm wrestling. Despite his too-short trousers and pussy-bow tie, this is a pretty decent Tango, with some nice footwork and a commanding presence from Will. His butt sticks out and he looks a bit knock-kneed, but not bad at all. Go Will.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.47pm BST19:47And finally for tonight, it’s Will and Karen! Their first dance is the Tango to ‘Let’s Dance’ by David Bowie. In many ways I think Will Young stumbling through a Tango in Week One of Strictly is definitely what Bowie would have wanted. Next week Will plans to dance the Argentine Tango to Prince’s ‘When Doves Cry’, and after that is anyone’s guess. Cilla? Wogan? Maurice White?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.46pm BST19:46Scores: 6,6,7,7 - a total of 26 for Claudia and AJ. The scoring paddles are meaningless now, aren’t they?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.45pm BST19:45Darcey thought they were great to watch, but needs to be more dynamic. Len didn’t like the gymnastics, but it was a great job. Bruno gets all patronising about how cute Claudia is, which I’ve got zero time for. Craig thought it was stompy (DRINK), but was impressed with gymnastics in heels.

Claudia is anything but frumpy, so please no more fringing for Claudia. THANKS!Well this is fun – great hip action from Claudia and some nice shaping. Her footwork lacks precision and is a bit sluggish in places, but a great job (with bonus gymnastics)FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
