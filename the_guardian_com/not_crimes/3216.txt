I was sorry to read of Anna Altman’s distressing symptoms (The long read, 17 November), which I recognised only too well. I spent 40 years of my life suffering incapacitating pain, nausea, dizziness and hallucinations in spite of trying every possible conventional and unconventional treatment.I was permanently cured by a simple surgical procedure and 10 years later am migraine-free. I had to pay for this private operation in Germany. I took out a bank loan and it’s the best money I ever spent. My life was transformed. I subsequently advised other intending patients. The success rate is 85%. It’s not available on the NHS and my GP had never heard of it. He counselled against it, preferring to prescribe me increasing doses of increasingly expensive “migraine medications”, none of which worked.Jacqueline KayeLondon
