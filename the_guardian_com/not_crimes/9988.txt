“It had never crossed her mind that sending your child to school would be like going back to school yourself.”The Australian author Liane Moriarty is a master of suburban secrets and lies (particularly among the white middle class), and her 2014 novel, Big Little Lies, was lauded for being uncomfortably recognisable in its absurdity. The book is full of knowing humour about the first year of school in a Sydney beach suburb, where the adults needed more watching than the children; anyone who has come into proximity with a primary school will know the obsessive politics that go into planning the sausage sizzles and trivia nights. The novel finds humour in the helicopter melodramatics of overprotective parents. If the afternoon pick-up line is the battleground, the long lunches are the war room. On the second page, an outside observer named Mrs Ponder (who’s omitted from the show) listens in on the calamitous trivia night: “Goodness me,” she says. “Do you think they’re arguing over the capital of Guatemala?”Liane Moriarty on Big Little Lies, and the 'parallel world' of fame in America These supposed adults are far removed from high school, yet the popularity contest of who said, wore, and did what is still alive and well, while their children play in the background. “Mothers took their mothering so seriously now,” Moriarty writes. But in the American series of Big Little Lies, which premiered on HBO last month and stars Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon and Shailene Woodley, the quaint Pirriwee Public become the more posh-sounding Otter Bay, and Sydney’s northern beaches become Monterey, northern California.There’s another change, too: mothering is perhaps being taken too seriously by the show itself as well.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  First look at Nicole Kidman in HBO’s Big Little LiesMoriarty is a bestselling author in the US, but it’s only recently that she’s become known in her home country; it was therefore inevitable that the adaptation would be an overseas production – and it’s a very, very great one, too. But when it comes to transferring something as indebted to its specific location as Big Little Lies to a different place, the less precious and beholden to the source material the better; it’s better to capture the intended atmosphere of the book than force rigid adherence to a story that may or may not fit. From its mysterious opening, to the Greek chorus of talking heads who offer a series of peripheral observations in the aftermath of the trivia night tragedy, Big Little Lies has staunchly adhered to the story laid out in Liane Moriarty’s novel – with the exception of some narrative padding in the later episodes. The added backstory, David E Kelley’s writing, Jean-Marc Vallée’s direction and the stunning performances giving depth to these characters, but there’s still something missing in the transfer, something that made Moriarty’s words so entertaining and so tragic: the satire at the centre of it.This is not to say that the American transfer of the show is bad; it’s just different, making less of the environment and more of the background drama about motherly expectations. “It wasn’t her dream job, but she did quite enjoy the satisfaction of transforming a messy pile of paperwork into neat rows of figures,” is one of the melancholic lines about Jane’s job as freelance accountant in the novel. Moriarty’s writing is often reduced to the genre of “chick lit” but she considers the class divides of Australian society in a public school environment that is reportedly equal, but where, of course, more money equals more muscle.

The knowing melodrama made what went on behind the scenes – namely, the abuse of Jane and Celeste – even more disturbing, because of how jarring it was. One never truly knows what goes on what’s behind a seemingly perfect life, the novel poses – but on screen, there’s little surprise when we find out things are far from perfect for the residents of Monterey. The show is also unashamedly overdramatic; like Moriarty’s text, it uses tropes – in this case, of soap opera – to dare viewers to take it seriously. But it’s still not satirical. The woozy montages of the sea and bodies moving together, which represent the complex emotional lives of the characters, combine fantasy and reality and are often set to classic rock (a favourite genre for Vallée). In the novel, these self-serious flights of fancy – where Jane (Woodley) runs off a cliff and Madeleine is attacked by Renata (Laura Dern) wielding an Avenue Q puppet – would be met with laughter but in the show they’re reverently treated as escapes that the characters desperately need.And then there’s Jane’s fantasy of shooting fellow joggers with a gun, which, if it existed in the novel (it doesn’t) would never be treated with such offhandedness – and which cheaply expedites the narrative stakes for Jane.Australia and the UK are close relatives when it comes to comedic sensibility; comedy shows from the UK frequently find popularity in Australia and vice versa. But irony and satire rarely travel well when adapted for the US. Take the short-lived US version of Kath and Kim in 2008, for instance, which the San Francisco Chronicle writer Tim Goodman said was “barely recognisable as a distant cousin to the original” and a “contender for the worst remake ever”. Kath and Kim without the satire was completely toothless, robbed of the conceit that made the original so successful.

Photograph: HBOAustralian comedy loves nothing more than to laugh at itself and the absurdity of the situations we put ourselves in – like when a trivia night is treated with the utmost strategy. It’s a similar story for UK humour, which Ricky Gervais described for Time in 2011: “We use sarcasm as a shield and a weapon. We avoid sincerity until it’s absolutely necessary. We mercilessly take the piss out of people we like or dislike, basically. And ourselves.”Big Little Lies review: someone’s going to end up dead – but who? In the insincere world of Big Little Lies, which acts as a microcosm for the big, wide world beyond the beaches and mansions, satire is essential. It makes the plotting more biting and efficient; adds depth to those deceptive truths and tragedies. “The world, right this very moment people were suffering unimaginable atrocities and you couldn’t close your heart completely, but you couldn’t leave it wide open either, because otherwise how could you possibly live your life when, through pure random luck, you got to live in paradise?” runs Madeleine’s internal monologue in the novel. “You had to register the existence of evil, do the little that you could, and then close your mind and think about new shoes.” • Big Little Lies airs on Showcase in Australia, HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK
