SAS Rogue Warriors 9pm, BBC2Opening episode of a series exploring the peculiar origins of the SAS. Lieutenant David Stirling, described by superiors as “irresponsible and unremarkable” was the founder of the regiment which, in 1941, was convened for a series of suicidal missions in the north African desert. Historian and author Ben Macintyre eagerly describes the manoeuvres of this band of eccentrics as their scattershot approach to warfare transmuted into something more measured. Phil HarrisonThe Fake News Show 8pm, Channel 4Once again, Channel 4 steps heroically forward to address the drought of panel shows featuring Stephen Mangan, Katherine Ryan and Richard Osman. This, part of C4’s Fake News Week, promises to be a one-off dissection of current propaganda – but prompts the thought that a regular (and serious) show of this sort would be a valuable service. Followed later by Confessions Of The Paparazzi, a portrait of photographers who pester celebrities. Andrew MuellerThe Halcyon 9pm, ITVForbidden love and unacknowledged attraction form the underlying themes tonight as the upstairs-downstairs second world war hotel drama continues. For Toby and Adil, this means the worry of being discovered and outed; for WVS volunteer Emma, there’s annoyance at journo Joe; while simmering tension between musicians Betsey and Sonny boils over. All this plays out against the backdrop of an air raid. Soapy, sure, but impressively realised. Jonathan WrightThe Accused 9pm, Channel 5This raw documentary purports to be a UK television first, shadowing a defendant and her legal aid team as they await criminal trial and, eventually, a verdict. The case could not be more emotive: 23-year-old Kenzey is charged with child cruelty and failing to protect her baby from a violent assault by her boyfriend. Preparing her defence involves reliving the worst night of her life, and the stark injury reports make for upsetting viewing. Graeme VirtueThe Art of France 9pm, BBC4In the second instalment of Andrew Graham-Dixon’s series, he considers both pre- and post-Revolutionary art. Jacques-Louis David acted as an artistic chronicler of his age, but initially worked as a reluctant propagandist for the monarchy, after being commissioned by Louis XIV himself. David changed his allegiance following the storming of the Bastille, and his latter work celebrated the winds of political change. An engrossing documentation of the era. Ben ArnoldMy Life: Born to Vlog 5pm, CBBCTwelve-year-old Nikki Lilly has AVM, a rare medical condition that causes headaches, nosebleeds and swelling on one side of her face. She started vlogging to keep herself busy when ill health forced her to take time off school. In this moving and inspiring documentary, she tells her story and gets vlogging tips and talks about how to stay safe online with her hero, beauty blogger Em Ford. As if that’s not enough, Nikki enters Junior Bake Off – and wins. Hannah VerdierBalls Deep 9pm, VicelandA double-bill of Vice’s immersive documentary series, presented by journalist Thomas Morton. First, he takes a look at the transgender community, and New York’s Christopher Street scene; then, to a soundtrack of Ode to Joy, shadows some grassroots Trump supporters (“Trump is our last hope”) from Stark County, Ohio. These “true believers” have funded a local campaign from their own pockets, “which is laudable… maybe” says Morton. Ali CatterallFilm choiceIt Follows (David Robert Mitchell, 2015) 9pm, Film4There was a time when it was the virginal kid who survived the serial killer, but in Mitchell’s clever horror pastiche, it’s the other way round. The only way to beat the curse of the implacable, shape-shifting bogeyman is to pass it on to someone else … by having sex with them. This deadly new strain of STI creates heaps of tension, suspense and outrageous shocks for Maika Monroe’s poor Jay and her suburban Detroit friends.Today’s best live sportWinter Universiade 7.30am, Eurosport 1 Coverage of the men’s relay classic cross-country skiing event.La Liga Football: Sporting Gijón v Alavés 7.40pm, Sky Sports 1 Strugglers Gijón take on mid-table Alavés in a top-flight clash from El Molinón.NBA Basketball: Memphis Grizzlies v San Antonio Spurs 2.30am, BT Sport1 Western Conference Southwest Division clash from FedExForum.
