What do you do at night? Should the answer be anything other than sleep, we want to hear from you – and to see pictures that tell the story of what keeps you going.Open all hours: behind the scenes of the UK's night-time economy If you are among the nocturnal who stay up while others get some shut eye – by choice or through work or family commitments – your photographs could feature in a special edition of the Observer New Review in August.Maybe you’re one of the 3.5m in the UK who work night shifts, or perhaps you go out owl spotting? Do you stay at home seeking solace online with other sleep deprived new parents, or simply take time to get out into the countryside and look at the stars? We’re interested in all these activities and more – wherever in the world you are.You might be part of an organised group running all-night cycle rides, or use the extra time to cram in other hobbies that are more relaxing? Do you volunteer with an organisation that focuses on night time issues? Maybe, just maybe, you enjoy a drink and a dance and find there’s no better time to do it than 4am?Next time you’re up all night, whether that’s something you do all the time or for reasons unplanned, get your camera out and send us a shot of what you are doing or the people you meet by clicking on the blue GuardianWitness buttons on this page.
