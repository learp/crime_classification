When the model of Katharina Fritsch’s Hahn/Cock was shown in the run-up to her 2013 fourth plinth commission, I had little idea what the effect of the giant blue rooster itself would be. Like David Shrigley’s bronze thumbs-up Really Good, Fritsch’s commission only made real sense in-situ, on the north-west corner of London’s Trafalgar Square. Scale and symbolism have been crucial to this most public of changing artworks. Some have worked better than others, in very different ways.Fourth plinth shortlist includes winged bull and giant cream blob Mark Wallinger’s 1999 Ecce Homo – a life-sized fake marble figure cast from a real person, set a standard that has been hard to beat. Every new commission has to be more than a thing on a plinth or a joke that gets beaten down by familiarity. Novelty is not enough.The five shortlisted artists for the next two commissions more or less rise to the occasion and reflect the grim sense of foreboding in the national mood. This is no time for celebration.Huma Bhabha’s Untitled figure, with its dark cork body and polystyrene head, has a kind of brutish magnificence and malevolence. But why this? Why here? It seems to me to lack specificity – calling it Untitled shies away from allusions of any sort and seems to me a lost opportunity. She has made more extreme – and more fun – things with a greater sense of absurd horror. Her sculpture seems to belong to the same sculptural universe as Shrigley’s thumb, currently occupying the plinth. It even shares a similar silhouette.Raqs Media Collective’s The Emperor’s Old Clothes is altogether too obvious. There is barely a comment thread below Guardian articles about contemporary art that does not, somewhere, mention the emperor’s new clothes. The robes of an absent emperor, who presumably fled naked from Delhi, leaving only a ceremonial cloak that stands unaided on the plinth, doesn’t say much about anything that we don’t already know.Giddy up! The subversive sculpture on the fourth plinth is a dark horse Hans Haacke reduced the equestrian statues occupying the other plinths in the square to a skeletal nag. Raqs’ monument is all clothes but no emperor and no general; an empty relic of the British colonial statues that once populated Delhi now gathered in the city’s Coronation Park.Damián Ortega’s Highway, a sort of unstable circus balancing act with a tall ladder on top of piled-up oil cans on a scaffolding tower built on the flat bed of a lime-green VW truck parked on the plinth, will be much less precarious than it looks. This is a pity. It isn’t knockabout enough, and is too easy a gag.The two projects I would like to see on the plinth are Michael Rakowitz’s The Invisible Enemy Should Not Exist, and Heather Phillipson’s The End.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Michael Rakowitz’s The Invisible Enemy Should Not Exist depicts the gate of Nineveh which was destroyed by Isis in 2015. Photograph: Will Oliver/EPAIraqi-American artist Rakowitz proposes a copy of the winged bull and protective deity Lamassu that once guarded the entrance to the Assyrian Nergal gate of Nineveh, a lost city on the edge of Mosul in Iraq. In 2015, Isis destroyed the ancient sculpture that was kept in the Mosul Museum. Rakowitz’s replica will be made largely from recycled Iraqi date syrup cans, a reminder of a now ruined industry. Rakowitz’s proposal seems to me entirely fitting, a reminder of a lost material culture – and an abject memorial and a rejoinder to iconoclasm. He makes you stop and think – reason enough to put his sculpture on the plinth.Phillipson’s The End is a whirl of cream with a cherry on top. She calls it a monument to hubris and impending collapse. When Phillipson recently won the Jarman award, she told me how furious she was. Anger takes the strangest forms. Hers is an exuberant, hollow laugh. The End is the most sculptural sculpture I have seen her make. I am reminded of Claes Oldenburg’s giant cartoonish objects, but Phillipson’s extruded creamy swirl has a giant fly crawling on it and a surveillance drone viciously snagging the air. The whole thing is jammed together as unexpectedly as the vicious and hilarious lines and images in her poems and videos. I can’t wait to see it on the plinth.
