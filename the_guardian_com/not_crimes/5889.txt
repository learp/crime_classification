By the time Colin Trevorrow’s Star Wars: Episode IX completes its run in cinemas in 2019, the space saga may well have restored its position as the highest-grossing movie franchise of all time at the global box office. It’s a position currently held by the rather more loosely grouped Marvel Cinematic Universe, including the 2014 cosmic fantasy Guardians of the Galaxy. Maz Kanata 'used telekinetic powers' in Star Wars: The Force Awakens James Gunn’s barmy space romp was based on a little-known Marvel comic book, that often drew inspiration from the original Star Wars trilogy, released between 1977 and 1983. The same period also saw the revival of Star Trek on the big screen, in the middling 1979 effort Star Trek: The Motion Picture, as well as the 1979 Disney turkey The Black Hole and the cult 1980 space romp Flash Gordon. Given that Star Wars: The Force Awakens is set to hit $2bn at the global box office, might we be about to see Hollywood history repeat itself?The comic book writer Mark Millar, whose work inspired the films Kick Ass, Wanted and the excellent Kingsman: The Secret Service, certainly appears to be banking on a space-opera revival. His new series Empress, which is due to debut in April via Marvel Comics, clearly borrows from the same prewar planetary-romance genre (Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, etc) that inspired George Lucas – with a little help from Akira Kurosawa – to create Star Wars. Telling the story of a galactic dictator’s wife who leaves her nefarious Ming the Merciless-style husband for a new life, taking their three children with her, a preview for the comic suggests that it will boast the same star-straddling “boys-own” thrills and the complete lack of concern for real science that characterises the very best space operas.Star Wars: Episode IX's Colin Trevorrow promises 'profoundly satisfying' Rey reveal “This genre has tended to skew more [towards] Blade Runner and Alien, but Star Wars proves the market [for space opera] is potentially enormous,” Millar told the Hollywood Reporter. Might space opera also be ready to challenge the superhero movie’s hegemony on the big screen? And if so, why, Guardians of the Galaxy and Star Trek aside, have space epics routinely failed to find the audience sizes found by Star Wars?      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Life on Mars ... The unfairly maligned John Carter, starring Taylor Kitsch, was no more barmy than Star Wars.DVD store bargain bins are littered with the corpses of planet-jumping fantasy fare that failed to make it into orbit. Only last year, the extravagant Jupiter Ascending was the latest ambitious offering to find itself stuck in the box office equivalent of Yoda’s stinky swamp from The Empire Strikes Back. In 2012, Disney suffered $200m losses on the hugely underrated Martian space romance John Carter. And Vin Diesel’s antihero never recovered from the leap into space opera territory in 2004’s ill-advised The Chronicles of Riddick.John Boyega: Star Wars: Episode VIII will be 'much darker' The problem is, no one knows how far it’s possible to push the far-out cosmic fantasy envelope before audiences start guffawing in the aisles. John Carter was unfairly ridiculed for its preposterous aliens and pre-Apollo-era approach to interplanetary travel. But Star Wars – which on the face of it is no less silly – seems to get a free pass on the space nonsense front. As Trevorrow remarked this week: “Here’s a character. His father is part-robot, but he can also do magic. And there’s a guy who can fly in a spaceship. He’s got a dog for a friend! – it sounds insane. But it’s the greatest story ever told!”While there’s no guaranteed template for success, projects such as Empress are surely vital conduits to test the water before Hollywood dives in blind to another era of colourful galactic nonsense. Only if audiences can be convinced of the genre’s ability to flourish in the absence of lightsabers, Jedi knights and hairy starship co-pilots will we know if space opera really is primed for its second coming.
