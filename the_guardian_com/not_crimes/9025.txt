In any urban conurbation you can observe trudging figures with disposable coffee cups clamped to their faces like poly-paper snouts. This gives the commuter the appearance of a Womble – unfortunately one less committed to making good use of rubbish.Billions of single-use cups are thrown into landfill sites every year and, according to the WWF, to produce a single latte requires 200 litres of water, including the materials and manufacture of the paper cup and cardboard sleeve.But is that stained ceramic novelty cup really so superior? In 1994 Professor Martin B Hocking of the University of Victoria in Canada carried out an analysis of the life cycles of beverage cups, pitching the reusable – ceramic, plastic and glass – against the disposable – paper and foam – also factoring in the energy use in manufacturing materials and cleaning of a reusable cup. The ceramic cup is environmentally preferable, but only if it is reused until it is retired. Drop and smash that cup early on and a paper-based disposable cup can almost match it for eco efficiency. A Dutch study later found the energy burden of washing the cup even more significant.Meanwhile this planet's caffeine corporations are attempting to narrow the odds against disposable even more through innovation. Costa, which doles out 100m cups in the UK each year, is working on a "next generation" single-use cup with increased recycled content and FSC-certified pulp paper. It also points out its paper cups can be recycled (the process was tried out at a paper mill in Kent) but that recyclers "do not value the paper cup".Valuing cups is a point Starbucks is keen to work on – not least at its annual Cup Summit. In 2006 it began using 10% recycled post-consumer waste in its cups – fairly revolutionary in recycling terms. The goal is to make 100% of cups reusable or recyclable by 2015.So the eco superiority of the ceramic cup is being challenged. But avoid gloating. It is hard to think that millions of single-use cups aren't a ridiculous use of resources. We need to question why we have developed this habit of ingesting so many expensive caffeine products. If you're not ready to go cold turkey, invest in a reusable portable cup – a halfway house. The "barrista friendly" KeepCup has a new mini version for espresso and macchiato – the caffeine addict's eco compromise.
