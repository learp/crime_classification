When I get ready for a glamorous event I just use more of the same products that I use in the day, with a slightly bigger trowel. I’ve become a convert to Charlotte Tilbury since I was introduced to her by one of the makeup ladies on Strictly last season. After I did Strictly, there was a decompression phase when I still thought it appropriate to wear sequins in the day. Initially I could wear as many as I liked because it was Christmas, but in the new year I had to tone everything down.I’ve always liked dressing up: I love false eyelashes and a high heel. I am all or nothing: I am either in jeans, no makeup and a ponytail at home or glam with big hair. I am not very good at doing the in-between, “just smart for work’”.A perk of telly is being able to borrow things that I would otherwise not have access to. For the Baftas, I borrowed a long navy dress from Amanda Wakeley that I loved. I also tried on a razzle-dazzle party dress: it was black and gold with fringes and, to my utter delight, Beyoncé had worn it. Then I started getting self-conscious and thought about that comparative photo of a 45-year-old me and Beyoncé in the same dress. So I stuck with the beautiful navy one.Joanna Lumley: ‘I like a bright lipstick in a “Patsy red”’ I am acutely conscious that I don’t want to look as if I’m trying to be 25, but I spent a lot of my 30s trying to look 40, because I had a serious job doing the news. So I probably dress younger now than 15 years ago. It’s a balance: I don’t want to look as though I’ve borrowed my teenager’s clothes and nor do I want to look like the dowager duchess.• Katie Derham presents the BBC Proms 2016, which run from 15 July-10 September, and appears in the Strictly Prom on 21 July.
