Fortune Cookie is a typically charming, soulful story from the amazing Cathy Cassidy. I love the fact that – instead of making all the chocolate box series about girls – this story includes a boy, giving the reader an interesting surprise.Jack is troublemaker, but he is also a kind-hearted, caring and honest person (even if he lies once or twice). Living with his mum and sisters in a grubby flat just above a Chinese restaurant, Jack feels like the luckiest person to have a family and a place to stay. However, when things go from bad to worse, and a terrible mistake turns his world upside down, Jake has no choice but to pay a visit to his long lost sister Honey Tanberry. We see the sister through his own eyes, and his presence helps bring an end to the hatred between Honey and Cherry.Within this story, Jake realizes that everyone is not who they seem, and that even though everything may look perfect - it certainly is not. This is just like his sisters who too have their own problems. This story relaxes and warms you. When everything is put right, we are comforted with a happy ending. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, because whatever the age, this story is AMAZING!How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
