The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is taking legal action over the way a set of unofficial “Oscars gift bags” have been marketed.Mink eyelashes and armpit nappies: what are the worst Oscar goody bag gifts? The Academy claims that the marketing firm Distinctive Assetshas misrepresented their own goodie bags to make them seem officially affiliated with the awards ceremony, which takes place later this month, when in fact they are entirely unrelated.On Tuesday, the Academy filed a lawsuit against the marketing company, which specialises in product promotion through celebrity placement. The film organisation claims that Distinctive Assets has intentionally misled media outlets and the public as to their relation to the Oscars. Slogans such as “Everyone Wins at the Oscars®! Nominee Gift Bags” are being used as evidence of copyright infringement.The Academy’s lawsuit says: “Deeply concerned about the confusion Distinctive Assets was spreading, the Academy’s legal counsel wrote Distinctive Assets on or about February 17, 2015, to inform it that it ‘is critical that no one be confused into believing that your gift bags are associated with or have any connection with the Academy.’”The $200,000 (£140,000) bags, which are set to be given to all acting and directing nominees, have drawn media attention because of some of their tawdrier components, including a “vampire breast lift” and a $250 sex toy. “The media coverage reveals that Distinctive Assets appears to be taking no steps to stop wrongfully implying a relationship with the Academy,” the suit went onto read.Distinctive Assets are yet to respond.
