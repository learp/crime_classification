A former president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has challenged the body which organises the Oscars to help increase diversity in the wake of the current row over all-white lists of nominees.Hawk Koch, a producer of movies such as Source Code and Gorky Park who was president of the Academy from 2012 to 2013, said efforts should be made in Hollywood to include all under-represented groups in every area of the industry.“I know that many programs already exist but, clearly our industry needs to do more to find and develop talent in all the crafts,” he wrote, in an open letter to fellow Academy members published by Variety. “We must work with the Unions and the Guilds as well as schools across the country to identify and cultivate the talent of African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, women, LGBTs, the disabled and all under represented groups. And then we have to allow them access to every single aspect of film-making.”Added Koch: “We are an industry of creative people, people! We should be able to use the very thing Idris Elba mentioned in his powerful speech to the British Parliament — our imagination … I want to personally challenge each and every branch of our industry — production, designers, cinematographers, sound mixers, editors, composers, makeup artists, hair stylists, casting directors, publicists, attorneys, agents, managers, animators, visual effects, writers, directors, producers, executives — to form committees whose sole purpose would be to imagine and create programs to extend opportunities to those without it.”Will Smith confirms he won't attend Oscars in row over lack of diversity Koch also said he did not believe current proposals for a boycott of the Oscars, an idea mooted by Jada Pinkett Smith and which the civil rights leader Al Sharpton has promised to make a reality, were the correct move forward. “While such an idea shines a necessary light on the issue, now more than ever we have the responsibility to actively work together to fix the problem with concrete steps,” he said.Koch’s comments came on the same day that double Oscar-nominee Will Smith confirmed he would be joining his wife Pinkett Smith in non-attendance at the Oscars. Speaking on Good Morning America, Smith said that diversity was “the American superpower” and that attending next month’s ceremony, given the lack of it among this year’s nominated performers, would therefore be “awkward”.The furore over Oscar diversity erupted after no people from black or ethnic minority backgrounds were named among the 20 acting nominees for the world’s most famous film ceremony for the second year in a row. Smith denied his own failure to garner an Oscar-nomination for the NFL drama Concussion had inspired his wife’s actions, pointing out that he was out of the country when Pinkett Smith posted her first video.“She’s deeply passionate and when she is moved, she has to go,” he said. “And I heard her words and I was knocked over, you know, I was happy to be married to that woman.”
