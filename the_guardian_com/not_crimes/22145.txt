Opera North’s production of Wagner’s complete Ring Cycle toured sold-out concert halls across England last year to huge acclaim. The semi-staged concert performances, with the orchestra and singers on the stage in front of giant screens that integrated impressionistic video with surtitles and other narrative, were hailed as enthralling experiences and praised for both their intimacy and a matchless cast of singers and musicians that brought Wagner’s music thrillingly to life.

This is back-to-basics Wagner, and in many respects it feels like a liberation,” wrote Martin Kettle in his Guardian review. The live performances were filmed over a week at Leeds Town Hall in May 2016, and the entire cycle is now available to view, free, on the BBC – and in part here on the Guardian.
