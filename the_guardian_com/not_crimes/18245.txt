I would love to say I start getting ready for a snazzy do at lunchtime, but I have two children, a dog and a husband, so it’s not until 4pm that I’ll close my bedroom door to make sure the kids and the dog are on the other side.I shower and give my hair a wash and a deep cleansing treatment so I can control the spiral curls. Then I’ll de-fluff in the shower because, unless I’ve got a big night out, it’s not getting done.My makeup takes 20 minutes. I put on primer before concealer and foundation, anything to stop the makeup sliding off, because I will be dancing; it doesn’t matter where I go, I always find music. I use Mac and Bobbi Brown, and a lot of it comes from work. When I finish a job, they give me the makeup palette they’ve used. I still have Darcey’s eyeshadows from Cutting It 15 years ago.Nina Conti: ‘I don’t take my makeup off before I go to bed. It’s too boring’ When I did the red carpet at the Golden Globes and the Oscars six years ago, I had a stylist who picked out the most beautiful blush, floor-length, Jenny Packham dress. I wore it last year at the National Television Awards with nude heels from New Look. I don’t like wearing heels but I like the way they make me look. I have size nine feet, so finding anything that fits is difficult.I turned 40 this year, and I’m a lot less “fashion” than I used to be. I am not bothered about looking as if I’ve just walked out of a magazine. I am probably a bit cooler than I used to be; I was too try-hard before. There was a time when I would go, “I must wear something that comes from Harvey Nichols if I am going to be photographed”. Now, I am head to toe in Topshop!.• Angela Griffin stars in the new series of Ordinary Lies on BBC1.
