At a Guardian members’ dinner at The Reliance in Leeds, which formed part of the Leeds Indie Food festival, head chef Tom Hunter prepared a four-course vegetarian menu to celebrate the start of the summer.Using fresh, seasonal, local ingredients sourced from Yorkshire, the main course included meaty St George’s mushrooms foraged from a secret Leeds location, but you could use an alternative. Here’s how you can prepare the dish at home. Serves four.For the gnocchi1kg floury potatoes75g plain flour75g potato flour1 egg, whiskedSalt and pepperBake the potatoes until soft.
