Kanye West has threatened to boycott the 2017 Grammy awards if Frank Ocean doesn’t receive nominations for his two albums Blonde and Endless. This could prove delicate for the awards as, according to reports, neither Blonde nor Endless were even entered for the Grammys before the 30 September deadline, despite being eligible for inclusion. What’s more, it’s believed that this may have been a conscious decision by Ocean and his team.Frank Ocean: Blonde review – abstract, atmospheric beauty One Blonde superfan, though, is not going to let it lie. Speaking during his show in Oakland, California, West said: “The album I listen to the most this year is Frank Ocean’s album. I’ll tell you this right now, if his album is not nominated in no [sic] categories, I’m not showing up to the Grammys. As artists, we’ve got to come together to fight the bullshit.”He then invited the head of the Grammys to “come and holla at Ye”.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It’s not the first time West has thrown his support behind Blonde. Following its release he tweeted to say: “... Frank album on repeat”. He then called on radio stations to pick their favourite track from the not-particularly-radio-friendly album and play it 10 times a day, in order to “create a more inspired world”. The Grammys nominations list is due to be revealed on 8 December.
