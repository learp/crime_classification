Wishing that our parents were more “normal” is the cornerstone of many childhoods, if not all. But no child knows this more than those with hippy parents.A cupped hand filled with sunflower seeds at break time, packed lunches of falafel and lentils, hand-knitted hand-me-down jumpers, and acoustic guitar sing-a-longs to finish the day; the life of a child raised by hippies wasn’t easy. In a piece for the Guardian’s Weekend magazine, writer Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett describes how the hippy lifestyle is back in fashion – if only with a slightly cleaner and Instagram-ready slant. Cowhide yurts have been swapped for five-star glamping, flower hairbands are purchased on Etsy, and meditation comes in downloadable 30-minute sessions to your smartphone: “commodification of the counterculture is complete,” says Cosslett.Share your storiesIf you were raised by hippies, or raised children within a hippy lifestyle, we’d like you to share your experiences with us.
