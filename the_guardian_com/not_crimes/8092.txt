Prince would have turned 58 next week. To mark the occasion, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) is releasing a free download of his pro-vegan song Animal Kingdom, which he recorded for the charity nearly two decades ago.The track– which is available to stream now via the Peta website – is a stripped-back, spacey acoustic number. His voice distorted, Prince sings the lyrics: “No member of the animal kingdom ever did a thing to me / It’s why I don’t eat red meat or white fish / Don’t give me no blue cheese / We’re all members of the animal kingdom / Leave your brothers and sisters in the sea.”The late musician had been a long-time supporter of animal rights, and donated the song to Peta for its 20th anniversary in 1999. Mayte Garcia, Prince’s ex-wife, who is working alongside the charity, has said that they would mark his birthday every year, encouraging Prince fans to make a “veg pledge” and go vegan in support of his legacy. Prince – a life in pictures “Prince didn’t want to celebrate birthdays, but to live life, to elevate and educate to the next level of enlightenment,” said Garcia. “My mission every 7 June is not only to celebrate his birth, but also with Peta to remember this man by making 7 June a day where Prince fans go vegan to see how much better they feel and to honour his kind legacy.“Prince said ‘compassion is an action word with no boundaries’, and that’s our message with this campaign, which everyone can participate in.”Earlier this week, an autopsy report showed Prince’s death in April was from an accidental overdose of the prescription painkiller fentanyl. The results are said to have surprised friends and family members, who said Prince avoided alcohol and drugs and maintained a healthy lifestyle.
