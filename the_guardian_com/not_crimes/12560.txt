Last month on the reading group we had the great pleasure of reading Penelope Fitzgerald, a superb female writer who didn’t start publishing until she was 58. This month, we’ll look at Angela Carter, another great talent – but one who produced all her works before her premature death at just 52.It’s going to be some contrast. Fitzgerald is brief, sharp, arch and elusive. Angela Carter’s books burst with a very different energy. She deals in great torrents of words, pinging ideas, bright images. Her genre and reality-bending novels have even been accused of magical realism. But don’t be put off if you’re cynical about overwrought fancy. It’s the real life, the down and dirty humanity that counts in books like Nights at the Circus. Carter produced visceral, smart and often fiercely political literature that roars from the page. I can’t wait to get stuck in – and I hope you’ll join me. The only question is, which one to read? As often, we’ll put it down to a vote. There’s no shortage of material to choose from. She wrote nine novels, and six collections of short stories, as well as a number of superb, fierce essays and pieces of journalism (you can find a good bibliography on her Wikipedia page. Do read her life story as well. She was a very impressive individual.) So please place your suggestions in the comments below. As usual, all ideas about topics for discussion, further reading and all other thoughts about this splendid writer will also be gratefully received.(Oh, and a quick heads-up for next month. We’re going to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Anthony Burgess.)
