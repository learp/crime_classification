Cheryl Edwards does not look like your typical farmer. “If she’s 5ft 4in, it would be a miracle. She is as slightly built as you could imagine,” says Tim Wilson, who runs the Ginger Pig butchery chain.“One day we were in the kitchen, and Cheryl popped her head round the door and said: ‘There’s a longhorn calving.’ We said we’d give her a hand but she said: ‘I’ve done it. The calf’s in the shed,’” he recalls. That’s an English longhorn, named for their – you guessed it – long horns; the type of cow that weighs north of 500kg, and Wilson had figured she would need some men to help her manage.Women such as Edwards, who now has her own flock of sheep and works on a number of different farms, might lack the brute strength to push cows around, but that isn’t stopping them working in the agricultural sector. “An animal will do whatever you want, if you take the time. A bucket of feed held under their nose is a lot easier than standing behind and pushing them,” adds Wilson.And for all the really heavy lifting jobs, there is always a pallet and forklift. Not to mention an assortment of machines to help handle cattle, adds Caroline Millar, a Perthshire farmer who is chairing next year’s Oxford Farming Conference.This all helps explain why the number of women running farms in the UK has jumped by nearly 10% to more than 25,000 between 2010 and 2013, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). That means 28% of the British agricultural workforce is female, and the picture is similar overseas. “In the past, women weren’t encouraged to take over the family farm, but that’s changing,” Millar adds. “Women in the farming business have historically been farmers’ wives, but why should the word ‘farmer’ mean a male person?”Lyndsey Martin, a 28-year-old beef and sheep farmer in Kent, believes more women are entering the industry because “there is less of a stigma between male and female jobs [and] girls are more confident about their choices”.Those choices include studying agricultural-related courses at universities and colleges, which attracted 25% more women than men in 2015, the latest enrolment figures from Defra show. And in the past five years, the number of female students opting for agriculture at Shropshire’s Harper Adams University has doubled.Six years ago, Wilson would have laughed if you’d told him he would prefer hiring stockwomen to stockmen to look after the animals on his North Yorkshire farm, where he has roughly 40 longhorns, 500 sheep and 1,000 pigs. He sent packing the first woman to ask for a job, only to change his mind a few weeks later. Mel Wall still works for him. What’s more, three-quarters of his farm employees are now female and he can “definitely” see that hitting 100% soon.“I don’t want to make it sound like [women] are better than men, but they are more conscientious, they have got more feeling, and they’re probably kinder, which makes their animal husbandry better,” he adds. Plus he finds men prefer to work on arable farms where they can drive big machines.Katie Anderson, who runs Muddy Boots Farm in Essex, says switching to farming was a “life choice” because she hadn’t enjoyed her first career, working in property in London. But she struggles to shake the notion that “if you are a female farmer, you must be a farmer’s wife or a farmer’s daughter”, which she isn’t. “That undermines many women’s hard work and success.”
