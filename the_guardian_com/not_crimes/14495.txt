This is my favourite book written by Jeff Kinney because it is the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid that has a proper story.The story is about a character called Silas Scratch and the problems he causes everyone. It is a sort of mystery story with unexpected twists and turns and the ending is a real surprise. I was really hooked from the first page. I really recommend it, especially if you like the Diary of the Wimpy Kid books.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book youâ€™ve read?
