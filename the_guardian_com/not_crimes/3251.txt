Fashion mogul Pierre Bergé has announced that he will put the second part of his famous library – one of the most valuable in private hands – up for auction in November.The French philanthropist, who co-founded the Yves Saint Laurent fashion empire with the late designer, who was his partner, raised €11.7m (£9.2m) from the sale of the first part of his collection last year.He now intends to put 380 works that include some of the cream of 19th-century European literature under the hammer, he said in a statement on Wednesday.They include the manuscripts of the Marquis de Sade’s last novel, The Secret History of Isabella of Bavaria, and Gustave Flaubert’s Over Strand and Field – an account of his tour of Loire and Brittany in 1886.Although the full catalogue of the Paris sales will not be released until September, it will also include signed books exchanged between Balzac, Hugo, Stendhal and Baudelaire.English-language, German and Russian classics will also feature, with rare editions by Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth, Wilde, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Kleist and Goethe.“You have to know how to get rid of things,” Bergé, 85, said before the last sale.The proceeds of the auction – to be held on 8-9 November and run by Sotheby’s in Paris – will go to a foundation Bergé set up with Saint Laurent that helps support Aids research.
