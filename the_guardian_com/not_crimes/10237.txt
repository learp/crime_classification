What’s the name of this show? Rush Hour.When does it premiere? Thursday 31 March at 10pm EST.Is this based on the movie series starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker? Yes.Did that need to be made into a TV show? No.Is it exactly the same as the movie, with a blend of action, martial arts and comedy? Essentially.So there are two cops who both want to work alone and don’t like each other and they’re forced to be partners even though they have completely different styles of investigating crime? Yup.And the Chris Tucker character doesn’t like to do things by the book and when his case goes south his boss fires him and then he solves the case anyway and is promoted? Duh.Is it good? Hardly.Is it not funny? Assuredly.How many people are killed in the premiere? Nine.How many people get hit in the balls? One.What things do they destroy? Helicopter, green house, pool cue, flatscreen TV and dignity. Does the villain look like a blonde Justin Bieber? Of course. Seriously, dude, you have to give me more than all of these one word answers! Alright, fine. The problem with Rush Hour isn’t that it is the most awful show on television, it’s just that it’s so incredibly lazy it barely merits speaking about it. The comedy is rote, the dialogue is wooden, and the performances by Justin Hires and Jon Foo, in the Tucker and Chan roles respectively, are nil. The Rush Hour movies, though not perfect, were at least fun. This is not. It seems like a cash grab by CBS, trying to add a bit of funny business and karate chops to its usual procedural formula and failing badly. By the time the two begrudgingly decide to work together even though they hate each there are very few people who would actually root for that pairing to work for years to come. It’s also a total waste because a show with an Asian and African American lead (and a regular cast nearly devoid of white people) rarely gets made and this one is an opportunity gone awry.Should I watch this show? Nope.
