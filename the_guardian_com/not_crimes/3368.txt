The actor Tom Hiddleston has fuelled speculation that he could replace Daniel Craig as James Bond, saying he was a huge fan of the 007 films and would not take on the role lightly.Hiddleston, who is starring in the BBC adaptation of John le Carré’s The Night Manager, said playing Bond would be an “extraordinary opportunity” if “it ever came knocking”.According to some bookmakers, Hiddleston, who went to school at Eton followed by Cambridge University, is quoted as 10/1 to be the next actor to play the role, making him the sixth-favourite. Tom Hardy and Idris Elba are first and second, ahead of Homeland’s Damian Lewis, Poldark’s Aidan Turner, and the Superman star Henry Cavill. Speaking to the Sunday Times, Hiddleston said: “Time magazine ran a poll and there were, like, 100 actors on the list, including Angelina Jolie. But, yes, it’s nice to be included in the 100. Tom Hardy, Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba … who should be the next James Bond? “I’m a huge fan of the series. We all went to see Spectre when we were shooting Skull Island in Hawaii. I simply love the theme tune, the tropes and the mythology. I love the whole thing. If it ever came knocking, it would be an extraordinary opportunity.”He added: “And I’m very aware of the physicality of the job. I would not take it lightly.”Craig, who has been playing Bond since 2005, triggered speculation he may give up the role when he told Time Out he would “rather break this glass and slash my wrists” than make another Bond film. “We’re done. All I want to do is move on,” he added. “If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Daniel Craig’s penultimate outing as James Bond pits him against a mysterious organisation headed up by a new nemesis, played by Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz. Ralph Fiennes, Monica Bellucci and Lea Seydoux also starHe later clarified his remarks, telling the BBC: “I’m quite straightforward and I say things when I feel it and then I change my mind. I’m just like everybody else. People latch on to things. There’s not a lot I can do about that.”Hardy, who recently starred as both Kray twins in the crime thriller Legend, told the Evening Standard last year he would “smash it out the park” if he ever got the opportunity to play Bond.
