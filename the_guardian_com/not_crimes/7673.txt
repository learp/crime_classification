Now, although the ending of this book was ruined for me, it didn’t take away the pleasure of reading it. Despite the agonising ending which I really wish didn’t occur…The rest of the book was just as great as Divergent and Insurgent, only it was much darker, with much more action and character development. I have to admit, although Allegiant is a long book, there are way too many plot holes, and many situations where I didn’t pay attention, as they shifted too much from the main plot of the book. Despite all the plot twists, this book is much slower than the first two which was a down side. However, the ending is written very well and I definitely didn’t expect it because it was very unique. I really didn’t know how to feel at the end of the book as I just felt very emotional and lost with the massive turn of events.I am looking forward to watching the last movie instalment which has claimed to change parts of the book. However, I don’t think the film will be as good as the book and neither do I think it will generate as many emotions as the book did.
