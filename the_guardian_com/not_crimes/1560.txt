Of all the things I half expect to derail a marathon training schedule - niggles or injuries, work/life balances issues, stitches, head not in the right place, etc, coming down with a nasty bug never seems to occur to me. Unfortunately that’s what happened to me last week, so while my weekend running has been fine, I did absolutely none last week. I haven’t taken that many days ‘off’ - if you can call lying listlessly and feverishly in bed watching box sets on the laptop ‘off’ - in years. A few days on, I’ve regained the ability to run, but totally lost my voice. Not a problem for marathon training, though somewhat limiting my ability to parent (try telling a stubborn five year old to do something she doesn’t want to, without being able to do the “I really mean it now” voice ...). I missed two hard mid-week runs, had to limit the length of my long run yesterday to 14 (should have been 19) but all in all, it’s probably not that bad a thing. At least my legs had a rest. So for all of you feeling under the weather - and there do seem to be an awful lot at the moment - take it easy. Tuck up under the duvet, put on the box sets and get better before you venture out again. Tara - that means you. And if anyone finds my voice, please return to Guardian HQ ...
