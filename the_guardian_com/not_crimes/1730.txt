The action thriller Bastille Day, starring Idris Elba, has been pulled from French cinemas following the Nice truck attack.The film, in which Elba plays a CIA agent aiming to thwart a terrorist attack in Paris on the national holiday, was released in France on Wednesday.The next day Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel ploughed a 19-tonne truck into a crowd of people who had been watching a fireworks display in Nice, killing 84 people and injuring more than 200 more. Distributors StudioCanal had already decided to take down posters and adverts for the film, which had been marketed with the tagline “Cette Année, Le Feu d’Artifice C’est Eux” (“This year, they are the fireworks”). It was being shown in 230 cinemas and StudioCanal had originally left it to them to decide whether to show it.But, on Saturday, Antoine Banet-Rivet, a spokesman for the distributors, said the film had been withdrawn from cinemas out of respect for the victims and their families.The film’s original planned release in the UK and Germany was postponed earlier this year, from February and March respectively, in light of the November attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. It was eventually released in the UK in April and in Germany last month.In March, Sky postponed the launch of the second series of its drama series The Tunnel after the attacks on Brussels airport and on the city’s metro system, which killed 32 people. The opening episode of the second series, which sees the protagonists investigating a terror network, was pushed back by a week. In series one the terrorists caused a catastrophic crash of an airliner into the Channel.
