Severe thunderstorms brought strong winds, flash flooding, hail and tornadoes over the southern Great Plains in the US last week. A lowpressure system pushed a cold front eastwards over Oklahoma and northern Texas, generating supercell thunderstorms. This in turn spawned numerous tornadoes, the strongest of which occurred just east of Tipton, Tillman County, in southern Oklahoma on Monday. The tornado ranked as an EF4 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, the first time such a big tornado has occurred in Oklahoma in November since records began in 1950. Maximum wind speeds were estimated to have been between 166mph and 200mph.Storms brought heavy rain, strong winds and golf ball sized hail across Melbourne, Australia, on Wednesday afternoon and evening, with 37.8mm being recorded at Viewbank between 7pm and 11pm local time. A cold front gave strong gusts of wind and heavy rainfall across British Columbia on Friday. Gusts reached 62mph at Solander Island, cancelling ferries and causing widespread power outages.Finally, the western coast of Alaska was hit with its worst storm since 1974 last Wednesday. A storm surge as high as 3 metres above normal caused coastal flooding, whilst winds reached maximum gusts of 89mph in Wales along the western coast. Blizzards were also reported, with 19cm of snow being recorded at Kotzebue, breaking the previous 9 November record of 12cm.
