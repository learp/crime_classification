Self Drives: The Trabant (Weekdays, 1.45pm, Radio 4) is an extraordinary road trip: Will Self is 6ft 5in and his passenger – childhood friend Mike Shamash – is approximately half that. The pair were pals as youngsters, drifted apart, and – despite Self having previously made some ill-advised comments about people who, like Shamash, are of restricted growth – are now friends once again. The idea is to drive the notorious communist-era car some 700 miles back to Zwickau in Saxony, where these miniature, two-stroke-engined vehicles were turned out in their millions in the days of East Germany, challenging some of the cliches about life in that state as they go. (My favourite East German cliche is that its leader Erich Honecker once began a speech with the words “If I die”. Let’s hope that one survives). They end the first episode stationary on the hard shoulder of a Belgian motorway, the plastic-moulded people’s chariot sadly lacking a fuel gauge.Back in the Age Of Sail, the strong, waterproof material known as tarpaulin had a hundred uses. The flags of pirates were improvised from it. Regular sailors, who slept on deck beneath it, were known as “tarpaulins” or “tars”. In The Tarpaulin – A Biography (Monday, 8pm, Radio 4) historian Dina Gusejnova finds it still plays a vital role for people living in extremis, whether in the migrant camp at Calais or as part of an experiment in the simple life, just outside Tunbridge Wells.In the months leading up to the presidential election, I eavesdropped on US podcasts and broadcasts covering the campaign. It’s been startling to go back to those same programmes in the days after the election to hear the surprise in the voices of the presenters, no matter where they’re placed on the political spectrum. Post-election they’re suddenly talking to different people. The Sun Comes Up, the post-election episode of This American Life, begins with two police officers in South Florida, who voted Obama in 2008, Romney in 2012 and Trump in 2016. The reporter finds them just as they hear the news. “This is almost as good as the Dolphins winning the Super Bowl,” one says. They don’t see themselves as having changed in any way. In Wrong Number, the post-election instalment of the excellent On The Media, analyst Nate Silver defends the pollsters on the grounds that they always showed the race as being close. The problem was the media didn’t want to believe it.New this week is Cooking In A Bedsitter (Monday, 11.30am, Radio 4), Sue Teddern’s sweet story of girls in flats in the 60s, based on Katharine Whitehorn’s book of the same name. As Trisha battles with the grim realities of bedsit life back in the days of coin-operated everything, her parents hope that she will come back home, forsaking her new friends Millie, Lulu, Peter and Gordon.
