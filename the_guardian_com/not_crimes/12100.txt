As gardeners in eastern and southern Britain hang up their hosepipes for the summer, it may be worth considering one way of soothing their pain and at the same time easing the current water shortage in the UK's most populous regions. Discourage the growing of grass. Specifically, grass that is purely aesthetic, kept short, and which absorbs thousands of gallons of mains water in every dry year. Lawns, once a celebration of status, are nowadays an affront to changing climate. They are an environmental desert, generally a monoculture where any tendency to biodiversity is vexed by the application of noxious weedkillers. Clover, buttercups, daisies and dainty speedwell are all unwelcome. Even worms are to be deterred. Meanwhile, keeping the sward green and encouraging it to grow requires – as well as copious water – regular applications of oil-based fertiliser. And having got it growing, cutting it back again takes more resource-intensive machinery. Some claim that lawns have a certain benefit as a kind of natural air conditioner. But they serve no socially useful purpose, or none that would not be better served by turning the space over to vegetables. If that sounds over-prescriptive, it would be less effortful to allow a wildflower meadow to develop. Golf courses, commons and sports fields are shared public spaces and fall into a different category. But, while a property tax remains a distant dream, a tax on private lawns beyond a certain size is within the gift of every chancellor.
