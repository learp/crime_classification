I am a literary poacher-turned-gamekeeper; a novelist who has started a book festival.Festivals have become such a cornerstone of our culture and visiting them such a major part of promoting a book that it’s hard to remember when most book events were confined to libraries and bookshops. Visiting festivals now takes up so much time that I divide my life into writing years and talking years, so as to minimise the discomfort of talking about one book when my head is filling up with another. Most novelists are at the shy end of the spectrum – sly watchers of life rather than noisy graspers of it – and many of us have had to overcome that and develop a performative persona behind which the sly watcher can continue to lurk. Never mind learning how to tweet – when I talk to writing students now, I urge them to act, or at least get some training in handling an audience.Many of us are isolated, too, so festivals should provide a wonderful opportunity to meet other writers. But all too often the rushed experience is part of a longer tour; you arrive in Tresoddit Parva just in time to glimpse an author you’ve always admired before you’re ushered before an audience to talk and sign books before catching a train to St Wallop.So when I started the North Cornwall book festival, which runs this weekend, I kept it small, with the minimum of overlapping events, so that readers can aspire to see almost everything. And we encourage any authors who aren’t local to stay for the whole thing, so they have time to befriend each other and leave having done more than simply talk and sign copies. And along with the likes of Jackie Kay, Andrew Miller and Francesca Simon, there is a bar and an abundance of homemade cake.•The North Cornwall book festival at St Endellion runs from 21 to 23 October
