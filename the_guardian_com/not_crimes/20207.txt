It says something about our current uneasy relationship with technology that this autumn offers up not one but three deeply creepy sci-fi series. HBO’s Westworld has already got its stetson on and is busy chilling people to the bone with its tale of a malfunctioning AI theme park, while Charlie Brooker’s angsty anthology series Black Mirror makes its move to Netflix later this month. If that weren’t enough, powering up for a second series at the end of October is Channel 4’s deeply dystopic drama Humans.
