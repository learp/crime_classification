What is it?We’ve had 3D cinema, 4D cinema, Secret Cinema, rooftop, hot tub cinema… While we’re not quite at virtual-reality cinema yet, Edible Cinema provides an immersive experience by matching what’s happening on screen with a custom-made menu.How does it work?After being greeted at the door with a drink (Bombay Sapphire is a mainstay), you find a tray of food on your seat, divided into little numbered boxes. At the appropriate moment in the film, indicated by a screen-side light box, you eat or drink its contents. So for a scene involving the sea you might get something salty or smoky overtones for a gun fight.Secret Cinema: five films that shouldn't get the ‘immersive experience’ treatment Hmm, sounds gimmicky.Well, kind of. At around £38, it’s not cheap and make sure you have a light meal first – the dainty portions are more geared towards enhancing ambience than sating hunger. And, while Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Our Little Sister was a wonderful choice of film, navigating chopsticks in the dark while reading subtitles was a challenge.But is it worth it?If you’re a cinephile and gourmand, it’s worth trying. It helps if you have a slightly dark sense of humour: during the orgy scene in Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, guests munched away on mini cumberland sausages, while the appearance of Jack’s grisly ghost in An American Werewolf in London was complemented by a canape of venison jerky and bloody tomato dip.The next events are Our Little Sister at Curzon Soho, London W1, on Wednesday and Some Like It Hot at East Dulwich Picturehouse, London SE22 on 15 May
