‘Grief is so overpowering – it consumes you’: readers on death and dying Talking about death doesn’t come easy if you’re British. When broached, the topic seems to make people feel uncomfortable and can even be judged as a morbid conversation subject. But death is part and parcel of what it means to live. We talk about having the ‘time of our lives’ or ‘living life to the full’ but often try and forget what inevitably follows. We’d like to know what it means to you. Why do you think some people find it difficult to talk about death? What do you think it means to ‘die well’?We’re also interested to hear about different countries, religions or communities’ burial customs. From the Vajrayana Buddhism practice of sky burials, to hanging coffins in the Phillippines we’d like to hear your burial traditions.You can share your thoughts and experiences, anonymously if you prefer, using the form below.
