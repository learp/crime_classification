Game of Thrones breaks Emmy record and wins best drama for second year Updatedat 4.59am BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.04am BST04:04Dave SchillingThat was ... something. While I thoroughly enjoyed Jimmy Kimmel’s laconic, snarky performance as host, this year’s Emmys lacked surprise, controversy, or much to talk about. It was a by the book awards show, plodding along from category to category, rewarding many of the same people from years past. Even new winners like Rami Malek, who won best actor in a drama series for Mr Robot, had a whiff of the expected. Besides the typically elaborate, expensive set design, there wasn’t much that was grand about this show. Oh, and did I mention John Mayer?Updatedat 4.04am BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.57am BST03:57Brian MoylanDid The Americans and Mr Robot have better seasons than the sixth season of Game of Thrones? Sure. But Game of Thrones is still one of the most excellent programs around with sky-high production values and a galaxy of great characters. Should we be upset about it’s win? Of course not. And if you are, Khaleesi is coming for you.With this win it now has the most awards ever. Is that correct? Maybe, maybe not. But there’s no going back now.

But can’t we make a rule about comedy shows not being able to win two years in a row, because Blackish, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and Master of None really deserve a chance at the big award.

It’s taken four years for Tatiana Maslany to go from constant Emmy snub to winning the award. Like Keri Russell she plays a number of different characters on the same show, but unlike Russell her variety of accents and personalities are constantly shifting. She sometimes has to play one of her clones pretending to be another one of her clones. It’s a mind-bendingly amazing performance. Too bad the show hasn’t been that great the past few seasons.
