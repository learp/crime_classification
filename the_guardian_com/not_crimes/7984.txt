Britain’s Got Talent will not be investigated by the media watchdog over the revealing dresses worn by Alesha Dixon and Amanda Holden in the semi-final, despite nearly 20 complaints from viewers.Both judges chose revealing outfits for the second live semi-final of the ITV talent show, broadcast on 23 May, sparking 19 complaints to Ofcom.Dixon wore a revealing jumpsuit and Holden opted for a gown with a plunging neckline. Ofcom assessed the complaints but decided that they did not warrant launching a full investigation of a potential breach of the UK broadcasting code.“We assessed a number of complaints about the suitability of clothing worn by two female judges before the watershed, but won’t be taking the matter forward for investigation,” said a spokesman for Ofcom. “The dresses worn by the judges did not raise issues under our rules on nudity, and the judges were not portrayed in a sexualised way.”Ofcom also cleared the choice of dresses chose by the two judges for last year’s BGT final, which drew about 90 complaints to Ofcom and a further 200 to ITV.
