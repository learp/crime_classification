Sow this A few rows of annual flowers criss-crossing your veg patch doesn’t just look pretty – it lures in beneficial insects such as lacewings and hoverflies (whose larvae hoover up aphids), and bees and butterflies to pollinate crops. Sow pot marigolds, nigella, poached egg plant and cosmos in situ now: they will self-seed for a repeat performance in future years.Split this If your pond is overtaken with waterlilies, it’s time to divide overcrowded plants. Lift them clear of the water and take a sharp knife (an old bread knife works) to the roots, cutting away sections of rhizome, each with a growing shoot. Replant the finest division with a fresh layer of aquatic compost, topped with pea shingle.Plant this Diascias are normally grown as annuals, but breeding has produced a plant that’s hardy to -8C, making it perennial in sheltered southerly gardens.
