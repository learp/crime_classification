Iowa’s Capitol II Theatre recently adopted a pet pig named Joy to attract audiences. The animal has made the picturehouse a firm favourite with the locals. Now we’d like to hear about your most unusual cinema experiences and see photos of the cinemas around the world you have discovered. Whether it’s a cinema gimmick your local has effectively deployed, an independent cinema you have spotted in an unusual place, or a favourite memory of your local picturehouse, share all your cinematic photos and stories with us. We’ll feature a selection of them on the site. You can share your pictures and stories by clicking on the blue ‘Contribute’ button on this article. You can also use the Guardian app and search for ‘GuardianWitness assignments’ – and if you add it to the homepage – you can keep up with all our assignments.GuardianWitness is the home of readers’ content on the Guardian. Contribute your video, pictures and stories, and browse news, reviews and creations submitted by others.
