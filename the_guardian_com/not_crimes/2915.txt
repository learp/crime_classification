The ambitiously, or perhaps foolishly, titled orcs v humans video game adaptation Warcraft: The Beginning was perceived as not just a standalone summer blockbuster but the first instalment in an epic new series of adventures. Before the film had even been released, director Duncan Jones was teasing that more was to come and Universal, a studio that’s seen franchises bloom in recent years from Fast & Furious to Despicable Me to Fifty Shades, was surely eyeing a Lord of the Rings style profit-making saga.Duncan Jones on Warcraft: 'If you get it wrong, people are going to be upset' But as every poorly received trailer and poster landed online, the buzz started to smell worse than the inside of an orc’s boot. The reviews were reflective of this undeniable stench. It was labelled “a contender for the worst movie of the year” and one reviewer hoped that the sequel “languishes in development hell forever”. Audiences made this a safe bet with a disastrous US opening of just $24.4m, meaning its domestic gross would be unlikely to make back even half of its $160m budget. Game over.But on the other side of the world, one country was desperately inserting coins to continue. Warcraft opened in China to a record-breaking five-day total of $156m, the highest ever debut for a foreign release, thanks to the game’s popularity, a whopping 26 brand sponsors and a stack of specially created localised marketing materials. Along with a strong showing from other countries, it’s up to $300m worldwide, with analysts suggesting that an entirely achievable $450m would be the magic break-even number that might even lead to a sequel.Its success has come just a week after news of John Boyega signing on to star in Pacific Rim 2, pushing the film closer to production. In 2013, this seemed an unlikely proposition. The reviews were more positive for Guillermo del Toro’s brash monster movie, but it failed to find the required audience in the US. A $101m total might sound respectable but from a $190m budget, it’s a disaster. Yet the film scored overseas, making $114m in China and topping out at $411m worldwide.

Pacific Rim 2 then became the first Hollywood sequel to be greenlit thanks to international audiences, and, if China continues to embrace the orcs actioner, Warcraft: The Middle could well be on the way.However, it’s not guaranteed. The resurrection of the Terminator franchise was seen as a regrettable decision by critics and audiences in the US, but in China, Terminator: Genisys was a hit, making $113m compared with a US total of just $89m. Ultimately, Paramount decided against their planned sequel, despite a $440m worldwide number. Paramount sued by Chinese company for failed Transformers product placement There’s also a problem with heritage when it comes to Chinese blockbusters. The success of Warcraft and Pacific Rim could be traced back to their relative newness. But the success of sequels and reboots often relies on brand awareness, and since many Hollywood films have never been released in China, that’s not always easy to ensure. Star Wars: The Force Awakens broke records around the world, but it was only moderately successful with Chinese audiences and its final underwhelming gross was seen by some analysts as the reason why the film didn’t beat Avatar’s international record. The first film in the series to be released in the country was Phantom Menace in 1999, meaning the saga doesn’t have the same feverish cult following in China. The forthcoming spin-off Rogue One: A Star Wars Story has smartly recruited Chinese stars Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Joseph Gordon Levitt in Looper.

Transformers: Age of Extinction was part-funded by China Movie Channel and utilised local talent and locations, while Iron Man 3 included extra footage in China with popular actor Fan Bingbing. It all started, though, with a more modestly budgeted film: 2009’s indie time-travel thriller Looper. A co-production with a Chinese company led to a major location change from Paris to Shanghai for key scenes, extended for the Chinese release, and it became the first US film to open to more money in China than at home. Working with a Chinese company also means that the film is exempt from the country’s strict annual quota of just 34 foreign movie releases (a number that may increase next year).Warcraft: The Beginning was also a co-production between Universal and Legendary, a company that has recently become a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate Wanda Media Group. Next year, the company is set to release prequel Kong: Skull Island and The Great Wall, a China-set fantasy adventure from director Zhang Yimou starring Matt Damon, a film that’s a clear sign of a growing commercial relationship between the two countries as well as a creative one.China sentences man to seven years in jail for watching 'sensitive' film It’s still likely to leave many Hollywood films unaffected but could lead to worrying side-effects. While spectacle translates well to international audiences, humour isn’t always as easy. Guardians of the Galaxy proved a hit with critics and audiences in most of the world, but it didn’t catch on in China. The title translation to Interplanetary Unusual Attacking Team goes some way to explain why the film’s unique brand of comedy was tough to convey. The less joke-heavy X-Men: Apocalypse has already eclipsed it.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Ryan Reynolds in Deadpool. Photograph: Allstar Picture LibraryIt’s also likely to affect content on a broader level, with Chinese censorship still notoriously stringent. Deadpool was denied a release in the country thanks to its violence, nudity and language, while Crimson Peak was barred because of its supernatural content as the censorship guidelines prohibit films that “promote cults or superstition”. An alarming, commercially minded future could see all blockbusters conforming to Chinese rules in order to maximise profits.The overseas success of Warcraft: The Beginning is an undeniable turning point for global box office, but the long-term effects remain unknown. Jackie Chan believes that it will lead to more homegrown blockbusters, once the Chinese film industry realises the money that can be made. That would make sense and hopefully curb an influx of overly modified US offerings.Appealing to an international audience doesn’t need to be a bad thing, but if the industry spends too much time and effort directing content to one country, one that has an entirely different view on so many issues, Hollywood could end up losing its domestic audience. Warcraft: The Beginning (and the end), please.
