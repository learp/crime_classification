A proposed boundary for Queensland’s Port of Gladstone fails to protect some vulnerable areas from development, conservationists say.The Queensland government on Monday revealed the boundary for a master plan of about 88,000 hectares it says will help protect the Great Barrier Reef while driving economic development.The proposed boundary includes land controlled by the Port of Gladstone and the Gladstone State Development Area.It also covers marine areas. But the Rockhampton’s Port Alma, the Fitzroy River Delta, Keppel Bay or North Curtis Island are not within the boundary.The Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) welcomed the exclusion of northern Curtis Island and the Fitzroy Delta from the plan but says other areas should also be excluded.“These areas deserve to be fully protected,” AMCS spokeswoman Felicity Wishart said.“However, we remain concerned about the inclusion of southern areas of Curtis Island and other islands, such as Facing Island, which are world heritage listed and should not be used for port expansion. It is important to remember that Gladstone remains an important area for dugongs, dolphins and turtles.”The state development minister, Anthony Lynham, insisted the plan considered marine and land-based impacts and environment values.The Queensland government is also developing master plans for the Abbot Point, Hay Point and Townsville ports as part of the Reef 2050 long-term sustainability plan.Labor has also introduced new laws into parliament to stop new ports being built along the reef coast and to ban sea dumping of dredge spoil.
