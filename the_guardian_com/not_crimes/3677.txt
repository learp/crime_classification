Thousands of homes along the Thames have been told to prepare for significant flooding, as the number of severe flood warnings in the south of England rises to 16.Fourteen of the warnings relate to a lengthy stretch of the Thames through Berkshire and Surrey, and two remain in place in the Somerset Levels.The Environment Agency (EA) said the Thames warnings stretched "from Datchet to Shepperton Green, including Ham Court and Chertsey, as river levels in the area are extremely high and are forecast to continue to rise".The communities secretary, Eric Pickles, said the areas were expected to suffer significant problems by the middle of the week.The latest storm was predicted to arrive in southern England and Wales on Monday evening with heavy rain of up to 0.78in (20mm), MeteoGroup said.While emergency work to prevent flooding continues, including the distribution of tens of thousands more sandbags by the Royal Marines, the EA boss has hit back at government critics.Lord Smith has accused ministers of "getting in the way" of vital work to deal with devastating floods by turning the crisis into a political row.The peer defended the quango's handling of the situation and issued a furious broadside at what he said were attempts by politicians to undermine the work and reputation of the agency in a bid to secure better media coverage.The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, who was leading the government response until being forced to take leave for an eye operation, has reportedly complained to Downing Street about Pickles's criticism of the EA.The energy secretary, Ed Davey, also insisted "blame games" were not the right focus for ministers."The government is focused on helping the people, the communities, the businesses who are struggling because of this weather, these floods," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."That has got to be our focus. Blame games I'm afraid are really not the focus."The prime minister's doing that, I will be doing that and I think the whole government needs to do that."He added: "Eric is playing a role with Cobra, with other ministers to make sure the government gets the help needed."As politicians traded blows on the political fallout from the flooding, police were investigating whether seven-year-old Zane Gbangbola, who died after falling ill in his flood-hit home in Chertsey, Surrey, may have become a victim of the floods.Officers have refused to be drawn on whether carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator pumping out floodwater from his home may have been to blame. His parents, Kye Gbangbola and Nicole Lawler, were also taken ill.There are more than 230 low-level flood alerts and more than 150 medium-risk warnings in place across Wales and central and southern England with severe weather expected throughout the week.The Met Office warned that river levels were expected to continue rising along the Thames, the Severn and the Dorset Stour this week.A further 20,000 sandbags are ready to be deployed to communities at risk of flooding on the Somerset Levels.Somerset county council staff have worked tirelessly alongside Royal Marines from 40 Commando throughout the weekend to prepare a further 20,000 sandbags for use.A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "Military personnel, currently mostly Royal Marines, continue to provide support in Somerset in areas affected by floods as part of cross-government and multi-agency relief efforts."As the prime minister has said, all available resources are being brought to bear to help those still struggling as a result of the floods."The Ministry of Defence has put 1,600 personnel on six hours' notice to help in the south.Surrey police and Thames Valley police have issued safety advice to residents in their area expected to be affected by flooding.A spokesman for Surrey police said up to 2,500 homes were at risk of flooding and added that military assistance was being provided.The prime minister, speaking after chairing a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee on Sunday, said he had "made clear again that every resource is available to the local communities affected". Network Rail had been told to do "whatever it takes" to restore badly disrupted rail links, he said. The south-west was cut off entirely at one stage.Flooding in Datchet, a village next to the Thames near Windsor in Berkshire, forced National Rail to cancel trains on Monday morning.A statement said: "The river Thames has flooded at Datchet and other locations between Staines and Windsor & Eton Riverside."Because of this, trains are unable to run and a replacement bus service is not available."Flooding has also disrupted services between Oxford and Radley and services are unable to run between Bridgwater and Taunton.Services from London to the south-west remain disrupted after days of severe weather and the rough seas that caused damage to parts of the track and a sea wall at Dawlish.
