Suzanne Moore (G2, June 2) reports that the provost of Eton, Lord Waldegrave, has cried foul at Matt Hancock’s suggestion “that employers check the socio-economic backgrounds of applicants to stop the 93% of us who didn’t go to private schools being discriminated against”. Is this the same Lord Waldegrave who had the following thoughts from a ministerial car: “How can these people on the pavement live? … Their lives must be shadowy, dull, have nothing compared to this insider life of ministries, secrets, parliaments, flags, interpreters, crises, fear, fame (of a sort); being somebody.”Michael BarberLondon• The vote by the Bundestag to recognise the Armenian genocide is important (Berlin’s Armenian-genocide vote prompts recall of Turkish envoy, 3 June). It means pressure will build on states that have not recognised the genocide up to now, such as the US, Britain and Israel, to follow suit. Once Turkey is isolated on this issue it will have to end its denial of the genocide.Dr Michael HerronLondon• Thank you for the front-page picture of the new £5 note, showing Winston Churchill (3 June). Now I know where the idea for David Cameron’s cultivated, concerned frown came from, as in several recent photos.Derek ChownStowmarket, Suffolk• In Garstang we have still have our medieval weinds, such as Thomas’ Weind and Stoops Hall Weind – narrow lanes populated with shops and houses (Letters, 3 June).Austen LynchGarstang, Lancashire• I was a teenage drummer (Return of the axe, G2, 2 June). However, I will concede that the electric guitar is something special. Surely the greatest invention of the 20th century. It has entertained, reshaped popular culture and brought so many people together. Peter Bradshaw will have to get friends round to form a band.Simon ReadingAltrincham, Cheshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
