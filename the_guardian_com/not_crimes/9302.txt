The New York Times journalist involved in a war of words with US electric car company Tesla Motors over how far its new $101,000 luxury car can go between charges range has hit back over claims he deliberately let the car run out of power.The journalist John M Broder drove the Model S car from Washington DC to New England for a review published last week, in which he recounted having to have the car taken away on a flatbed truck because the car's battery had run flat, despite a network of fast-charging points designed to make the trip viable. The review sparked a furious response from Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, who subsequently published data logs from the car which he said showed the car "never had a chance with John Broder".Elon Musk (@elonmusk)NYTimes article about Tesla range in cold is fake. Vehicle logs tell true story that he didn't actually charge to max & took a long detour.February 11, 2013But in a blogpost late on Thursday, Broder launched a defence of his review, in which he said he had not set out to "sabotage" it. He denied having deliberately run the battery down by driving "in circles for over half a mile in a tiny, 100-space parking lot" as Musk had claimed, but said he was driving around in the dark looking for a Tesla charging point which was "not prominently marked".However, Broder was unable to explain why he had claimed to have set the car's cruise control at 54mph when Tesla's data logs showed he went "65mph to 81mph for a majority of the trip.""I do recall setting the cruise control to about 54mph," Broder wrote in his post, "[but] I cannot account for the discrepancy."The story also took on a new twist on Thursday as journalists from CNN retraced Broder's route successfully, saying they had 96 miles of range left on the car's battery at the end. The car is rated as having a 265 mile range between charges, and the Tesla network of fast-charging points are spaced every 200 miles.Abigail Bassett (@AbigailBassett)We made it!!1am, but here! @teslamotors S made it with @peterdrives + @jerharlancnn 96 miles to spare! twitter.com/AbigailBassettâ€¦February 15, 2013Tesla and the NYT's row has echoes of a BBC Top Gear episode where Jeremy Clarkson drove another Tesla electric car, the Roadster, and showed it running out of power in a race. It led to the company sueing the BBC over the "faked" episode.
