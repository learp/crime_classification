The National Trust is offering the tenancy of a £1m farm for £1 a year to a farmer who will help protect its rare and fragile landscape. Last year the organisation bought land on Great Orme in north Wales, including the 145-acre Parc Farm, which has views of Anglesey and grazing rights to 720 acres of headland. The move aimed to protect the habitats of unique and rare plants and animals and save fragile grasslands from being turned into a golf course.As part of its 10-year vision to reverse declines in wildlife, the Trust is looking for a farmer willing to take on the “nature first” approach to grazing the coastal headland, which may go against the grain of modern farming. Brexit could spell end for farming and car industry, says transport secretary William Greenwood of National Trust Wales said: “Unless we implement a very specific grazing regime, we will not see these most fragile habitats recover. To ensure a healthy and beautiful landscape, we need the most agriculturally productive pasture land to be grazed less and the least agriculturally productive grassland to be grazed more.”The unconventional farming method of regularly moving the grazing sheep around will mean long hours shepherding on often difficult terrain and working around the Great Orme’s 600,000 annual visitors, the Trust said. The successful candidate will get a 10-year farm business tenancy for £1 a year, and conservation charity Plantlife has pledged to buy sheep for the tenant. The headland is a protected area for nature. Its limestone grasslands are home to Kashmiri goats, subspecies of silver-studded blue and grayling butterflies, and a plant, the wild cotoneaster, found nowhere else on earth.
