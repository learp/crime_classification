When Rihanna recently posted an image of herself listening to Anti, adorned in lavish Dolce & Gabbana leather rhinestone crown/headphone hybrid, intrepid fans attempted to gauge as much as possible from her expression. Did the icy gaze imply that her eighth album would be a provocative trap record in the same vein as BBHMM? Or was it a contemplative acoustic stare, the kind that someone listening to a song similar to the triple-denim dream FourFiveSeconds might give? Rihanna (@rihanna)listening to ANTI ðŸŽˆ pic.twitter.com/AgqlhU0GEzJanuary 25, 2016The rumour is that fans will have to wait until Friday for the full album, but today Rihanna has broken her relative silence with the premiere of Work, a track which features longtime collaborator, reported ex-lover and all-round internet obliterator, Drake.From the four tracks lifted from the record so far, Anti is set to be as diverse as it has been long awaited. The glossy, modernist Work skewers elements of dub and dancehall: her voice is at times Auto-Tuned, and a distant sample of what sounds a little like Grace Jonesâ€™s My Jamaican Guy haunts its empty spaces. From Drakeâ€™s perspective, Work, co-produced by Boi-1da and PARTYNEXTDOOR, is a straightforward song about facing the labours of work before play, but Rihannaâ€™s vocals sound a little more disappointed and dejected. A typically fated Rihanna love story, basically.Unfortunately for those who care not for paying money for music, the singerâ€™s new track is only available from the paid-for streaming service Tidal, and iTunes at present. Take a listen to a sample below. Eileen Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ (@MissWhoeverUR)#NowPlaying "Work" by Rihanna, Drake in @TIDALHiFi https://t.co/airdWztBgeJanuary 27, 2016
