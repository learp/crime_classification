Marissa Mayer has given birth to twin girls just one day after announcing a complex corporate “reverse-spin” maneuver designed to reverse the long, slow decline of the technology company.Mayer wrote in September that she would not be taking much time off after the birth of her children. “I plan to approach the pregnancy and delivery as I did with my son three years ago, taking limited time away and working throughout,” she said on her Tumblr (a company also owned by Yahoo). “I’ve shared the news and my plans with Yahoo’s Board of Directors and my executive team, and they are incredibly supportive and happy for me.”marissamayer (@marissamayer)Zack and I are excited to announce that our identical twin girls were born early this morning. Our whole family is doing great! @zackbogueDecember 10, 2015It’s the second public nativity in two weeks among tech tycoons: Mark Zuckerberg announced the birth of his daughter Max on 1 December, along with a public initiative in her name that immediately fell under scrutiny for its odd tax status.Mayer simply announced her kids’ arrival on her blog after fielding questions about the complex deal to sell Yahoo’s core businesses on a public call with investors on Wednesday morning. “Zack and I are excited to announce that our identical twin girls have arrived!” she wrote. “They were born early this morning. Our whole family is doing great! Thanks to everyone for all of the support and well wishes throughout my pregnancy.”Yahoo’s liberal policy on maternity leave has caused comment: shortly after Mayer’s first child was born, she extended leave for childbirth to 16 weeks and adoption, surrogacy and foster care to eight weeks. Mayer herself is constantly working, a move that has prompted some criticism despite the company’s stated policies.
