A man has died after being swept away by floodwater as heavy rain and thunderstorms continued to batter much of England, Scotland and Ireland.West Mercia police said the man was overcome by the water in a stream at Bitterley, near Ludlow in Shropshire, shortly after 10.30am on Thursday.The accident was reported by witnesses and the man's body was found after an extensive search involving police, fire crews and the Severn Area Rescue Association.Residents named him as maths teacher Mike Ellis, who lived in the village with his wife.The West Midlands, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Staffordshire all suffered heavy flooding during the day.Later the storm spread north, closing both main rail lines between England and Scotland, with the west coast mainline closed at Tebay in Cumbria and a landslip blocking the east coast line near to Berwick.At one point the Tyne road tunnel was closed in both directions, and police warned motorists stuck in traffic to stay with their cars until emergency services reached them. Residents in several locations across Tyneside had to be evacuated.The Environment Agency urged people to be on alert for more flash flooding across the Midlands, northern England and Scotland as the Met Office forecast outbreaks of torrential rain across central and northern parts of the country. There was a continued risk of surface flooding if drainage systems were overwhelmed by rainfall.The heavy rain could also cause rivers to rise rapidly, the EA warned, and it advised the public to stay away from swollen rivers and not to drive through floodwater. It also urged people to check its website and Twitter feed for the latest updates and flood warnings.There were seven flood warnings in place for the Midlands, two for the north-east, one for the north-west and one for Scotland.Flooding has also hit Ireland, where more than 50 homes and many businesses were flooded and several thousand left without power after 50mm of rain fell in a seven-hour period across Cork.There were fears in Northern Ireland that overnight flooding which swamped Belfast could happen again. Further downpours were forecast as thousands struggled to clean up damage caused by flooding across the city and parts of Co Antrim.Emergency services reported receiving more than 700 callouts linked to flooding in Belfast, while the region's water authority said it handled nearly 3,000 flood calls, and 1,000 homes were hit by power cuts.
