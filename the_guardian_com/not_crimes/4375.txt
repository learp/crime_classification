Thank you all for joining in and helping me keep it together, and a massive thanks to Alice for being an extra pair of eyes and ears on this crazy night. I know Eurovision isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but it’s one of my favourite nights of the year - being here in Kiev in your liveblog company has been an absolute joy.We’re on Twitter @heidistephens and @alice if you’d like to say hi, but right now we’re off to the Euroclub to dance until dawn (not very far away, it’s already nearly 2am). Thanks for joining in, and see you in Lisbon next year!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.41pm BST23:41 Salvador has brought his sister onto the sister onto the stage - she wrote the song, and now does it with him as a duet. This is all rather lovely and I’m welling up, but I may just be overtired.

I’m not sure the crowd gives two hoots, to be honest. It’s the first time a non-English song has won Eurovision for about ten years, so perhaps a turning point.

We got 12 points in total, which is really disappointing. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.25pm BST23:25 OK, time for the public votes. All I ask is that we stay on the left hand side of the leader board, so we can head to Lisbon in 2018 with our head held high.
