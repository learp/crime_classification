Iggy Pop will revisit the history of the Stooges in a new book entitled Total Chaos: The Story of the Stooges – As Told by Iggy Pop.Published by Third Man Books, Total Chaos is “the first time the story of this seminal band has been told entirely in Pop’s own words”, according to a press release.The Stooges – 10 of the best The book is not penned by the proto-punk pioneer himself: instead author Jeff Gold and contributor Johan Kugelberg spoke to the frontman at his Miami home to secure “candid, bare-all responses”. Johnny Marr, Joan Jett and Jack White – who owns Third Man Books – also contribute. The “almost unbelievable tale” includes Pop describing “the alternately tragic and triumphant story of a group who rose from youth, fell prey to drugs, alcohol, and music biz realities, collapsed and nearly 30 years later reformed, recording and touring to great acclaim”.“It was a rare privilege to sit with Iggy as he downloaded the story of the Stooges,” said Gold. “He’s an incredible storyteller with a fantastic memory and a great sense of humour, and he held nothing back. The Stooges were pioneers in sound, look and live presentation, and along the way invented a genre – punk rock – and influenced countless others that followed. There was no precedent in rock music for what they did.”Total Chaos will be published in winter 2016. In the meantime, Iggy Pop is preoccupied with the release of his 17th solo album, Post Pop Depression, which he is currently touring with Josh Homme.
