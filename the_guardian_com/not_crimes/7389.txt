The home affairs committee aims to provide parliament with advice in order to legislate on subjects such as drugs and prostitution. Keith Vaz, who clearly knows first-hand about these things, has done “the right thing” and resigned. I sincerely hope that the other members of the committee have never had sex at all, let alone paid for it, nor ever taken drugs.

Didsbury has always been a middle-class suburb, inhabited by the well-off and professionals, and we are quite capable of gentrifying our own areas without the help of our old friends from the south.Moira SykesDidsbury, Manchester• I was advised early in my career with a famous lubricant manufacturer, 50 years ago, that suede shoes, then very fashionable, would suggest sexual ambivalence and would be a bar to promotion (Letters, 6 September).

He saw the joke and we are still good friends.Richard PriceBrockenhurst, Hampshire• We may be of “a certain age” (Letters, 5 September), but we still have milk delivered by a milkman, on what I would still describe as a milk float (although sadly diesel, I believe, and no longer electric).Mike EllwoodAbingdon, Oxfordshire• Does Harry Kane suffer hay fever? If so, it may explain why he struggles to score early in the season (Sport, 6 September). Paul RalphWoodstock, Oxfordshire
