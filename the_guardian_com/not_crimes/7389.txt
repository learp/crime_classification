What was our planet like in its early days? We know there was liquid water around 500 million years after Earth formed, so it can’t have been that cold, and yet the sun was only around 70% as intense at this time – the faint young Sun paradox. Possibly Earth’s surface was less reflective back then, or perhaps the atmosphere contained greater proportions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.Back in 1851 Charles Lyell, an eminent geologist and friend of Charles Darwin, suggested that ancient raindrop imprints could tell us more about Earth’s early atmosphere. He reasoned that raindrop size was limited by the density of the atmosphere: the less dense the atmosphere the larger a raindrop can be, and the larger its impact crater when it hits the ground. Given that the few examples of raindrop craters from Earth’s early days look pretty similar to modern raindrop imprints, Lyell concluded that Earth’s early atmosphere must have been similar to today’s.More recently scientists have tried to take the idea further. Lucas Kavanagh and Colin Goldblatt, from the University of Victoria in Canada, pipetted raindrops down a tall stairwell and measured the resulting impact they made in a tray of sand. By comparing these calibrated raindrop imprints with modern day raindrop impacts (on local Canadian beaches) and ancient fossil raindrop craters they were able to conclude that Earth’s early atmosphere couldn’t have been more than ten times as dense as today’s. “This at least confirms that the atmosphere was more like Earth’s present atmosphere than Venus,” says Goldblatt, whose findings are published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters.
