21 Savage – Red OppsThis is a great song from an Atlanta rapper called 21 Savage. I’ve been listening to his Slaughter Tape a lot and all his songs go in. Definitely one of the best rappers out right now.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Arthur Russell – Soon to Be Innocent FunI don’t know much about Arthur Russell, but the line “As a scientist, I find you very interesting”, always gets me. [There are] some great melodies in this song and beautiful cello chords.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The Waterboys – Fisherman’s BluesA beautiful song that a very special friend showed me when he was living at my apartment. [It’s] definitely been the soundtrack to many cigarette and coffee breaks.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Future – Road 2 Riches “The cars and bitches, don’t let it effect you …” Future really speaks from the heart. His addictions and struggle are very real and I think you can hear the pain in all his songs.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Hawthorne Heights – Ohio Is for Lovers Rapper Bladee showed me this song and I instantly fell in love with it. Really beautiful music.
