Bear Grylls may know how to survive in the world’s harshest climates – but one of his most recent shows has become a casualty of the cut-throat media jungle.ITV has cancelled Bear Grylls: Mission Survive after two series, citing an ongoing “refreshment” of the channel’s entertainment portfolio.“We had two exciting series of Mission Survive but the commissioning team continues to refresh the channel’s entertainment portfolio and so we have taken the decision not to commission a further series,” said an ITV spokeswoman.The second series of the show, in which celebrities compete against each other on a gruelling expedition in southern Africa, included former footballer Stuart Pearce, actor Neil Morrissey and female footballer Alex Scott.Champions League and Europa League finals attract 3m YouTube viewers for BT ITV said it is in talks on new projects with Grylls as well as having recently commissioned a second series of Bear Grylls Survival School for CITV.“We would like to thank Bear and the production team for everything that they achieved with the series,” said an ITV spokeswoman. “We have a number of projects with Bear in the pipeline and we will be announcing more details in due course.”
