Zachary Cole Smith’s ramshackle shoegaze outfit DIIV are heading out on tour to accompany the release of their second album, the snappily titled Is The Is Are. The Brooklyn band’s previously announced London show at Heaven is already sold out, but they’re doing comprehensive rounds elsewhere (17-28 Mar, tour starts O2 Institute, Birmingham) …The peacock-friendly End Of The Road festival has revealed its lineup, with headliners Animal Collective, Bat For Lashes and Joanna Newsom – the latter’s sole UK festival date. Highlights further down the bill include ex-Fiery Furnace Eleanor Friedberger and brilliant New York psych-pop band Sunflower Bean (2 to 4 Sep, Larmer Tree Gardens, Wiltshire) …You’ve got until Wednesday to enter the draw for tickets to War Child’s Passport To Brits Week. Big acts will be playing relatively tiny venues in aid of the charity: Frank Turner will be at Camden’s Monarch pub, Florence + The Machine play St John At Hackney church, and Jamie xx will be at Dalston clothes shop LN-CC. (15-26 Feb, various London venues).
