The controversial restoration of an ancient Spanish castle, which was viewed as a monumental “cock-up” by some and hailed by others as a stunning and sympathetic labour of conservation, has been shortlisted for a global architecture prize.Matrera castle, a 1,000-year-old hilltop fortress in the Cádiz province of southern Spain, has found itself at the centre of bitter clash between traditionalists and modernists following a painstaking “consolidation and restoration” project that saw its dilapidated structure shored up and returned to the original dimensions that time, battles and rain had eroded.'What the hell have they done?' Spanish castle restoration mocked Some residents of the nearby town of Villamartín have been bitterly critical of the restoration, as has a Spanish heritage and conservation group. Hispania Nostra called the restoration “truly lamentable” and said it had shocked Spaniards and foreigners alike. Others have compared it to the doomed and now-notorious attempt by a devout woman to restore Elías García Martínez’s 19th-century fresco of Christ in the north-eastern Spanish city of Borja.Architecture experts, however, have pointed out that the restoration is in keeping with the recent trend for restoring ruins with blank additions. Carlos Quevedo, the local architect who oversaw the project, now appears to have had his approach vindicated after the project was selected as a finalist in the architecture and preservation category of the global Architizer A+ awards. “We’re happy to be nominated, but we’re being cautious until the jury makes its decision,” he told the Guardian. “To be chosen as finalists by a jury of 300 experts – including such esteemed architects as Rem Koolhaas, Steven Holl, Bjarke Ingels and Sou Fujimoto – is recognition of our five years of work and effort.”Quevedo added: “As I’ve said before, I believe opinions are always welcome and constructive criticism and debate are always enriching. But I do think that some basic, accurate information can help avoid some of the prejudices that spring from a simple image.”Last month, the architect said that the restoration process had been guided by three aims: “To structurally consolidate those elements that were at risk; to differentiate new additions from the original structure – thus avoiding the imitative reconstructions that are prohibited by law; and to recover the volume, texture and tonality that the tower would originally have had.”Voting in the awards, which are designed to “nurture the appreciation of meaningful architecture in the world and champion its potential for a positive impact on everyday life” closes on Friday and the prizes will be given on 12 April.
