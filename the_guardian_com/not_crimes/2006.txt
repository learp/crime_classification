These days fresh air is hard to find, even in parks. Nearly a quarter of London’s green open spaces now breach laws on nitrogen dioxide pollution (the stuff that spews out of diesel exhausts).When the air in the park is worse than at the side of the road, that’s a new low. If you’re a Londoner, type in your postcode at Asi Open Data to find the nearest park where NO2 emissions don’t exceed 40 micrograms per cubic metre.This is not just diverting; it’s potentially life-saving. We know pollution can be a factor in developing lung cancer. Now new research shows that it may also shorten the life span of lung cancer survivors. Researchers are joining the dots between pollution and dementia, too. We tend to give pollution polite names like “haze” and “smog”. We should call it “the killer”.Sadiq Khan, the new London mayor, who suffers from adult-onset asthma, is talking tough on this. He has promised new measures for the capital including a green bus route for Putney that will reduce NO2 emissions by 84%.But what about the rest of us? According to the WHO, 41 out of 52 UK towns and cities breach safe levels of so-called PM10 particles, which can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes if inhaled. Eleven breach standards on even scarier finer particles. Among the cleaner ones were Southend and Saltash.But does every region of the UK need a high-ranking official to take an interest before we can breathe in clean air? Some fear that Brexit will send pollution soaring, because so many environment laws come from Brussels.The legal NGO ClientEarth will take the government to court in order to get clean air laws enforced. We should get squarely behind their #no2dirtyair campaign.The big picture: the art of the banquet      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Art you can eat: Lucy + Jorge Orta’s Peterborough event last year. Photograph: Chris PorszArtists Lucy + Jorge Orta express their anxieties about food security on a giant scale. Fans of ‘social sculpture’, they put together ‘70 x 7 The Meal Act XXXIX’, part banquet, part artwork, last year in Peterborough. Now comes a new exhibition, also in Peterborough from 10 September, and a book, Food and the Public Sphere, which delves further into food recycling, gastronomy and mobile soup kitchens (studio-orta.com).Well dressed: fashion’s new model      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Marketing multifunctionality: what you may be wearing next winter.

How long do you intend to keep shopping this way, and when will you know when you have a full wardrobe? Nu Blvck co-founders Becca Flory and Andrew Vincent envisage a time when you’ll pre-order your clothes months ahead (that’s why the accompanying picture is so wintry) from a limited collection and have more of a connection with the maker and designer. The idea is that you pre-order the designs that you believe in, and if there is enough interest, then the item goes into production. The first collection, made by artisans in the UK and bringing together emerging designers, is about multifunctionality. So, the backpack has an elastic cross-over section at the front that holds a clutch bag, too. Another design breakthrough is the cardigan that doubles as a scarf.Email Lucy at lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @lucysiegle
