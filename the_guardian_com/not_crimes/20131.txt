FilmFantastic Beasts And Where To Find ThemAs the success of Jack Thorne’s recent pair of Potter plays proved, clamour for Hogwarty high jinks remains as bright as a stag patronus five years after the boy wizard hung up his cinematic invisibility cape. And Hollywood nary leaves a cashcow unmilked. So Fantastic Beasts takes place in the same wands-and-Weasleys Potterverse, only in 1920s New York, as Eddie Redmayne’s Newt Scamander searches for escaped magical fauna. It’s an enjoyable romp, recently awarded the full five stars by the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw. In cinemas nowTheatre Putting Words In Your Mouth      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Scottee. Photograph: Holly RevellThis show from cabaret performer Scottee offers up that rare thing: a novel take on Thatcherism. Described as a lip-sync marathon, it sees performers mouth along to audio interviews with LGBT people across the country about their reactions to Brexit, austerity and Britain’s recent past. Roundhouse, NW1 from Tuesday to 3 DecemberThe RoyaleHaving hopped over the Atlantic for a spell in New York, Marco Ramirez’s play about a black boxer (Nicholas Pinnock) in a segregated United States has returned to London’s Bush Theatre for another round. It remains both a bruising and balletic encounter.

Following a wannabe mogul and his rapper cousin, it mixes moments of unabashed weirdness and blazing insight into US racial politics to create something utterly distinct. Airs on Fox, Sat 19 NovTalksZadie SmithThere’s no such thing as too much Zadie Smith, and you can enjoy a triple dose of the author this week. Her new novel Swing Time, a lyrical effort moving from north London to west Africa, is out now, and she discusses and reads from the book in London and Manchester this week. Meanwhile, the Beeb’s adaptation of Smith’s NW is still available to stream on iPlayer.

Photograph: Sarah Lee for the GuardianA world away from the “men’s rights” nonsense you find on Twitter, this three-day festival at London’s Southbank Centre provides a more thoughtful take on modern masculinity. Its focus this year is on the notion of heroism. It is a topic that allows for a wide range of debates, talks and live performances, touching on everything from addiction to transgender rights and depression among men. Roger Moore, the Guardian’s Gary Younge and former So Solid Crew man and Top Boy star Ashley Walters (pictured) are among the contributors. Southbank Centre, SE1, Fri 25 to Sun 27 NovMusicChance The RapperA true DIY sensation, the Chicago rapper has found fame and acclaim without a hint of major-label involvement. His recent album Coloring Book is superb: a euphoric slice of gospel-tinged hip-hop that features everyone from Justin Bieber to Young Thug. Now he’s heading to the UK and Ireland for dates in London, Manchester and Dublin.

After bringing everything from Dorian Grey to Lord Of The Flies to the stage, he now turns his hand to Powell and Pressburger’s famed musical, a stage adaptation of which flopped horrendously on Broadway in the early 90s. We’re expecting Bourne to enjoy more success with his effort. Theatre Royal, Plymouth from Mon 21 to Sat 26 Nov
