Timing is important. Just before I go out, I play I Wanna Be Your Dog by the Stooges, which gets you in the mood for anything. But I have to make sure I am not so into the music, and haven’t kicked into the ale too early, that I go out in my pants.I’ve stopped wearing suits on stage; the bloke who made them, Colin in Sheffield, has retired, so they are precious. I learned about clothes from my grandfather. He was a steel worker but went to a tailor. He’d buy well and wear it until it fell off his back. I don’t do designer or labels, so on stage I wear bog-standard double denim. I buy my boots from a friend who is a master cobbler and runs Peter’s Shoes in Sheffield. I love it that my clothes and boots are made by people I know in the city I live in.I am not someone who goes out looking like a Christmas tree. I’ve a pocket watch that is a family heirloom – it was made in 1815, the year of the battle of Waterloo – a wedding ring and an earring that reminds me of my first band, Treebound Story. The original members were all born within 18 days of each other and we had our ears pierced for our 14th birthdays. The silver ring on my right hand is one of four in the world. I had them made for Jarvis Cocker’s 50th. He’s got one, as has Steve Mackey, Pulp’s bass player, and Jeannette Lee at Rough Trade. It’s a picture of the middle of an old-fashioned 45 single, because we are all into tunes.Frankie Dettori: ‘I use perfume four times a day’ I have a mirror so I can check the back of my quiff for insects and bits of leaves. I use Black & White – if it’s good enough for Elvis and Eddie Cochran, it’s good enough for me.• Richard Hawley is playing at the Royal Festival Hall in London on 16 June as part of Guy Garvey’s Meltdown.
