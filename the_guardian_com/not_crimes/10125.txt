Judd Apatow has said that he believes the people who disapprove of the female-fronted Ghostbusters reboot are also supporters of Donald Trump.Dan Aykroyd: new Ghostbusters is funnier and scarier than original films In an interview with Uproxx, the Trainwreck director offered his thoughts on the forthcoming Ghostbusters film, whose trailer has become the most disliked in YouTube history.“I would assume there’s a very large crossover of people who are doubtful Ghostbusters will be great and people excited about the Donald Trump candidacy,” he said. “I would assume they are the exact same people. That movie is made by the great Paul Feig and stars the funniest people on Earth, so I couldn’t be more excited.”Apatow, who worked with Feig on the TV show Freaks and Geeks and the hit comedy Bridesmaids, also believes that there has been too much coverage of the backlash to the Ghostbusters reboot.The Ghostbusters trashing is just another internet tantrum against change | Laurie Penny “I think people have paid too much attention to just some angry trolls,” he said. “And it will be judged on its own greatness. The movie will come out, and it will be great, and people will just be happy to have it. It’s not like anybody really cares about a couple of idiots who hold onto the idea that things never evolve.”Feig’s new take on Ghostbusters stars Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. The director has already labelled the film’s criticism as “vile, misogynistic shit”. Dan Aykroyd, who starred in the original films, recently said that it “has more laughs and more scares” than the first two.
