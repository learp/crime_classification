Oasis might be no closer to reforming, but fans can take solace: Liam Gallagher is preparing to release his debut solo album. The record, which is due in 2017 through Warner Bros Records, is said to feature 10 or 11 new songs written by him.Speaking in this month’s edition of Q, Gallagher said his new songs contained both flair and attitude. “The melodies are sick and the words are fucking funny,” he said. “[It] sounds well tasty. You won’t be scratching your chin. It’s not Pink Floyd and it ain’t Radiohead. It’s chin-out music.”Noel Gallagher: I think Liam should make a solo record Ever the contrarian, the Britpop icon refused to accept he was now a solo artist. “I am not embarking on a solo ‘career’” he said during the same interview. The album will be the first thing Liam has released since the demise of Beady Eye in 2014. That band had two top five albums but failed to replicate the generation-defining soundtrack of Oasis, who have notched up sales of 77m studio albums since they released their debut, Definitely Maybe, in 1994.For Oasis fans unmoved by news of Liam’s solo career – sorry, record – there is alternative good news. The Oasis documentary Supersonic, produced by the team behind the Oscar-winning film Amy, is due for release in October.
