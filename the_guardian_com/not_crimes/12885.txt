I have a theory: it‚Äôs harder to move into a house with people you know than with people you don‚Äôt know. Why? Expectations. The same can be said for a book club: better to be in a book club with people you don‚Äôt know than those you do.There is no expectation to talk about life stuff ‚Äì the house, the job, whatever. You form relationships as you come to know one another, and a lovely bond develops. There is no expectation about what you will think of the text. As different people pick it apart, you can discover a diversity of perspectives that would not likely come from your tribe.But how do you go about joining a book club where you don‚Äôt know anyone? Simple: ask Siri! Emma Watson leaves free copies of Maya Angelou book on tube There‚Äôs a whole range of digital book clubs, hosted across Goodreads, Google Groups, Facebook, Tumblr, apps and more. Digital book clubs also avoid expectations of time management ‚Äì the text can be adequately deconstructed on the bus, in bed, or at the cafe. All you need to do is log in, purchase your book and start commenting. Our Shared ShelfLast week, Emma Watson scattered copies of her book club‚Äôs latest read across the London Underground. The Harry Potter starlet slash UN Women goodwill ambassador left notes in each to be found by 100 wide-eyed Wi-Fi-less tube-riders. ‚ÄúWhen you are finished please leave it on the tube again for someone else to find,‚Äù they read. She‚Äôs annoyingly perfect, isn‚Äôt she?Emma Watson (@EmmaWatson).@BooksSubway @BooksUndergrnd @DrMayaAngelou #Mom&Me&Mom #OurSharedShelf pic.twitter.com/sSXZBVFjLzNovember 9, 2016The initiative was part of Books on the Underground‚Äôs project to bring new and used books to commuters, and served as a handy lure for likely readers to join her online book club, Our Shared Shelf, which can be found filed among other online clubs on Goodreads.

Headed by Tumblr‚Äôs director of literary outreach, Rachel Fershleiser, the picks are suitable for those 13 years and older, chosen mostly to represent the Tumblr community, which Fershleiser admits ‚Äúskews a little nerdy, a little progressive and a little fandomy‚Äù.Sample reading list: Fangirl by Rainbow Rowell; The Impossible Knife of Memory by Laurie Halse Anderson; California by Edan Lepucki; Brown Girl Dreaming by Jacqueline Woodson; Salt to the Sea by Ruta Sepetys.Between Two BooksFour years ago, fans of Florence + the Machine frontwoman Florence Welch began a book club in her honour. When the singer learned of it via Twitter, she leapt in with encouragement and suggested their first book (Opposed Positions by Gwendoline Riley). She has since supported the Facebook-based club with plugs at gigs and by taking readers questions when, for example, she interviewed Donna Tartt. Welch has also facilitated guest recommendations by poet Nayyirah Waheed and model activist Adwoa Aboah.Florence and the lit scene: how a fan's dream became a star's book club Sample reading list: The Ice Age by Kirsten Reed; Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston; A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole; Birthday Letters by Ted Hughes; Just Kids by Patti Smith.Women‚Äôs Lives book clubNew York-based writer and editor Rachel Syme was fascinated by the lives of women. (She used to spend nights on end trawling Wikipedia pages reading of ancient matriarchs.) In a bid to get others to pay attention to those lives, she started her Women‚Äôs Lives book club, dedicated to reading more books (mostly nonfiction) about women and by women. On the day it launched, 175 people signed up via Google groups. Since then, it has gained a tick of approval from Amy Poehler‚Äôs Smart Girls organisation, and a whole lot of momentum under the hashtag #wlclub.Sample reading list: The Silent Woman: Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes by Janet Malcolm; Wrapped in Rainbows by Zora Neale Hurston; Writing a Woman‚Äôs Life by Carolyn Heilbrun; The Witches: Salem, 1962 by Stacy Schiff; The Dead Ladies Project by Jessa Crispin.Zoella book clubBritish vlogger Zoella confesses that reading is one of the only things she does that doesn‚Äôt require Wi-Fi.

It might be a strange choice for the 18‚Äì35 demographic, but back in 2013, the site‚Äôs founder Bryan Goldberg said he was all about content being accessible. And with Bustle‚Äôs shared editorship, the digital book club makes sense: ideas for everyone that are easy to read.Sample reading list: Are You There God? It‚Äôs Me, Margaret by Judy Blume; The Witches by Roald Dahl; Hidden Bodies by Caroline Kepnes.Andrew Luck‚Äôs book clubFemale celebrities aren‚Äôt the only ones at the game of book-club-influencing. Enter American football quarterback Andrew Luck, also known as the Indiana Colt‚Äôs unofficial librarian. When he announced the club‚Äôs launch in April 2016, he admitted the nickname was ‚Äúkind of cheesy ... but the truth is that I love to read both fiction and nonfiction and I feel strongly about the power of reading‚Äù. He‚Äôs got selections for ‚Äúrookie‚Äù and ‚Äúveteran‚Äù level readers ‚Äì made up mostly of books he‚Äôs read and loved over the years.Sample reading list: The Boys in the Boat by Daniel James Brown; Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinelli; Hatchet by Gary Paulsen; The Art of Racing in the Rain by Garth Stein; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by CS Lewis.AL Book Club (@ALBookClub)A little #throwbackthursday photo from my travels this summer.
