Facebook knows everything about you. At least that’s what we, and the advertisers it sells us to, are constantly told. But a peek behind its algorithmic curtains suggests what it does know might be wrong.As any of its 1.65 billion users can tell you, Facebook is constantly “updating” its privacy settings, which is why I tool through all my settings every few weeks. I try to keep a lock on what strangers can learn about me on Facebook or have access to; not because I’m disinclined to participate in the platform, but because my family is uncomfortable with strangers having access to their personal lives, and that seems fair.But although I choose to share some information with people I don’t know – I’m a journalist and don’t accept friend requests from strangers, you’ll see if you look me up – and even allow people to follow my public posts, there’s a whole class of information that Facebook thinks it knows about me, and it allows anyone willing to pay $5 to run a Facebook ad to essentially utilize that information.Buried deep in anyone’s privacy settings – click the little lock icon, then “See More Settings”, then the word “Ads” in the left-hand column, then “Edit” in the “Ads based on my preferences” row, and then “Visit Ad Preferences” – is a list of key words that Facebook has assigned to your profile from which advertisers can choose when targeting their ads.For those unfamiliar with Facebook ad buys: when you buy an advertisement or promote posts, the company allows you to target who will see it based on all kinds of data, including what kind of phone they’re using and a list of keyword preferences. Advertisers get a least a little peace of mind that they aren’t sending make-up ads to my Uncle Pete, and Facebook can sell more ads by claiming that people who don’t care, won’t see.But algorithms are flawed ways to categorize people: we’re often messy and unpredictable, and we all use Facebook for different reasons. So what Facebook thinks it knows – and sells to advertisers – about me isn’t entirely accurate.For instance: listed under “lifestyle and culture”, Facebook has been serving me ads based on my supposed “ethnic affinity”, which it lists as African American. It also thinks I’m interested in both communism and the Belgian social-democratic Flemish political party (I’ve never been to Belgium, unless you count being in the airport for a connecting flight in 1995). It considers me one of its “technology late adopters” and that I’m both part of a “family-based household” and “away from my family”.It lists Princess Superstar as one of the people I care about because in 2007 my friend Josh and I used to laugh about her video Bad Babysitter – we met while I was dog-sitting for his housemates – even though I don’t like her on Facebook and am pretty sure we never discussed it on the platform; it believes I am into the artist Flea because I liked a page for my local flea market. It seems to think I am a very, very big fan of professional wrestling – I blame my article on the Gawker case, which I shared on Facebook like a dutiful Guardian employee – and like the Tasmanian football championship, though I don’t care about soccer and have never been to Tasmania. It also thinks I’ve traveled to Bruges, Easter Island, some place called Roystonea and the Matterhorn (the last of which was actually a restaurant at which I once ate, albeit not one in Switzerland or Italy).It also, correctly, notes that I shop for shoes online (but not by clicking Facebook ads), like drinking, have an interest in mammals (though, to be fair, I also really dig reptiles); it knows what phone I use, which one I used to use, and that I spend most of my time on Facebook using Chrome. It also somehow knows that, when I’m at the office, I often listen to Vivaldi concertos on YouTube, that I was (until now) a secret fan of even terrible police procedurals and that I have an interest in – as they term it, but I never have – suffrage, though I’ve neither liked nor posted about any of those things.While advertisers couldn’t go into my profile and find that information – at least, they can’t right now – they can access my eyeballs based on it. And Facebook is monetizing both the information I explicitly gave them, that which they gleaned from my use of their platform and, quite clearly, that which they’d have no reason to know unless they were tracking me off-platform or buying information about my preferences on the open market.I could, of course, delete all of it and force them to start over – and I might, but I’d have to delete each item one-by-one. But, then they would just start over – and who knows what they’d mine next, maybe they’d be right.
