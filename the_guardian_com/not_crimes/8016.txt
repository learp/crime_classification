Justin Vernon has revealed that new Bon Iver material is in the pipeline, with the singer-songwriter set to perform a set of entirely new music. It will be the first new material that Vernon will have aired since 2011’s second album Bon Iver, Bon Iver. The new material will be debuted at Eaux Claires festival in Wisconsin in August. Speaking on Twitter, Vernon said: “For anyone who wants to know … Bon Iver will be playing a set made of NEW music this august @EauxClairesWI” He added: “to everyone asking: its a SET of ALL new music xxxxoo.” Speaking to Billboard earlier this year, Vernon was less sure if his new music would be ready in time for the festival, which Vernon runs himself: “We’re not just gonna play the same set we did last year. I’ve been working on music, you know, man. It takes a long time, and I’m not sure exactly what it is or what it means to me, and until that happens I won’t really know exactly what sharing it will look like or feel like or when.”He added: “There’s sort of this internal pressure, not from anybody but myself, to come out with new music for the festival. But I’m not gonna make myself do anything. I really have to take it step by step and have patience and know that the music – if it comes out, it’s gotta be really true, it’s gotta really live with the other records and extend from them and be reborn and all that.”In other news, Haim have announced details of the follow-up to their 2013 debut album Days Are Gone. Due in August, the album reportedly follows in their debut’s footsteps by being written in their parents’ LA living room. Speaking to Rolling Stone, the band said: “We’ve gone through a lot these last couple years ... [the songs are about] trying to go back to your normal life, but realising there is a difference.”
