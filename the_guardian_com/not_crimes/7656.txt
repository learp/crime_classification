Aim for a cheeky elegance with spring’s new pink nail – a glossy candyfloss, or popped bubblegum. At Emilio de la Morena they painted half the nail with glossy Orly varnish, and the other with matte topcoat for a two-toned texture. At Erdem it was gentler: a flush sea-shell pink. Go for nails that make you think of pudding and the sweet things of your past, so when you look down at your typing hands they’ll remind you that warm weather is coming, and with it all the picnics and beaches that promises.Get the lookOrly Happy & Healthy £12 orlybeauty.co.ukD&G Passione & Tropical Coral £21 harrods.comCiaté Beach Melba £10 ciatelondon.comRMK #21 £14.50 lookfantastic.comButter London Coming Up Roses £15 feelunique.comRimmel Fit for a Princess £2.99 superdrug.comNailberry a Touch of Powder £14.50 nailberry.co.ukMargaret Dabbs Peony £14 margaretdabbs.co.ukYSL Rose Abstrait £19.50 yslbeauty.co.ukAutograph Flash Gel Nails in Ballet £7.50 marksandspencer.comChanel Sea Whip £20 chanel.comEmail Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman
