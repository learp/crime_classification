Mortimer Keene: Ghosts on the Loose by Tim Healey and Chris MouldReview by JacobThis book is about a boy called Mortimer Keene. He accidently lets ghosts come into his school and one of the ghosts is a Victorian hanger! The Victorian hanger then finds Keene. I really enjoyed this book because it has a lot of pictures and it took me around half an hour to read its 70 pages and I’m eight. Anyone 4-9 would really enjoy it. I liked it because it was more of a picture book. I give it 5/5.Louie Let’s Loose by Rachel HamiltonReview by EloiseThis book is about a unicorn that likes cakes and who wants to be a star. He goes to the pantomime and finds another unicorn. I really liked it as it was very funny. I really liked the fact that he was a unicorn who liked cake! Anyone who likes unicorns would really like this book and maybe girls more than boys. I give it 5/5.Dixie O’Day and the Great Diamond Robbery by Shirley Hughers and Clara VuillamyReview by RachelThis book is about two dogs called Dixie and his friend Percy. They went to Brightsea hotel and there was a robbery. The robbers stole Miss Peaches Meow’s diamond necklace. Luckily Dixie met a man who lived right above the robbers and was so able to help Dixie and Percy to become heroes. I really, really liked this book as I like animals and it is really funny when they act like humans. Anyone else who really likes animals and robberies would really enjoy this book. I give it 5/5.Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
