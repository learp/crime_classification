Boris Johnson's campaign for a new airport in the Thames estuary "flies in the face of public opinion", a Tory council leader who commissioned a poll that revealed widespread opposition to the plan has said.The Conservative London mayor wants to see a £70bn airport built on an artificial island off the north Kent coast – the so-called "Boris Island" – to increase flight capacity.But his proposal has put him on a collision course with two Tory councils that would be directly affected by the plans, Medway and Kent, and in conflict with the government's aviation policy.Environmentalists also point out that the site of the proposed airport is a protected habitat for birds and wildlife.Medway commissioned a UK-wide poll involving 1,000 respondents, of whom 76% said London did not need another airport, in August.Eighty-one percent said the cited figure of £70bn was too much to spend on a new airport, particularly given the financial difficulties the country faces. Even more (87%) believed the government's plan to make airports "better not bigger" should be pursued instead of creating a new airport.Rodney Chambers, the Medway Tory leader, said the proposed airport would prove to be "undeliverable, unaffordable and unnecessary"."It is a proposal that has already been dismissed by the airline industry and by the government, and this poll makes it clear that no one at all sees it as a serious option," he said."A Thames estuary airport would blight huge parts of Kent and Medway, as it would need a huge amount of infrastructure to support it and it would devastate one of Europe's most important areas for migrating wildfowl."An overwhelming majority of people agree it is unaffordable to spend up to £70bn on a new airport and that the government's plans to improve regional airports is the right policy."He said Johnson needed to "listen to public opinion, admit it is a pie in the sky idea and drop it for good".But despite critics arguing that he should focus on policy issues within his remit for the capital rather than venturing into national policy, Johnson – who chairs Transport for London – is sticking to his vision.The mayor, who is seeking re-election in May, has approved up to £200,000 of spending to allow TfL to respond to the government's consultation on aviation.A spokesperson said: "There is absolutely no question that a serious aviation bottleneck is emerging in London and the south-east that has the potential to strangle our national economy."Several sites have been widely publicised as possible locations for a new hub airport, but the mayor's priority at this stage is to ensure the government gives clear acknowledgement to the need for greater aviation capacity in the south-east."London is the motor of the UK economy, and if it is to retain its position as the heartbeat of global business then a new hub airport is an absolute necessity."
