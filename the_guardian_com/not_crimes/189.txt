Technology has just made it easier for the Kardashians to buy stuff. MasterCard has confirmed it will soon roll out a new payment-verification system based on selfies, whereby gurning into your phone’s camera will replace entering your password.It works like this: you download an app; then, whenever you try to purchase anything, a push notification prompts you to look into your camera and blink (the blinking prevents someone emptying your account by holding up your photo). That’s it – you’re done.In a world where more than a third of customers have admitted to pulling out of an online transaction because they couldn’t remember their password, this sort of facial recognition software is likely only to help grease the gears between consumer and retailer. In fact, MasterCard says 92% of all test subjects preferred the new way to the old.If you’ve ever run head first into a tangle of interchangeable cases and lengths and special characters while trying to remember an online password, you can understand how something as simple as taking a selfie might appeal. You may wilt at the sight of the breathtakingly cryptic password reminder you wrote five years ago – “Animals?” – but you’ll almost certainly remember how to point a phone at your face.Also, it’s trickier for fraudsters to surgically transform themselves into you than to guess your password for everything is “password”, because everyone’s password to everything is “password”.Then again, if you’ve tried recently to leave an airport in reasonable time, you will know what a gigantic pain in the neck this new technology could prove to be. MasterCard employs roughly the same system that’s used in biometric immigration gates, where you have to stand in a specific spot and pull a specific facial expression while you wait for a scanner to judder slowly to a specific height four times in a row, before a man wanders over to tell you that the machine is rejecting you because it thinks your rucksack is a baby.There will be other problems with the selfie-verification system. Never again will you be able to save your relationship by buying an anniversary gift at the last minute while your spouse sleeps next to you: the camera won’t be able to see your face in the dark. And, obviously, wearers of niqabs and burqas are probably best advised to stick to passwords for now.In any case, this – along with HSBC’s recently announced voice-recognition trials and fingerprint technology – looks like another nail in the coffin of the tortuous password process. From now on, your face really is your fortune. Or the thing that reminds you that you’ve only got £1.84 in your overdraft to last you until the end of the month.
