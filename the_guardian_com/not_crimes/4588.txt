It felt absurd to be cooking a roast, complete with sides and trimmings, just to have the leftover ingredients I needed for a bunch of other dishes, but I did it anyway. Everything made it into your recipes – except my roast potatoes. They were insanely good, so they got eaten. Which, by all accounts, is exactly what happens at dinner tables the world over. Roasties are the first things to go, and the only things people really want to eat. But what to do with all the things they don’t eat? Well, do you want a dish that requires no shopping and next to no effort to make? Of course, you will need to plan ahead for such indolence. Before Christmas hits you in the stomach with the biggest meal of the year, make sure you have the few things needed for these recipes – pizza bases, a jar of spice paste, a roll of filo sheets – so that your post-Christmas cooking is a doddle.The winning recipe: Brussels sprouts, cranberry and stilton pizzaLight and easy, this is the kind of thing you can rustle up in no time and serve to anyone who rocks up on Boxing Day – so long as you’ve had the foresight to prep the dough or stock your freezer with some readymade pizza bases. Plus it uses the honey-roasted cranberries Anna Thomson made for her last winning swap recipe – and they are just as winning this time round.Serves 4-8 For the dough500g strong white bread flour 1 tsp salt7g active dried yeast2 tbsp olive oil320ml warm water For the toppings4 tbsp olive oil2 garlic cloves, minced2-4 tbsp creme fraiche, mascarpone or similar – whatever you have left over100g brussels sprouts, shredded50-100g leftover roasted squash, carrots, parsnips or other root veg100g stilton, or blue cheese of your choice1-2 tbs cranberry sauce or roasted cranberries50g pecans or walnuts1 Put the flour and salt in a bowl and make a deep well.2 Put the yeast, oil and water in a jug and mix well, then pour on to the flour. Mix to form a dough. Cover and leave in a warm place for at least one hour or until doubled in size.3 Punch down the dough, then roll into 3-4 thin pizza bases.4 Mix the olive oil with the garlic and season with salt and pepper, then brush on to the pizza base and swirl a little creme fraiche over. Sprinkle with the shredded sprouts, dot with roasted veg, cheese, cranberries and nuts. Leave the dough to prove for another 15 minutes.5 Bake in a preheated oven at 220C/425F/gas mark 7 for 10-15 minutes until the dough is crisp.Malay-style curryRachel Kelly always has a jar of homemade spice paste in her fridge, which is exactly the kind of thing you need for dealing with leftovers, festive or otherwise.Readers’ recipe swap: nibbles for drinks Serves 3-4For the spice paste2 red chillies5 garlic cloves4 shallots, or 1 red onion2cm fresh ginger, peeled2cm fresh galangal (optional) For the curryVegetable oil100g brown mushrooms, quartered2 medium tomatoes, chopped1½ tsp ground coriander½ tsp ground black pepper½ tsp ground cumin½ tsp ground turmeric¼ tsp ground cinnamon¼ tsp ground cloves¼ tsp ground fennel seeds¼ tsp ground nutmeg1 x 400ml tin of coconut milkSaltLeftover roast meat1 First make the spice paste by blending all the ingredients together. If you are using a blender, add a splash of water to help the blades turn.2 Heat about 2 tbsp oil in a heavy-based pan. Add the paste and fry for 30 seconds, before adding the mushrooms and tomatoes.3 Stir well and gently fry for 5 minutes before adding the ground spices. Continue to fry for 2 minutes before adding the coconut milk. Bring the liquid to a gentle simmer for 10 minutes or until the vegetables are softening. Don’t boil, as the coconut milk has a tendency to separate.4 Add the meat and cook for a few minutes until warmed through. Check the seasoning and serve with plain steamed rice or bubble and squeak cakes made from leftover roast potatoes and cabbage.Mincemeat pebble tartJustine Wall uses leftover marzipan and mincemeat for this, and it is terribly good – marzipan in a dough is a keeper of a recipe. My one hesitation here is that mincemeat and marzipan are such long-lasting foodstuffs that they aren’t really leftovers – they’re forward planning. Next Christmas will be here sooner than you think …Serves 8230g self-raising flour50g ground almonds180g chilled butter, chopped50g caster sugar20g soft brown sugar½ tsp baking powder150g marzipan, chopped200g readymade mincemeat1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Mix all of the ingredients except the mincemeat in a food processor until a dough forms. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and refrigerate for about 2-3 hours.2 Remove from the fridge and divide the dough into two pieces. Line a baking tray (I use one about 20cm square) with baking parchment, making sure it comes up the sides so you can lift the bake out when it’s done. Press half the dough into the bottom of the tin until you have an even layer.3 Spread the mincemeat over the dough. Then – and this is the fun part – pop the other half of the dough into a potato ricer, and rice the dough over the mincemeat layer. Make sure the mincemeat layer is well covered. If you don’t have a potato ricer, use a grater and grate the dough over the mincemeat layer.3 Bake at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 25-35 minutes, until golden brown on top. Cut into squares and serve with cream or custard.Cranberries: who knew they were so versatile? | Readers’ recipe swap Leftovers pieSally Baines has to make extra of everything to make sure there’s enough for this pie on Boxing Day. And my fellow tasters and I certainly got through a lot of it. But, we concurred, that’s probably because we haven’t actually had our Christmas dinner yet. This is incredible – because it’s everything you love about that dinner, in every mouthful – but it’s also incredibly rich.Serves as many as you have leftovers forLeftover meat, nut roast, vegetablesGravyFilo pastryOlive oil1 Cut up all the leftovers into bite-size pieces – all the meat and veggie nut roast, then any vegetables.
