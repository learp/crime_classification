Barry Glendenning writes: “The Boat Race … is often derided as a symbol of class elitism [but] this sporting spectacle retains a curious appeal among millions with no particular interest in rowing or either university involved” (Sport, 3 April). Roger Bannister’s historic four-minute mile also involved a bunch of posh Oxbridge amateurs but also attracted thousands of spectators. Perhaps, in a world where most top-level sport is highly commercialised (and dominated by another sort of elite), the fact that the boat race is one of the few first-class sporting events that is still truly amateur has something to do with its appeal. Perhaps we need more of this sort of thing, not less.Robert AndersonLondon• Like Patrick Barkham (How native are your daffs?, 28 March) I am not too keen on the excessive displays of large daffodils on urban verges. They may well be better than scalping the verges of wild flowers – but still look out of place. I’d love to see our native primrose (Primula vulgaris) planted instead. Or cowslips (Primula veris) , which are much rarer in the wild. The primroses in our garden produce a range of colours, from pinks through to white, they spread readily and look after themselves as long as they don’t get too much sun. Can I suggest Guardian readers do some guerilla gardening and plant primroses?Jill BennettSt Albans• When doctors become consultants, they are no longer called “Dr” but “Mr”, to indicate their higher status (Report, 31 March). One of our surgeons was a woman who insisted on being called “Mr” in the hospital, but “Dr” at the filling station.Dr Allan DoddsBramcote, Nottingham• I shuddered at the sight of your 1 April spoof article (By Georgio! Former chancellor reveals new job as fashion designer, 1 April). For heaven’s sake don’t put any more ideas into his head.Phil GarnerLittleover, Derby• Adrian Sinfield asks after the whereabouts of San Serriffe (Letters, 3 April). The referendum meant that the country is split between infinitives, but is currently hoping for a “deep and special” relationship with the UK after Brexit.Derrick CameronStoke-on-Trent • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
