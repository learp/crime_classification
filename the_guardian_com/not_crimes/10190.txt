The rescue of passengers aboard the research ship Akademik Shokalskiy, icebound in Antarctica, took another dramatic twist on Friday, after a Chinese icebreaker involved in the rescue itself became trapped in thick sea ice.The ship, Xue Long – or Snow Dragon – signalled that it might need to be rescued from ice floes off the coast of Antarctica, where 24 hours earlier its crew had helped free passengers from the Shokalskiy.The Chinese icebreaker, which has more than 100 people on board, will attempt to break through the dense pack ice towards open water on Saturday morning. If that fails, the 15,000-tonne ship might need rescuing by a more powerful vessel.The development raises the prospect that the Aurora Australis, which has on board 52 scientists, journalists and tourists, who, on Thursday, were successfully evacuated from the Akademic Shokalski, could return to the scene to rescue the Xue Long."It's dreadful to hear that the Xue Long is trapped in the ice, said Chris Turney, the expedition leader, who is a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales. "Thanks to the courageous efforts of the captain and his men, they made an incredible effort to help us get to safety – we all owe them a huge debt. We're keeping everything crossed that they get out soon."The latest complication in the dramatic 10-day rescue mission came as passengers freed from the Shokalskiy spent their first day aboard the Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis.The Aurora Australis, which is ferrying the expedition party to Tasmania, has been told to be prepared to turn around to help free the Xue Long.Tracey Rogers, a marine ecologist at the University of New South Wales and part of the group rescued by the Xue Long, said it was important for their ship to stay in the area to help. It was the Xue Long's helicopter that airlifted the passengers to safety.Rogers said: "We need to stay around because there's more than 100 people on that vessel. As part of the work in Antarctica we all look out for one another. Antarctica is a place of peace and science and people look out for each other. These guys looked out for us, it's our turn to be there for them."The sad part is that, because they were so extremely professional, streamlined and fast when rescuing us, that we didn't get a chance to say thank you properly."Rogers spent her first 24 hours in new surroundings collecting messages and drawings of thanks from her fellow evacuees, which she plans to send to the crews of the Xue Long and the Shokalskiy."It's a simple organic thing we've put together. We can't get to them physically but we can scan in something on a computer. It's something that's a little personal, to be able to say thank you – particularly to the captain of the Xue Long, because it was his choice to stay and help us. Jianzhong Wang is a real hero."The Aurora was on Friday continuing to Tasmania as it awaited further instruction on whether it should return to the Xue Long, believed to be about 40 nautical miles away.Another option is for the Xue Long to wait about 10 days for an American icebreaker to reach the area, off Cape de la Motte, in Antarctica, and try to free the ship.
