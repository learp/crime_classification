Channing Tatum has announced Magic Mike Live, a stage version of his successful stripper movie franchise.Magic Mike XXL – strippers' verdict: 'A public liability claim waiting to happen' The actor, whose life inspired Steven Soderbergh’s original film, released a torso and puppy-filled video via Cosmopolitan to reveal that the live show would launch in Las Vegas in March 2017.“We want to create a place for women that is their gentlemen’s club, their Playboy club,” he said in an accompanying interview. “It shouldn’t be sleazy. [You shouldn’t feel] nervous to go there because you feel unsafe; we want to create the polar opposite of that.”    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Tatum will direct the show which will also retain some of the choreographers from the films. He’s not set to appear but hasn’t ruled out the possibility. “If I’m ever in shape enough to do that again, I’ll absolutely go out and have a fun night or two,” he said.A site has now launched which, like the video, asks women to contribute their opinions on what they would like to see in the show. Magic Mike and Magic Mike XXL have made a combined total of $289m worldwide yet a third film looks unlikely. ‘Look, if someone has an idea then email me, cause I don’t,” Tatum said in 2015. “If anyone on the internet likes any ideas, just go for it and write it because I don’t know if I can write it because I’m pretty dry now on all my actual real life experiences.”
