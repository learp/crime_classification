The interesting word “footsolider” (Paul Mason, G2, 19 April) deserves the kind of exegesis that occurred over the lines “Soldier Aristotle played the taws/Upon the bottom of a king of kings” in the printed version of WB Yeats’ Among School Children. Much energy was spent by scholars explaining, some quite plausibly, why Aristotle was referred to as a soldier, until inspection of the manuscript showed that Yeats had written “Solider Aristotle”.Karl SabbaghBloxham, Oxfordshire• “Global warming/climate change” sounds cuddly. “Climate cancer” might move record temperature rises from page six (World’s hottest March in more than 100 years, 16 April) to the front page.Jane FreemanBristol• My husband has just come in from the garden wearing his orange and black TNT logo shirt. Is this an “attention-grabbing visual statement” (Yes logo, G2, 20 April) on his part? I certainly don’t find it funny, it’s a hideous colour. Maybe if I just explain to him that it is now deeply fashionable, this will prompt him to stop wearing it. He certainly wouldn’t want anyone to think he paid £185 for it. Neither of us has any idea where it came from.Isabella StoneMatlock, Derbyshire• Cauliflowers can be glamorous, too (Letters, 20 April). As Sir Walter Scott’s character Andrew Fairservice remarks: “a kail-braid, or a colliflour, glances sae glegly by moonlight, it’s like a leddy in her diamonds” (Rob Roy).Paul Noel WilsonBarnoldswick, Lancashire• More puzzles.
