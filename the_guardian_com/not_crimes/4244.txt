Life is wonderful if you ignore all bad thoughts and just keep smiling – says Hope, a teenage vlogger and promoter of Leata, a wonder drug that makes you constantly happy with no side effects. She is determined to see the best in everything and when her old friend, and neighbour, Tom loses his dad to suicide she decides to try to make him better. But Tom doesn’t take Leata, in fact he hates it and the company that makes it, as he is sure they had something to do with his dad’s death.Suddenly Hope finds herself dragged into the dark, dangerous underworld of corporate cover up, but is she ruining her perfect life or is she finally seeing what has been right in front of her all this time? This is a high-paced thriller with very contrasting protagonists. Hope, as her name would suggest, is happy and slightly out of it thanks to her medication, while Tom is dark, brooding and moody. The book alternates between the characters with each chapter, allowing you to understand their motivations, as well as view them from another’s perspective. The themes running through the book are quiet relevant to teenagers today, with topics like depression, drugs, love and death throughout the book.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? Although this book seems a little confusing at the beginning, once you get stuck it is a very gripping read. This book kept me hooked for hours on end and I found it hard to put down from the moment that I started. I would recommend this book to teens that like mystery or a bit of a thriller, especially fans of books like Paper Towns. But even if you don’t like these things then why not give it a try anyway; you’ll probably still enjoy it just the same. • Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
