Bruce Springsteen has announced four UK stadium shows for this summer. He brings the E Street Band to Britain for The River tour, in which he plays the entirety of his 1980 double album, finishing his set with a selection of highlights from the rest of his career.Springsteen will play the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on 25 May, Hampden Park in Glasgow on 2 June, Ricoh Arena in Coventry on 3 June, and Wembley Stadium in London on 5 June.Tickets go on sale on 25 February at 9am.The US leg of the tour has been received ecstatically. “The greatest revelation of the revisiting of this album is that, at its core, The River sees the band do something rare: get quiet,” wrote Mark Guarino, reviewing the Chicago show for the Guardian. “With the songs played in order, the album begins slowly to stretch out and soon, the slower songs begin to edge out the quick and fast. These songs – Point Blank, Fade Away, Stolen Car – grow into cinematic set pieces and since they are not often featured on the band’s setlist, there is a sense the band was energized, skillfully filtering all their strengths for big gestures into smaller pockets.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest
