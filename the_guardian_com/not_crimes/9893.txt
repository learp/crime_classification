Scotland Yard was warned a decade ago that Mazher Mahmood’s methods were suspect but continued to work with the notorious “Fake Sheikh” to bring prosecutions, the Guardian has learned.Tulisa Contostavlos trial collapses over Mazher Mahmood's evidence Details of the warnings emerged hours after Mahmood, a star reporter for the News of the World and the Sun on Sunday, was convicted by a jury of tampering with evidence in the drugs case of the pop star Tulisa Contostavlos.Sources with close knowledge of Scotland Yard say the force was warned about his methods on at least two separate occasions yet continued to treat his stories and evidence as the basis for criminal cases that led to people being jailed.One of those who warned police, first in 2003 and then 2005, was a former helper of Mahmood who claimed in an interview with detectives that the Murdoch journalist was routinely setting people up.The reporter’s former helper also alleged that Mahmood potentially acted criminally. At the time police concluded after an assessment that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations.Mahmood’s conviction for perverting the course of justice potentially throws doubts on scores of other convictions resulting from his tabloid stings. Technically, the conviction could result in a life sentence but in practice it is likely to run to months or a small number of years.The Criminal Cases Review Commission said it was investigating the cases of six people, convicted after cases involving Mahmood, who say their convictions are unsafe. Others are expected to follow: according to the Crown Prosecution Service there were “42 cases with 72 defendants involving Mahmood” and it is up to defence lawyers to appeal against convictions if their clients want to.Mahmood, along with his driver, Alan Smith, 67, was found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice by tampering with a statement Smith made to police before Contostavlos’s trial in 2014. The singer had been charged in relation to allegations that she had tried to arrange a contact of hers to supply £800 worth of cocaine to Mahmood, who had posed as a movie producer promising a new career on the big screen.Contostavlos’s trial collapsed after it emerged that Mahmood had tampered with evidence being used against her, leading to the controversial journalist being prosecuted.The self-styled “king of the sting” claims to have helped secure the convictions of 100 criminals over his 25-year career after his evidence was handed to police. But some trials that resulted from Mahmood’s investigations collapsed, including one involving an alleged attempt to kidnap Victoria Beckham.The information police received in 2003 and 2005 came after an earlier police review had identified concerns about Mahmood. That review was conducted by Robert Quick, then senior officer in the Met’s anti-corruption command, as part of an investigation of a private detective agency, Southern Investigations, which Mahmood and others at the News of the World used.One source with knowledge of the Met’s internal workings said: “The Met continued to make use of his services … By 2005 they knew he was suspect but they were still involved with him.”The fallout from Mahmood’s conviction also threatened to engulf Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers in the UK and US in fresh litigation and demands for huge payouts. The solicitor Mark Lewis said he was acting for 20 people who say they were victims of Mahmood’s suspect methods, in claims that could total £800m.Among those planning to sue, he said, were Emma Morgan, a page 3 model, and John Alford, the former star of ITV’s London’s Burning. Lewis has previously acted for clients suing Murdoch-owned tabloids over phone hacking.Alford has said in the past that his life was destroyed by Mahmood, who promised him a role in a Robert De Niro movie in exchange for drugs. The actor lost his £120,000-a-year job as a result and in 1999 was jailed for nine months.According to Los Angeles court papers, a US financier, John Bryan, who once dated Prince Andrew’s former wife, Sarah Ferguson, is suing News UK’s parent company, News Corp, for libel, invasion of privacy and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. He is claiming $50m (£39m), which could triple to $150m under US law, which allows “treble damages” where punitive compensation is awarded. “The vile conduct giving rise to this lawsuit includes a failed entrapment scheme, unlawful recordings and a malicious libel,” says the 13-page document.Bryan’s case has been brought in relation to a sting in which Mahmood’s undercover team offered the American an investment opportunity in a casino and then allegedly tried to entrap him by “asking him to supply prostitutes and drugs”. .Lewis says they will be suing for a multitude of alleged wrongs expected to include libel, reputational damage and loss of earnings. He is also examining whether there could be a basis for a claim of vicarious malicious prosecution against News UK. A malicious prosecution claim would involve accusations that, as Mahmood’s employer, News UK facilitated the alleged entrapment and subsequent prosecution.After a two-week trial at the Old Bailey, a jury found Mahmood, 53, and his driver, Smith, 67, guilty of plotting to pervert the course of justice.When the case against Contostavlos collapsed, the former N-Dubz star branded Mahmood’s investigation “horrific and disgusting”, telling reporters that she was “never involved in taking or dealing cocaine” and had been entrapped by Mahmood, who had offered her a leading movie role alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.Fall of the 'Fake Sheikh': how the tables were turned on Mazher Mahmood “They targeted me at a time when things were going badly for me and they had no mercy,” she said last year after the Sun on Sunday claimed she had agreed to arrange the supply of cocaine because she thought it would help her land a role in a Bollywood blockbuster.“Mahmood got me and my team completely intoxicated and persuaded me to act the part of a bad rough ghetto girl. They recorded this and produced it as evidence when I thought it was an audition. It was a terrible thing to do.” After the verdicts Ben Rose, Contostavlos’s defence lawyer, said: “The real scandal in this case is that Mahmood was allowed to operate as a wholly unregulated police force, ‘investigating’ crimes without the safeguards [that] apply to the police.“It was obvious from the outset that Tulisa should never have had to go to court. If Mahmood’s evidence had been properly stress-tested instead of accepted wholesale by the CPS, we are confident it would have come to the same conclusion.”DC Jim Morrison, of Scotland Yard, said: “This case is a reminder that perverting the course of justice is a very serious offence that goes to heart of our justice system. We will always take action where statements or other evidence has been tampered with.”A News UK spokesperson said: “We are disappointed by the news that Mazher Mahmood has been convicted. We do not have further comment at this time.”
