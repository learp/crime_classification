Ofcom has begun an investigation into Christopher Biggins’s comments about bisexuality on Celebrity Big Brother.The pantomime star, 67, was ejected from the Channel 5 show last month after being given three warnings by Big Brother for his remarks on bisexuality, and for a comment that was not broadcast about gas chambers.During a conversation about homosexuality, the gay actor said: “The worst type though is, I’m afraid to say, the bisexuals … what it is, is people not wanting to admit they are gay.”He was then seen agreeing with his fellow contestant Renee Graziano’s comment that “you have to pick a team”.Biggins claimed HIV had been spread by bisexual people who had sex with infected people abroad “and brought it back to their own families in America, and that’s how it became a worldwide disease”.The broadcasting watchdog said it had received 20 complaints.“We’re investigating whether a contestant’s comments about bisexual people were offensive and breached generally accepted standards,” a spokesperson said.Ofcom is not investigating Biggins’s comments about the Holocaust because it was unable to consider complaints about material that had not been broadcast.While in the house, Biggins had said to housemate Katie Waissel, who is Jewish: “You better be careful or they’ll be putting you in a shower and taking you to a room,” as the celebrities queued for the bathroom.He later apologised to Waissel and Big Brother for the “trite, ridiculous remark”.Ofcom has also resolved a complaint about Harry Hill’s TV Burp, which was broadcast on Dave in May.Hill sparked a complaint with a comment about a clip from a Channel 4 documentary, The Pregnant Man. A viewer complained that the remark was “offensive and discriminatory towards the transgender community”.Ofcom said: “We investigated potentially offensive comments Harry Hill made about a transgender man.“The broadcaster made edits to the programme, which was first broadcast in 2008, to remove potentially offensive comments from future broadcasts. We consider the matter to be resolved.”
