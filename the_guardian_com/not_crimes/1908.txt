I loves a good apocalypse, I do. It's the Welsh in me, craving some wild drama in the temperate capital, a dull, placid place where your emergency poncho never blows away to leave you at the mercy of the vicious elements as you stand, weeping and hungover in a field, clutching a spool of sopping wet bog roll (so how was your weekend?).But then, who doesn't love the end of the world? It gives one something to work towards – something to plan for. But it is a laborious business, being someone who buys into doomsday scenarios. There are shelters to build, canned goods to stockpile, hill forts to maintain.At least this time we have plenty of time to prepare ourselves – scientists have estimated that life on Earth will be wiped out somewhere between 1.75bn and 3.25bn years, not because the planet will implode or the plagues of locusts will become intolerable, but because things are going to get too damn hot to live. Yes, even hotter than that day last July when lots of young women took their tops off to sunbathe in the park, only to have it all photographically documented by the Daily Telegraph. In short, unless we high-tail it off to Mars, or somewhere similarly balmy, we're all going to meet our maker while drowning in our own sweat (provided our eyeballs haven't melted first).With this incredibly relaxed timeframe in mind (you may argue that there really isn't anything to worry about, because we may even have evolved into something else by the time we need to start thinking about this – in which case, clearly, you have never met me), I thought I'd compile a short list of things that humankind really needs to get sorted out before we're wiped out.1. The end of all known diseases, plus male pattern baldnessThus rendering us a fit and healthy super race with excellent, long flowing locks.2. The end of war Strength is in numbers. If we're going to colonise other, possibly inhabited planets, we need to stop killing off so many of our own and start backing one another. Forget about all these quibbles regarding borders and resources, we're all on team human race now.3. Tangle-free headphonesIt's incredible. All it takes is a matter of seconds in your pocket and you're faced with a knot worse than an eco child's rattail. See also: headphones that make your ears too hot.4. Gender equalityIf we're going to build a new utopia, we're going to need the ladies on board, and we're going to need more to convince us than a £1,500 childcare tax break and a free makeover voucher. See also: racial equality, gay equality5. A replacement for bufferingWe know the technology is available, and yet we're slaves to the spinning iPlayer circle. Sorting out buffering would leave time for us to concentrate on solving other problems, such as …6. How to introduce someone whose name you can't rememberThis happens to me at least once a week. It used to be that I would awkwardly freeze, halfway through the sentence "and this is…" as a deadly silence descends on the group. Nowadays, I retreat awkwardly to the lavatory and allow people to make their own introductions. It would be really great if someone could sort out the protocol here to avoid all the wasted hours that human beings would otherwise spend hovering in public bathrooms. Or at the very least you could get Wi-Fi in there.7. The end of world povertyOur legacy is looking pretty shabby here, to be honest. How's it going to look when we leave Earth and are in the process of meeting and greeting our new neighbours and they ask about our old planet was like. "Oh, it was really quite swish on our side, and there were loads of resources to go around, but instead we left over half the population in the dirt, and actually, if your house had a roof, that put you in the top 20% of human beings."8. The male pillWords cannot express how badly I want this to happen.9. The end of the 5:2 diet(Conversation with alien continues) "So while the rest of the world's population was literally starving, we had so much milk that we had to turn it into lakes and most of the people in my office were voluntarily going hungry in order to match up to an unrealistically skinny body ideal. It made them really unpleasant to be around but it's OK because they all froze to death in the last ice age."10. The meaning of Mulholland DriveI just really want to know.
