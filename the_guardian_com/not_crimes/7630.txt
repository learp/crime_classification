Kanye West’s seventh studio album Swish is now complete. According to the rapper, “the best album of all time” is finished just in time for its 11 February release. In the runup to its unveiling, West has previewed a number of new tracks, including No More Parties in LA featuring Kendrick Lamar, Fade featuring Post Malone and Ty Dolla $ign, and Real Friends. These are featured on the handwritten tracklist – adorned with a message from Kylie Jenner – while previous singles such as All Day and Only One have been left off the forthcoming record. While the list of West’s collaborators on the follow-up to 2013’s Yeezus has not yet been revealed, alongside the aforementioned, the track Wolves, performed on Saturday Day Night Live, features Sia and Vic Mensa.News of the new album should give relief to those dismayed by the possibility that West was considering making an album of David Bowie covers and interpretations. Just 24 hours after the rumours of his possible tribute album emerged, a petition to stop him from doing so had been set up.
