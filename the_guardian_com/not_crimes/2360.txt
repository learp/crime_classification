7.57pm GMT19:57So that’s it for another Strictly week, and only two to go! Thank you all for joining in, and I’ll see you next Saturday at 6.50pm for the semi-final, which involves TWO DANCES. It’s the final push, so let’s make it count. See you next week!

He then makes Oksana cry by being entirely lovely.They dance their final dance to Defying Gravity from Wicked, and I am already missing Rinder’s sense of fun (a lot), his latin hips (a bit) and his dancing sex face (less so). Rinder has without doubt been on the biggest journey of this year’s Strictly quarter finalists, and I’m sorry to see him go. Things might be decidedly light on laughs from here on in.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.53pm GMT19:53As expected, all the judges save Ore and Joanne, which means JUDGE RINDER AND OKSANA are going home.

FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.50pm GMT19:50So Ore and Joanne are up first. This is still a bit sedate for my liking, but I thing Ore’s top line has definitely improved. I’d still love to see him in the final, ideally with Claudia and Louise, but that isn’t going to happen.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.43pm GMT19:43 So who is joining Ore and Joanne in the dance-off? As expected, it’s Judge Rinder an Oksana, who immediately gives the crowd a wave. He knows he’s going home. Boo.  It’s Ore .

Alas the picture desk doesn’t seem to have a shot of that dress. Either it’s an endangered species, or we’re all being encouraged to pretend that never happened.Updatedat 7.41pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.34pm GMT19:34Apparently there are two dances next week. I had no idea, they should have mentioned it sooner.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.33pm GMT19:33You know what would improve Ore and Joanne’s Foxtrot, Bruno? Taking a scythe to the superfluous flowers. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.32pm GMT19:32So who is safely through to the semi-finals (TWO DANCES), and who is the first couple in the bottom two? Claudia and AJ are safe (hooray!), along with Louise and Kevin! First couple in the bottom two: Ore and Joanne! So it’s either Rinder or Danny, which would be a massive upset.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.28pm GMT19:28Last night on Strictly – a slightly lacklustre Musicals Week, with far too many superfluous backing dancers and some odd music choices. Highlights: Rinder’s Samba hips, Oti’s Beyonce hair, Louise looking like she’s having fun, the West Side Story pro dance.Lowlights: Anton’s impression of Bruce Forsyth, Bruno’s impression of Donny Osmond, Kevin’s chaps, no Ed Balls.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
