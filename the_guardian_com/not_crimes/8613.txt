MachynllethYou can have a very good walk across upland Cardiganshire eastwards from the source-lakes of the Teifi River. It is all a strangely broken, hummocky, ridged and rocky country in which these quiet lakes lie. Then the track goes away into the moors, wandering round every little rise as if it lacked all ambition. But no matter. There is no cause for hurry on such a road. It goes nowhere in particular for its day is over. There are no longer any cattle to go along it to Barnet Fair; and the Cistercian abbeys it once connected (Strata Florida and Cyrnhir) have been long centuries in ruins.Today if you care to follow this track you are pretty sure to be led to Birmingham Corporationâ€™s Claerwen reservoir. For it is only too easy to miss the ancient road which steals slyly away to the north-east, losing itself in wide and tussocky bogs but re-finding itself where it climbs the farther slopes. Whichever way you go you will traverse one of the finest, emptiest sweeps of high-placed grassland in all Wales with, miraculously, not a conifer in sight. Miraculously, did I say? Alas no, it is no miracle. I fear it is merely that a vast area thereabouts is common land and so cannot yet be afforested. But the laws that are now threatening to revolutionise commons rights will change all that and will be a death-blow to many a lovely open stretch of moorland.
