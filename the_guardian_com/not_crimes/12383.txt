Disney has come under fire from US presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, after he used a rally in Anaheim, California, the Disneyland resort’s home town, to attack the company’s low wage level. “Disney pays its workers wages that are so low that many of them are forced to live in motels because they can’t afford a decent place to live,” said Sanders to a crowd that included Disney employees. “Meanwhile Disney made a record-breaking profit of nearly $3bn last quarter”.Sanders, who is currently running behind his Democrat rival Hillary Clinton, also criticised Disney’s outsourcing of manufacturing to China. “I say to Disney, bring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck back to America,” he said.The Walt Disney Company, which has recently scored global hits with Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Zootopia and The Jungle Book, reported record-breaking profits in the first quarter of 2016. The company pays Disneyland food service workers $10.30 an hour. Its CEO, Robert Iger, took home $46.5m in total compensation last year, a fact that was leapt on by Sanders during his speech. Iger, a donor to the Clinton campaign, responded to Sanders’s criticisms by posting a message on his private Facebook account, which was later obtained by website The Wrap. “To Bernie Sanders: We created 11,000 new jobs at Disneyland in the past decade, and our company has created 18,000 in the US in the last five years,” he wrote. “How many jobs have you created? What have you contributed to the US economy?”“Mr. Sanders clearly doesn’t have his facts right,” Suzi Brown, a Disneyland spokesperson, said in a statement to Politico. “The Disneyland Resort generates more than $5.7bn annually for the local economy, and as the area’s largest employer has added more than 11,000 jobs over the last decade”.
