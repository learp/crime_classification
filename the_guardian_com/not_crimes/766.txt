Judee Sill – That’s the SpiritI found out about Judee Sill through the Radio 4 show The Lost Genius of Judee Sill, and instantly fell in love with her music and her world. That’s the Spirit is from her third album, Dreams Come True, which was unreleased in her lifetime. It sounds like her freest piece of music as there are so many other musicians playing on it, whereas on her previous albums she generally did everything.

Beautiful late-60s European jazz with a strong Purcell-like apocalyptic choir outro!    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Kate & Anna McGarrigle – Heart Like a WheelI think I came across this song first on Spotify. One of those rare occasions where banjo and heartbreak work so well. Truly beautiful arrangement from the McGarrigle sisters’ 1976 debut album.

Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Laura Nyro – The ConfessionLastly, Laura Nyro, from her incredible album Eli and the Thirteenth Confession. I chose this song because it displays what a genius she is – all the instrumentation and emotion in her vocals, climaxing in a chant about love being gospel.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest
