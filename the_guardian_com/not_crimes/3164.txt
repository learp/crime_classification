Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:59pmI did know her a little, and I interviewed her several times for radio and print interviews, before I knew I was going to be her biographer. I often wish I’d known at the time, but she was an elusive and private person and would probably have given me evasive answers. There was someone she was in love with, unrequitedly, for a long time: it comes into many of her books and she sometimes mentions it indirectly. I would love to know who it was, but she would never have told me. And I would like to have asked her about her dreams.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.01pm GMT14:01Vasco Resende says:Was Penelope Fitzgerald a religious person? If so, do you think it reflects at a substratum level on her novels?  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:57pmYou are right, she was religious, and the Christian church was very important to her. But she is not explicitly religious in her books (she used to say she regretted this). The books are full of prayer, miracles, a sense of an other world beyond the world we know. But they are not at all explicitly Christian (the conventional religious people in her books are pretty ineffectual). They are interested in the relationship between the body and the soul, in mystery, and in human aspirations, however muddled, towards something larger than an individual life. But they are not at all preachy.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.00pm GMT14:00hemingway62 asks:What is your view on Offshore winning the Booker prize in 1979? Compared to most of her other fiction I found it a poor contender for the Booker short list, let alone the winner for that year.  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:59pmIt was up against some big names, like Naipaul and Weldon. But – even if it isn’t your favourite of her books - I think the judges recognised something rare about it, the evocation of a place and time in an extraordinarily intense, spare, confined narrative, the painfully truthful story of a failing marriage, and the enchanting eccentric lives of the boat people and the children. It’s also a very good book about poverty, grief, regret and hope.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.57pm GMT13:57stoneofsilence says:In the writing of a life; does the other life impinge upon yours?  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:55pmI don’t believe in biography as a form of autobiography, but certainly if you are writing about Virginia Woolf or Edith Wharton or Willa Cather or Penelope Fitzgerald you are powerfully affected by the personality you are writing about, and find yourself very bound up with the story of the life. At the same time it’s a book you’re writing, it’s not a marriage or a personal relationship, and you have to keep a certain distance.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.56pm GMT13:56lljones says:As you noted in your book, C.K. Stead, in a LRB review of Innocence, “…kept asking himself, with wonder and admiration: ‘How is it done?’”Our own Sam noted on his intro to the Reading Group: “How is it done?” asked Jan Morris in her review in the Independent of The Beginning of Spring. (A few years later, Michael Dibdin would also ask “How on earth was this done?” when reviewing The Blue Flower, as did AS Byatt.) Julian Barnes, again referring to The Blue Flower, asked: “How does she do that?... I have reread [the washday] scene many times, always trying to find its secret, but never succeeding.”Do you feel you found a satisfactory answer to this question for yourself? And did Fitzgerald know how she did it?  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:53pmWhat attracted me to PF as a subject was partly the mystery of her personality and the sense in her writing that there is always something not quite explained, something mysterious you can never find: like the blue flower itself. I tried hard to work out how she made her effects: so for instance at the start of the chapter about The Blue Flower I spent two pages on the first paragraph of the novel, asking how she creates a particular mood and tone. But in the end she keeps her secrets!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.55pm GMT13:55Kungfulil wants to know:Are there any unpublished writings? Unfinished stories by PF?  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:52pmThere were some unfinished sketches which I wrote about in my book; there were unpublished stories which were published after her death in The Means of Escape; and she was planning for years to write a biography of L.P.Hartley, and a book on the meaning of Renaissance flowers. I wish she had written both of them.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.52pm GMT13:52'You have to be ruthless and candid as a biographer'deadgod asks:How hesitant were you in handling the material that might have been personally embarrassing to Fitzgerald? (—for example, her husband’s embezzlement, or her undeserved (?) coldness towards her daughter-in-law.) Especially with a person who impresses one not just in their work, but in their character—a person whom one feels (or imagines one should feel) fondness for—, one wants not to be gratuitous or merely sensational — as you never are in your biography, but I think of kindness, as well as fairness, as being not inevitable, but rather, an achievement.  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:49pmYou have to be ruthless and candid as a biographer, or you would never tell any truths about anyone. At the same time I think it’s important to be fair, generous if possible, and empathetic to your subject. I have never written a biography about someone I didn’t admire, and whose work I didn’t love; but when it comes to their faults and failings (we all have them) you have to tell the truth.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.45pm GMT13:45Benjamin Cavanagh says:Two of her uncles were prominent Christians and another was atheist. I think her father was more ambivalent. I am curious to know the origin of Penelope’s own religious beliefs and was there any big conversion story or was there an influence on her eventual fairly quiet CofE participation? Did she ever write about this aspect of her life?  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:44pmShe was a Christian, and went to Church - but organised religion is somewhat satirised in her books and her faith was kept back from the surface of the work (which she used to say she regretted). The books are full of prayers, some of which get answered, miracles (as at the end of The Gate of Angels) and mysteries - also smaller phenomena like a highly convincing poltergeist in The Bookshop (which she used to matter of factly say she had experienced herself.) Above all she believes in the deep connection between the body and the soul. Blue Flower is all about the sense that though we live surrounded by thick material things, we are on the edge of another world.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.44pm GMT13:44'Why do I like her? I can't think of another writer who writes more deeply and wisely about loss and harm'MythicalMagpie says:Thinking about it, you must really like an author’s writing to go to the trouble of writing their biography. I’d like to ask Hermione Lee what she particularly admires about Fitzgerald’s books.  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:40pmYes, I couldn't imagine spending between five and seven years with a writer in my head without liking their books. I am drawn to PF for a mixture of reasons: a lot has to do with the comedy of human life. She makes me laugh out loud. I think she is wonderful about muddle, hypocrisy and embarrassment. But she also makes me cry. I can't think of another writer who writes more deeply and wisely about loss and harm, but also about the need to battle on.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.42pm GMT13:42Ongley says:I am still to read any Penelope Fitzgerald, but I was wondering what is her reception abroad and do her books translate well? I don’t mean this in a strictly literal sense.  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:38pmThe Blue Flower won the National Critics Book Circle Award in 1998 and at that point she became hugely well known in the States, for that book and for The Bookshop which is much loved by reading groups. She does get translated into French and other European languages too (The Bookshop in France was called L'Affaire Lolita, which makes it much more spicy) but I don't know how much she sells on the continent.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.41pm GMT13:41Racine62 asks:Was it easier to empathise with Fitzgerald more than the formidable Edith Wharton?  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:35pmEdith is like a great ship of state, full of luxury and wealth and people and grand relationships and big travels: I loved all that, and wanted to make my book on her as full and grand and lavish as possible, like a series of richly furnished rooms. Penelope, by contrast, is spare, austere, apparently simple, so I wanted to cut down. But they are both equally savage, witty, lacerating, sharp, when the mood takes them.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.40pm GMT13:40Ring leader of our Reading group, samjordison asks:I hope this doesn’t push too far into the realm of speculation... And it’s also a bit of a half-question... But I’ve always wondered if Penelope Fitzgerald was able to write so well partly because she came to it so late after years of thought... Or if, had things been different, we could have had another 40-years-worth of masterpieces? Do you have any definite thoughts on that?  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:34pmIt's rather like the last question only the other way round. But I agree with you that part of the magic is the sense of things having matured in her mind. She is very interested in "lateness:" - things coming late to people, people having to wait for things.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.39pm GMT13:39Scuff wants to know:If Fitzgerald had begun writing in her 30s, what sort of books might written, and do you think they would have affected the books she did write later in life?  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:33pmFascinating What If question. I don't think I know the answer, but she might have revealed more about the passions and frustrations that were part of her life at that time. But I think it worked well for her, in fact, the saving up of materials: Human Voices, for instance, is such a brilliant account of life in London and at the BBC during the Blitz, just because it has had time to settle down in her mind. Sorry, this is a rather evasive answer: like many questions about PF, I think the answers are hard to find.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.37pm GMT13:37Wondergirl says:I read her biography of her father and uncles, The Knox Brothers, after reading her novels, and then I realised how she had done it as it were, that she came from a family of thinkers and writers, that in a way, her writing life was the life she was born, raised for, having grown up in that atmosphere. Can you say something about this aspect of her life and work?  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:31pmThis is absolutely crucial to everything she did. The Knox Brothers is a marvellous, odd, funny, touching book and brings to life vividly the eccentric brilliance of her family. They were a mixture of priests and code-breakers and literary editors - all with a very strong sense of integrity and an absolute refusal to compromise. It wasn't an easy family to grow up in, particularly for a brilliant young woman.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.32pm GMT13:32Our very own C1aireA has a question:Hello Hermione and thanks so much for coming in.Do you think one could describe her as a historical novelist, on the basis of her later books? Or do you think that creates a false division in her oeuvre? And what would she have thought about it?  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:30pmI always think of historical novels as big thick fully furnished operations, like War and Peace. PF has the extraordinary ability to conjure up a very particular historical place and period - Russia just before the revolution, Italy in the 1950s - with the most economical and subtle strokes, so that you feel you are completely inhabiting that world, without thinking of it as "history". That;s what makes The Blue Flower so extraordinary.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.29pm GMT13:29'I'm very interested in this question of how a biography can be true to a life...'machenbach asks:The way Fitzgerald constructs her characters is an implied rebuke to some of the reductive ‘explanations’ that some biographers (present company excepted, of course) tend to rely on when they represent their subjects. Her characters are often enigmatic and Fitzgerald rarely imposes an authorial explanation for what they say or do – something that the biographer is usually constrained to provide. Was that something that you took on board in your biography of her? She states in an interview that “You shouldn’t read fiction for [biographical] truth.” To what extent do you agree with that? Or how do you interpret it?  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:21pmI'm very interested in this question of how a biography can be true to a life. I don't believe the cradle to grave historical method is necessarily the best one, particularly not with a very well known life like Virginia Woolf's. I think you have to try and find a structure and a tone which best expresses the writer's character and life-story.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.26pm GMT13:26allworthy says:I am interested to see how her art affected writing. Bainbridge also artistic and produced artworks mirroring her writing.  Guardian contributor HermioneLee 27 January 2017 1:18pmshe was extremely interested in art and artists and wrote a wonderful book on Edward Burne-Jones, in which William Morris was the hero. She was very fond of Morris and everything he stood for: the usefulness of art for ordinary life, the ideal of the social purpose of the artist. Her books are full of people who can do things: look after a boat, nurse people, run a printing press. She believed in craft as part of artistry. She also drew, very vivid and vigorous little drawings of family, children, cats, places, which she would send to her friends as cards. I scattered them through my biography.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
