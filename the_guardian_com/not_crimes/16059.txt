The Australian theatre company accused by John Cleese of ripping off his television series Fawlty Towers has said it is “staggered by [his] vitriol towards us and our tribute show”.Cleese tweeted on Wednesday that Interactive Theatre International had not sought permission to use the characters, situations and names associated with the show for its Faulty Towers dining experience.John Cleese may sue Australian theatre company over Fawlty Towers rip-off Since 1997 the show has been staged in more than 20 countries around the world every year, including a six-night-a-week residency in London’s West End, with tickets selling for as much as £64 (A$119) a head.It is described as a “loving tribute” to the television series written by Cleese and his ex-wife Connie Booth, using the characters, concepts and catchphrases but not the original television scripts.While Cleese had known of the show for more than a year, he said he had only recently learned of its “astonishing financial success” from an Australian journalist. He said that, having used the show’s basic concept and characters for close to 20 years “without paying us a penny, they could well owe us a very significant amount”.Geraldine Hill, the PR and brand director for the producers of the show, said on Thursday that she was not able to disclose “any of the discussions that we’ve had [with] Mr Cleese and his management over the years”, but she rejected his suggestions that the show was a rip-off.“We are staggered by John Cleese’s vitriol towards us and our tribute show. He and his management have known about our show for years. We have made nothing like the sums he claims we have,” she said.“We are not an unauthorised rip-off show – anyone who knows the law in this area will understand that we do not require authorisation to use the concept of Fawlty Towers. We are not the bad guys he is painting us to be.“It is a shame he has chosen to air his frustrations so publicly rather than contacting us directly about this matter.”Q&A: John Cleese She said she was unable to say whether Cleese or his representative had contacted the company within the past 48 hours.Cleese’s agent in London and promoter in Australia have been contacted for comment.Cleese told Fairfax Media he was considering pursuing legal action against Interactive Theatre International before the world premiere of his stage show Fawlty Towers Live in Sydney in August.“The British press doesn’t like me very much,” said Cleese on Monday of its Australian debut. “I don’t think I would have got very good reviews [in London].”
