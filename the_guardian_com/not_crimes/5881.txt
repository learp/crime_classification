She later finds out that she has a strange connection to what’s happened.The film, which also stars Jason Sudeikis and Dan Stevens, premiered at last year’s Toronto film festival to mixed reviews.

Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It’s the latest film from Nacho Vigalondo, who also directed breakout Spanish thriller Timecrimes and Open Windows, starring Elijah Wood.Hathaway spoke to the Guardian last year about the role that toxic masculinity plays within the film’s unusual plot.“I’m glad that you used the word ‘toxic’, because it’s very important to say that it’s very different from male energy,” she said. “Male energy is beautiful. Male energy is welcome. Male energy is necessary. Male energy is half the reason why we’re here. That said, there has been a perversion of the beauty of male energy into this macho ideal that I don’t think services anybody ... In terms of my new movie, what our director was saying was that he thinks this energy really has no place in our world any more.”Colossal will be released in cinemas on 7 April
