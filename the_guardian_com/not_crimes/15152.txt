A new directive from China’s media regulators has prohibited films and TV that promote a “western lifestyle”. Issued on Monday by the State Administration for Press, Publishing, Radio, Film and Television, the guidelines also warn against the dangers of making shows and movies that satirise classic works of Chinese literature and encourage decadent behaviour. The state-owned Xinhua news agency explains that such lapses will mean programmes and films are outlawed should they appear to cheerlead for “vulgar” values. The ruling also extends to the news agenda of TV shows, according to Xinhua:  They should also avoid putting stars, billionaires or internet celebrities on pedestals; or sensationalising private affairs, relationships or family disputes.Moreover, social and entertainment news products must not advocate overnight fame, wealth parade or hedonism, selfishness or intrigue.Licenses will be revoked should such moral codes be broached. Instead, films and TV shows “must be dominated by mainstream ideologies and ‘positive energy’.” Eastern promise: the Hollywood films making their money in China New draft legislation is also currently under review, which requires film industry personnel to strive for “excellence in professional skills and moral integrity” and seek to aspire to “core socialist values”.
