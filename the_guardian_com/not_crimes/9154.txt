My wife has read a film review, and now wants to see a film. “We could go tomorrow,” she says. “It’s not as if we’re doing anything else.”“Maybe,” I say. My wife picks up the iPad.“It’s only on at one place,” she says. “First showing at 6.”“Nothing earlier?”“Shall I book anyway?” she asks. “I’ll book anyway.”“Well,” I say.“Where do you want to sit? Sort of middle middle?” I don’t say what I’m thinking, which is: this is all happening too fast.When we arrive at the cinema the next evening there is a short queue – just one person ahead of us.“We’re a bit early,” my wife says. “Never mind. We can drink.”The queue clears, but before my wife and I can step forward, a middle-aged woman walks directly in front of us and takes our place. It is a mildly jaw-dropping moment – a comprehensive violation of common courtesy.

The woman produces some kind of loyalty card and launches into a very long question about the nature of the discount she is entitled to. She has an American accent, a detail that might have been intentionally added to further enrage my wife.“I’m going to go berserk,” my wife says.“I don’t think you should,” I say. “And I’ll explain why.”“I’m shaking with irritation,” my wife says. “I can’t help it.” The woman is waving her card in the air as she speaks.“In my experience,” I say quietly, “a failure to observe basic social norms is often the result of some intractable deficiency.”“I don’t care,” my wife says, very loudly.“It would probably be a deeply unsatisfactory confrontation, is what I’m saying. Let it go.”“I can’t,” my wife says.“Try,” I say. Just then another member of staff appears, waving us forward. The moment passes, and I feel I have done something for the world.

The American woman enters the mostly empty cinema with a large box of popcorn and sits at the end of our aisle, three seats away.“I’m going to kill her,” my wife whispers.“Calmly,” I say.The lights dim. The ads begin. Although the cinema remains sparsely populated, people sit directly in front of us, and behind us. I imagine a dozen couples at home with iPads, all selecting middle middle, unthinkingly violating basic social norms. A couple sit right next to us, even though our row is empty apart from the American woman on the end. After a few minutes my wife turns to the woman directly next to her and points to me.

I can’t concentrate, because the American woman is scraping the bottom of her popcorn box with long fingernails. I don’t usually get irritated by this sort of thing, but I find I can’t help myself. Then she begins to laugh loudly at inappropriate moments. I turn to my wife, but she hasn’t even noticed – she’s wholly engrossed in the film. For her it’s already a highly successful outing. She’s made a friend, and bequeathed me an enemy.
