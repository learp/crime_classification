Critics from across the political spectrum agreed that there was one fundamental problem with Comrade Corbyn, Rosa Prince’s biography of the Labour leader: a lack of character development. “It is almost as though when young Jeremy first popped his little head out of his mother’s womb he was already sporting a peaked cap and a beard,” wrote Craig Brown in the Mail on Sunday. Though the book was, he thought, “a clear, well researched and fair-minded account of a steadfastly monotone life … As thrillers go, it lacks something. Ah, yes, that’s it: thrills.” Robert Colville, in the Daily Telegraph, also concluded that “Labour’s new leader has always been as he is now”. But Prince’s account was revealing in that “the figure that emerges is not the Loony Lefty of caricature, but someone who is too often blinded by his own sense of righteousness”. Writing in the New Statesman, Stephen Bush found it “an accomplished study and the most lucid explanation yet of the Labour party’s present state”. However, Prince left one key question unanswered: how cunning is Corbyn? “She gives us a better idea of what he did and where he came from that any other writer has done so far, but we never quite get inside his head. His thoughts, concerns and motivations remain a mystery.”There was no doubting the American novelist Jhumpa Lahiri’s bravery in writing In Other Words, a meditation on language, entirely in Italian. However, the book failed to summon up the spirit of Bella Italia for some reviewers. “At least she wasn’t bonkers enough to try Welsh,” wrote Roger Lewis in the Times. “But nevertheless, it sounds strange, punishing behaviour.” He found In Other Words “cerebral and cold. It is a book about Italian that leaves out Italy.” In the Financial Times, Jan Dalley agreed that “there are moments when the reader regrets it … we begin to feel that this disquisition on language is not so much an exploration of Lahiri’s beloved Italian as a display of the inadequacies of English.” However, the Independent’s reviewer Roma Tearne commended “an astonishingly sincere book on the mechanics and mystery that surround the creative process”. And for Horatio Clare, writing in the Daily Telegraph, “as an insight into creative daring and obsession with language, In Other Words is superb … Lahiri does not know whether she will return to writing in English. I rather hope she does not.”Elizabeth Strout won several rave reviews for her new novel, My Name Is Lucy Barton. “There is not a scintilla of sentimentality in this exquisite novel,” wrote Claire Messud in the New York Times. “Instead, in its careful words and vibrating silences, My Name Is Lucy Barton offers us a rare wealth of emotion, from darkest suffering to … simple joy.” For Hannah Beckerman in the Observer, “the descriptions of Lucy’s formative years are visceral and heartbreaking … If she hadn’t already won the Pulitzer for Olive Kitteridge, this new novel would surely be a contender.” In the Independent, Matthew Adams found that the prose was at times “so lacking in adornment as to be tedious but, quietly elegiac, this is the story of a single life that also manages to tell the story of many”. In the Washington Post, Lily King described it as “coming close at times to the rawness of autofiction by writers such as Karl Ove Knausgaard and Rachel Cusk. Strout is playing with form here, with ways to get at a story, yet nothing is tentative or haphazard. She is in supreme and magnificent command of this novel at all times.”
