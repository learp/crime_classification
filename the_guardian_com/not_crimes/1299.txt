The report of an inquiry into the Hazelwood coalmine fire will be released on Tuesday as residents of the nearby town of Morwell consider a class action lawsuit.The 400-page report is expected to be critical of the Victorian health department and the mine’s operator, GDF Suez. During hearings, the inquiry heard that the chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, had waited too long before recommending that vulnerable groups relocate and that communication to residents was confusing. Lester defended her actions, saying they were based on the best evidence available at the time. The inquiry also heard that GDF Suez was not fully prepared for a mine fire and had not adequately rehabilitated the disused area which caught alight.The blaze at the open-cut coalmine began on 9 February and burned for 45 days. There is no buffer zone between the brown coalmine and Morwell, and its 14,000 residents were blanketed with smoke, ash and at times carbon monoxide for six weeks. The inquiry, led by the former supreme court judge Bernard Teague, heard that the fire was “one of the worst public health and environmental disasters in the state’s history”.The legal firm Maurice Blackburn has called for residents and businesses to register if they are interested in a class action, which is normally run on a no-win, no-fee basis. The firm wanted to “gauge the extent to which people have been adversely affected by the fire and the amount of damage that has been suffered”. A lawsuit would depend on the inquiry’s findings and the community’s interest.Five months after the fire was extinguished, many residents of Morwell continue to be angry at the way authorities handled the disaster in a town already disadvantaged by high unemployment and poor health. They remain concerned about ongoing health problems and fear a recurrence of a fire unless the inquiry’s recommendations are implemented in full.Residents have also been largely left to bear the cost, with some still fighting insurance companies to clean roof cavities that remain covered in black dust.The blaze led to the setting up of the lobby group Voices of the Valley to fight for improved mine safety and for more diverse industry for the Latrobe valley, a major coalmining and power-generation centre. The group’s president, Wendy Farmer, said the community was looking for the mine to be rehabilitated properly “so we don’t have to fear that this could happen again”.“We want the community’s health to be looked at,” she said. “What we were breathing was pretty bad, and we were ignored and told that it was OK … when it wasn’t OK.”A new group, Latrobe Valley First, has held “kitchen table” meetings over the past two months to discuss the region’s future with the aim of standing an independent candidate in November’s state election. Tracie Lund, the coordinator of Morwell Neighbourhood House, has been nominated as a candidate for the group, which is holding interviews this week. During the fire, Lund organised a petition for a long-term study into the fire’s health impact, which gathered more than 25,000 signatures.
