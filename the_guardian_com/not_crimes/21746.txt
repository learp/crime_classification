Donald Trump might be setting out to Make America Great Again, but those described by Margaret Atwood as the “punsters and wordsmiths of Twitter” have been experimenting to see what the addition of a sprinkle of Trumpisms will do to the world’s great literature.The hashtag #TrumpaNovel has been running riot on Twitter, bringing us everything from “Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close: A Lesson in Debate Tactics” (thank you, Open Road Media), to The Giant Left Hand of Darkness (thank you, Joanne Harris – but should it be the Tiny Hand?).#TrumpBookReport: great literature reimagined as a tweet from the Donald There’s Mopey Dick, or Moby Dickhead, 20,000 Leagues Over His Head and The Gropes of Wrath. I’m particularly fond of Belittle Women, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Assgrabin, The Perks of Being a Wall Builder and No Country for Orange Men, but Great Expectations, Really Really Terrific Expectations is also very good. And whether it’s David Cop-a-Feel or The Girl I Grab on the Train or The Great Grabsy, there’s a whole world of titles riffing on the Republican presidential candidate’s attitude to (Nasty) Little Women.But I’m not sure they top last week’s literary-themed Donald-storm: #TrumpBookReport. That meme took its cue from St Louis politician Antonio French’s tweet following the final presidential debate that: “Trump’s foreign policy answers sound like a book report from a teenager who hasn’t read the book. ‘Oh, the grapes! They had so much wrath!’” Twitter went to town with this idea. Entertainment Weekly has collected some of the funniest responses. They include: “It was the best of times. The best! Was it the worst of times? WRONG! It was the best. I have hotels in those two cities,” or “Juliet. Such a nasty woman. She made Romeo kill himself. And believe me he could have done better. Look at her.”I’m sure our readers can do better, bigly.
