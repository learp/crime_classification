It’s been a wobbly couple of years for Wonga, the payday loan company with the aggravatingly matey name. After achieving the sort of notoriety even borrowed money can’t buy, the firm packed off its rubbery pensioner mascots – presumably to a private collector with a Zelda-from-Terrahawks fetish – and course-corrected into seriousface marketing. Its last campaign hammered a message of fiscal responsibility so hard it felt like a party political broadcast. Now, it’s reverted to cheeky gimmicks, hoping to create an atmosphere conducive to carefree spending. In its latest ad, a hamster in an exercise ball hurtles round a living room to the uplifting jungle-call chorus of Baltimora’s Tarzan Boy. Getting to the next level requires some help from the critter’s owner, who MacGyvers a stepped solution with some books (dude owns books, so he must be smart), echoing Wonga’s new three-month flexi loan. It’s nonsense but at least there’s a subtext of truth. For what is a transparent exercise ball if not a symbol of false freedom? And if you miss a repayment at 1,261% APR, you better believe you’ll be running on an endless hamster wheel in an attempt to scramble out of the red.
