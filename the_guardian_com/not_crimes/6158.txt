I was born two months premature with jaundice, twisted legs and a hole in my heart. I was that small I used a face flannel as a nappy. Now, I’m 6ft 1in. We had no money, so my mum, Myra, dad, John (original name Tun Shing), sister, Oilen, and brother, Kwoklyn, lived in a static caravan on the outskirts of Leicester. I was a few months old when we moved into a council house.It was rare to see an Asian man and white woman together when my parents fell in love. They went through years of persecution and harassment. My father moved to England at 15. He was born in Sha Tau Kok, Hong Kong, and his parents came over to make a better life. Mum and Dad met in Southampton. He was working for his uncle’s takeaway; she was working in a florist. They eloped to Leicester and went through hell to be together – Mum’s family weren’t initially very accepting – but love conquered all.Our house has always been non-judgmental because of what my parents had to go through. It made us more accepting of everyone around us. It didn’t matter who you were or what you did for a job, if you were good people. If there was a prostitute seven doors down, that didn’t bother us because she was making a living.Growing up without much money made me more ambitious. We never worried about money – we had it or we didn’t. We always had the family restaurant, even though we had no cash, and my parents worked seven days a week. That work ethic has been instilled in all of us. We’re all workaholics.Mum and Dad didn’t teach us to have an independent streak. They didn’t want us to have independence, they wanted us to have the family unit. Mum would still have us living at home if she could. My brother lives opposite; my sister is four miles away. We still have contact every day.Working in the restaurant from a young age made my siblings and me brilliant communicators. We can talk to anyone about anything because we’re all waiters and we’ve got the chat. It made us closer as a family, but a little awkward socially. We didn’t need anybody else, we had each other. I describe our family as the Transformers. Separately, we can do our own thing, but the minute we start locking in, we become a force to be reckoned with. We become Optimus Prime.Food is the fourth child in our family. It’s the only passion my parents passed on to us. My father’s motto is “you live to eat” rather than eat to live. We didn’t have music, we didn’t go to the theatre or go on holiday. There was nothing recreational in their lives other than food. Life was one big deep fat fryer. We communicated through food. Everything was about food growing up – and it still is.My brother has always been my guardian. If I was in trouble or worried, I’d go to him and he’d sort it out. We shared a room and were brought up like twins, really, as there’s only a year between us. We’ve always been very close. I wanted to be my sister when I was a kid. She was hugely influential. I got my love of fashion from Oilen and seeing that incredible metamorphosis when she transformed herself from wearing school uniform into a goth. For a long time, I thought I was gay because she wanted me to be gay. She was going through her indie, liberal, finding-her-own-politics phase and thought: “If I’ve got a gay brother, that’s cool.” I was: “OK, I’ll be the gay brother.”Relationships are one area where I’ve struggled. My siblings and I have always thought: “How are we going to have what Mum and Dad have got?” It’s been a lot to live up to as it’s true love.I don’t think it’s just down to my parents or finding fame. I’ve always worked hard and found it difficult to find time for a relationship. I’ve never found a work/life balance. It’s the thing I fail at most. That, coupled with the most loving relationship in the world to look at constantly … it’s going to be tricky.• Gok’s Divas – a CD featuring his favourite arias from opera’s greatest stars – is released on Warner Classics
