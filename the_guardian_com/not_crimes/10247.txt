Key Tory MEPS – including the leader of the Conservative MEP group – are set to vote against tight new European carbon emissions targets supported by David Cameron, who had promised to "work on" his party in an attempt to win their backing.MEPs will vote today on whether the EU's target on emissions cuts should be increased from 20% by 2020 compared with 1990 levels, to a world-leading target of 30% by 2020.When the vote was originally scheduled to take place, on 23 June, a survey of Tory MEPs by the Guardian found that the leader of the Conservative party in the European parliament, Martin Callanan, was advising his colleagues to vote against the higher target, and several were planning to comply. Only one of those contacted in advance of the vote said she would definitely vote for the higher target.The revelation prompted a parliamentary question to the prime minister, who vowed that he would persuade the MEPs. But a follow-up survey by the Guardian and Friends of the Earth has found that the prime minister has failed to convince them to vote for lower carbon emissions.At least eight MEPs out of the grouping of 23 said they would vote against the measure, while most of the remainder did not respond to emails and calls. Only two MEPs said they would definitely vote in favour, and a handful were undecided.Several MEPs echoed Martin Callanan, who told the Guardian: "Conservative MEPs have always been sceptical of the EU unilaterally increasing its target to 30% without a worldwide agreement. I am in favour of increasing the EU target to 30%, or even higher, in the context of a global agreement where our competitor countries take similar action. Increasing our own targets while the rest of the world does nothing will have virtually no measurable effect on global emissions, because it will force large EU emitters to relocate to other countries outside the EU where they will continue to emit at a much lower cost.""We are also concerned that the higher carbon emission costs resulting from an increased target will feed through into energy price increases for domestic consumers," he said.Their decision was attacked by the party's Liberal Democrat coalition partners, and by green campaigners.Andy Atkins, executive director of Friends of the Earth, said: "As well as snubbing David Cameron, Tory MEPs are defying the latest scientific advice and playing fast and loose with our future. Preventing the necessary action on climate change also goes against EU economic interests – scores of Europe's leading companies back a 30% cut in emissions because it will create new jobs and business opportunities."David Cameron came to power with an intelligent approach to tackling climate change, but he must act fast to prevent his promise to lead the greenest government ever from unravelling. The prime minister must redouble his efforts to show his entire party the enormous benefits of building a cleaner, safer future," he added.Chris Davies, a Lib Dem MEP, said: "This vote will show the true colours of the Conservative delegation in the European Parliament. If Tory MEPs decide to vote against the 30% reduction target, they are not only seriously undermining the government's green agenda but also putting into question the prime minister's commitment to a low-carbon economy."The vote is likely to take place around midday, at the same time as the European Court of Justice will be presented with arguments on whether it is illegal for the EU to attempt to regulate emissions from airlines based overseas that fly into or out of EU member states. US airlines are vehemently opposed, and other countries such as China have indicated they are reluctant for their airlines to be forced to take part in emissions trading.On Tuesday, the court will hear arguments from the American Transport Association – representing US airlines – against the proposal to force all airlines operating within the EU to participate in its compulsory emissions trading scheme (ETS). Bringing airlines within the scope of carbon trading has been a key plank of the EU's environmental policy for several years.Keith Allott, head of climate change at WWF-UK, said: "The European Court of Justice needs to back the inclusion of all flights in the emissions trading scheme and the EU needs to stand firm against political pressure and industry lobbying that will take us back to square one. US officials have said that ETS plans to include aviation emissions are 'the wrong way to pursue the right objective' and they would prefer an international agreement instead. But efforts to strike such an agreement have moved with glacial slowness for more than a decade. The US is the world's biggest emitter of aviation greenhouse gases, and supporting the EU ETS would help it to reduce emissions and raise finance for developing countries to tackle climate change."
