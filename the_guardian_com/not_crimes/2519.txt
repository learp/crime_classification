We, the undersigned, are calling for a new approach to conservation, one that respects tribal peoples’ rights, for all of humanity.Tribal peoples are generally the best conservationists; they have managed their lands sustainably for many generations. Forcibly removing tribal peoples from their land usually results in environmental damage. Such removals are a violation of human rights and should be opposed by conservationists. The cheapest and quickest way to conserve areas of high biodiversity is to respect tribal peoples’ rights – studies show reduced deforestation and forest fire rates, and greater biodiversity, on tribal land. The world can no longer afford a conservation model that destroys tribal peoples: it damages human diversity as well as the environment.Eric Avebury, Noam Chomsky, Ben Goldsmith, Zac Goldsmith MP, Tony Juniper, George Monbiot, Jonathon Porritt, Ghillean Prance, Tim Smit, Davi Yanomami, John Sauven Greenpeace UK, Stephen Corry Survival International This has also been supported by the following indigenous organisations:ALDAW Network, Palawan (The Philippines), Associação Huni Kui da Terra Indígena Henê Bariá Namakiá – AHHBN (Brazil), Federação do Povo Huni Kui do Acre (FEPAHC) (Brazil), La Federación Nativa del Río Madre de Dios y Afluentes – FENAMAD (Peru), First Peoples of the Kalahari (Botswana), Hutukara (Brazil), La Communauté des Potiers du Rwanda – COPORWA (Rwanda), Noroeste de Rondônia e Sul do Amazonas – OPIARA (Brazil), Organização dos Povos Indigenas do Acre (Brazil), Organization of the Agta People of Casiguran – SAKBIBI (The Philippines), Programme d’Intégration et de Développement du peuple Pygmée au Kivu – (PIDP) (Democratic Republic of Congo), Taluk Soliga Abhivrudhi Sangha (India) and Zila Budakattu Girijana Abhivrudhi Sangha (India)
