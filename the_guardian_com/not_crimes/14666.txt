We have no idea what @AmericaFerrera and @EvaLongoria are saying #GoldenGlobes,” tweeted MTV Australia.Ella Cerón (@ellaceron)I would call you out on this @MTVAUSTRALIA but as I'm Latina, you might not understand what I'm typing here. pic.twitter.com/942hB7mVrWJanuary 11, 2016The tweet was quickly removed after it was denounced by other Twitter users for being “offensive” and “racist”. Others said the comment was in “poor taste”, particularly because during the presentation Ferrera and Longoria poked fun at the way Latina actors are regularly mistaken for one another. “Hi, I’m Eva Longoria, not Eva Mendes,” Longoria said.
