I love this combination – fresh omatoes work brilliantly with sweetly acidic berries at this time of year. Consider this more of a guide than a recipe, though – you should change it as the seasons change, and use the herbs you prefer. The dressing is wonderful with lots of salads and vegetables that are raw, roasted, steamed or grilled, so make a larger batch and use it liberally.Tomato and berry salad with breadcrumbs and herbsServes 4 as part of a sharing menu2 tbsp sherry or balsamic vinegar1 tbsp Japanese soy sauce4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 300g of very fresh ripe heirloom and seasonal tomatoes, sliced and cut into chunks200g of any of the following seasonal berries: raspberries, blackberries, gooseberries, redcurrants, blueberries, white currants, chopped or left whole depending on sizeFresh herbs: basil, dill, tarragon, parsley, chervil, chives and any herbs that you find still flowering, such as nasturtium, torn and chopped100g stale bread1 tbsp butterSalt and pepper to tasteTo make the dressing, combine the vinegar, soy sauce and oil and refrigerate.Pulse the bread in a food processor until you have some evenly sized pieces.
