The BBC is to bring back tech gameshow Robot Wars with “more innovative fighting machines”.The series, presented by Jeremy Clarkson and then Red Dwarf actor Craig Charles, is to make a comeback 13 years after it last aired with a six-part series on BBC2 later this year.“Robot Wars is an absolute TV classic and I’m thrilled to be updating it for the next generation of viewers,” said Kim Shillinglaw, controller of BBC2 and BBC4.“With new technological advances making for an even more exciting and immersive experience, this is a fantastic example of the kind of content-rich factual entertainment that BBC2 excels at.”The BBC promises the new-look Robot Wars, which last aired in 2003, will feature a “raft of technological advances and more innovative fighting machines” that will battle it out in a purpose-built fighting arena in Glasgow.“The redeveloped Robot Wars proved compelling, offering a mix of real people, real passion and raw power,” said Alan Tyler, BBC acting controller of entertainment commissioning. “It is remarkable to see how much more powerful these robots have become since the series last aired, with battles now staged in an arena that is literally bullet proof. And yet, the show is still fundamentally driven by the eccentricity of the brilliant brains behind the machines.”The show had its heyday on BBC2 from 1998 to 2001. It was then moved to BBC Choice, a forerunner of BBC3, before finally fizzling out on Channel 5 in 2003.The BBC has not yet finalised who the presenter, or presenters, of the new Robot Wars will be but it is thought it is unlikely that Charles will make a return.The BBC has commissioned Tinopolis-owned Mentorn Scotland, in association with SJP Media, to make the series.“Bringing back Robot Wars to our screens is hugely exciting,” said Chris Brogden, creative director for entertainment at Tinopolis. “Its return will see new and improved robots, with extraordinary innovation and power in these updated machines – it promises to be quite the competition.”
