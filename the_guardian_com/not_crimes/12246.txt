Shares in Areva – one of the companies at the heart of Britain’s planned nuclear renaissance – plunged 16% on Wednesday after the company warned it was suspending its financial targets for the next two years.The French engineering business, which is a shareholder and designer in the Hinkley Point C scheme in Somerset, blamed continuing delays to a flagship atomic power project in Finland, Olkiluoto 3, and a wider slowdown in nuclear work for its difficulties.It said it was facing “market conditions which remain unfavourable” and was conducting a strategic review.Industry analysts believe Areva, which is largely owned by the French state, may need to raise more money after reporting a series of financial losses in recent years.Luc Oursel, the chief executive, stepped down last month for health reasons while Areva has been badly hit by delays at new atomic power stations it has designed in France and Finland.Areva is working with fellow French business EDF to build the plant at Hinkley Point, but interest in nuclear work has declined since the Fukushima explosion in 2011.The Japanese accident encouraged countries such as Germany to abandon plans for new plants while the domestic market in France has also been hit by uncertainty. The government of François Hollande has made clear it wants to concentrate more heavily on renewable power in future.
