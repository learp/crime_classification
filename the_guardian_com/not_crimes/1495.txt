The Royal Ballet: Giselle, LondonPepita’s Giselle is the quintessential romantic classic, the story of a love affair that begins in the real world and continues beyond the grave. In its dual ballerina role of peasant girl and ghost, it also offers dancers one of the great challenges of the repertory. Performing the part in this revival are Marianela Nuñez, Lauren Cuthbertson and Akane Takada, among others, with Vadim Muntagirov as the lovesick but deceitful Count Albrecht. Peter Wright’s production is rightly acclaimed as one of the most theatrically nuanced on the ballet stage, its first act dramatised with rich, naturalistic detail and its second illuminated by a spectral beauty.Royal Opera House, WC2, to 15 AprBartabas & Andrés Marin: Golgota, LondonBartabas, the horse whisperer of dance, returns to London with his production Golgota, which he performs with the flamenco dancer Andrés Marín along with a cast of four horses and a donkey. In the production, Bartabas uses his remarkable equestrian art to explore the power of ritual – in a series of intricate tableaux, inspired by the paintings of 17th-century Spaniard Francisco de Zurbarán he recreates the religious rituals of Seville’s Holy Week. The accompanying music, performed live, is based on Gregorian motets, by the composer Tomás Luis de Victoria.Sadler’s Wells, EC1, Sat & Mon
