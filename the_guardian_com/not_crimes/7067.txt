The Promise – Sturgill SimpsonIt’s rare that I like a cover version more than the original. But maybe not so rare when I don’t like the original anyway, as is the case with The Promise. Sturgill Simpson owns this When in Rome song. The heartbreak in his voice is palpable and it gets me every time. Beautiful.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The Devil Named Music – Chris StapletonI’m sticking with the country theme. It’s difficult to pick one song from Stapleton’s brilliant Traveller album, so I picked the one that tells the story of my life.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The Phoenix – Fall Out BoyI am a sucker for a good hook, and this is a pure pop gem with a furious urgency. Undeniably catchy and just fucking good.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Cowboy Song – Thin Lizzy Phil Lynott was the Cormac McCarthy of hard rock. I have no idea what that means but it feels right. Listen to this song and read Blood Meridian.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Purgatory – Iron MaidenI have been a fan of Iron Maiden since 1980. I buy their albums, I buy their merchandise and now I get to go on Ed Force One and tour Mexico, Central and South America with them. Dreams do come true. Thank you heavy metal.
