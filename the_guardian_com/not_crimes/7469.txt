A novel about a “swashbuckling” tabloid journalist set in the wake of the phone-hacking trial, crowdfunded by names including Elisabeth Murdoch, is to be turned into a film by the makers of 24 Hour Party People and The Trip.The comedy thriller, Three in a Bed, is the fictionalised story of a tabloid news editor set days after the real-life 2014 phone-hacking trial of Rebekah Brooks and former News of the World editor Andy Coulson.It tells the fictionalised take of a news editor described as a “swashbuckling womaniser who takes on the baddies and wins” after uncovering a huge scoop.Given that the book focuses on the “shady world of the tabloids”, Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth is perhaps an unlikely backer.Three in Bed, by first-time author Andrew Croker, was originally picked up by crowd-funding publisher Unbound.Croker, son of former Football Association chief Ted Croker, raised £15,000 from backers including Murdoch, who is thought to have contributed a “fairly typical” level of small donation towards the cost of getting the book to market.“It’s set against the background of real events, particularly the unsavoury threesome that involved our politicians, the police and the press,” said Croker, who started TV sports channel British Satellite Broadcasting in the 1980s which later merged with Murdoch’s Sky. “It really is the first novel to explore the media world after the Leveson inquiry. Journalists are so used to seeing their profession being portrayed negatively in TV, films and books. I have so many friends working in journalism and I know how it really works. This shows all the flaws of the tabloid world but its good side, too. For once, the journalist is not the villain.”Other backers include former Arsenal defender Lee Dixon and David Dein, former vice-chairman at Arsenal and the FA.Backers do not get any any financial benefit, such as royalties, from backing a project.The book is now being distributed through Penguin Random House and has gone on sale this week. It is subtitled “the shady world of the tabloids, sex, spies and entrapment”, while ITN’s Mark Austin, who helped Croker research the book, is quoted on the cover saying it is “like a red-top version of State of Play”.Croker has now sold the film rights to the book to Andrew Eaton at Revolution Films, the company behind movies such as 24 Hour Party People, Formula One film Rush and Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s BBC2 series The Trip.“Selling the film rights before the book was launched was a massive buzz,” said Croker. “The word-of-mouth on the book already has been incredible and I have been thrilled with the reaction.”Croker’s career has also included running the football division of sports management agency IMG; working with Hawkeye, the ball-tracking technology used in sports including cricket; and founding of Perform, the global digital sports agency.
