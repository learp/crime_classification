I’ve been reading this little Sherlock Holmes book, How Watson Learned The Trick, where Watson tries to imitate Sherlock’s observational skills. (Whether he succeeded or not, you’ll have to read the book to find out…) I like to think of myself as pretty observant, but reading this book and thinking, Yeah, I could do this notice-everything thing, I realised we had people arrive at my house and I didn’t even hear them come in… Observational fail. That got me thinking: what else is so easy in books but damn near impossible in real life? Here’s my list:1) Finding True Love as a teenager – or, my arch nemesis, Insta-Love. In my experience, this does not happen.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Harry and Ginny kiss – high school sweethearts who go on to have kids... At least it wasn’t instalove.

I tend to think of my witty thing two hours later: not so helpful, or effective…  Ansel Elgort as Augustus Waters, King of Quips, in The Fault in Our Stars.3) Never going to the toilet, ever.Seriously, when did you last read a book where the character went to the toilet like a normal person? Precisely. It doesn’t happen.4) Shooting a bow and arrow, using a gun or having an epic swordfight (and surviving).I’ve read more than one book where someone just picks a weapon up and is an instant master. Based on my archery activities in school… not so easy. But that might be because I have no hand-eye coordination…      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1. AKA, the best archer since Robin Hood. BUT at least we know she did train for years, unlike some other characters we could mention...

Hello, demigods! Well, demigods and a satyr...Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. Photograph: Allstar/20 CENTURY FOX/Sportsphoto Ltd.7) Running around on secret missions and adventures without people thinking it suspicious. I mean, if the character has parents or guardians, they’re going to think that’s weird. If the character is alone, everyone else is going to think that’s weird. Suspiciousness either way, you see?  Alex Rider, teenage superspy and exam evader. Photograph: MGM/Everett/Rex8) Randomly running into hot people, who all happen to be attracted to you. This happens a lot in teen books. It has happened very little in my real life. Might just be me, might be that no one IRL is as perfect as book-boyfriends and girlfriends… Sigh.9) Flying. I’ve tried numerous times over my life, in numerous different ways, to fly. Jumping off the sofa over my dad’s head aged four, after watching Peter Pan. With a broom aged nine. Flapping my arms like wings aged 10. None have worked, alas. I’ll keep trying. I’m working on a Days Of Future Past Professor X wheelchair… I’ll keep you posted.

Don’t go teasing fate, my friends!11) Being a badass, going around testing authority, kicking butt and slaying demons. Well, this is untrue in so many ways. 1) Testing authority gets you grounded or suspended. 2) Kicking butt could get you arrested or seriously hurt. 3) Slaying demons – yeah, that wouldn’t end well either... Being a badass is so hard in the real world.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Shadowhunters = Badass.

It generally takes three books, but it’s inevitable, right? Well, people have tried in real life. It tends to lead to dictatorships or prison.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Peeta and Katniss say ‘Down with the Capitol!’ in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Photograph: Allstar/LIONSGATE/Sportsphoto Ltd.13) Falling in love with your best friend and them never suspecting a thing! Another common thing among YA books. Leads me to ask: if you spend all your time with them, how can they not see?!14) Thinking you’re plain and then finding a guy and realising you’re actually hot! So many things wrong… Most of all this: you’re all beautiful and shouldn’t rely upon a guy or girl’s approval to make you feel that way!  Mae Whitman stars in The Duff. Photograph: Guy D Alema15) Being ridiculously talented at numerous things. Ok, in books why are there so many people with such mad skills? Why so many amazing artists and musicians and fighters?! I know there are loads of people in the real world who are really talented, but if you’re a demon hunter or trying to survive in a medieval fantasy world, when would you have the time to learn to play the harp?!

Some are the coolest magical creatures (dragons, griffins, etc!). Some are just awesome pets (like so many of the animals in Michael Morpurgo’s books). But really, what’s a girl gotta do to get a dragon in this world?!       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Seriously - I want a dragon so much! Especially one like Toothless from How To Train Your Dragon 2 (2014). Photograph: c.20thC.Fox/Everett/REX17) Finding awesome adventures. People always find the coolest quests, goals or adventures in books. In real life, it’s a little harder... But, unlike a few things on this list, not impossible. Yay!
