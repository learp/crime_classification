A BBC presenter went into labour shortly after reading the news on live TV, and gave birth to a boy with a fellow newsreader by her side. Victoria Fritz, who presents the business news on BBC Breakfast, was not due to give birth until early December, but her waters broke on Tuesday after leaving the studio.When fellow presenter Sally Nugent discovered that Fritz’s husband was stuck on the motorway, she said she would stay with her at the hospital until he arrived. But because of heavy traffic on the M6, Fritz’s husband did not get there on time, and Nugent ended up being birthing partner for the arrival of the baby.A BBC spokeswoman said: “When Sally heard that she’d gone into labour she offered to be there until Victoria’s husband got there. But her husband never arrived so she found herself at the birth.” Fritz tweeted:Victoria Fritz (@VFritzNews)My heartfelt thanks to @sallynugent & St Mary's drs&midwives who helped me deliver my little boy yesterday. A @BBCBreakfast team effort! 👶🏼November 16, 2016Nugent wrote: sally nugent (@sallynugent)You won't believe what happened after work yesterday. Huge congrats to our very clever @VFritzNews 😘 https://t.co/PYs29p8CaJNovember 16, 2016On BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, newsreader Naga Munchetty explained why another presenter, Sean Farrington, was reading the business news. “There she was, you know, just presenting very happily, not an issue in the world. And then she decided to have a bit of an event later on,” Munchetty said. Co-presenter Dan Walker added: “Sally was reading our sport yesterday. Because Victoria’s partner was stuck on the M6, Sally was the birthing partner.” Walker also tweeted:Dan Walker (@mrdanwalker)Thank you for all your suggestions for baby names for @VFritzNews but I think Baby McBabyFace might not make the grade @BBCBreakfast 😂🐣November 16, 2016Other colleagues also tweeted their congratulations.
