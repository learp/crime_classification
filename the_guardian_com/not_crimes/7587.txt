What do you eat when you’re on a date with someone you really like? According to a study, done by researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark, women are more likely to eat low-calorie and healthy food while dining with someone they fancy. Conversely, a man will splash out on expensive food and drink to impress their date.We want to know what you think of this result. Do you think this is all a load of nonsense and people should eat what they want? Does it highlight sexist attitudes about women and men’s diets? Do you care what you eat on a date?
