Don’t put me back in the box!Aardman launched a successful crowdfunding campaign to bring back Morph three years ago, and he later appeared on a YouTube channel. Alas there is no sign that bumbling caretaker Mr Bennett will also be back.Lucy Murphy, head of kids’ content at Sky, said: “Having lots of great shows for kids has always really mattered to us.“Around a quarter of Sky households have children so we know how important it is we give them the very best kids entertainment.“That is why we are investing in exclusive new programming starting with family favourite Morph as well as developing future enhancements for the app including even more safety features, live channels and offline viewing.”Sky said Morph would appear exclusively on the Sky Kids app, aimed at preschoolers to nine-year-olds and featuring a range of shows from channels carried by Sky including CBeebies, Nick Jr, Boomerang and Cartoon Network.It will include a sleep mode setting that gives parents the ability to limit viewing time. Alix Wiseman, head of sales and acquisitions & executive producer, Aardman, said: “Morph is very dear to our hearts and we hope that he and his mate Chas will entertain a brand new generation of viewers on this platform, as they have their loyal fan-base over the past four decades.”
