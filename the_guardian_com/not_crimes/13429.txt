Banks that wrote down £90m of debt on an investment in Anglian Windows have failed to agree a sale for the group.The Norfolk-based windows business has been on the market for more than a year, with a mooted price tag of up to £140m. Sources say several bids above £100m had been received but that the owners are in no hurry to sell.Parent company Anglian Home Improvements, which made pre-tax profits of £9.9m in the year to 27 March, is controlled by a consortium of banks, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and Bank of America. The banks took control in 2008 in a debt-for-equity swap after it hit trouble under private equity group Alchemy.The company has paid down debt in recent years after a restructuring led by current chief executive Peter Mottershead. Net debt is now £28m.It is unclear who the potential bidders were for the group but there was speculation that the current management would team up with private equity to finance a buyout.Private equity group HIG Capital, which owns rival windows manufacturer Synseal, was also thought to be a likely bidder.A third alternative was a bid from a utility. Centrica in particular has been interested in businesses that could profit from the government's Green Deal, which will provide incentives to make homes more energy-efficient.Bidders may have been put off by a lack of clarity on the Green Deal: the government is proposing to allow consumers to take out loans fixed on their properties rather than on them as individuals, and it is not yet clear how exactly the scheme will work. If it does result in extra financing for home improvements, companies such as Anglian could be beneficiaries.Anglian recorded sales of £210m in the year to 27 March. Anglian manufactures windows as well as selling them, employing 2,000 staff.KPMG was appointed to sell the business in September 2010.
