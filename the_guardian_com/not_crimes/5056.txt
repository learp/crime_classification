The backstage area of the Glory, a gay bar in east London, is full of female performers strategically placing socks in their Calvin Klein’s and using an abundance of “tit tape”. It is the final of Britain’s biggest drag king night, Man Up, and the culmination of a weekly contest – 15 acts have made it through, all women performing in drag to entertain the crowds. I have been invited to join the judging panel alongside a lineup of gay and straight magazine editors, journalists and performers.Drag queens have, of course, been on the mainstream’s radar for years, from Lily Savage in the 90s to the more recent RuPaul’s Drag Race. But it is fair to say that drag kings are some way off having their own show on ITV2.The Glory’s co-owner, drag queen Jonny Woo, tells me: “The acts … address gender politics.” For him, there is something more defiant about a woman strapping down her breasts, than a man slipping on a pair of heels. In a scene sometimes dominated by gay men, Woo has made it his mission “to do something for women. I wanted to find female performers.” And he has.What is happening at the Glory is a lot more sophisticated than bulges and designer boxers. As 25-year-old drag king Gusher, a lip-syncing spoof of R&B’s Usher, explains, after taking three hours to transform herself into character, the biggest appeal is the feeling of liberation. “My body doesn’t belong to me from now until I get off that stage,” she says, and for that moment her identity “belongs to the drag king movement”.

Contestants are being judged on their presence and look – not only how “manly” they are, but how they bring their character alive on stage, and comic timing is key. This is a cleverer, crop-top-free version of Girl Power and femininity is not at its core – by and large, these drags kings want to prove that gender, masculinity and other binary opposites are flimsy.Backstage, I stumble across Boyz, a group of girls who perform as a boyband. Band member Hattie, 26, is a drag king by night and a geography teacher by day. Perhaps the contrast is part of the appeal. As Hattie tells me: “I put down my books at the end of the day and I don my fake eyebrows. I feel like I walk around differently in my costume, with socks stuffed down my pants. I don’t want to be a man, but it’s fun to walk with a different swagger.” And Boyz are clearly having fun when they take to the stage later to perform covers of Westlife hits. Like songs, versions of perceived masculinity are often “covers” – male personas and stereotypes borrowed from different eras, recycled and repeated on stage. Yet each of the drag kings brings something original, teasing out their own versions of masculinity and blurring the lines of gender. From Manley Stanley, who brilliantly subverts extreme masculinity – so macho she ate raw steak on stage – to south London act Frankie Sinatra, who will only give away that she’s “younger than Madonna”, to the winner, Calvin Decline, who was crowned the King of all Drags Kings not just for being convincing in briefs but because the judges felt her performance, unlike the underwear ads she was spoofing, had real depth – satirising the world of fashion.Calvin is a Californian student whose win is all the more poignant in light of the attack at the Pulse Night Club. As she puts it: “Following the event in Orlando, I was a bit scared to get up and perform, [but] as an American, it felt affirming to make a statement.” The Glory is all about championing a stage for all.It is still a relatively niche scene, but across the country, more drag king nights are cropping up. Looking around the room at the largely female crowd of the Glory’s grand final, you cannot help but feel drag kings and their fans are moving in from the fringes.
