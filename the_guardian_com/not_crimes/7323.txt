The recipe Take 4 pieces of pork fillet, each about 75g in weight, and bat them out to with a rolling pin or cutlet bat. Break an egg into a shallow bowl, scatter 100g of crisp panko breadcrumbs into a thick layer on a plate and season them with salt and pepper.Halve 2 medium-sized leeks lengthways then cut each in half again and then into small dice. Melt 30g of butter with 2 tbsp of olive oil in a shallow pan, add the leeks and cook over a low heat for 5 minutes, stirring regularly until they have softened but not coloured.Chop a couple of gherkins into thick rounds then stir them into the softening leeks. Add 100ml of double cream, 1 tbsp of green peppercorns and 1 tbsp of the peppercorn brine. Taste and add salt (but no pepper) as you wish.Dip each of the pork steaks into the egg, then into the crumbs, pressing down firmly so the crumbs stick to the meat. Melt 25g of butter and 3 tbsp of olive oil in a shallow pan then lower the steaks into the hot pan. Let the steaks cook for 3 or 4 minutes until the crumbs have turned golden, then turn each one over and cook the other side.When the steaks are done, serve them with the leek and peppercorn sauce.The trickWhen cooking the crumbed steaks it is essential not to have to the heat too high, otherwise the crumbs will burn before the meat is cooked through. The olive oil should sizzle gently. As the leeks cook, keep the heat low and the pot stirred, to stop them colouring too much. They are best when pale and sweet.The twistUse batted-out chicken breasts instead of the pork. I also like to use lamb fillets, though you will need several slices each as they are considerably thinner than pork.Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
