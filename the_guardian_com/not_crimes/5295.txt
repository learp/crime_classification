Congratulations to John Bercow, the Speaker, for his brave and principled refusal to provide the historic platform of Westminster Hall to a man who preaches racism and sexism, and who dismisses a fundamental principle of the US constitution, the rule of law (Trump unfit to address MPs, says Bercow, 7 February). In these troubled times, the courage to uphold democracy and individual liberty is of the first importance. John Bercow deserves our respect and support.Shirley WilliamsLiberal Democrat, House of Lords• Ned Newitt (Letters, 7 February) confuses the issue. There are two types of cartridge used to play LPs: moving coil (MC) and moving magnet (MM). The output of an MC is lower than an MM and therefore requires its own phono amplifier through which its signal is then fed to the main amplifier. The higher output from an MM cartridge can be fed direct to the phono input on the modern amplifier to which he refers. However, in both instances the deep bass line derives from the LP. Otherwise how could the reproducing equipment detect when it occurred?Doug SimpsonHarrogate, North Yorkshire• Eddie Jones (Sport, 6 February) feels that England (pop 53 million) should easily be able to beat Wales (pop 3 million). So those pesky All Blacks (pop 4 million) will present no problems then?Alan WoodleyNorthampton• John Barstow (Letters, 7 February) neglects to mention the inconvenience for trains exiting a proposed North Channel rail tunnel of the change of gauge from GB’s standard to the Irish 5ft 3in.Barry KorzeniewskiDewsbury, West Yorkshire• In response to John Barstow’s letter suggesting the building of a northern channel tunnel between Scotland and Northern Ireland, I have two words: Beaufort’s Dyke.Nick HearnBrighton• Following the discussion on the various properties of Weetabix (Letters, passim), I wonder if anyone has looked into its potential as a sustainable building material? My memory of toddlers fond of “Bix” for breakfast was that it took a hammer and chisel to get the stuff off the table if left until lunchtime.Lindsey PooleHaddenham, Buckinghamshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
