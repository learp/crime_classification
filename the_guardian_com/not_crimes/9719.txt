England's woodlands have had a rough time recently. At the beginning of last year, government plans to sell off the public forest estate were only abandoned after a public outcry. Around the same time, large numbers of trees were felled to prevent the spread of Phytophthora ramorum, more commonly known as sudden oak death. And in March this year, the Woodland Trust reported that a loophole in planning laws had already lead to the loss of 100 ancient forests over the past decade.Last month the Forestry Commission published its tree-planting statistics and they show that England is some way behind the rest of the UK, not to mention the rest of Europe, in expanding its woodland areas. It appears the government requires a plan for growth in the more traditional sense. {"dataSourceUrl":"//docs.google.com/a/guardian.co.uk/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AmpIHjG9WDaqdENnTUQtQzRaU3JXMVJkTEtlUXl1N3c&transpose=0&headers=1&range=A2%3AF39&gid=0&pub=1","options":{"vAxes":[{"useFormatFromData":true,"title":"Trees planted ('000s hectares)","viewWindowMode":"pretty","viewWindow":{}},{"useFormatFromData":true,"viewWindowMode":"pretty","viewWindow":{}}],"series":{"0":{"color":"#a4c2f4","areaOpacity":"0.1"},"1":{"color":"#b6d7a8","areaOpacity":"0.1"},"2":{"color":"#ffe599","areaOpacity":"0.1"},"3":{"color":"#f9cb9c","areaOpacity":"0.1"},"4":{"color":"#dd7e6b","areaOpacity":"0.1"}},"booleanRole":"certainty","curveType":"","title":"Woodland creation in the UK","animation":{"duration":0},"lineWidth":2,"useFirstColumnAsDomain":true,"hAxis":{"useFormatFromData":true,"title":"Year","minValue":1976,"viewWindowMode":"explicit","gridlines":{"count":"6"},"viewWindow":{"min":1976,"max":2012},"maxValue":2012},"width":460,"height":371},"state":{},"chartType":"LineChart","chartName":"Chart 1"} England is lagging behind with its woodland creation strategy, with a steady decline in the number of trees planted dating back to the 1970s. Scotland and Wales have shown a significant commitment to expanding their existing wooded areas, with increases on 2010 planting figures of 233% and 250% respectively. Over the same period, England has planted just 13% more trees than it did two years ago.The decline in the planting of new trees over the last 30 years has been partly attributed to a change in policy from the Forestry Commission, the body responsible for the UK's woodlands. A spokesperson from the commission saidthere has been "a change in focus that looked at improving what we've already got, rather than adding more".The Forestry Commission says that the drop in woodland creation (not woodland area) in the 1970s is most likely explained by the reduction of land purchasing and planting. The increase from the 1980s shows the beginning of the farm woodland premium grant scheme and the decline in the early 2000s reflects the emphasis on improving existing woodlands rather than creating new ones, it said.As part of the Queen's jubilee celebrations, the Woodland Trust launched a challenge to plant 6m trees by the end of this year.Hilary Allison, policy director at the trust, said:"These figures just aren't good enough â€“ they are far lower than what's needed to achieve the benefits the natural environment can offer in terms of both ecosystem function and the economy. We hope to see the forestry panel [an independent forestry panel to advise ministers on England's woodlands] make clear recommendations around woodland creation in its final report and we continue to call on government to set clear targets as part of an overall expansion of woodland in England. We need to be planting 10,000ha a year in England. It's vital we plant now in preparation for the changes ahead."The slow rate of planting also has knock-on effects beyond the local value of woods, as the government's climate advisers noted last week."Projections from the Department for Energy and Climate Change and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology suggest that this sector will turn from being a net carbon sink to a carbon source from around 2012. This is largely a result of the sharp decline in tree planting rates from the late 1980s onwards following large-scale afforestation schemes in the previous three decades, which is reducing the strength of the forest carbon sink."The independent panel on forestry's final report, commissioned by the government after it changed its mind about plans to sell-off the forests, is due to be published on Wednesday. It will address the government's policies towards increasing woodland by examining tree-planting rates, types of trees to be planted and the use of instruments, such as carbon markets, to support increased planting. The key question will be whether England can match its neighbours in terms of woodland creation, maintenance and protection.
