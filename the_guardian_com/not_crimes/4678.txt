Next time you see the doctor for a checkup, there’s a chance you could come away with a prescription for reading. A new project has been launched across the country encouraging GPs to prescribe certain books to teenagers suffering from mental health issues.We need to talk about mental health without shame The new Reading Well for Young People campaign is aimed at 13-18 year olds, and GPs, counsellors and school nurses will all be able to recommend books from a pretty comprehensive list of both fiction and non-fiction titles (35 in all), which were selected with the help of a group of six young volunteers.With stress from school, friends, family and social networks all becoming part of everyday life for many teens, there’s been a massive increase in teenagers suffering from mental health problems over recent years. The Reading Agency, who launched this new campaign, estimate that one in 10 teenagers now suffer from mental illness. Alongside this increase, there have been growing worries that teens just aren’t getting the help that they need.While settling down and losing yourself in a good book can feel like a necessary escape for lots of us, this new scheme suggests that reading about certain things can actually help us deal with the world. Many of the books on the list explore topics such as depression and anxiety, as well as friendship struggles, bullying and identity. But crucially, they’re all written for teens. It’s hoped that reading these books could help provide support to those struggling with mental health issues. You can see the complete list of fiction books on the list below.

These books were quite realistic and delved into the depths of the person’s mind, making you understand and empathise with them more. They also have a bittersweet and hopeful ‘aftertaste’ which I believe relates more to me as a reader and does portray a positive message which is always good.Using books as a means for escapism also; I like to look at fantasy books such as The Throne of Glass, Harry Potter, Mortal Instruments, Percy Jackson, the Grisha trilogy and The Hunger Games.
