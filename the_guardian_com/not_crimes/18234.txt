The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with Terry Francis: The Answer   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I generally don’t plan my sets, but lately I’ve been opening with this. I wrote it as a thank-you to Fabric for the last 17 years; in a way, it’s my ode to the club.The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor Fabio Giannelli: Maintain   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest If I’m playing more of a house set, this is one I’m always drawn to. Punchy snares, rolling piano keys and addictive vocals bring a summery vibe wherever you’re playing.The track that got me out of bed this morning Mike Mower: Bargain Hunt theme   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Me and my mate Wendy have always talked about going on the show. It would be fun, plus you only have to make a tenner to win. The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding Black Lace: Hokey Cokey    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Just a classic knees-up tune perfect for a Saturday night; it takes me back to nights at Leatherhead working men’s club with my family as a young lad.The best track by my favourite new artist Oskar Szafraniec: K Hole    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’ve been buying a lot of stuff by this guy lately; only last year he put out an EP with Ricardo Villalobos. This is deep, trippy stuff for real heads-down moments.The ideal festival track Hardfloor: Acperience 1    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Something I’ve noticed is how much of a resurgence acid house seems to be having. It’s great for those crazy moments; I think this would go down well.The track I’d play at sunset in Ibiza Keni Burke: Risin’ To The Top    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I spent some of this summer in Ibiza, although didn’t play any sunset sets. If I had done, I’d probably have picked some old soul stuff, because I’m a bit of an old soul boy at heart.The track I’d play at my funeral Derek And Clive: At The Races   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Whatever I played, I’d include a song sheet so everyone could sing along. I actually named my cats Derek and Clive so this would be appropriate.Terry Francis plays Fabric’s #saveourculture1 at Great Suffolk Street Warehouse, SE1, 15 October
