2.12pm BST14:12That's all for today!Thanks everyone! Until next time. Remember, you can see Beverley on tour this spring in the UK.  Guardian contributor BeverleyKnight 21 April 2016 2:07pmI've just finished my tea, so that means I need another one. I may even have a cheeky biscuit with it - Malted Milk of course. So thank you so much for having a lovely chat with me. And I'll see you all on the road soon. And look out for that album announcement...Updatedat 4.36pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.11pm BST14:11'Marriage has just made me more passionate about people being as happy as I am'David Chick asks:Do you think marriage has changed how you write music?

What would you save?  Guardian contributor BeverleyKnight 21 April 2016 2:05pmThat is the hardest question in the world, and it's also brilliant, and my brain is going to hurt for the rest of the day now. My favourite song of all time is Sam Cooke's A Change is Gonna Come. But it would be a travesty if the world never heard Bitches Brew by Miles Davis.Updatedat 2.09pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.08pm BST14:08KatieMB asks:What do you prefer, touring your own songs and albums or appearing in West End shows? What is next for you after this tour?  Guardian contributor BeverleyKnight 21 April 2016 2:04pmWhat is next? After I finish the tour, and the forthcoming album, I roll straight into rehearsals for The Bodyguard in July, but before any of that, look out for me singing a little number at the Queen's 90th birthday celebrations. I'm not very busy at all.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.07pm BST14:07ungainlyBLOBBER asks:Do you think you would have similar career success if you were starting out at 21 in 2016 rather than the mid 90’s?  Guardian contributor BeverleyKnight 21 April 2016 2:02pmThat is a really interesting question. And I think as challenging as it was, to be a black female R&B/soul singer, in a Britain that was celebrating all things Britpop - I came out in the middle of that! - at least back then I had a chance to develop my craft as an artist. New artists, to me, don't have the luxury of time to develop any more. You need to be a hit now. Oh, you're not? Bye! Prince only became the superstar that he is today at album number six, which was Purple Rain.

Guardian contributor BeverleyKnight 21 April 2016 2:00pmThe out brigade has some "interesting" characters, dare I say dubious.

How is the album shaping up? Do we have any idea of release dates and whether we will hear anything from it on the tour?!  Guardian contributor BeverleyKnight 21 April 2016 1:59pmThe album is sounding bloody brilliant, if I may say so myself. I am so proud of this record, and hold tight for a big announcement about release dates and titles... you will absolutely get a sneaky preview of songs when I'm on the road.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.59pm BST13:59Amer Hussain asks:Hi - I have a 13 year old daughter (dreamer) who loves to sing – should I encourage or discourage her? In my opinion she’s ok but not superstar material...  Guardian contributor BeverleyKnight 21 April 2016 1:57pmAbsolutely encourage her to sing. It's not everybody's dream to be up front, centre stage, but singing gives so much joy to yourself and if you're decent to everybody else! Let her do it because she loves it, and it makes her happy.Updatedat 1.59pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.58pm BST13:58Tanveer Bassan asks:What would you have done differently in your career if you had the chance to go through your life again?  Guardian contributor BeverleyKnight 21 April 2016 1:56pmI am happy at how my career has gone. When I look back, even the things that seemed tough at the time, I now realise just were a steep learning curve. A couple of deals, and business decisions I made were perhaps not the best, but that means now I pay attention to any kind of business proposal that's put in front of me.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.56pm BST13:56ID1519791 asks:What’s you perfect Sunday?  Guardian contributor BeverleyKnight 21 April 2016 1:55pmI love when I have time to go home to Wolverhampton, all the family piles round Mum's house for a proper full-on West Indian Sunday dinner, and then Mum makes trifle at the end, but swaps out the cold custard for butterscotch Angel Delight. I love watching films on a Sunday - a good Sunday film would be something like Evan Almighty, because my Mum can watch too. Once Mum's gone to bed then the real film-watching can begin - something like Kill Bill or American Psycho. Fabulous!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.55pm BST13:55GoodbyeEurope asks:Marmite yay or nay?

You never know... one day that duet might just happen.

If you could choose any renowned songwriter to pen a song for you,who would it be? Love your voice, strong,sweet and soulful. Looking forward to seeing you live soon.  Guardian contributor BeverleyKnight 21 April 2016 1:49pmPrince, Sam Cooke, Aretha, Chaka Khan. I grew up with these guys plus a whole army of others. My ear would always lend itself to anyone who had a great voice. And there are so many elements of varied vocalists who made their way into my own vocal style - for example, as a child, I always wanted to be able to sing high notes in full voice, and not falsetto voice, the way that Chaka Khan always does. So I practised and practised until I could do just that.Songwriters, I'd love Carole King to write something just for me. She writes such powerful songs from a woman's point of view, but they always capture everyday experiences in everyday language.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
