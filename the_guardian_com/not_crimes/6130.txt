North DevonI wonder if there were really as many vipers or adders, to give them their Anglo-Saxon name, in this area fifty years ago as one is led to believe? In several years of systematic walks on Exmoor and around the North Devon coast I have come across only a few; two of these were on the moor. An Exmoor shepherd tells me that the last time he saw one was 18 months ago, but other people who know the moor well state that they have never seen any there. However, two young people have been bitten by adders in North Devon this summer; last year an acquaintance was bitten when he had the misfortune to pick one up in a bale of hay. Adders make off, if they can, when they sense the approach of a human, but may feign sleep. They are indeed well camouflaged and may be overlooked in vegetation. The Exmoor adders for instance had bold black markings on a light background tinged beautifully, with green; both were discovered among grass and tangled stems of bracken and heather. When one of these specimens which I wanted to photograph was coaxed into the open it became very angry, hissing, and striking the air each time the shutter clicked; I was trying to obtain a view of the vertical, rather than horizontal, pupil which is one of their distinguishing characteristics, but it was anxious to retreat to the privacy of the undergrowth. There are incidentally no adders or other reptiles on Lundy.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Guardian, 3 September 1964
