The Outrun, Amy Liptrot’s account of reconnecting with nature in her native Orkney after leaving a troubled life in London, has won this year’s Wainwright for the best UK nature and travel writing.The Outrun saw off five other acclaimed examples of the boom genre including Common Ground by Rob Cowen, The Fish Ladder by Katharine Norbury, A Shepherd’s Life by James Rebanks, Landmarks by Robert Macfarlane and The Moth Snowstorm by Michael McCarthy.'In stressed times, we can take comfort in wildlife': why nature-writing is 'exploding' Liptrot wrote The Outrun over two winters in Papa Westray, the most north-westerly Orkney island, which is home to just 70 people. Documenting her retreat from London, where a series of traumatic events saw her enter rehab for alcoholism, Liptrot reflects on place and identity, eventually writing a column for blog Caught By the River. This writing developed into the winning book, which was also shortlisted for the Wellcome book prize in April.Reflecting on the process in the Observer, Liptrot wrote: “Writing a book is a sustained process of holding your nerve. For me it was also a transformative process – as the chapters grew, so did my confidence in my new lifestyle.”In his review for the Guardian, Will Self said Liptrot “writes extremely well about this voyage into the Stygian, obsessive-compulsive depths – she has a sharp eye for social detail, and is ruthless in dissecting her own pathology”. Liptrot, who was unanimously chosen by the Wainwright judges, was presented with the £5,000 award at a ceremony at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire on Friday afternoon. Liptrot told the Guardian she felt “proud, pleased and very bewildered to have won” and said she had celebrated by going for a wild swim in Oxfordshire’s River Evenlode.Why Amy Liptrot deserved to win the Wainwright prize – a judge’s view Chair of the judges, Dame Fiona Reynolds, called The Outrun “brave and searingly honest”.“Profoundly contrasting London’s underbelly and Orkney’s wild, windy and remote harshness, Amy discovers herself and her route to freedom through nature, including through its harshness, grit and honesty. She writes bravely, unsettlingly and with a self-revelatory exposure that can shock; but she also writes beautifully. Amy’s is an unforgettable voice: she did not seek nature but nature sought her, and her spare, lyrical prose is both powerful and tender,” Reynolds said.Now in its third year, the Wainwright prize is named after renowned nature writer Alfred Wainwright. The previous winners were Meadowland by John Lewis-Stempel and The Green Road into Trees by Hugh Thomson.
