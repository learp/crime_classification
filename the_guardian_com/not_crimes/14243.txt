Get Out producer Jason Blum is teaming up with acclaimed writer-director Dee Rees for a horror film about black lesbians in rural America.Get Out: the film that dares to reveal the horror of liberal racism in America In an interview with the New York Times, Blum revealed that the pair will be working together on the as-yet-untitled movie based on Rees’s own experiences. Blum met Rees, who scored a major success at this year’s Sundance film festival with Mudbound, at an event in March, and she pitched him an idea about a small-town scary movie based in one location.“You’ve got me and my wife, two black lesbians, and when we first moved in, we fought every day over all these little things: ‘Why is this over there? Did you move that?’” she said to him. “Maybe it was a ghost. Or maybe it was some other force – like us not wanting to be there or fitting in.”They met again days later, and Rees is now working on a script about “the domestic lives of black lesbians in rural America” much to her surprise. “I can’t tell you how rare it is that people mean what they say in this business,” she said. “He’s just letting me make the best possible version of what I want to make.”Rees’ period drama Mudbound, a follow-up to her HBO biopic Bessie and breakout 2011 film Pariah, was sold to Netflix for $12.5m after stellar reviews at Sundance. It tells the story of two families, one white and one black, living in rural Mississippi and stars Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige.Racially charged horror movie Get Out, about a black man uncovering a nefarious plot at his white girlfriend’s family home, has become one of the year’s surprise success stories, making $204m worldwide from a $4.5m budget and, along with Mudbound, is stirring early Oscar talk.Blum has also seen success this year with M Night Shyamalan-directed thriller Split and is known for horror franchises Paranormal Activity, Insidious and The Purge.
