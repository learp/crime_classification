Someone claiming to be from TalkTalk just rang me out of the blue, to tell me there was something wrong with my router. He had rung a couple of weeks ago, telling me to unplug or turn off this, that and the other, but I was busy and couldn’t be fagged, so I rang off.Anyway, who was this fellow, ringing and bossing me about? Was he a scammer? We’re forever being warned against cold calls from trick banks and rogues wanting money. Perhaps this was just another scoundrel preying on a weedy old lady.

Turn it on.”“I don’t have time for this now. Anyway, my computer is fine. I just mended it myself,” I tell him, sharp as a tack and defying elderly stereotypes. “I would like a phone number, please, on which I can call you when I need help.”“You mended it?” said he, sounding even more ratty. “Are you a technician?”No, I am not, but I had remembered something about those filter thingumebobs that you’re meant to have on each telephone extension, noticed one was missing, unplugged the guilty extension, bought myself a new mouse, and ta-dah!

Hacking devices are getting into your internal parts.” Again I begged for his number, but he slammed the phone down. Then guess what? I managed to get through to a real-life person at TalkTalk, who told me that this was a scam – so watch out, everyone – and that she would email me within minutes, explaining how to block it. I’m still waiting for her email. Waiting and waiting …
