Children of Zeus – Still Standing This is one of my favourite records this year; amazing authentic soul music. When I first heard it, I thought I was listening to old Maxwell or Musiq Soulchild from the mid 90s. Children of Zeus are Manchester duo Tyler Daley and Konny Kon and are most definitely ones to watch.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Dimension – AutomatikDimenson has had a whirlwind couple of years writing some of the biggest drum’n’bass tunes and travelling all over the world. We’re fortunate to have him signed to our label MTA and our sets are always packed with Dimension records. Automatik has been lighting it up on the floor from London to Ibiza.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Chase and Status – Spoken WordThis is our latest single featuring George the Poet and samples the 90s Rozalla classic Everybody’s Free. We’re big fans of George and that era of music and wanted to combine his poetry with the euphoria we fell in love with back then. When we got together in the studio, it felt really effortless, and after he recorded his verses we knew we had something special on our hands.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Frisco – Them Man ThereFrisco is, hands down, one of the best MCs out there and he’s been putting in the hard work for years. Taken from his System Killer LP, Them Man There, produced by Swindle, this track has a catchy hook and razor-sharp flows throughout. I expect nothing less from Big Fris.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Ini Kamozi – World a Music Such a timeless classic, which was heavily sampled by Damian Marley for Welcome to Jamock in the early noughties. We couldn’t have a Rhythm and Waves-themed playlist without including the reggae royalty that is Ini Kamozi. A day doesn’t go by where I don’t listen to this. The beat and bass and vocals are infectious and will always be a firm favourite.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Chase and Status perform at Rhythm and Waves in Ibiza on 21 July.
