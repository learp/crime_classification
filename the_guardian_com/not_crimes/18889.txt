Casey Affleck has won the Oscar for best actor for his role as a grief-stricken janitor in Manchester by the Sea. Affleck had been the strong favourite for the award, and duly carried off the statuette, despite the reemergence of sexual misconduct allegations from 2010.Affleck’s performance in Manchester by the Sea, opposite Michelle Williams and directed by Kenneth Lonergan, has been widely acclaimed, and he has already won a string of major awards, including the Golden Globe for best actor (drama) and the Bafta for best actor.This is Affleck’s first Oscar win, after being nominated for best supporting actor in 2008 for The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He defeated a strong lineup, including Denzel Washington for Fences and Ryan Gosling for La La Land.Affleck had won admiration for his self-deprecating appearances on the awards circuit this year, reading out past negative reviews and telling the New York Critics Circle: “There’s never really been anything so horrible said about me that I haven’t either thought of or said to myself”. However, his campaign was nearly derailed by reporting of allegations of sexual misconduct made by two female crew members on his 2010 mockumentary I’m Still Here, starring Joaquin Phoenix. Both claims were settled out of court.
