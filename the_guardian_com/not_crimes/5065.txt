The Church of Scotland’s highest law-making body has voted to allow its ministers to be in same-sex marriages.The church’s general assembly, which opened in Edinburgh on Saturday, voted in favour of extending a law passed last May that permits ministers to be in same-sex civil partnerships.Scottish churches push forward on gay rights The decision, after years of deliberation, means the church maintains the traditional view marriage as between a man and woman, but allows individual congregations to “opt out” if they wish to appoint a minister or deacon in a same-sex marriage or civil partnership.Any wider consideration of the theological understanding of same-sex marriage will not take place until the Theological Forum presents its report to the church next year.More than 850 commissioners from across Scotland, the rest of the UK, Africa, Asia, North America, Europe, the Middle East and the Caribbean registered to attend this year’s assembly, which began with a ceremony at the Assembly Hall attended by Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon.

He was replaced by the Rev Dr Russell Barr, the founder of the Edinburgh-based homelessness charity Fresh Start.Morrison said he felt a “sense of gratitude, relief and heartfelt appreciation” as he left the post, while Barr said his predecessor was a “great ambassador for the Church of Scotland”.A letter from the Queen, highlighting the church’s efforts in the refugee crisis, was read aloud as the assembly got under way. She wrote: “At a time of such upheaval and unrest across the world, it is reassuring to hear that the Church of Scotland has made a particular priority of working to develop a coordinated response to the issues affecting refugees and asylum seekers.“This international crisis requires a compassionate and generous response and we are pleased that in keeping with your priority to serve the poorest and most vulnerable, you are making such a valuable contribution.”The Queen also acknowledged the church’s contribution to the United Nations climate change conference in Paris last year.
