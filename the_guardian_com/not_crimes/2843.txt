Three Tesla Motors employees were injured when a casting press containing hot aluminium failed at its San Francisco Bay area factory, officials said.One employee was seriously hurt and two other sustained minor injuries when the low-pressure machine spilled hot metal shortly before noon on Wednesday, said Greg Siggins, a spokesman for the California Occupational Safety and Health Adminstration (OSHA)."Hot metal somehow burned the workers," said Siggins, who added there had been no fire inside the plant.The most seriously injured worker received chest and upper-body burns, OSHA spokesman Peter Melton said. The three workers were taken to hospital with second-degree burns, Siggins said.The high-profile Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who also runs the private SpaceX consortium building spacecraft, said in an email that he would visit the workers and "personally ensure that they receive the best possible care".The incident was being treated as an industrial accident, Siggins said. "We will be talking to any witnesses, reviewing training documents and manuals to see if they are in accordance with specifications as part of finding out what happened," Siggins said.Tesla Motors, which is headquartered in Palo Alto, makes its all-electric Model S sedan at the Fremont factory. Tesla took ownership four years ago of the plant formerly jointly owned by General Motors and Toyota.Wednesday's accident follows recent Tesla car fires in Washington state, Tennessee and Mexico. Two Model S sedans caught fire after hitting a metal object in the road and a third caught fire after a high-speed chase. None of the drivers were injured.Musk said on Tuesday that there were no plans for a recall and described the Model S as one of the safest cars on the road.
