Grayson Perry has picked up both best presenter and best arts programme prizes at the Royal Television Society awards in London for his latest Channel 4 show.“In your face, David Attenborough!” the artist joked as he came to the stage to collect his prize for Grayson Perry All Man. Speaking about the show, which saw him explore the modern view of masculinity, he said: “The conversations I had with people on the streets are really what we want to be talking about now and that’s why I feel like I’m doing the right thing.“Good television should have that water cooler effect of starting conversations – I have had taxi drivers talk to me about it and that’s lovely. It’s not my day job so I feel pretty good that I’ve just wandered unexpectedly into television and we’ve struck a nerve.“But I think it would alter my relationship with television if I went full time. I quite like being the artist who just rocks up in front of the camera, so I don’t get too up myself.”The awards were presented by Sandi Toksvig, who last week was announced as one of the new hosts of Great British Bake Off, alongside comedian Noel Fielding. The original planned host, Piers Morgan, pulled out last month after a campaign claiming his involvement would be “damaging” and “inappropriate”.Piers Morgan pulls out of hosting Royal Television Society awards Other big winners for the night were Ant and Dec who picked up the prize for best entertainment show for Saturday Night Takeaway.As the pair accepted the award, they said their dream guest would be Adele: “We’ve never quite made it work because of all her tours and albums and stuff, but we could have a lot of fun with her.“If you all put the pressure on from your end and we put the pressure on from our end, maybe we can make it happen.”The duo, who have won fans on shows they have presented across channels, said they would stay in the job for “as long as people are watching”.The soap and continuing drama award was claimed by Emmerdale, with its producer Iain MacLeod saying the show was finally receiving “the recognition it deserves”.BBC Three, which recently became an online only service, won the channel of the year award, and the creator of its cult hit comedy Fleabag, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, won the breakthrough award. Julie Walters, 67, picked up a lifetime achievement award recognising an acting career across film and television genres that has already spanned more than 40 years.

I always get excited at things like this, being surrounded by people I know, I’m like a Jack Russell dog.”A self-confessed fan of Bake Off, she told the Press Association that she was also looking forward to seeing what the new presenter set-up would bring: “I am so sad it has gone from the BBC, but I will definitely be watching the next series. I love Sandi and it will be very interesting to see how it transfers. It will just be a different experience from Mary Berry and maybe that will be good - who’s to say?” RTS AWARDS WINNERS • Best female actor: Sophie Okonedo – Undercover • Best male actor: Robbie Coltrane – National Treasure • Arts: Grayson Perry – All Man • Breakthrough: Phoebe Waller-Bridge – Fleabag • Children’s programme: CBeebies – A Midsummer Night’s Dream • Comedy performance: Asim Chaudhry – People Just Do Nothing • Daytime programme: Find it, Fix it, Flog it • Documentary series Exodus: Our Journey to Europe • Drama series: Happy Valley • Entertainment: Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway • Entertainment performance: Adam Hills, Alex Brooker and Josh Widdicombe – The Last Leg • History: The Aberfan Young Wives’ Club • Live Event – Stand Up to Cancer • Mini-Series: National Treasure – The Forge • Presenter: Grayson Perry – Grayson Perry All Man • Popular factual and features – Employable Me • Channel of the Year: BBC Three • Science and natural history: First Contact: Lost Tribe of the Amazon • Scripted comedy: People Just Do Nothing • Single documentary: The Murder of Sadie Hartley • Single drama: Murdered By My Father • Soap and continuing drama: Emmerdale • Sports presenter, Commentator or Pundit: Osi Umenyiora • Sports programme: Rio Paralympics Sunset • Best comedy writer: Phoebe Waller-Bridge - Fleabag • Best drama writer: Sally Wainwright - Happy Valley • Judges’ award: Sally Wainwright • Lifetime achievement award: Julie Walters
