This spit of land extending into the Moray Firth about 18 kilometres northeast of Inverness is one of the best places in Britain to see bottlenose dolphins without going to sea. They can regularly be seen breaching the waters here – particularly if there is a run of salmon on the making tide. Birdwatchers, photographers and onlookers of all ages gather by the Chanonry lighthouse to see the display.On my most recent visit, the dolphins were scything through the water with just their large fins showing. Experts say they can identify individuals by the variation in colour and markings, including nicks and clefts, on the fins, but, apart from one specimen with a large fin cleft, I doubt I would have been able to identify any of them again.Death of a dolphin The gannets are the other big wildlife attraction here. Their magnificent black-tipped white wings span up to two metres, making them Britain’s largest breeding seabird. On our visit, they were feeding far out to sea, with the adults soaring high, apparently teaching their young to fish. The juveniles, looking almost black from a distance, were flying much lower and diving after their elders, which hit the water at speed, sending up striking plumes of white spray. Though the adults seemed to be catching lots of fish, the juveniles obviously still had much to learn, with very few of them bringing up fish.Despite the attractions of the wildlife, the eye cannot avoid being drawn to Fort George on the east bank of the narrows near Ardersier. Dominant is the obvious word for this monumental 18th-century fortress – known in Gaelic as An Gearastan (“the garrison”) or Dún Deórsa – designed in 1746 to quell any further rebellion in the Highlands after the battle of Culloden. Named in honour of George II, it has never actually had to resist attack. Today it is the garrison of the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, and home to the Highlanders’ Museum, one of the largest regimental museums in Scotland.
