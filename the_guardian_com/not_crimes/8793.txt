Name RadfanFounder Roland GlancyCompany started February 2011Employees 2Based Newcastle upon TyneWhat's the big idea?The Radfan is a low-powered fan unit that fits on to the top of a conventional radiator and distributes the warm air horizontally across a room, instead of letting it rise to the ceiling.What does it do differently?Roland Glancy, the inventor and managing director, says it can raise room temperatures by 1C-2C without the need to turn up the heating. The fans plug into mains electricity, but he says each one costs only around 50p a year to run, so savings are substantial.How did it come about?Glancy says he came up with the idea because his wife was continuously complaining about being cold. "Even though the radiators were working, I realised the heat was not getting spread efficiently," he says.Back then, he was studying for an MSc in renewable energy: "The Radfan was just an academic project, I never assumed it was going to go anywhere."But having trained as an architect, Glancy struggled to find work in that field and so took another look at the Radfan idea. He started entering business plan competitions and won one at Newcastle University, where he met his business partner Simon Barker."Simon had a plan also based around radiators and central heating," Glancy says. "I was looking for a co-founder and we got on really well. We decided the Radfan was a more developed idea and went in together, all guns blazing."Glancy's family have supported his living costs while he developed the idea. He has repaid their faith by winning several startup awards, in particular a £20,000 business incubation prize from Santander.That earned them a £150,000 investment, before Christmas, from venture capital fund North East Angel Fund."I've been very lucky in that I haven't yet had to invest any of my savings," Glancy says.Who are their clients and how do they work with them?The product is still in development and testing. "We're only just beginning to approach retail and potential buyers," Glancy says.How is the business plan going – and where do they hope to be in a few years?Initially, Glancy and Barker hoped to have the Radfan on the market by last winter but now, he admits, they are preparing for an autumn 2012 launch."In a couple of years we'd like to be selling in B&Q, Wickes, Argos and so on," he says, "but, as a new product, you have to be careful about going to the big boys too soon, as they can be pretty sharkish. Our market entry strategy is more niche retailers, like eco-outlets and those for the elderly. We also hope to work with local housing associations to help solve the problems of those in fuel poverty."What's their piece of killer advice for new startups?"Give a business idea all of your time," Glancy says. "The best thing I did was agreeing with my family that they would support me for nine months."When you're pitching for investment, you don't need all the answers, as long as those you do have are compelling and you admit the things you don't know. There's nothing worse than trying to paper over cracks."Are you a recent startup with a big idea? Email work@theguardian.com
