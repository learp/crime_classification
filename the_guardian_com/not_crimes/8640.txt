Priti Patel, the international development secretary, demands better “value for money” and greater accountability and transparency in UK aid spending (Report, 26 October). It’s time to start applying these principles to the full extent of the UK’s role in global poverty. Whether through enabling tax-dodging, the actions of our corporations, or our contributions to climate change, the UK causes far more poverty in the world than its aid budget can ever compensate for.In 2013, over $1tn in illicit financial flows was stolen from poor countries; 55% of illicit flows are estimated to end up in rich countries, 45% in tax havens. With 10 tax havens under our jurisdiction, the UK is at the heart of this theft.Giving money to alleviate poverty, while at the same time enabling it, is not transparent, not accountable, and does not provide value for money. Aid is, at best, meagre compensation towards the damage caused. Transparency and accountability in aid spending is reasonable; it’s time we start applying these principles to the full extent of our relationship with the world.Martin DrewryDirector, Health Poverty Action • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
