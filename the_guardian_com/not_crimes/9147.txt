RIP Pappa ParfDecember 24, 2016The Surrey-born guitarist had been dogged by health concerns for years, most recently pulling out of the band’s tour after a heart attack over the summer. Parfitt’s manager, Simon Porter, said at the time that he had “died” for several minutes. Parfitt underwent a quadruple heart bypass in 1997. Doctors told Parfitt then that his lifestyle involving touring, drink and drugs could kill him. He cut down on his vices but vowed not to become a “born-again Christian” and continued to enjoy the “odd pint”.Status Quo found success globally with hits such as Rockin’ All Over The World and Whatever You Want. In 2015 the band passed a milestone enjoyed by only a handful of musicians: 500 weeks in the UK album charts. After news of Parfitt’s death, the band’s official website was updated to show a full-screen picture of him on stage.He joins a long list of celebrated musicians to have died in 2016, including David Bowie, Prince and Leonard Cohen.Other celebrities paid tribute to Parfitt on social media: Dr. Brian May (@DrBrianMay)Shocked and so sad to hear of the passing of Rick Parfitt.
