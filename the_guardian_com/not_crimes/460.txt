Our life experiences are now filed away in digital cabinets and the arrival of Snapchat’s new Memories feature isn’t doing any favours for analogue methods of memory-keeping.But we’re not ready to let go just yet. We want to see photos of your diaries, scrapbooks and family albums. We want to hear stories of how you and your loved ones have collected sentimental objects and documented moments that you wanted to hold on to. Send us your contributions and we’ll include highlights in a video about memories before social media. You can do this either by clicking on the contribute button or filling out the form below.
