An Indigenous elder who successfully took on the mining entrepreneur “Diamond” Joe Gutnick in the Queensland land court has wound up with a $70,000 legal debt he cannot repay.In a case that could have a chilling effect on future challenges to mines by traditional owners and others, the Kalkadoon elder James Taylor was denied legal costs despite winning a three-year battle for changes to Gutnick’s phosphate project near Mount Isa. Adani fails to force activists to pay $1m costs for Carmichael challenge The case turned on the same legal precedent that thwarted an attempt by the mining giant Adani to make conservationists pay an estimated $1m in what was widely considered a landmark costs ruling in favour of mining objectors.Both rulings were handed down last Wednesday by the land court president, Carmel MacDonald, who found the court did not have the power to award costs to either side in challenges to mining permits.That was in line with a supreme court ruling last year which Queensland’s Palaszczuk government then legislated to overcome but cabinet is yet to activate.Taylor’s lawyer, Colin Hardie, said his case showed how a law that protected some mining objectors hurt others who could least afford it. Taylor won changes to environmental conditions for the Mount Isa mine, owned by Gutnick’s company Legend, after raising concerns about the impact of a dam on ancestral lands including Battle Creek, where settlers massacred Kalkadoon people in 1884. If you’re a little fella battling a big company and you have to go and get your expert reports, you’ve got no chanceColin Hardie, lawyer “It will destroy the very country that by my ancestors I am obligated to protect,” Taylor said in an affidavit to the court. “It is an affront to my culture and my very being.”The changes won included Kalkadoon representation on a committee that could alert the environment department if Battle Creek showed signs of deteriorating water flows, a proposal Legend had initially resisted.Taylor told Guardian Australia he did not regret the “very important” legal action and hoped other traditional owners would be undeterred. “I’m not disappointed because we won,” he said. “We won, except for the legal costs.”Taylor, a labourer, admitted he was personally unable to cover the cost of more than $67,000 for expert reports by a hydrologist and ecologist, which were pivotal in the land court case. Hardie’s firm Just Us, which believed there was a reasonable prospect of recovering the cost of those reports until last week’s ruling, told Taylor it had written off the expense. But Hardie said future mining objectors who could not afford the reports needed to win their case would struggle to find law firms or experts willing to wear those costs on their behalf.“The green movement are lauding that decision against Adani as a big victory,” Hardie said. “They’ve said costs shouldn’t be awarded against objectors for trying to review environmental authorities and I agree.“But I think the disadvantages far outweigh the protections because it basically means if you’re a little fella battling a big company and you have to go and get your expert reports, you’ve got no chance because you can’t even say to the experts, ‘You produce this report and if we get a costs order, you’ll get paid.’“This means any little person that doesn’t have resources on their own is less likely to object – when they have a valid objection.“That’s most likely Aboriginal people because of their custodial role [of remote country]. I think they’re going to be particularly impacted because how are they going to continue to fight on?”It left the Environmental Defenders Office Queensland as virtually the only legal group able to cover those costs on litigants’ behalf, Hardie said.But the EDO, which ran the Adani land court challenge for conservation group Coast and Country, had limited resources and would likely be “swamped”, he said.Hardie contended that giving the land court power to award costs would not open the floodgates for rulings in the favour of cashed-up miners. Coalition to restrict green groups' right to challenge after Carmichael setback “I can understand [the EDO] being chuffed against Adani but I don’t think a costs order would have been a lay down misère,” he said. “In my view there’d have to be some flagrant disregard for the process and continually arguing something that isn’t arguable that you would get that sort of decision.”Hardie argued that the spectre of potential costs orders against them made “mining company bully boys more inclined to sit down and negotiate”.“My experience is mining companies generally have plenty of money and if they want to make life tough for you, they will make it tough, irrespective of whether they’ve got costs orders against them. Aboriginal people are not in that position.”In her ruling on Taylor’s costs application, MacDonald noted that the power to award costs in mining permit challenges could only be given to the land court by a change in court rules made by the governor on advice of the state cabinet, with the agreement of her and the chief justice.
