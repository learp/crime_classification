Faber have announced details of a new book by the KLF – otherwise known as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (the Jams) – described as a “utopian costume drama, set in the near future, written in the recent past”.There is little information regarding this mysterious trilogy, entitled 2023, but the publisher’s website includes lyrics from the Jams’ 1987 track All You Need Is Love by Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty: “Well we’re back again / They never kicked us out / twenty thousand years of / SHOUT SHOUT SHOUT,” it reads.The KLF are back (sort of) – and it’s exactly what 2017 needs A statement goes on to describe the dystopian narrative of their forthcoming book:“Down through the epochs and out across the continents, generation upon generation of the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu have told variants of the same story – an end of days story, a final chapter story. But with one hope, even if the hope at times seems forlorn.”Earlier this year, there was evidence to suggest the KLF were returning after a 23-year hiatus. Unfortunately for fans, a YouTube video featuring a collage of the duo’s previous videos was soon traced back to a project that was compiled for a 2015 book talk. Drummond also quashed hopes the band would be performing, rereleasing or writing new music, by saying: “Jimmy and I have always remained very close but we have no plans to reform the KLF or exploit our back catalogue in any way.”However, his statement caused confusion when a poster, which appears to herald the book, was spotted in Hackney, London shortly after. It said 23 August 2017 would be the date on which The Justified Ancient of Mu Mu would return, which matches the publishing date of the title on the Faber website.
