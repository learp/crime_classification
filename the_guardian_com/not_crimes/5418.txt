She’s collaborated with CocoRosie and appeared in a Jim Jarmusch film. But this Paris-based Lebanese artist’s unusual take on electronic pop is just starting to get noticed in the UK. The combination of Arabic dialect and hyper-modern beats and textures is a languid treat. Scala, N1, 15 MayFilm      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Highlight ...

Depending on which interview with Scott you read, this is either the first in a trilogy that will bookend with Alien, or the second in a series of six. Michael Fassbender returns, as a new crew of explorers, including Danny McBride and Katherine Waterston, offer themselves up as xenomorph aperitifs. Much better than its predecessor, if doing little original with the space-horror genre.Alien: Covenant is released in Australia on 11 May, the UK on 12 May and the US on 19 MayTheatreOur Ladies of Perpetual Succour“Raucously rude.” “Contains singing, hilarity, Sambuca and strong language.” It’s no wonder this play from the creator of Billy Elliot has already won awards and had a sold-out UK tour. The story of six Catholic choir girls let loose in Edinburgh for 24 hours transfers to the West End’s Duke Of York’s Theatre for an unholy four-month run: a chaotic coming-of-age tale to the songs of ELO. Duke Of York’s Theatre, WC2, to 2 SeptemberThe Addams FamilyThe long, strange trip that has been Les Dennis’s career takes another left turn. This time, he’s cast as Uncle Fester in this musical rendering of the family of proto-goth oddballs.
