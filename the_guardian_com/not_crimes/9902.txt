Frank Marshall, who produced 80s classics such as ET: The Extra-Terrestrial and Back to the Future, has reassured fans that neither film will be remade.Speaking to Yahoo Movies about the Back to the Future series, Marshall said: “We’re never touching those” after being asked if the time-travelling trilogy might fall victim to the new drive for reboots. “Yeah [we won’t reboot Back to the Future], as long as I have my say,” Marshall continued. “No, that one exists just like ET – we’re never touching those. I love watching it.”Not only is the Back to the Future franchise ring-fenced from reboots, it is also unlikely to have a belated follow-up, along the lines of Dune, Tron, and more recently, Zoolander, Bad Santa and Trainspotting. Speaking in 2014, screenwriter Bob Gale said he was absolutely opposed to the idea of a Back to the Future 4. “Let’s face it, we’ve seen a lot of sequels that are made years and years later and I don’t think I can name one that’s any good,” said Gale. “That lives up to the originals. I don’t think you can recapture it.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest
