Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.This week’s question: I booked five tickets for a gig, but now we can’t go. I might sell them on Seatwave or Viagogo (and only want back the money paid), but have heard bad things about the “secondary market”. Anyone any experience of it, or morally should I just steer clear?Do you have a problem readers could solve?
