A team of Western Australian researchers is trialling ways to make surfers look less like seals to reduce the risk of shark attack.Their work is based on the theory that sharks usually attack surfers because they are confused by the similarity in silhouettes between a human on a board and their favourite prey.Dr Nathan Hart, from the University of Western Australia’s Oceans Institute and school of animal biology, said it was accepted wisdom among surfers that sharks sometimes mistook them for seals, but there had been limited research to figure out why that might be the case and how to prevent cases of mistaken identity.To solve the problem researchers have been videoing and recording sound from seals swimming in tanks in Sydney’s Taronga zoo then comparing that to videos and sound recordings of swimmers and people paddling surfboards in the same tank.“What we are trying to do is understand what the shark is interested in and what their natural prey’s signals are, to see if there’s anything to this myth that they mistake surfers for prey,” Hart said.“If we find that the silhouette of a surfboard is an attractive thing, for a shark it thinks it’s a large seal lounging about on the surface, then perhaps by breaking up that silhouette by attaching lights to the bottom we can change that.”Hart said the team would test the theory next month by putting lights on the bottom of decoy seals used by tourism operators to encourage great white sharks to breach off the coast of South Africa. If it is correct, the decoy seals with lights attached will attract fewer breaching sharks than those without lights.That could mean that attaching lights to the bottom of a surfboard would have the same effect.It’s not the first shark deterrent Hart has worked on – with fellow UWA researcher Shaun Collin he has developed two anti-shark wetsuits, one designed to hide from them and the other to act as a warning the wearer is not like their natural prey. He said testing the effectiveness of shark deterrents in a natural habitat was difficult because you needed to attract sharks without encouraging them to associate human objects – such as a wetsuit or a surfboard – with food.“You just can’t go and stick a wetsuit in the ocean, fill it with tuna and see if a shark wants to eat it, because no one wants to teach a shark to attack wetsuits,” he said.The trial will take place in South Africa in May and June because Australia does not have a large enough population of great white sharks.Of the 14 fatal shark attacks in WA waters since 2000, five occurred while the victim was surfing or bodyboarding. Hart said in some cases the shark was just taking an investigative bite to see what was there – but from the point of view of a shark attack victim, the animals’ intentions did not matter much.“I think it’s fairly safe to say that if sharks wanted to attack people there would be a lot more shark attacks, just because of the number of sharks in the water,” he said. “Shark attacks are extremely rare given the number of sharks in the water and the number of people in the water, so there’s something else going on.”The research is funded by a $285,000 grant from the WA government as part of its $1.9m research package, introduced in 2012 alongside its now abandoned shark cull policy.Other grants include about $450,000 to investigate the effectiveness of shark deterrents that are already available, such as Shark Shields, and other “novel” non-lethal shark deterrents, such as bubble curtains and underwater strobe lights, which Hart is also involved in. The government is expected to receive reports on that research next month.No WA Shark Cull’s founder, Natalie Banks, welcomed the research, but said WA should be committing more funding to investing in existing non-lethal shark safety programs, such as plastic eco-shields, personal Shark Shields and Clever Buoys – which use sonar to detect sharks near beaches.“There needs to be a balance between putting money into finding solutions and solutions that are already on the market now,” Banks said.The fisheries minister, Ken Baston, said WA had committed $26m to investigate non-lethal shark deterrent and detection methods. “The Western Australian government recognises the importance for West Australians to understand the facts about sharks to continue to enjoy using WA’s amazing coastline,” he said.
