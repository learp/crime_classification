I wonder if the latest Brighton Argus online poll represents what really happened across the country.The paper asked its readers: did you do anything to celebrate the royal baby being born?Result: Yes, 4%. No, 91%. Don't know, 5% (how can you not know whether you did or didn't?)Let's hope Brighton residents, which includes me, say yes to cleaning up the city. The Argus has launched an anti-litter campaign because beaches are being strewn with litter by unthinking sunbathers.With record crowds expected again this weekend, the paper has teamed up with more than 20 businesses and the city council to organise what it calls "the big beach clean-up" on Monday, 29 July.The paper regards the seafront and beaches as Brighton's shop front, but too many visitors treat them like a dumping ground. Last weekend an estimated 50,000 tourists left 21 tonnes of rubbish behind them. Hence the Argus's "Take it home" campaign.There are both commercial and environmental reasons, says the Argus. "It is vital for businesses that the beach remains as pristine as possible. "But, more importantly, the survival of the fragile ecosystem depends on our unflagging efforts."
