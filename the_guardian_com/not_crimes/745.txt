1 New monkey species identified in Democratic Republic of CongoLesula found in remote forests is only the second new monkey species to be discovered in Africa in 28 years2 George Monbiot: The day the world went madAs record sea ice melt scarcely makes the news while the third runway grabs headlines, is there a form of reactive denial at work?3 Arctic expert predicts final collapse of sea ice within four yearsAs sea ice shrinks to record lows, Prof Peter Wadhams warns a 'global disaster' is now unfolding in northern latitudes4 World's biggest geoengineering experiment 'violates' UN rules  This illustration shows relatively high concentrations of chlorophyll (yellow to brown is high) in August 2012 where HSRC says they placed the nutrients. Other patches of high chlorophyll in the open waters can bee seen where HSRC was not operating. High chlorophyll indicates higher concentrations of phytoplankton. Careful and thorough research is required to determine what occurs naturally.

Brown: The world is closer to a food crisis than most people realiseUnless we move quickly to adopt new population, energy, and water policies, the goal of eradicating hunger will remain just that
