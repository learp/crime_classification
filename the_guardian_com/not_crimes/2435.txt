A giant pumpkin grown in Chelmsford could set a new record on Saturday when it is weighed at a festival in Southampton.The fruit was grown from the world’s most expensive pumpkin seed at RHS Garden Hyde Hall in Essex by gardener Matthew Oliver.The seed, taken from a pumpkin that weighed more than a tonne, was bought by Ipswich seed firm Thompson and Morgan for £1,250 at an auction earlier this year.Rob Brett (@HydeHallCurator)Giant pumpkin on the move #ukgiantpumpkin @RHSHydeHall. Well done Matt pic.twitter.com/wNtytY4TpvOctober 7, 2016The 2,323lb (1,054kg) pumpkin was grown in Switzerland two years ago and is the world’s heaviest, according to the Great Pumpkin Commonwealth.A real passion for pumpkins: competitive growers and carvers live for their craft Oliver was asked by Thompson and Morgan to grow the seed, which was planted in mid-April and took six days to come up. “I was getting worried. Six days is a long time,” he told the BBC. “It had to be repotted a couple of times because they are such vigorous growers.”The fruit, which has a circumference of about 4.5 metres (15ft), was loaded on to a truck and taken to Royal Victoria country park in Southampton on Friday.
