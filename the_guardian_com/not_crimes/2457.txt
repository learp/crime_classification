I have been a policeman for 25 years and a detective for 15. A few years ago, a friend of mine who practised mixed martial arts (MMA) asked if I wanted to do a couple of rounds with him, to help him prepare for an upcoming fight. He battered me. But in our conversation afterwards, he explained how he’d analysed me and picked out my weaknesses, and I realised just how much there was to this sport.MMA takes elements from a multitude of martial arts – from greco-roman wrestling through to judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Thai boxing and wrestling – and combines them to produce the purest form of combat sport there is. In a competitive bout, the winner is decided either by the judges’ decision at the end of three rounds of up to five minutes each; by knockout; or by tap-out, where you get your opponent in a position like a stranglehold until they tap the mat.For the uninitiated, MMA can look like two guys inside a cage – where contests typically take place – going hell for leather. In reality it’s a lot more chess-like. You always have to be thinking two or three moves ahead.You don’t have to compete. You can use classes as a way to learn self defence, or just to get fit. It’s physically exhausting. You can go to a Boxercise class and get sweaty, but the pads don’t hit back. When the person who you’re practising with is fighting back, it keeps you switched on, so you work harder. It’s invigorating.I was sparring in the gym the other day and someone landed a kick across the top of my head. I fell like a stone to the floor. The coach was rolling about laughing. When I asked him why, he pointed out that the guy who’d just hit me was on bail for assaulting a police officer. That’s the camaraderie. You’ve got men and women of every background, nationality and occupation in our gym, and there’s huge respect among everyone.My weekend workoutYears practising? Five.Any injuries? Black eyes, a few cracked ribs.Favourite recovery meal? Two bananas, yoghurt, milk and protein shake all whizzed up.Five ways to get started: MMA1 MMA is a combat sport, so it’s vital that you seek out a credible coach who will run sessions in a safe, structured way. Contact the UK MMA Federation (ukmmaf.org.uk) to find an affiliated gym near you.2 You’ll never be forced to compete or spar if you don’t want to, and there’s no shame in avoiding that side of the sport.3 MMA is not just for big burly men – it has become increasingly popular in recent years among women. MMA gyms are often typified by their inclusive, welcoming and social atmospheres.4 Counter-intuitively for a sport based around fighting, MMA training is great for injury prevention. Its combination of twisting and turning motions along with dynamic, explosive movements will improve aerobic fitness and all-round strength.5 Try not to eat within the two hours before a session. Even if you’re not sparring, classes involve short, sharp bursts of high intensity fitness training. If your body is still digesting, you’ll feel sick and won’t be able to make the most of your workout.Essential kit      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Adidas MMA gloves, £29.99,martialartshop.co.uk.
