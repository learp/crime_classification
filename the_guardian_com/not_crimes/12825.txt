A nationally treasured work by Romanian sculptor Constantin Brâncuşi has gone on display at the National Bank of Romania as part of a bid by the state to raise funds to buy it from a private owner.Wisdom of the Earth is a 50cm (20in) tall sculpture carved from limestone in a primitive modernist style. It depicts a female figure sitting with folded arms and her legs pulled up.Dating to 1907 or 1908, it is one of just a few Brâncuşi works remaining in his homeland. The government has pledged €5m (£4m) towards the €11m price, much lower than its estimated value of €15m-20m, and is seeking the rest from private contributions by 30 September.Government spokesman Dan Suciu said the campaign had raised €212,000 since March. “We have a long road ahead, but not all engines have been turned on,” he said. The government’s fundraising plans include a telethon on national television. People will also be able to donate by phone. Reflecting wariness about donating money, Adrian Tanachiu, 63, an antiques dealer, said he would not donate “because I don’t trust the government … too much money was stolen in this country”.Romanian actress Maia Morgenstern, who supports the campaign, said the fundraising effort was more than an economic endeavour. She said Brâncuşi symbolised “humanity, the values we aspire to”.The son of Romanian farmers, Brâncuşi emigrated to France in 1903 where he became one of the great sculptors of the last century. In 1951, he wanted to donate all his works to Romania, but the communist authorities refused his offer. He died in 1957.The sculpture is owned by Paula Romascu Ionescu and Alina Serbanescu, descendants of Gheorghe Romascu, a friend of Brâncuşi who bought the sculpture in 1911.The Romanian government also wants to have Brâncuşi’s remains moved from Paris to Romania.
