Craig Green’s hole jumper – a simple cotton sweater with a hole in the centre – became something of a cult favourite of men in the front row. But, let’s be honest, men in the front row of a fashion show are likely to spend more than the average man on their clothes, so a price tag of about £500 probably seemed like a bargain to them. To the rest of us, £85 is more friendly. That’s how much this long-sleeved polo shirt – a collaboration between Green and Swedish sports brand Björn Borg – costs. Now at Selfridges, it’s part of a collection that sees Green – such a talent in London fashion that his shows have prompted grown men to cry – venture into sportswear, but in a typically conceptual way. Like most of Green’s work, the collection is gender-neutral, with a futuristic minimal look. Other pieces include combat pants, backpacks worthy of a Pokémon Go avatar and quilted ponchos, all in a palate of black and white. Cult favourite status is only a matter of time.
