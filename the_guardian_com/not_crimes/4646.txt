Britain’s farmers often complain bitterly about the bureaucratic nightmare that is the common agricultural policy. But up and down the country it is the possibility that the UK might leave the EU – the source of their hefty subsidies and abundant seasonal labour from eastern Europe – that is keeping many of them awake at night.“It is terrifying,” says David Long, who farms near Rochester in Kent. “Terrifying in several different ways.”Long, a leading light in the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), tends 1,500 acres, many of which are given over to strawberries and pears. He uses the latest technology to boost production where he can, but he needs human hands to pick and pack his fruit, and the only place he can find them is in eastern Europe. Now, as the strawberries ripen, he is employing 65 eastern Europeans, mainly from Romania and Bulgaria.“It is not easy to find British people to do it,” he says. “The eastern Europeans are brilliant workers. If we were not able to employ them because the rules were tightened, or because we left the EU, it is difficult to see how we could operate.”That is just part of the worry. The other fear that farmers such as Long have is the loss of their subsidies if the UK was no longer part of the CAP.Gone, suddenly, would be the cheques from Brussels that make up most of their income. In 2012 CAP money accounted for 68% of this country’s total farming income. “Without the CAP, British farmers would be bust,” he says. In a recent submission to the government , the NFU said: “For many farmers CAP support remains incredibly significant.”Long’s farm lies in the heart of Ukip territory in the Medway. His land is in the seat held briefly for Ukip by former Tory MP Mark Reckless, until he was turfed out at the general election. But here, as in much of the farming community, there is little support for Nigel Farage’s party.Agricultural England might be largely Tory, but it is far from uniformly Eurosceptic. The NFU made its position clear to the Observer. Martin Haworth, its deputy director general, said: “In general terms and purely from an agricultural sense, then of course British farmers would be better off inside the EU. For example, if we were outside the EU we would either lose our export markets to Europe, which in some sectors are valuable, or if we negotiated arrangements that allowed us to continue to trade freely we would have to follow rules over which we would have no influence and there would be a serious risk we would have to compete against other European farmers who would continue to have support while we would have none.”Senior NFU figures have begun to lobby government about the dangers to agriculture, and to shops and the food industry, of any moves that might choke off the supply of ready eastern European labour.Guy Poskitt, chairman of the NFU’s national horticulture and potatoes board, farms near Goole in the East Riding of Yorkshire and employs some 180 eastern Europeans out of a workforce of 270 to 280. He says the British workers he has are good but he can’t find enough and describes the eastern Europeans as “fundamental to our business. If we are unable to employ them, we would be in a very dark place indeed. I do not see how we would be able to supply the supermarkets and the shops, the hotels and the restaurants with what they need. We would all be in a very serious position.”Poskitt recently met the agriculture minister, George Eustice, and made his view known. He was told that the government wanted to keep the UK inside the EU, but to change some of the rules, including those on how long EU workers had to live and work in this country before claiming benefits.Farmers worry that more restrictions on workers coming here will leave them staring at labour shortages and unpicked fruit and vegetables. Long says that a few years ago it used to be easy to recruit workers from Poland, but as that country’s economy has grown, fewer now want to come. “I used to ask for 60 workers and they would be guaranteed. There are fewer who want to come here, so if we tighten the rules, or worse still leave the EU, I am not sure what we will do.”It is no cheaper to employ eastern Europeans than British workers. It is just that they are there and are willing. They are crucial to the rural economy. His strawberry pickers, like Flori Balace, 26, from Romania, who is working on the farm with her husband and sister and says she can earn £500 a week in peak season, are content in their work. “I enjoy it here,” she says. “The life is good and the money is good. I want to use the money to buy a big house back home.”The fact that many farmers are ardently in favour of staying in the EU is one part of the argument that has yet to surface in the public debate. Labour’s Europe spokesman, Pat McFadden, said his party would demand that all ministries produce a detailed report on the implications of an EU exit. “The public have a right to know what being out of the EU would mean for agriculture, for trade, for every area. I suspect we are only scratching the surface of the implications of leaving.”
