Professor Kushner (Letters, 2 March) mentions that “whatever turns a profit” is Apple’s main concern. But this is founded upon straight economic fact: anyone who values their privacy, against snooping government agencies or other exploitative agents, is likely to be willing to pay a premium to secure this.It might also be observed that governments sold out to corporate interests long ago, so the private individual is obliged to take defensive action. We may deplore the situation, but should also recognise this is the way of the world. The law always lags behind new developments, and quite right too – that way, a more considered view should emerge, rather than heat-of-the-moment reactions.John StarbuckLepton, West Yorkshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
