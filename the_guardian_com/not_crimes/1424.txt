The environment minister, Greg Hunt, says the federal government will establish its vision for improved urban tree coverage within 18 months.Speaking to reporters in Sydney on Tuesday, he said the government would work directly with cities throughout 2016 and 2017 to set decade-by-decade goals for the creation of “urban canopies”.The creation of tree cover, he said, would reduce heat within city environments and improve health outcomes.“Our task is to establish those goals and increase them progressively over each of the decades,” Hunt said.“That allows us to make progress to 2020, which we’re already doing through the 20 Million Trees program, the Green Army program and the National Land Care program.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Palm trees tower alongside high-rise buildings in Brisbane.
