Mel Gibson may make a late move into superhero movies by directing the forthcoming sequel to Suicide Squad. Gibson, 61, is currently riding high after his commercial and critical hit, Hacksaw Ridge, was nominated for six Oscars. Warner Bros are said to be in talks with Gibson to take over from David Ayer, who directed the first film, which met with mixed notices but took $746m worldwide. It starred Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto as a ragtag bunch of baddies forced into the government’s service.Since the film’s release, Ayer has expressed sceptcism about some elements of his film, but stayed within the DC stable for his next project, Gotham City Sirens, which reunites him with Robbie and concentrates on DC’s female villains.The Hollywood Reporter quotes sources who say Gibson is familiarising himself with the material, and that the studio is also casting around for other film-makers. The name Daniel Espinosa has been mentioned; the Child 44 director took over from Bryon Howard on forthcoming big-budget sci-fi film Life, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds. Gibson’s renaissance after years in the industry doghouse was cemented by the news he’s joining Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg for the Daddy’s Home sequel, as well as collaborating with Vince Vaughn on a crime thriller about police corruption.
