 In Japan festivals are devoted to these springtime treats, and they sell at eye-watering prices In days gone by the transition between winter and spring was known as the “hungry gap”, when winter stores were running low but spring crops had yet to mature, something any British food grower will still be familiar with. In other parts of the world, however, this same period is considered a time not of austerity but abundance, with species that offer up early spring crops positively revered as a culinary highlight of the year. In Japan whole festivals are dedicated to these springtime treats, which can sell at eye-watering prices. So if you think your veggie patch is looking bare at the moment, here are four seasonal Japanese delicacies that could be growing in your garden right now.HostasHostas were introduced to Britain as ornamental plants, but in their native Japan they are commonly found in the vegetable patch. Their young spears of growth are cooked and eaten much like asparagus. Variegated forms common in gardens were originally developed as “self-blanching” varieties whose leaves have a milder taste, rather like some familiar celery varieties. I love their fresh, pea meets asparagus flavour. Harvest just a third of the leaves from each plant and they will provide a sustainable crop year after year.Shepherd’s purse      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Like watercress: shepherd’s purse.

They are at their most abundant and tender right now (they can be very peppery in the heat of summer). The leaves are really pretty, too, like a delicate bonsai-sized watercress. Perfect to decorate a lemon, garlic and shepherd’s purse risotto.Fern shoots      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Favourite fronds: ferns. Photograph: Alamy Stock PhotoIn both Japan and North America these little fiddle-head-shaped fronds of unfurling ferns are sautéed in garlic and oil and are one of my all-time favourite vegetables. They look stunning on the plate, too, with their curiously shaped emerald green croziers. The North American Matteuccia struthiopteris is now one of the most popular species in Japan.BambooThe bamboo shoots sold in tins in the UK normally come from tropical species considered far inferior eating in Asia to the finer-flavoured species from cooler, temperate regions. By some ridiculous stroke of luck one of the best is Phyllostachys aurea, which is also the most common in UK gardens. Harvest the tips when 10cm long and boil twice, ditching the water from the first cooking to leach out bitter chemicals, making them safe to eat and sweet to taste.Email James at james.wong@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @Botanygeek
