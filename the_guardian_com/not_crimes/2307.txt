I was amused recently by a neighbour who described her love-affair with a robin called “Robbie” – a decade-long passion that’s probably three times the average robin’s life. Since both robin sexes sing and cannot always tell each other apart, my neighbour may actually have loved many Robbies over the years. Yet no matter, her love is true.It’s interesting to compare my neighbour’s engagement with nature to the public responses at Lough Beg in County Derry, Northern Ireland, which I visited recently. Lough Beg is part of “Seamus Heaney Country”, the landscape central to the Nobel laureate’s magnificent poetry. A proposed four-lane highway would violate Heaney’s heartland and wildlife areas protected by numerous international designations. Yet, in the absence of protest from more mainstream NGOs (such as the RSPB and Ulster Wildlife Trust), a friend is fighting a lone legal battle, supported by his own money and crowd sourcing.One in 10 UK wildlife species faces extinction, major report shows On Kent’s Hoo Peninsula, meanwhile, there is another contest to save Lodge Hill, a woodland that is home to about 90 nightingale pairs, as well as a host of other wildlife that justifies its statutory protection as a SSSI. Yet the Ministry of Defence wants to build 5,000 homes there. More parochially, the University of East Anglia in Norfolk wants to site a 300-vehicle carpark on the last really important habitat at the heart of Norwich.What these stories reflect is a situation painstakingly described in two State of Nature Reports published in 2013 and 2016. The documents catalogue how nature is undergoing systemic decline in our country. In the three cases named the supporters of development – including all political parties in Northern Ireland, the MoD in Kent and the university authorities here in Norfolk – seem to see nature as an abstract idea, a theoretical resource, which can withstand any amount of imposition. Somehow they fail to see that nature is, in truth, that marsh, that wood, this particular field and even this individual bird. They could all learn much from my neighbour, who sees nature as the robin singing directly to her. What she values is the lived encounter. For the robin as idea is a trifle that can so easily be turned from vague abstraction into mere memory.Follow Country diary on Twitter: @gdncountrydiary
