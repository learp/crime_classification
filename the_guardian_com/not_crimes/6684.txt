Spectacles are a godsend but for the naturalist they are a problem in wet weather. We waited through bouts of driving rain for a break that might last long enough for us to get out and use our eyes. When it came we could not go far and chose to explore part of our local industrial past. At the heart of Hyde common is the cricket ground, a flattish area also used as a school playing field. In spring, the outfield is surrounded by yellow gorse, in autumn by colourful crabs, rowans and hollies.Just across the road the landscape changes. Here it undulates, with humps and water-filled hollows, evidence that this was a gravel working long before the massive machinery excavating not far away. Left to itself, the area has been reclaimed by nature. Trees became established when there were fewer deer browsing here. Rabbits help to keep the turf short-cropped, allowing lichens to flourish.A small group of gorse bushes catches our attention. We are used to seeing shrubs festooned with spider webs but these were cloaked at the bottom, not the top, as if they had been wrapped in wet fleece. Each was studded with black seeds, which had ripened within the webbing and been expelled, only to be caught by filaments from which there could be no escape. These webs were most probably made by a population explosion of gorse spider mites, tiny red spider-like creatures that can seriously damage the plants. Indeed, in Australia and New Zealand, where gorse is a highly invasive alien species, they are employed as a biological control.The annual display of waxcap fungi in the church yard has yet to arrive but the first golden spindles are showing through. The nearby black earth-tongues are so aptly named that they could be representing the world beneath the turf, as if saying: "Go away! Don't be so nosy!"
