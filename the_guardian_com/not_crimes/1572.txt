The Great British Bake Off 8pm, BBC1With Michael given the boot for his messy tribute to Cyprus, nine bakers enter the tent for week four of the culinary contest/national institution. This week, they’re taking on batter, a new addition for 2016 that may well mean pancakes, waffles or even savoury treats. Will last week’s star baker Tom come out on top again, or can the likes of chilled-out entertainer Selasi and meticulous Andrew rise to the challenge like a perfectly proofed dough? Hannah J DaviesOur Girl 9pm, BBC1Second instalment of the return of the army drama, reinvented in a new setting (Somalia) with a new star (Michelle Keegan) in a new headline part (Lance Corporal Georgie Lane, a medic, a role that permits her insertion into life-and-death situations with little likelihood of having to do anything so indecorous as kill foreigners). Having been established last week as a headstrong maverick, Lane is briskly reminded that her actions have consequences for others. Andrew MuellerNatural World: Jaguars – Brazil’s Super Cats 9pm, BBC2Jaguars are handsome, but elusive. This documentary follows a team of vets investigating their movements. The big cats are under threat, and pioneering work with two orphaned cubs has them travelling for 19 hours to be released back into the wild. Although the sight of a jaguar gazing into the camera or clumsily waking up from sedation is a very cute thing, they are tricky beasts – the vets observing them have their work cut out. Hannah VerdierDCI Banks 9pm, ITVBanks is a lugubrious copper at the best of times. But tonight, juggling a tricky kidnapping case with ongoing investigations into a gangland boss and problems with insubordinate junior colleagues, he’s particularly hangdog. DCI Banks can feel a little flat and generic, but tonight’s rope-a-dope kidnap handover scene is a decent twist on an old formula and, as usual, the more workaday moments are kept watchable by Stephen Tompkinson’s effortlessly world-weary performance. Phil HarrisonUndercover: Nailing the Fraudsters 10pm, Channel 5Investigator Paul Connolly looks at medical fraud: estimates suggest the illegal sale of prescription drugs in the UK now outstrips the heroin and cocaine businesses combined. It’s not just the valium and cancer drugs being sold online that are of concern, but the counterfeits full of contaminants somehow making it behind legitimate counters and being sold to consumers. Soon enough, Connolly’s legging it after a big-time dealer in a service station car park. Ben ArnoldDeath by Selfie 9pm, 5StarWill Best meets people living, rather extremely, under the “selfie” brolly, in one of those queasy, generationally polarising shows. Charlotte spends up to six hours editing her selfies daily; Jordan’s spent £100,000 on his face to bypass that process; daredevil Matt photos himself climbing vertiginous structures (despite all the broken bones); and “rinser” Charley B receives gifts for dominatrix self-portraits. Can Best follow in her “footsteps” under the handle Footdom69? Ali CatterallUnspun With Matt Forde 10pm, DaveConsidering the tumultuous political landscape, now seems like a good time to launch a weekly satirical chatshow taking the mickey out of the mighty, and Unspun will be recorded a day before broadcast to ensure maximum topicality. Host Forde also feels like a good fit: with his dark suits, open-necked shirts and sensible haircut, the thoughtful, politics-obsessed standup could easily be mistaken for a roving BBC correspondent. Graeme VirtueFilm choicePerrier’s Bounty (Ian Fitzgibbon, 2009) 1.55am, Channel 4A lighthearted Dublin-set crime drama, that has Peaky Blinders main man Cillian Murphy as Michael, on the run from gangsters with his nervy neighbour Jodie Whittaker and his dad Jim Broadbent.
