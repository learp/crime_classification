In many ways, Tamwar and Nancy were the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie of EastEnders. Nanwar, as people inexplicably chose not to call them, might not have enjoyed the longevity of Ian and Jane Beale. They might not have had the dramatic fake pregnancy of Ben Mitchell and Abi Branning. They might not even have spoken with the constant incoherent breathiness of Phil and Sharon Mitchell. And yet, by some distance, they were still my favourite couple on Albert Square.This is Tamwar and Nancy’s last week on EastEnders. Although their final storyline – ultimately a soggy, week-long will-they-won’t-they backpacking dilemma – feels as if it’s been chucked together blindfolded at the last minute in a panic, I’m still sad to see them go.Tamwar will, obviously, be a great loss. Played by Himesh Patel for the better part of a decade, he’s always been a character out of step with the rest of the show. He’s experienced all the traditional highs and lows of the soap opera churn. He’s been married (to a woman whose father once set his mother on fire) and divorced. He’s been permanently scarred in a B&B fire. He’s secretly created a website dedicated to wobbly impersonations of Dot Cotton and Pat Butcher. And yet the overwhelming memory of Tamwar will be him simply existing; walking around Albert Square in an anorak, not really doing anything, underplaying every line in a way that suggests he’s an overlay from a parallel, less histrionic version of EastEnders.

Photograph: BBCThis is probably the perfect time for Tamwar to leave EastEnders. Had he stuck around much longer, he’d become the sort of veteran who gets shoehorned into various ill-fitting, bombastic storylines. Maybe he would have to be buried alive like Max Branning, or have a nervous breakdown that manifests itself in a scraggly Catweazle beard like Ian Beale. That wouldn’t be Tamwar’s thing. He did his best work on the sidelines, an alien observer of the most befuddlingly toxic neighbourhood in the country.Nancy, however, feels like she’s leaving far too soon. Maddy Hill’s first appearance was only in 2014, but she’s been such a force of nature that she’s already won a fleet of awards for the role. She’s been funny and sweet and boisterous and – since the biggest subplot of the soap’s entire Christmas period was given to her decision to wear a dress to a wedding – it seemed as if EastEnders had much bigger plans for her.Perhaps this is also for the best. An actor of Hill’s talents probably shouldn’t be stymied by a permanent association to a single role. Her departure will leave a gaping hole in the Carter family – it now mainly consists of Danny Dyer dressed in a pink dressing gown making a noise like a deflating mattress – but it’s probably a sensible career move.Tamwar's speech in EastEnders shows the true face of Islam As much as Tamwar and Nancy will be missed individually, it’s their pairing that’ll be most keenly mourned. Patel and Hill shared a fondness for offbeat, naturalistic cadences that, when combined, made for scenes you don’t often see on soap operas. The one that sticks out the most is when they had a brief but tender discussion of the Qur’an. In the hands of other actors the scene would have been hammed to high heaven, but Patel and Hill managed to keep the whole thing grounded, which immediately lent it far more impact. This is exactly the sort of scene I’ll miss the most.But, hey, neither of them are dying. They’re just going backpacking. The door is always open for the characters to return. They’d just better not come back recast.
