John McEntire has a CV that should make you feel thoroughly lazy. For 25 years he has been a multi-instrumentalist for the jazz-tinged but ultimately indefinable band Tortoise, as well as drumming in guitar-pop band The Sea and Cake. He has also produced a huge number of other acts, including Stereolab, Broken Social Scene and Antibalas.Originally from Oregon, much of his creative life has been based in Chicago – a city markedly less glamorous than New York or Los Angeles, but which punches way above its weight in terms of music. For this episode of the Guardian’s series with NTS Radio, he talks us through the wildly varied scenes that have flourished in the windy city.Ben Beaumont-Thomas with John McEntire at the NTS Studio in DalstonRichard Dawson on the naked voice – the Guardian Radio Hour podcast African-American music has long been at the heart of Chicagoan music: the blues of Howlin’ Wolf through to the astral jazz of Sun Ra and Art Ensemble of Chicago, and of course the groundbreaking invention of house music. But there have been other pockets of intense creativity: the punk scene around Big Black, psych bands like Aorta, and the anything-goes sensibility of Jim O’Rourke. John meanders through all of them, discussing how Tortoise fit into Chicago’s musical culture, with guest host Ben Beaumont-Thomas.
