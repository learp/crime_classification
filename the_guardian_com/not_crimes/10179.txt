Deborah Orr, in her column in Saturday’s Guardian, rightly warns about the counterproductiveness of demonising the privileged themselves (What has sneering at posh people achieved? An elite who stick together, 30 January). But she is mistaken to portray the abolition of private education as a futile, unattainable cause.Something that so unfairly and systemically entrenches privilege is plain wrong and disfigures our society, at times grotesquely.That argument needs to go on being made – without name-calling, agreed – until there is a consensus among the disadvantaged 93%, and even the privileged 7%, that we need to do things differently.David KynastonLondon• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
