Warm sunshine brought out masses of wildflowers this summer, including many rarities such as the lesser butterfly orchid. Lime trees also did well in the heat â€“ they need hot summers to flower and set seeds. Unfortunately, limes have a bad reputation for the sticky mess they drop on cars parked underneath them in streets, but the culprit is actually a foreign species of lime, and the sticky stuff is honeydew made by masses of aphids feeding on the leaves.The native British lime, though, is one of our most ancient plants, dating back to the end of the last ice age, but is at its most northerly limits in the UK because of our cool climate. Without a hot summer, limes rarely come into flower and set seed but they have incredible powers of regeneration, by sprouting from toppled trees or branches lying on the ground. And as ash trees succumb to fungus disease, native lime trees growing in similar places may replace them.Perhaps the best thing about limes in hot weather is their intoxicating sweet-smelling blossom, which attracts crowds of bees with nectar so sweet it sometimes leaves the bees punch drunk. The blossom can also be made into tea, which was used during the war as a mild sedative. And hot summers are also needed to make the pollen viable, fertilise the flowers and set seed, which eventually blows away using a bract like a helicopter wing, similar to a sycamore seed.
