It’s set to be a banner year for Nicole Kidman. Not only is she involved in a number of advertising campaigns (Airline! Vitamins! Meerkats!) but the Oscar-winning actor is also appearing in a number of interesting projects for both the big and small screen.Strangerland review – passionless characters in an emotionally remote film This month’s Berlin film festival will see the premiere of Genius, a biopic of the literary editor Max Perkins that Kidman stars in alongside Colin Firth, Jude Law and Laura Linney. Her turns in festival premieres from last year, Werner Herzog’s Queen of the Desert and Jason Bateman’s The Family Fang, will also get released. Plus she will pop up in John Cameron Mitchell’s sci-fi comedy How to Talk to Girls at Parties, the Oscar-tipped drama Lion and the HBO series Big Little Lies, with Reese Witherspoon.Her first film of the year is the Australian drama Strangerland, where she plays a woman searching for her missing children in the outback. Here we look back over the actor’s greatest big-screen roles.To Die For   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest While Kidman had already impressed in thrillers Dead Calm and Malice, it wasn’t really until 1995, in Gus van Sant’s dark comedy, that she really showed the extent of her talents. Kidman’s performance as a ruthlessly ambitious woman desperate for a life on TV was terrifyingly committed and her fame-hungry character has only become more relevant since. She won a Golden Globe for her performance.Eyes Wide Shut   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Kidman’s previous films with husband Tom Cruise (Days of Thunder and Far and Away) had been forgettable studio fare but for their third film together the couple took an entirely unconventional route. Stanley Kubrick’s final film, a haunting psychosexual drama, drew a divisive reaction upon release but offered much to admire, not least Kidman’s intriguing turn that hits its peak in her confessional scene above.Dogville   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Kidman’s work in the wake of a very public divorce from Cruise drew some of the highest praise of her career, with standout performances in Moulin Rouge and The Others followed by an Oscar for The Hours. But while all were fine turns, none of them matched the challenge she was faced with under the tutelage of Lars von Trier. His experimental thriller had Kidman and her co-stars acting on a sound stage and the star’s performance was a towering piece of work, never failing to convince despite the surroundings (or lack thereof).Birth   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Kidman continued to make daring choices outside of some of the other dreck she found herself in (The Stepford Wives, Bewitched) and found an ideal collaborator in British director Jonathan Glazer. This underappreciated drama saw her play a woman who is visited by a 10-year-old boy who claims to be the reincarnation of her dead husband. Despite provoking boos on its premiere in Venice, it’s a sensitively told, almost magical tale in which Kidman sells every emotion effortlessly.Margot at the Wedding   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Kidman’s fearless habit of picking genuinely unlikable characters peaked with her role in Noah Baumbach’s intentionally difficult 2007 comedy. As a brittle, waspish author, Kidman was horribly uncompromising, alienating everyone around her and some critics too, who just found it all a bit too nasty to watch. But her refusal to soften her performance made it a rare triumph.
