Anyone else planning on an advent running streak? Don’t worry, I won’t bring up the C-word, but there are only nine days left of November ... I certainly will be, if only to help justify the odd extra mince pie. Or entire panettone. Ahem. The ‘rules’ of a running streak can obviously be made up as you go along (as all good rules are) but if you want to follow some slightly more helpful ones, try Advent Runnings own - you simply run, or swim, or do yoga, or cycle - for 30 minutes a day from December 1 until Christmas. (Oops, sorry, there’s the C-word). Of course, some people keep it going for the whole of December, or months beyond that, or even years - in Ron Hill’s case in excess of half a century. Suddenly 25 days doesn’t sound so bad, no?I always wonder what people who really are on epic run streaks do when they travel. What if they are on a flight to Australia? Jog around the airport at the halfway point? Up and down the aisles of the plane? Clearly these are not logistical issues that Ron Hill would have bowed to, given he ran with a broken sternum and in a plaster cast. I highly recommend a look at the US Running Streak Associations current list of ‘active streakers’, if only for the great naming system - only when you get to 40 years plus are you a ‘legend’ - a mere decade gets you nothing more than ‘experienced’ while a paltry five years is merely ‘proficient’. Must try harder, folks.So, over to you - what did the weekend hold for you? I saw some scenes on Rose’s instagram feed that looked like she was playing an extra in a film about Scott of the Antartic, and I know Gill is now tapering for her last marathon of the year, going for an utterly brilliant third sub-3 attempt in a row in as many months. Come share your stories, swap advice, and share stories of legendary streakers below the line ...
