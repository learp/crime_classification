9.02pm BST21:02Well that was a rollercoaster, as Ronan Keating might weakly describe it. It’s been a hard few days; but it is batter week since we shall see each other again, so stay strong. Thanks for all your comments! They are very entertaining and quite distracting while I’m trying to work.If you need practical advice on how to process the news, don’t come to me because I’m useless. But I am available for pictures of goats and silly jokes. Come say hi on twitter or even Insta which is how the kids say it.Selasi’s crackling xFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.00pm BST21:00Pastry next week! Filo and whatnot. I saw some laminated dough in there too. There are about 7000 ways for pastry to go wrong, all of which will no doubt be interpreted as metaphors for the show’s fate. Can’t wait. The memes are about to get real.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.59pm BST20:59Star Baker- Benjamina!YES! She’s had this coming. Well done Benjamina!

It’s Andrew’s turn to fry off a selection of penile-looking parts, but at least he’s dressed them up in a nice window box. Kate describes her sad bunnies as roadkill. The look of them makes me want to give money to charity.  Jane is happy Photograph: BBCI’m actually feeling quite sorry for Kate. And pleased for Jane! I’m getting soft, like the pillowy interior of Benjamina’s churros.Updatedat 8.58pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.53pm BST20:53Tom’s snake is overbaked. “Shall we say if you’re fond of fennel it’s fine?” says Mary rhetorically. Honestly, I dunno how she’s going to get the blood out of her silk-wrapped dagger.Paul tells Selasi flatly his churros are burnt. “... Are they?” responds Selasi, improvisatory powers having deserted him, if not his brass neck. These churros are strongly flavoured with chutzpah.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.53pm BST20:53Judging time!
