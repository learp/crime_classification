It’s a must-see.” Quoted by Russian news agency RIA Novosti, Peskov – who has been press secretary for Vladimir Putin since 2012 – added that he thought the film was “top quality”. The version that is being released in Russia is four minutes longer than the one available in the US, although it is unclear what is included in the extra footage.

Oliver Stone on Snowden relevance: 'The US government lies all the time' It premiered at the Toronto film festival last weekend, where it was met with mixed reviews. The New York Times’s AO Scott called it “an honourable and absorbing contribution to the imaginative record of our confusing times”, while the Guardian’s Benjamin Lee argued that “virtually every directorial choice is aimed at making Snowden’s life seem more conventional and it results in the majority of scenes feeling like a lifeless construct”.The script for Snowden was adapted by Stone and Kieran Fitzgerald from a book by Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, and another by Guardian journalist Luke Harding.
