Last year’s Kingsman: The Secret Service was notable for many things. The enormous box office (£319m worldwide). The divided critical opinion. The 38 complaints set to the BBFC, mostly taking issue with a protracted scene in which Colin Firth’s debonair spy-maker massacres scores of people in a church. And his character’s death soon after – apparently for good, presumed a bit of a blow for the sequel prospects.But director Matthew Vaughn has subsequently hinted he might try to revive the character, and a promotional poster released in April for the new film featured his glasses, with the line “Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated”. Now, the rumours appear to have been confirmed: Firth has been pictured on the set, in what does not appear to be a flashback.
