As Donald Trump gets his latest dose of stick for his support of torture, people in Britain seem ignorant of the fact that not only does torture occur in this country, but it is, in fact, televised.Celebrity Big Brother was once just a showbiz variant of a simple idea, and we seemed satisfied to watch what happened when a group of people were imprisoned in exchange for six months of Heat magazine exclusives and a fitness DVD contract. In response to our withering attention spans, though, some sort of celebrity mutation scheme has taken place and the house is now populated with the results of the lab; monstrous, self-involved freaks, who stomp around the house screaming about what they have been through and how their issue is more important than the issue of whatever other freak they seem to be talking to. Then they make up with that freak, and then those two freaks gang up on another one of the freaks. If this sounds exaggerated, consider the fact that Jedward often seem the most measured people in the house.Self-awareness is as rare as rocking-horse shit in this show. Take Ray J, of Kim Kardashian sex-tape fame, who, when asked whether the sex tape was the most important thing in his career, said the tape was one of the most important things that had ever happened. Ever. I immediately contacted my sons’ school for assurances that “Ray J banging Kim K” hadn’t been added to the world history syllabus.The effect of having contestants who have already been on the show before is that the game-playing element is now celebrated rather than reviled. Kim Woodburn from How Clean is Your House?, fresh from suffocating former partner Aggie MacKenzie to death, joined the Big Brother housemates late and proceeded to try to make Robert Mugabe look reasonable. When splashed with water by Chloe Ferry from Geordie Shore, AKA Geordie Stereotype, she unleashed a rage-filled diatribe that you might hold in reserve for when somebody has run over one of your kids.The producers of the show, whom we are encouraged to refer to cultishly as “Big Brother”, have also upped the stakes by undermining any signs of happiness from the house. Whenever a relationship is forged, the show immediately finds ways to create friction and tear it apart. If anyone has slagged anyone else off behind their back, Big Brother will engineer a game that requires the housemates to watch the footage so that we can sit back and enjoy the fallout. I expect the next series will show the footage before dropping in boxes of hand-to-hand combat weaponry, so we can enjoy the prospect of Katie Hopkins being skinned alive by Louie Spence, while Lucy Spraggan plays her latest single in the background.In the past, Big Brother sought to prod and poke the contestants. In this series, the show seems to be simply seeking to destroy lives. We are about a week away from the housemates just throwing their own shit at each other.Take Bianca Gascoigne, adopted daughter of Paul, star of Love Island, and a woman who complained of her mother being used as an “escape goat”. She had got together with former footballer Jamie O’Hara. They both seemed nice and, for the first time in the series, we had a number of really beautiful, heartwarming moments where they went to the toilet together so they could touch each other up. The beauty of this new love was slightly tarnished by the fact that Bianca already had a boyfriend. We know this because she divulged it to Nicola McLean in a coded conversation . I use the word “coded” loosely, because what actually happened was that they had a normal conversation about her boyfriend but used the word “mum” instead of “boyfriend”. I can’t imagine Big Brother had to wheel out the Enigma machine, a device used during another period of history dwarfed in importance by Ray J’s sex tape, before it played that conversation to the entire group. Now, at the time of writing, that relationship appears to be in tatters.What is terrifying about that episode is that it is not even the worst thing that Big Brother has done in the past week. The latest task to be shown involves each of the housemates being given a choice of having enough food or seeing a video from their family, an idea that I believe to be cribbed directly from Guantánamo Bay. The anomaly in this whole heady brew is one James Cosmo, actor from things such as Braveheart, Trainspotting and Game of Thrones. I have no idea what he is doing there. He seems like a normal human. I can only assume that he signed a contract to take part in a show parodying the effects of social-media-led celebrity in response to modern torture methods. He is going to be pretty pissed off when he finds out what is really going on. If he survives.It’s a terrifying show. A group of self-involved celebrities all compete to be more self-absorbed than each other while Big Brother shouts at them for not being self-absorbed enough. “Who the hell would watch this crap?” was certainly my primary thought, as I set it on to series link. The second? If this year doesn’t go as planned, look out for me in the next series shouting obscenities at Vanilla Ice.
