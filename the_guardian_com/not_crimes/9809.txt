The winner: The RevenantResisting the challenge of horny Robert De Niro and naked Zac Efron in Dirty Grandpa, Leonardo DiCaprio and the bear win it for a third week in a row, with third-weekend box-office figures of £2.28m. The Revenant’s total after 17 days is a spiffy £16.09m. That compares with £14.96m for DiCaprio’s last film, The Wolf of Wall Street, at the same stage of its run, putting The Revenant 8% ahead of the pace of the Scorsese hit. The Revenant is also mounting a challenge to The Martian in the competition to be the top grosser in the UK among this year’s eight best-picture Oscar nominees.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The Ridley Scott space-travel film had reached £17.49m after three weekends, although that number includes one extra day of play due to the film’s previews strategy. The Wolf of Wall Street reached £22.7m in the UK, and The Martian stands at £23.5m currently. Distributor Fox would presumably be delighted to push The Revenant close to either number. The Revenant’s three-week run continues a rare sustained period of stability at the top of the UK box office, following runs of three or four weeks for Spectre, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In the previous period of equivalent length – 14 weeks – 10 different films (Inside Out, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Fantastic Four, Pixels, Paper Towns, Straight Outta Compton, Legend, Everest, The Martian and Hotel Transylvania 2) occupied the top spot.The runner-up: Dirty Grandpa   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Reviews were pretty discouraging – check out the 18/100 score at MetaCritic – but Dirty Grandpa defied the critical mauling to post a £2.05m opening, including £605,000 in previews. The red band trailer promised ample Daytona Beach hedonism, including the sight of Zac Efron smoking crack cocaine and dancing the Macarena wearing only a stuffed animal toy taped to his genitals, and Robert De Niro trading lascivious banter with Aubrey Plaza. Evidently, the clips engaged the target audience. Discounting previews, The Dirty Grandpa number is very close to the debut for director Dan Mazer’s previous film, I Give It a Year (£1.44m). It’s well ahead of Efron’s previous outing, We Are Your Friends (£261,000 from 370 cinemas, including £51,000 in previews) – clearly, audiences were not wildly excited to see Zac Efron as an EDM DJ in a romantic drama. Efron’s biggest UK opening remains Bad Neighbours, which debuted with £8.45m, including hefty previews of £5.16m. High School Musical 3 opened in 2008 with £8.41m, including £2.46m in previews.The awards challenger: Spotlight   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The big winner at the Screen Actors Guild awards on Saturday night was Spotlight, which scooped the cast ensemble prize. Tom McCarthy’s true tale about Boston Globe journalists investigating child abuse by Catholic priests arrived in UK cinemas on Friday, debuting with a tidy £1.06m from 241 cinemas, yielding a £4,400 average. Distributor eOne has kept the theatre count relatively tight, but will expand this Friday to around 370 cinemas. Among the best-picture Oscar nominees, the prizes have so far been shared between SAG winner Spotlight, Producers Guild awards winner The Big Short and Golden Globes best drama winner The Revenant. Those three look likely to fight it out for the big prize all the way to the Oscars ceremony on 28 February. The Big Short enjoyed the gentlest decline of any film in the UK top 10 – down 23% from the previous weekend – and stands at £3.03m after 10 days. Prior to Spotlight, McCarthy’s directing achievements were the relatively modest indie movies The Station Agent, The Visitor and Win Win – plus the Adam Sandler comedy misfire The Cobbler (which debuted in the UK with an ignominious £58,000).The arthouse contender: Youth   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The last time Italy’s Paolo Sorrentino made a film in the English language, This Must Be the Place, lukewarm buzz saw the Sean Penn starrer release on just 18 prints, debuting with £45,500 plus £5,900 in previews. Its final gross was £209,000. A happier fate has befallen Sorrentino’s latest English language film, Youth: a debut of £265,000 from 105 cinemas, including £20,000 in previews. Sorrentino’s previous feature was the Italian-language The Great Beauty, which began with a very robust £117,000 from 25 sites on its way to a final total of just above £1m. On that occasion, the cumulative tally was more than eight times that of the debut takings – a feat unlikely to be achieved by Youth.The family battleA year ago, the big family movie going into the February half-term holiday was Disney’s Big Hero 6. In 2014, it was The Lego Movie. This year, there appears not to be a title of equivalent heft, although Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip should benefit from existing audience affection for the franchise. Goosebumps, based on the RL Stine books, enjoyed healthy previews at the weekend, which will be reported next time. The Goosebumps previews will inevitably have pulled audiences away from animation Capture the Flag, which took just £500,000 at the weekend. Anticipating just this eventuality, Paramount ran previews of Capture the Flag the previous weekend, and these boost the official opening tally to a more decent £775,000.The live eventsNot included in the official Rentrak chart for the weekend, because it played to cinemas last Thursday, is NT Live’s presentation of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, beamed live from the Donmar theatre, London. This Josie Rourke-directed version of the Christopher Hampton play, starring Dominic West, Janet McTeer and Elaine Cassidy, earned box office of £628,000. The New York Met Opera’s production of Puccini’s Turandot was beamed into cinemas on Saturday. A few encores on Sunday boost the tally to £376,000 from 174 venues.The flops: 13 Hours and The 33   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest When Michael Bay’s 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi opened in the US last month, it began with a decent $16.2m and has so far grossed $42.8m. Replicating that success in the UK was always going to be a challenge, given a storyline involving heroic military contractors trying to save American lives at a US embassy in Libya – true events turned into a film seemingly in a bid to derail the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time. Based on the US number, a UK debut of £1.6m might have been predicted. In fact, it has opened here with £238,000 from 306 cinemas, yielding an average of £779.Those numbers look positively muscular when compared to The 33, about the Chilean mining disaster and heroic rescue operation in 2010. The English-language film – featuring an assortment of non-Chilean actors including Antonio Banderas (Spain), Rodrigo Santoro (Brazil), Lou Diamond Phillips (Philippines/US) and Juliette Binoche (France) – has landed in 28th place, with a weedy £26,200 from 102 cinemas, delivering a £257 average.The future   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest January ends on a quiet note, with grosses 14% down on the previous frame, and also 15% down on the equivalent weekend from 2015, when Big Hero 6 and Kingsman: The Secret Service injected some box-office heat into the chart. Cinema owners are now pinning their hopes on Dad’s Army, spun off from the perennially popular BBC sitcom, which initially aired from 1968 to 1977. The show is still attracting big audiences on BBC2 on Saturday evenings, and the film could play surprisingly broadly. As mentioned above, Goosebumps begins its official release from Friday, and should be the top draw for families with children. Trumbo is the latest awards contender: star Bryan Cranston is nominated for the best-actor Oscar. Commercial hopes have rather dimmed for the Point Break remake, currently at $28m in the US, although the foreign gross is a much healthier $88m, boosted by $39m in China.Top 10 films January 29-311.
