Yo, ho, me hearties! Welcome aboard the pirate ship to sail away on an adventure here! In an old junk shop there are some pirates who are not “knick knacks” as you would think they would be. When the human world is not watching the pirates spring to life. One day the cheeky, pesky and sneaky mice steal the pirates’ tiny cat, Jones. The mice want cheese but want the pirates to get it for them and if they do, they will get their cat back. Can they survive their journey in the winter all the time thing called a fridge?  I like this book because it is funny and has good illustrations. There is a very detailed map of the junk shop at the end of the book.I would recommend this book to children who like adventures and love funny books.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
