Sales of frozen beefburgers have decreased by 43% since the start of the horsemeat scandal as shoppers steer clear of products they fear might not be quite what they claim on the label.Data from market research firm Kantar Worldpanel shows sales of frozen ready meals have also been hit, down 13% since the Food Safety Authority of Ireland said in mid-January that it had found horsemeat in beefburgers destined for sale in retailers including Tesco, Lidl and Aldi.The figure also shows Tesco, which was one of the most affected after 100% horsemeat was found in its own-brand lasagnes, suffered its worst monthly fall in market share for at least 20 years in the four weeks to 17 February. Kantar said this was more likely because of a reduction in big promotions compared with a year ago, rather than shoppers staying away in protest against the scandal. However, retail analysts at Barclays said Tesco "may indeed be suffereing a degree of consumer backlash".Edward Garner, director at Kantar, said: "There is still a huge rebuilding of trust for retailers to do. We won't see a bounce back in frozen meat sales for a while, until this has been resolved in the courts."The supermarket chain Morrisons, which runs its own abattoirs, revealed last week it had seen a boost in fresh meat sales. There have also been increases in organic meat sales and independent butchers have also reported brisker business.Riverford Organic Farms, which delivers fresh meat to customers homes, said it sales in the past four weeks were up 41% on the same period last year.Asda's chief executive, Andy Clarke, also revealed that his stores had seen a slight increase in sales of meat-free dishes in the wake of the horsemeat scandal.On Tuesday, the boss of Whitbread, Andy Harrison, criticised what he called Britain and Europe's "piecemeal regulation and patchwork certification" for the processed meat industry. The firm, which owns the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre pub chains, has also been caught up in the horsemeat scandal. A lasagne supplied to Whitbread by Brakes Brothers, and burgers from Doncaster-based Paragon Quality Foods were found to have equine DNA.Harrison said his pubs were putting burgers – sourced from new suppliers in Ireland – back on the menu later this week, adding that Whitbread now had a system to ensure processed meat products would be traced from "field to fork".He called for a radical overhaul of the framework governing the complex European processed meat supply chain. Currently, he said, general laws were set by Brussels; UK policy set by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; expert advice offered by the Food Standards Agency; and testing carried out by local authorities."I don't like the term 'red tape', because it implies ineffective bureaucracy, but we need tighter and more robust regulation and certification – and the FSA should take a lead on that," Harrison said.
