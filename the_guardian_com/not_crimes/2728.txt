The recipePeel an onion and cut it into rings. Melt 30g of butter in a frying pan, and add the onion, together with 4 cloves and 12 lightly crushed juniper berries. Cover the frying pan with a lid and cook over a moderate heat for about 7 minutes until the onion is soft.Halve, core and slice an apple, add the slices to the pan and pour in 2 tbsp of white wine vinegar and 1 tbsp of demerara sugar, then mix lightly with the other ingredients.Shred a hard, white cabbage (or a mixture of red and white if you prefer) and toss it with the ingredients already in the pan. Turn the heat to low and let the mixture cook for about 15 minutes.Tear 250g of thickly cut ham into large pieces and fold into the cabbage. Finish with chopped parsley and a dash of balsamic vinegar. Serves 2.The trickThere is a lightness to this dish making it good material for a spring day, but you need to get the timing right. Keep an eye on the texture of the cabbage as it cooks. It needs an occasional stir to stop it sticking but, more importantly, to keep the cabbage cooking evenly. I like to stop cooking just short of soft, so there is an element of crunch left in the cabbage and apple.The twistInclude finely shredded carrots or asparagus spears, halved lengthways, in with the cabbage. Add cavolo nero, very thinly shredded, in with the cabbage and perhaps a little redcurrant jelly.
