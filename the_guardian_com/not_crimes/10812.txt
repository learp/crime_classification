The Last Wild is a book that is set in the future where almost all the animals have died from a disease called The Red Eye. It is about a boy called Kester who is mute but has discovered that he can communicate with animals.All the humans have evacuated to a place called Premium City and Kester is at a school for children with special needs. He meets a cockroach who gets him out of the school by digging a tunnel, and then meets 100 pigeons who fly him to a place called the Ring of Trees. This is where he meets many more animals – some with the red eye some without.Kester and some other animals go on a journey to find Kester’s dad who turns out to be the best vet in the world. After a bit of the journey they meet a girl called Polly who comes along with them. Finally, they reach the city called Premium and Kester’s dad invents a cure for all the animals. I really like the way it ends on a cliffhanger as we are told that the animals only live for slightly longer. How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
