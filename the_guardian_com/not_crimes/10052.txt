For years I took the bus to school and back from where we live in Pennsylvania. But when I got my licence at 17, I would jump on any excuse to drive. Two weeks after I got my licence, in January 2012, we had exams at school and on the Monday I decided not to drive because I was tired from studying. That afternoon I sat on the bus and thought, “I can’t wait to go home and take a nap.”For almost six months, we’d had the same driver. Every morning and afternoon he would say hi and chat a little. All the kids on the bus were from our school; there were about 30 of us, aged from four to 18. I’d talk with everyone and sometimes bring the younger ones sweets. If they got rowdy, I’d quieten them down. I was kind of the bus mother and I enjoyed it.The younger kids sat in the front and the high schoolers sat in the back; I sat in the middle. That afternoon I was sitting by the window next to a 13-year-old girl who was telling me about her day, when there was a loud thud. I looked up to see the younger children standing and looking down towards the front of the bus. Our driver wasn’t at the wheel.It was around 3pm, so there was a lot of traffic and we were at a busy intersection. The girl I was sitting with jumped up and said, “You just got your licence – you have to go drive.” I replied, “What? My driving licence isn’t to drive a bus!” But she said, “You’ve got to go.”We’d been stationary at a red light but the bus started to move slowly, at about 5mph, on its own. Everything went into slow motion. I headed to the front and yelled for someone to call the police. The driver had fallen from his seat and his feet had come off the pedals. He was on the ground, shaking. His whole body was blocking the front of the bus. I couldn’t reach the brakes or sit down. I instantly went into problem-solving mode.I was looking at him, thinking, “How am I going to do this?” Then I saw a car coming towards us – we were in the middle of the intersection and had started drifting into the opposite lane. I leaned over the driver and grabbed the wheel, then I steered us through the intersection to the side of the road. I pulled the massive emergency brake, hoping it would stop the bus, and it did. We came to a rest right in front of a guardrail with a hill on the other side. All the younger kids were crying. The older ones took them to the back of the bus and tried to console them. Our headteacher and an ambulance arrived within five minutes. The driver had had a heart attack; he was pronounced dead at the scene. I felt so sad. He was a nice man.My dad picked me up and I was trying to tell him the story, but I was in shock. My mum was very sentimental. I kept finding her crying, saying, “Oh my God, there are so many things that could have gone wrong.” But I didn’t look at it like that. I’m just thankful it turned out the way it did.I didn’t think anyone would find out, but that night so many people wrote on my Facebook wall. The next day news vans showed up at school. I got calls from talkshows and I was a bit like, “Why are you giving me attention?”Experience: I broke my neck on a night out The bus company came to school and did a whole award presentation to thank me. They gave me a donation towards college fees and their trade union jacket. It was a bit embarrassing because I was standing in front of the entire high school and I was wearing this jacket that made my shoulders look weird. It was all very sweet but as a teenager, I just wasn’t used to the attention. My mum and I went to the bus driver’s funeral. I was nervous at first but his family were all so welcoming. I think it helped me and I hope it helped them.Now, nearly five years on, if I’m at a new job or make new friends, they’ll Google me and say, “Grace, did you do something with a bus?” I’ll act embarrassed but it’s always a good story to share. It makes other people feel good, I guess. • As told to Candice PiresDo you have an experience to share? Email experience@theguardian.com
