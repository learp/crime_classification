Blasberg beams as he greets this woman who apologises for missing his birthday. (It’s 22 April which is also World Earth Day, a coincidence, Blasberg jokes, because “I’m so grounded.”) The woman tried to send flowers but she’s so unsure of where he is these days that she wasn’t certain of the best address to send them to. Blasberg demurs: that doesn’t matter. It’s a lovely surprise to see her here, given there are no wedding dresses on show anywhere, he teases, impishly. But he’s forgetting himself; he introduces me to the woman. And this, he says, is Vera.And that’s how I met Vera Wang. As we head off – after Blasberg’s invited Wang to a party later at his friend Lauren Santo Domingo’s house, naturally – I tell him I’m impressed: not everyone gets called Honeybear by Vera Wang. Self-deprecating as ever, Blasberg shrugs. Maybe Vera calls everyone that. Maybe she’s forgotten his name.Somehow, I doubt it. Even if you don’t know Blasberg’s name – if you don’t read him in Vanity Fair, if you don’t watch him on CNN Style, if you’re not one of his half a million followers on Instagram – fashion folks know Blasberg. While I was shadowing him for this piece I was inundated with people enthusing over how adorable, smart and funny he is. How well-liked. How well-connected. You don’t need to take my word for it. Even a cursory glance over his Instagram feed shows him snuggly with Gwyneth Paltrow and cuddly with Karlie Kloss, cosy with Jessica Chastain and matey with Alexa Chung, sandwiched between Dolce and Gabbana and touchy-feely with Proenza Schouler, moody with Kanye West and all smiles with David Geffen, at the theatre with Girls’ Allison Williams and at the Met Ball with Katy Perry, lip-synching to Prince. For a “nobody”, he sure knows a lot of somebodys.Blasberg studied dramatic literature at university and seems to have a liking for Tennessee Williams; and it’s lines from The Glass Menagerie that spring to mind when I watch him in action. Whether he’s in the plush apartment of Carine Roitfeld, or at the aforementioned party at Santo Domingo’s Paris mansion, at which Naomi Campbell will turn up, Blasberg seems to “move in a continual spotlight”. Always running or bounding, never just walking. Always seeming to be at the point of defeating gravity.And given what Blasberg’s achieved, I wouldn’t bet on gravity to win that bout. So what, you might not unreasonably ask, has he achieved?It’s true that journalism – especially Blasberg’s fashiony, styley, arty stuff– isn’t exactly akin to splitting the atom. Nor has his journey from Missouri to glossy New York and beyond been like climbing Everest backwards and blindfolded. And yet, Blasberg’s ascent is to be admired, because, partly, it’s the American Dream: a smalltown boy with big ambitions goes to the even bigger city where he makes those ambitions a reality – a job at Vanity Fair! A job at the Gagosian Gallery! A job on CNN! – through hard work, charm and an extraordinary gift for networking. Blasberg has managed to turn what essentially could have been an endless, vacuous and soul-destroying whirl of cocktail parties, magazine launches and exhibition openings into the foundation for a powerbase. His greatest skill remains his social climbing. And many people are very envious Blasberg has power, influence, connections. They may, for now, be largely confined to the fashion industry and its associated social bubbles but when that industry is estimated to be worth $3 trillion annually, power in that sphere translates into money. Blasberg is the living embodiment of the old adage that it’s not what you know, it’s who you know. He says he doesn’t have a work-life endgame but I’m not sure I believe him. He’s been playing pretty good game up until now.When I asked Ellana Lee, senior vice president and managing editor at CNN International, why she chose Blasberg to front the resurrected CNN Style, she said, “We wanted to find a host who could connect with our audiences in different ways, and Derek offers that – knowledge of the industry, huge charisma, and an impressive, sizeable social media presence.” Which, when you boil it down, means: a fusty “old media” brand like CNN needs someone modern and connected. Lee’s calculation certainly paid off: it was Blasberg who landed them a Naomi Campbell interview, Blasberg who landed them Roitfeld, and Karl Lagerfeld, who, Blasberg tells me, will only use fax to organise anything. “Do you know how difficult it is to find a fax machine in Switzerland?” he faux-grimaces. “Email, Karl! Email!”So how does a boy from Missouri – who spent his Halloweens dressed, variously, as Tutankhamun, a vampire and the first George Bush – transform himself into the fashion world’s BFF, dressed today in a double-breasted Vuitton suit, Berlutti shoes and a Gucci belt? Because, put simply, Blasberg is something of a phenomenon. A digital Capote, a Gatsby of the Instagram age. The King and I @karllagerfeld 😎A photo posted by Derek Blasberg (@derekblasberg) on Mar 5, 2016 at 2:31am PST“When I was growing up I wasn’t aware of fashion as an industry,” he says. “There was no America’s Next Top Model, no Project Runway. You didn’t know what a stylist was or what an art director was. There was a photographer and a model and everything else was a mystery.”In fact, it was through his interests in photography and in art that Blasberg alighted on fashion as the sphere in which to carve a career. “When I was a kid, I decorated all four walls of my room, and eventually my ceiling, with collages I had made of pictures I liked: of the Kennedys, of Marilyn Monroe, of Kate Moss… I also liked Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor. I liked old-school glamour at a young age. Have you heard of The Secret? That you visualise stuff until it happens? I never did The Secret but that’s sorta what I was doing, I guess. I wanted to be where the action was.”And the action was in New York, where Blasberg’s ascent began in earnest. After graduating from university where, by all accounts, he was popular and where his skill as a “people person” was honed, he landed a job as an assistant at American Vogue. “I was a pretty terrible assistant,” he admits. “I was there about a year. I wasn’t very organised. Ten per cent was writing but 90% was updating contracts, Excel spreadsheets and taking meticulous notes. So while I was happy to be there, I was pretty excitable, easily distracted and I would just fuck everything up.” You never know who you'll run into at the airport @gwynethpaltrow 💑A photo posted by Derek Blasberg (@derekblasberg) on Jun 21, 2016 at 2:20am PDTFull of praise for Anna Wintour – “She does more before noon than you and I will do all day. She’s an animal” – Blasberg got organised and threw himself into work, toiling for the likes of Harper’s Bazaar, Interview and the New York Times. Along the way, he fattened up his contacts book in the way that a farmer might stuff a goose for the production of foie gras. But he has had a sideline that’s aided his progress. He’s made himself useful as a walker, the latest in a tradition popularised in the 1980s by Nancy Reagan among others, whereby a single, usually gay man would chaperone unaccompanied women to events. Blasberg’s choices of companion – Roman Abramovich’s wife Dasha Zhukova, for example – show impeccable taste and judgment. And his role – “a flirt but never a threat” (as Stephen Sondheim calls Bobby in Company) – has served him well in cementing his position as the must-have accessory, making it difficult to find anyone with anything bad to say about Blasberg.Difficult, but not impossible. “Derek’s greatest achievement remains his social climbing – and that he’s been so extraordinarily good at it means that many in the fashion industry are very envious of his ‘achievement’,” said one person I spoke to. They asked not to be named, lest the froideur of Blasberg be directed towards them. “I’ve seen it happen,” said this fashion insider, “and it ain’t pretty.”It’s true what they say: fashion is a bitchy business, and while its denizens don’t eat much, they gorge on sour grapes. But where many fresh-faced wannabes from flyover states find themselves chewed up and spat out, Blasberg has thrived. Why? It comes down to two key things.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Man of the moment: with Vera Wang in Miami Beach, Florida. Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Dom PerignonFirst, Blasberg is charismatic. You may have someone like Blasberg in your life. Someone who makes you feel like you’re the only person in the room. A bit taller, more interesting, wittier. I can confirm this first-hand: Blasberg’s attention is blissful, moreish and almost disarming.Second, Blasberg is, or at least does a damned good job of appearing to be, happy – or, perhaps, confident. There is not a hint of a secret sadness or insecurity about him. Or as he puts it breezily, “I’m not damaged, sorry!” And he’s not damaged, I imagine, because of his upbringing. As he explains, “Because my parents provided me with a traditional and solid foundation, I like to think that I’m fairly well-equipped for the follies, fabulousness and frivolities of an industry like this. Some of the most successful people are hard-working and smart and good to be around.”And here’s the nub of Blasberg’s appeal within an industry populated by brittle, neurotic, unhappy and damaged-to-the-point-of-deranged people. Like Santa at an orphanage, he comes bearing the most precious gifts of all: acceptance and the (brief) respite from the wretched feeling of being less-than, a feeling on which the fashion industry was founded and a feeling that it fuels in others in order to make its billions. As Amanda Wingfield says in The Glass Menagerie, “He smiled – the world was enchanted!” And so it is.So does Blasberg feel important? “Er, no,” he bristles. “What douchebag would say they did? No. I feel more so than ever that I am part of this industry but the shows are still going to happen if I’m not there.”Does he feel popular then? “There’s is a difference between popular and important, isn’t there? I don’t think everyone who’s popular is important. I will not say I’m popular nor will I say I’m important – because that’s a really assholey thing to say. You can feel free to say it though…”Given his otherwise breezy demeanour, Blasberg’s guardedness can turn the atmosphere a little chilly. When he doesn’t like a question, he either answers a different question or pirouettes to avoid it. For example, when I ask him what it’s like being an American abroad at the moment – the moment being defined by the rise and rise of Trump – his defences go up and I get a glimpse of the colder side of this erstwhile Mr Sunshine. “It’s better than being a Brit abroad, with your Brexit,” he retorts. “It’s neither here nor there. It’s fine.” But then, to be fair, he’s thoughtful. “America is having an interesting time. New York is staunchly and fiercely Democrat, and so is LA and when you get to the middle… When I go home [to Missouri], there are Trump signs in the neighbourhood.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Ladies’ man: in Brooklyn, New York, with Lauren Santo Domingo, Harley Viera-Newton, Sienna Miller, Alexa Chung, Joséphine de la Baume and Poppy Delevingne. Photograph: Pham/bfa.com/Rex/ShutterstockAnd how does that make him feel? “Not particularly excited,” he says. “I’m with her [meaning Hillary]. I’m with anyone but him.”But back to Blasberg himself. Given his Instagram following – which rises almost 30,000 in the month that I’m in his orbit – does he accept that he has clout? “Five hundred thousand is a nice number but it’s not big numbers. You follow Selena Gomez? She’s got 96 million.”When I point out that comparing himself to Selena Gomez is ridiculous, he becomes suddenly serious: “I’m 34 years old. I’ve worked hard to get clout, be that in social media or in the industry or with the people I work with. You’re taking for granted that popularity is on the tip of my brain when I’m working and it’s not.”So what is? “If I get a lot of Instagram Likes, that makes me feel good that I’ve been informing and amusing. Probably more the latter than the former. But that’s why I do what I do. Likewise, if something doesn’t get a lot of Likes, I feel as if I’ve underinformed or underamused. Life, for better or for worse, is now about the Likes.”Derek Blasberg presents CNN Style on CNN International, Sunday 11 September at 1930 BST and Wednesday 14 September at 1730 BST www.cnn.com/style
