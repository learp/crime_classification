Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy advice column in the Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?I am in my early 20s and have been running my own fitness business for three years. I graduated with a degree in sport and exercise science, and became a personal trainer. However, I don’t like working in a gym and have struggled to build a booming business outside of one. I am thinking of going abroad to teach English, as I’ve always wanted to travel and, from reading your column, it seems a popular option with many. But I have no idea how long I should do it for, or whether I should have a plan in place for when I want to stop. Will I be unemployable back here after a couple of years?Or, key decision, would it be best to forget teaching English and try to use my sports qualifications and experience on my travels? Are there any opportunities in this field for an Englishman abroad, and which countries would offer the best opportunities?Do you need advice on a work issue?
