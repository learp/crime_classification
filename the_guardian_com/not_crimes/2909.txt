Cash and carry group Booker has benefited from the horsemeat scandal as more caterers have turned away from processed meats and started making meals from scratch, according to the company. Chief executive Charles Wilson said: "We are the biggest meat supplier to the catering industry in the country and since the scandal we have seen quite a lot of the caterers turning back to making their own burgers and lasagnes. So, we've moved from selling pre-packaged burgers to selling more fresh mince instead."Booker's profits jumped 13% to £101m, on sales up from £3.5bn to £4bn a year earlier. Wilson said the rise was also due to a boost in demand from small retailers who have managed to ride through the recession relatively unscathed: "There are quite of lot of good entrepreneurs and talented people saying 'I want to set up a deli' or a new format. We've also seen a big rise in high-quality steaks being sold, with a number of Brazilian and Argentinian steakhouses driving sales."The company bought struggling rival Makro last year with the Competition Commission deciding the deal could be completed last month. Bosses believe this will add around £10m of sales next year.
