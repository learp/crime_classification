After sunsetcycling shared the above photo, we’d like to see your pictures and stories of out of place items that you have discovered on your travels, either helplessly overgrown or deliberately deserted. Whether it’s an unwanted car or a derelict cottage that has been taken over by the elements, or a deliberately cast aside item you have discovered on a recent nature walk, share your photos and stories about the things you have discovered abandoned in your environment and we’ll feature the best on the site. You can share photos of the snow by clicking on the ‘Contribute’ button on this article. You can also use the GuardianWitness smartphone app or the Guardian app and search for ‘GuardianWitness assignments’. GuardianWitness is the home of readers’ content on the Guardian. Contribute your video, pictures and stories, and browse news, reviews and creations submitted by others. Posts will be reviewed prior to publication on GuardianWitness, and the best pieces will feature on the Guardian site.
