Doctor Who’s next companion will be the first to be openly gay.Pearl Mackie, who plays Bill Potts in the upcoming series, told the BBC her character’s openness about her sexuality was important to represent onscreen, but not her defining characteristic.“It shouldn’t be a big deal in the 21st century. It’s about time, isn’t it?” she said.Doctor Who's new companion Pearl Mackie: 'I have no time-travelling experience!' The actor, who will appear in the BBC1 show alongside Peter Capaldi, added: “That representation is important, especially on a mainstream show. It’s important to say people are gay, people are black – there are also aliens in the world, so watch out for them.“I remember watching TV as a young, mixed-race girl, not seeing many people who looked like me, so I think being able to visually recognise yourself on screen is important.“[Being gay] is not the main thing that defines her character – it’s something that’s part of her and something that she’s very happy and very comfortable with.”Gay characters have featured in the programme in the past, but never previously as full-time companions.It was announced last April that Mackie would be taking the role and her first episode is due to air on 15 April. Mackie said the past year has been “kind of insane”.“My Twitter follower count went from 400-and-something to 16,500 in about two hours, so that was pretty mental. But it’s been really nice, everyone seems to be really excited. It’s sort of like being welcomed into a family and all the fans have been really welcoming,” she said.Mackie, adding that the role was the biggest she had taken on, said: “It’s an amazing platform for me and it opens a lot of doors that wouldn’t necessarily have been open before, it’s very exciting.”
