Rob Callender is talking about cheese. “My dad loves cheese, really loves it. So I’ve had to persuade him to cut down. Instead of leaping on every two-for-one in the supermarket, buy one really nice cheese once a week. Dairy farming is such a horrible industry.”Callender’s passionate advocacy of veganism has made him an object of fun and curiosity on film sets, but he is now turning his environmentalism into art. In just over a month’s time, he he will begin shooting a short crowd-funded feature film on climate change.The British actor, whose credits include Sherlock, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and the Guy Burgess character in the National Theatre revival of Another Country, has been chiefly famous among online fans for his appearance in Game of Thrones earlier this year. A close-up of his penis - “no, it wasn’t a body double,” he says, blushing - as his character Clarenzo examined himself for genital warts caused a stir.The Observer view on global warming Callender prompted the scene himself. Kidding around on set while filming a very different episode, he said it was about time for a male nude shot. Writers David Benioff and Daniel Weiss took him at his word, and the script was delivered soon after. “I thought it was quite amusing,” he says. “I don’t think we should be embarrassed about nakedness. And I had a wig, so no one would recognise me.”There will be no reprise of this scene in his climate change film, however. A thriller that takes a series of dams as its backdrop, The Incentive revolves around a “sort of Steve Jobs/Elon Musk” figure of an ambitious and charismatic entrepreneur taking on global warming. But is he all that he seems?      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Rob Callender on stage in Another Country by Julian Mitchell. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the GuardianCombining elements of action and disaster movies with spy conspiracies and flashes of comedy - including Simon Amstell in a “celebrity vegan cameo” -the film aims to portray the perils of climate change without preaching or bludgeoning audiences. It will be shown initially at film festivals, with the hope of a general release or a bigger budget remake if successful.Callender has been working on the script for two years, and is now in the final stages of raising funds for the production via Kickstarter. Shooting will be at the Cruachan dam in Scotland in November.This is a personal quest for Callender. A vegan who has converted all his immediate family to the cause, with the exception of his father’s cheese habit, he believes “in embodying the change you want to make”. Making a film about climate change was a natural fit because he believes the problem is now growing so urgent that we only have a few years, “a very short window”, to make the differences to the economy and our consumption patterns that are needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions.Winchester-educated Callender has an unusual perspective on the issue, having been born in Japan and brought up largely in Hong Kong and Los Angeles. His father was an executive at Cathay Pacific – “I think I have a deep guilt at having taken so many flights,” he says – and his experience of other cultures encourages him to think that if people can be persuaded there are different ways of living without our overweening dependence on fossil fuels, we can switch rapidly to those other modes. “Young people see this,” he says, as their exposure to the internet gives them a broader viewpoint of other cultures. “My grandfather doesn’t believe in it.”Deliciously Stella: the Instagram sensation serving up raw Kinder eggs on avo-toast His sense of urgency has deeply personal roots as well. While Callender, now 25, was at the Guildhall school of drama, his motherdeveloped cancer in her early 50s and died. “She was incredibly healthy, she had no vices,” he says. “It showed me that you can’t wait around. There is no time to waste,. All the social worries just melt away… you’re not thinking about how you ‘should’ behave, you just show what you are thinking, very directly.”Films about climate change do not, in general, have a happy history. Al Gore’s 2006 An Inconvenient Truth won an Oscar, but was a documentary, beautifully paced and shot, but essentially the filming of an hour-long standup lecture. The Age of Stupid looked and sounded different, but underneath was much the same format, with Pete Postlethwaite narrating an impassioned polemic against rampant consumerism. Others have been less successful. The Day After Tomorrow employed conventional disaster movie tropes, while 1995’s Waterworld, starring Kevin Costner with gills, put paid to the genre for a decade. Arguably the best job was done by The Simpsons Movie.Callender believes turning climate change into watchable filmic form is vital if people are to be persuaded to change their behaviour. “It’s this massive issue, this huge part of our lives, and it is missing [on film],” he says. A documentary was out of the question, he says. The defining question of our times, that of whether we deal with climate change or fail to do so, must and should be a subject of art. “We are failing otherwise,” he says.Above all, Callender says, his film must work on its own terms. “I want people to be awake while they watch it,” he says. “I want them to be watching to see what happens next, just like any other film. It’s not a lecture.”
