Amy Winehouse charity sets up home for female recovering addicts Speaking to the Guardian in 2013, the curator Elizabeth Selby said a big part of the collection’s resonance came down to the family’s involvement, with each caption written by her brother. “They really help to bring the exhibition together,” Selby said. “You get a sense of a very strong brother and sister relationship that’s very typical – it is very affectionate but also perhaps they sometimes didn’t get on.”The exhibition has travelled to San Francisco, Vienna, Tel Aviv and Amsterdam and, in October, the Jewish Museum will be the only place in Australia to host the exhibition.Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning almost six years ago at age 27.
