Unmissable show?The Secret Life Of 4, 5 and 6 Year Olds. It’s fascinating from a psychological point of view to see how things affect them at such an early age. I get a window into my daughter, who’s six. When she goes to school, I’m thinking, “I wonder if all that’s happening there!”Earliest TV memory?Rentaghost. I used to watch it all the time. It was a bit odd, wasn’t it? As I think a lot of shows in the 70s were. I loved the fact that Mrs Popov was [played by] Sue Nicholls who’s now in Coronation Street. It’s all animated now, but back then we had actual actors and actresses. Cartoons are great but I was a sucker for things like that and Marmalade Atkins and Grange Hill.Bring back…Blind Date would be brilliant, but you can’t do Blind Date without Cilla, so that’s kind of a no-no. I was a huge fan of Treasure Hunt and Challenge Anneka. I’d sit down with my parents, and we’d rib my dad because there was always a great shot of her bum and he’d always go really red as we stared at him.TV turn-off?I’m not a big fan of antiques shows or Cash In The Attic. I don’t care about the rubbish in your loft! I don’t find it stimulating in any way.Pitch us a TV show…If money were no object I’d bring back Treasure Hunt! With a helicopter and me. I think it could be updated – you could do something for a community that needs some help. You could go to Cumbria and help with the floods, for example. They sort of did that sort of thing anyway, but now everything is bigger and shinier, and on a grander scale.Mastermind specialist subject?Slightly cheesy subject matter, but Grease, the movie. I have watched it far too many times. I know every word to the whole script. We all wanted to be a Pink Lady. I’m not including the sequel here, by the way. We don’t talk about the sequel!Celebrity Big Brother continues all week on Channel 5
