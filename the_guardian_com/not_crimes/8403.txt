Can’t wait until Wednesday, can you, I’ve got serious Olympics withdrawal. How amazing would it be if our paralympians completely thrashed the Americans? Not in a bad nationalistic way, that was the brilliant thing about Rio – you realised there’s a kind of inspirational nationalism that means you can shout about living in a country with people like Mo Farah in it. I don’t see how you can be a bad nationalist if you like Mo Farah. That smile when he crossed the line? I don’t think I’ve ever felt that patriotic, and coming after all the Brexit doom and gloom.It’s just been the most fantastic uplift, you think, maybe Britain actually is quite great if it produced Laura Trott – she made my summer, anyway, and it’s got to make people respect Britain a bit, hasn’t it, when we got three times their medals. Well, everyone knows the French are sore losers.It’s such a change to feel proud. You watch Nick Skelton, so brave and inspirational, and think, “The Chinese can stick their power station”, don’t you, we’ll just make one ourselves, like in the old days, maybe everything is going to be OK, after all. Look at Peaty and his nan, we’ve got to be getting something right.Modern tribes: the bride I don’t see what’s so BNP about being proud of winning. What I can’t stand is the naysayers, trying to twist everything that’s great about celebrating being part of a first-rank, winning nation that just proved it’s a world-beater to look as if it’s some sort of horrible triumphalism. Would they rather Andy Murray had been beaten by that Argie guy? So go and live in Argentina.Nothing wrong with being proud of your country, and our winners are so modest and lovely compared with the rest of them, it just makes you think, maybe we should get behind HS2, build some more houses. Well, if that sounds like the East Germans, then fine, it just goes to show that there’s nothing little England about old-fashioned patriotism.
