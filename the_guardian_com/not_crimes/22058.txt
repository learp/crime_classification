Some actors reportedly turn down roles in superhero movies for fear of being pigeonholed. For Jude Law, the reason was more prosaic: he couldn’t cope with the costume.In an interview on Stephen Colbert’s Late Show on Tuesday, Law revealed he was approached to play Superman in Bryan Singer’s 2006 film Superman Returns. “At the time it just didn’t float my boat,” Law said. “I just didn’t really want to go there. I’m an Englishman and it just didn’t seem to fit. I was really worried about the outfit and I just didn’t fancy it.”Law recalled how Singer was keen to cast him, reassuring him that the suit had been “revamped” and sending it to Law’s hotel – with a minder – for him to try on. The actor retreated to the bathroom and struggled into the spandex, but the reflection that greeted him failed to alleviate his fears.“I’m stood there and then I have this picture of me in that costume on posters all around the world and I was like ‘No way!’ and I unzipped it. I was Superman for two minutes. That’s enough!”The role eventually went to Brandon Routh, who did not reprise it after a mixed critical reception to the film, which made $391m worldwide. Henry Cavill took over the role for 2013’s Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which was released earlier this year.• This article was amended on 10 June, to correct the date of broadcast of Law’s appearance on Stephen Colbert’s Late Show.
