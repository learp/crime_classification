“Directly you are in motion you will feel quite helpless, and experience a sensation of being run away with, and it will seem as if the machine were trying to throw you off,” wrote Charles Spencer in 1877, in his practical guide to cycling on the “modern” bicycle. The 19th-century handbook is just one of a series of texts the London Library has dug out from its 17 miles of shelving, as part of celebrations to mark the venerable subscription library’s 175th anniversary.Founded in 1841 at the instigation of Thomas Carlyle, the library has counted among its members writers from Charles Dickens and George Eliot to Virginia Woolf and Bram Stoker. When it opened, its stock numbered just 5,000 books, used by 500 members. Today, 7,000 members can call on more than a million titles. Nothing is thrown out, so any subject section will feature titles from the 17th century to today.“One of the joys of the library is that you can wander and browse at will, and anyone who has done that has experienced the delight of coming across something totally unexpected, whether it’s something serious or something which just lifts the spirits,” said librarian Inez Lynn. Staff wanted to share this experience with readers, so set out to trawl their shelves, coming up with six titles that Lynn called “long-hidden gems” which are “both very much of their time, but that also speak to now”.Cycling: The Craze of the Hour, which is published next week by Pushkin Press, collects together two other pamphlets with Spencer’s 1877 guide: George Herschell’s 1896 Cycling as a Cause of Heart Disease, discussing the alarming implications of the “craze of the hour”, and Barry Pain’s 1905 His Last Pupil, about a cycling instructor who can’t ride a bike.  The only use of a gentleman in travelling is to look after the luggage, and we take care to have no luggagefrom Unprotected Females in Norway “When we allow a child to ride long distances upon a cycle we are carrying out a physiological experiment which, although possibly of interest from a scientific standpoint, must be utterly unjustifiable,” writes Herschell, while Pain admits his reason for finally taking to the saddle. “Wherever I went I was met by bicyclists who longed to make others bicycle. It was not for health, nor for fashion, nor for exercise that I finally took to the machine; it was simply from the pressure of public opinion.”“Cycling is a phenomenon now, and it was also absolutely the craze of the hour in the 19th century,” said Lynn.The reissues also includes The Lure of the North. This is a collection of three 19th-century texts about travelling in Norway, featuring useful advice – “If you give anything to a Norwegian (old meat tins are always thankfully received), he will give your hand a silent grip more expressive than many words” – and tips. “The Buarbrae is a very pretty glacier, and well worth a climb; but a simple walk across the Folgefond entails much labour, and at the end one feels inclined to give Mr Punch’s celebrated advice, ‘Don’t’.” One of the texts included in the travel guide is Emmeline Lowe’s account of how she and her mother travelled through the Scandinavian Peninsula, Unprotected Females in Norway. “The only use of a gentleman in travelling is to look after the luggage, and we take care to have no luggage,” writes Lowe.Pushkin Press publisher Adam Freudenheim said that many of the texts in the series have been “unseen for over a century”, but that the writing “remains as entertaining and enlightening as the day it was originally published”.The collection, which will be followed up with a further six books in November, also features On Corpulence. This includes William Banting’s 1864 Letter on Corpulence, a 19th-century dieting book that encouraged readers to cut out milk, sugar, butter and potatoes. Pushkin said that it was so successful at the time that “‘banting’ or ‘to bant’ became a popular phrase for adopting a slimming diet, which lasted well into the 20th century”.“For nightcap, if required, a tumbler of grog (gin, whisky, or brandy, without sugar) or a glass or two of claret or sherry. This plan leads to an excellent night’s rest, with from six to eight hours’ sound sleep,” Banting advises.The Gentlewoman’s Book of Sports, Life in a Bustle: Advice to Youth and On Reading, Writing and Living with Books complete the first London Library collection. Authors represented in the books include Jerome K Jerome and Lewis Carroll, who writes in Feeding the Mind that “I wonder if there is such a thing in nature as a FAT MIND? I really think I have met with one or two: minds which could not keep up with the slowest trot in conversation; could not jump over a logical fence, to save their lives; always got stuck fast in a narrow argument; and, in short, were fit for nothing but to waddle helplessly through the world.”
