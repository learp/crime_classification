I was amused to read of Barbra Streisand’s latest bout of control freakery (Streisand takes issue with Siri over surname, 23 August). Some years ago I was chairing a press conference for The Mirror Has Two Faces, an oddly appropriate title for a mediocre film which she both directed and co-starred in. After being asked first to move to her right side, presumably to enjoy a kinder profile, she then reacted again after I introduced her to my press colleagues as “Barbara Streis-n’d”. “It’s Streis-AND!” she hissed noisily in my left ear, to which I reacted with a nervous titter.Quentin FalkLittle Marlow, Buckinghamshire• All my life I’ve been telling people my surname is pronounced with a V, not a W. Could Barbra Streisand start phoning the heads of global corporations for me and others who live with a similar affliction, to make them get it right?Mark LewinskiSwaffham Prior, Cambridgeshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
