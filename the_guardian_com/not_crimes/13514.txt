The term "bourgeois", like the term "terrorist", has a long and sometimes counterintuitive history. When the Conservative MP John Hayes dismisses the concerns of anti-biofuels campaigners as "detached, kind of, bourgeois views", it's safe to say he isn't accusing them of inhabiting a walled medieval market-town, as the term originally indicated.Hayes is equally unlikely to have been drawing on the French revolutionary terminology in which "bourgeois" applied to the men and women of the Third Estate, rich but without the highest social standing, who overthrew the country's ancien régime in 1789. Nor, unless the maverick wing of the Tory party is about to adopt a more radical direction than previously suspected, might Hayes have been referring to the categorisation employed by Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto, where the bourgeoisie are described – not without a certain grudging admiration for their transformative capabilities – as an exploitative and appropriative social class in control of the means of production, with capitalist society "more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other – bourgeoisie and proletariat".Like other terms popularised, transformed or contested in the ideological white heat of the French revolution – among them "liberty", "patriot" and "democracy" – "bourgeois" has gone on to become a flexible and multivalent signifier in modern political vocabulary. In the 19th century the meaning of the term appeared to stabilise, signifying firstly an economic category identified with the ruling class in capitalist society, and secondly the cultural values of that class – notably conspicuous consumption and materialism – which, significantly, could be internalised by both members of the bourgeoisie and those outside it. It is the latter of these categories that seems to have shifted, and the word has become the cultural identity that dare not speak its name.Over the past few decades – perhaps as a result of the disingenuous insistence on the disappearance of distinct class identities and the whimsical suggestion that "we are all middle class now" – "bourgeois" has become less an objective economic identity and more a derogatory socio-cultural term, an accusation to be dodged and denied if one is not to be dismissed. To be "bourgeois" in a cultural rather than a class sense has become a term of insult from both left and right, its pejorative power generally centred around its connotations of prioritising middle-class abstract concerns over the concrete realpolitik of "keeping the lights on". As used by the left, "bourgeois" not only retains its connotations of traditional political enmity but also implies an airy, sheltered detachment from the material struggles of the proletariat. From the right, as Hayes's remark illustrates, it can be made synonymous with "liberal", "elitist", and perhaps the unspoken insinuation "Guardian-reading".It's doubtful whether Hayes's rightwing populist use of "bourgeois" stems from his awareness of the 19th-century Tory party's distance from the interests of the aspirant bourgeoisie, as embodied in the old Liberal party. Rather, it indicates the extent to which the term's use as an automatic and somewhat knee-jerk political insult has superseded its historical use as a political descriptor. A certain irony is apparent, however, when one considers that Hayes's party, in its post-Thatcher neoliberal incarnation, has itself become one of the most effective vehicles available for bourgeois advancement.
