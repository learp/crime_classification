It has been described as the essential document of “words that define who we are”. Now, with the addition of “bogan”, “bush baptist”, “small-l liberal” and thousands of other new entries, the Australian National Dictionary is giving the official stamp of recognition to the way Australians speak.Or in some cases, since it is the first comprehensive update to the “primary repository” of Australian English since 1988, the way they used to speak.The second edition of the dictionary features more than 6,000 new words, phrases and idioms, including entries from more than 100 Indigenous languages. It was launched at Parliament House on Tuesday morning.Sausage sandwiches and potato cakes: new maps of Australian language The update has caught up on words, phrases and idioms unique to Australia, including those that are no longer in popular use.Among the idioms to be legitimised in the second edition are: “I don’t know if I’m Arthur or Martha”; “your blood’s worth bottling”; “do a Bradbury”; “carry on like a pork chop”; “a cup of tea, a Bex, and a good lie down”; “happy as a bastard on Father’s Day”; “he wouldn’t know if a tram was up him unless the conductor rang the bell”.The meaning of some was not immediately obvious to a small sample of people under 30. “Straight to the pool room”, a catchphrase from the classic Australian film The Castle, has been immortalised. Peter van Noorden, the managing director of Oxford University Press, said the dictionary “illustrates what it means, in words, to be Australian”.Among the epithets included are: “bogan”, “bronzed Aussie”, “bush baptist”, “callithumpian”, “grey nomad”, “chardonnay socialist”, “checkout chick”, “mungo”, “Mrs Kafoops” “ranga”, “rurosexual”, “saltwater people”, “sea change”, “seppo”, “skip”, “tradie” and “Mexican”.Oxford Australia (@OxfordAustralia)Australian National Dictionary second ed., new entry: grey nomad. #KnowYourAussie @ozworders pic.twitter.com/OfSNHZKkbwAugust 21, 2016From the world of politics “aspirational voter”, “Howard’s battler”, “small-l liberal”, “true believer” and “scrutineer” are added.Other terminology from the Canberra beltway to be recognised includes: “how-to-vote card”, “micro party”, “mortgage belt”, “negative gearing”, “tent embassy”, “two-party preferred”, “wombat trail”, “Hawkespeak”, “captain’s pick”, “branch stacking”, “economic rationalism” and “keep the bastards honest”. Entries relating to food and drink reflect changes in Australians’ tastes over the past 30-odd years and include “babyccino”, “Devonshire tea”, “fairy bread”, “kransky”, “long black”, “neenish tart” and “goon of fortune”.“Snag” and “kransky” add to the apparently innumerable list of words in Australian English that mean sausage.“Snot block”, “copha”, “dagwood dog”, “battered sav”, “Chiko Roll”, “chocolate crackle”, “nibblies” and “short soup” add to the list of largely unappetising Australian culinary delights.As well as words from more than 100 Indigenous languages, “welcome to country” and “Invasion Day” are on the new list of words relating to Indigenous culture.Among them are “migaloo” (a white person), “minga” (a tourist), “tjukurpa” (the Dreaming), “yidaki” (a didgeridoo), “gubinge” (a kind of plum), “jarjum” (a baby or young child), and words for heath mice and water rats.The dictionary now defines 16,000 words and phrases, and traces them to their source.Dr Bruce Moore, the chief editor of the new publication, said it was the essential document of the words “that define who we are, where we have come from and what we value”.
