Sitting in a meeting, daydreaming at your desk or pretending to listen to a boring client on the phone? If there’s a pen in your hand and a scrap of paper nearby, chances are you’ll start doodling.But far from being a meaningless waste of time, psychologists believe our idle scribbles of arrows, love hearts and squiggly lines reveal our inner hopes, dreams, and frustrations. In her TED talk, Sunni Brown, author of The Doodle Revolution: Unlock the Power to Think Differently, proposes that doodling is in fact deep thinking in disguise and that it is a simple, accessible tool for problem-solving in general.We were so impressed by the doodles readers’ have already shared with us, we are asking for more. This time we want to see what you have been scrawling on your notepad while supposedly hard at work – whether it’s a couple of wavy lines, spirals or an artistic masterpiece. We will then explore what some of these drawings reveal about your personality, job satisfaction and career ambitions with the help of a psychologist. And offer advice on how an understanding of your doodles can help you in your job.The date for contributions will be from Friday 12 until Sunday 21 August at 12 midnight.
