Although he can remember how to get there, it is a very long way to walk. Eventually, he falls over and breaks his leg and finds a barn owned by a weird lady called Vola. She helps Peter get better and fixes his leg so he can see his fox again.When his leg is much better and he can walk on crutches, Peter goes to find Pax. After a long and hard journey, Peter finds Pax and they recognise each other straight away, but Pax has a new family and doesn’t need Peter anymore.I liked this story because it is like me and my dog. I wouldn’t want my pet to be sent away and I would walk a long way to find her too. The ending is sad and I wanted them to go home together.I would recommend this book because the characters are very real and I like that it’s about a boy and his pet fox because that’s quite unusual. The story is happy and sad and I think many people will like it.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
