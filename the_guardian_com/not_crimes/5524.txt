Rarely can two books about ancient history with such contemporary relevance have appeared in the same week. Bettany Hughes’s Istanbul: A Tale of Three Cities, is “built deliberately on what is passing as well as past”, according to Peter Stothard in the Financial Times. Hughes is strong at “celebrating citizenry of the world at a time when that idea is in retreat, damning the ‘otherness’ that west has bestowed upon east … She is a wistful and impassioned cosmopolitan who has produced a challenging story for 2017.” Caroline Sanderson in the Sunday Express found “this sumptuously produced history book” to be “as timely as it is enthralling”. Several reviewers were keen on the tales of Empress Theodora, with the Sunday Telegraph’s Sameer Rahim applauding that “Hughes isn’t averse to heating up her own narrative with the salacious stories that dot the city’s past”. And for Louise Callaghan, the Turkey correspondent of the Sunday Times, “the women in this story become the most memorable characters”. “Where Hughes [tells complicated stories through compelling characters], her enthusiasm radiates, but elsewhere her language can veer into slapstick jauntiness, presumably to make the dense history more readable. Her subject, nevertheless, is irresistibly rich ... textured, readable and often compelling.”In Age of Anger: The History of the Present, Pankaj Mishra uses a vast historical perspective to explain “why the modern world, from London to Mumbai and Mosul, is like it is”, according to Helen Lewis in the New Statesman. “But the risk of writing about everything is that one can end up writing about nothing … Too often, the sheer mass of Mishra’s reading list obscures the narrative connective tissue that should make sense of his disparate examples.” Plus, the book ignores women: “In a book devoted to unpicking hidden connections, the role of masculinity in rage and violence is merely noted again and again without being explored.” Con Coughlin in the Sunday Telegraph was not impressed, finding “many sweeping generalisations” and the whole “simplistic and unnecessarily negative”. But Nick Fraser in the Observer called the book “deeply challenging”, “belligerent, scalding”, “incisive and scary”.Critics were equally divided over Paul Auster’s latest novel, 4321, which has been seven years in the writing. While Hephzibah Anderson in the Mail on Sunday called it “a rich and tender meditation on how lives are shaped”, the Sunday Times’s Theo Tait found his suspicions reinforced that Auster is “a somewhat glib and limited writer”, while the Daily Telegraph’s Tim Martin was a bit overwhelmed: “It is expansive where earlier Auster novels were cramped, realistic where they were arch and symbolic, and transfixed by the world’s minutiae where they offered, all too often, mere summaries of ideas … [it] wallows in texture and event to a sometimes merciless degree … For all the urgency in its countdown title, 4321 sometimes resembles the work of a man who has been told he will be shot when he reaches the end of his book.” John Sutherland in the Times had a solution: “My advice for anyone taking on this book (apart from don’t drop it on your toe) is turn first to page 862. If you don’t, you’ll probably have to go back and read 4321 again, with the page 862 key in your hand. And, believe me, with a book this length, that is something you do not want to do.”
