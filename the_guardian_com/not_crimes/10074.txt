It’s hard to remember that there was a time when one of the most important purposes of London clubs was to help men to get away from their females. It’s almost the other way round these days. Now women go to clubs to get away from whatever needs doing at home – and I don’t mean just the one or two meant for women alone. There’s an array of boltholes for people – men and women – according to their interests. The English-Speaking Union always houses the meetings of my book club – and sports any number of lectures and debates of overseas concerns. It's better to laud their inclusiveness, rather than their exclusiveness Any one person might belong to several clubs – they are not always in competition with one another and don’t necessarily dislike each other. The other day I was leaving the Reform Club, where a friend had been celebrating Christmas belatedly, and was heading for the Athenaeum. But I couldn’t remember where it was… so a member of the Reform staff kindly walked me to it.Putting it simply, clubs are not mainly concerned with family, or a tight-knit group of some kind, and nor are they primarily a reflection of how much money you have – a criticism often levelled at them. Clubs bring people together, across age ranges and political persuasions, opening up possibilities and as a forum to explore difficulties. They reckon on one person finding another with whom they have something at least in common, whatever else they don’t have in common.Clubs have a poor reputation in some quarters and not always with bad reason. But I reckon it makes better sense to approve of clubs than to ignore them, to laud their inclusiveness, rather than their exclusiveness. We just need to watch out for who they keep out – and make sure it’s not for unsuitable reasons.What do you think? Have your say below
