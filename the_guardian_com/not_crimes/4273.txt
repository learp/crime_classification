The winner: The Conjuring 2Comfortably landing at the top spot, The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case begins with £2.78m plus previews of £1.86m for an opening total of £4.64m. That compares with a £2.16m debut for The Conjuring in 2013, and £1.94m for Conjuring spinoff Annabelle in 2014. The Conjuring went on to a final gross of £10.46m, while Annabelle reached £7.51m. The Conjuring 2 is already 44% of the way to matching the original film’s final gross.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  The Conjuring 2: trailer for Enfield-set horror sequelHowever, with a sequel, you’d expect its box office to be relatively front-loaded, as fans of the franchise rush out to see the latest instalment. Further traction will depend more on audience word of mouth. IMDb user rating is an encouraging 8.0/10, although that number usually declines as a film goes beyond its fanbase and reaches a wider audience. MetaCritic score is a less warm 65/100. Although The Conjuring 2 faced competition from Euro 2016 on television, no England game fell at the weekend.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The real winner: The Secret Life of PetsNot officially released until 24 June, the latest animated feature from Illumination – makers of Despicable Me and Minions – outgrossed The Conjuring 2 at the weekend. Despite being available to audiences for one day less (Saturday and Sunday, but not Friday), The Secret Life of Pets beat The Conjuring 2’s weekend tally, with a nifty £3.6m. That will all be added into the tally for the coming weekend. When Disney’s Zootropolis opened in March, it managed £1.73m in previews, which did include a hefty chunk from the Saturday and Sunday prior to release. Zootropolis proved a significant word-of-mouth hit, reaching £23.6m so far. It’s too early to project any final total for The Secret Life of Pets, but its preview number is more than double what Zootropolis achieved.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The veteran: Me Before YouDropping by the smallest amount of any film in the Top 10, Me Before You fell 33% for third-weekend takings of £979,000, and a total of £6.54m. This is all good news for everyone involved, and director Thea Sharrock was announced last week as the director of new YA adaptation The Selection, based on the book by Kiera Cass. According to Box Office Mojo, Me Before You has grossed $82m worldwide on a rumoured production budget of $20m. While that theatrical box office is split with cinemas, and marketing costs also have to be factored in, all the ancillary revenues including DVD, VOD and TV are still to come, plus many more markets including France, Germany, Spain, Russia and Italy.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Russell Crowe on The Nice Guys and his toilet chat with Ryan GoslingThe Nice Guys, starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, also posted a decent hold, with a drop of 35%. The film offers a smart, adult alternative to blockbuster fare such as Warcraft and X-Men Apocalypse and family titles such as the latest Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Alice Through the Looking Glass.The flop: Gods of EgyptWith a US total box office of just $31m and some of the worst reviews for a film this year, Alex Proyas’s Gods of Egypt always looked like a disaster waiting to happen. So distributor eOne may not be too depressed about an opening gross of £484,000, though that’s the lowest gross for a film in third place since May 2014.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Gods of Egypt has a rumoured production budget of $140m, so this looks set to be an unprofitable title for Lionsgate and its international distribution partners. On the other hand, total foreign gross is $112m, according to Box Office Mojo, with China ($35.6m) and Russia ($11.4m) doing best so far.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Tale of Tales star Salma Hayek: ‘Women are more profound than men’The arthouse battleTop arthouse film in the market is Matteo Garrone’s Tale of Tales, landing in 13th place with £113,000 from 73 cinemas, plus £6,000 in previews. That puts it a place ahead of Whit Stillman’s Love & Friendship, grossing a decent £107,000 in its fourth weekend. Holding well, with just an 11% drop is Ciro Guerra’s Embrace of the Serpent, set in the Colombian Amazon. The critically acclaimed black-and-white film has cracked £100,000 in 10 days – only the third film ever to reach that milestone from niche distributor Peccadillo, which specialises in gay and world cinema titles.Admissions updateTickets sold in May are pretty much level with the number for May 2015. For the first five months of the year, admissions are 2% down on the equivalent period a year ago. On the one hand, that’s good news: cinema admissions surged in 2015, after wobbling badly in 2014. On the other hand, it’s less good news: the final quarter last year contributed a big part of that surge, and the 2016 release calendar appears not to have hits equivalent to Spectre and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Adult Life Skills: trailer for the Jodie Whittaker comedy – videoThe futureThanks to the arrival of The Conjuring 2, takings overall are 18% up on the previous frame, but 44% down on the equivalent weekend from 2015, when Jurassic World continued at the top spot. Cinema bookers now have hopes pinned on Independence Day: Resurgence, plus the official opening of The Secret Life of Pets. Alternatives include Elvis & Nixon, starring Michael Shannon and Kevin Spacey; Omer Fast’s Remainder with Tom Sturridge; Penélope Cruz in Ma Ma; Jodie Whittaker in whimsical UK indie Adult Life Skills; Italian crime drama Suburru; and more besides.
