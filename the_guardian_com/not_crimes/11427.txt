The Night Manager stars Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie have ruled out a second series of the BBC1 spy thriller.There had been reports that the BBC were considering a follow-up to the hit John le Carré adaptation, but Hiddleston said “the story feels complete” as the pair promoted the show in the US.According to the Sunday Mirror, Hiddleston, who played spy Jonathan Pine and is now hotly tipped as the next James Bond, said: “As it stands, Pine exists for six hours in a mini-series. The story feels complete.Night Manager comes out on top in Easter TV viewings “I know the rumours about it extending, but none of that is real.”Co-star Laurie, who played arms dealer Richard Roper, agreed, saying: “It’s based on a novel, we’ve got to the end of the novel and John le Carré has yet to write another novel, so in cold practical terms, no, we’re done.”The fate of Pine and Roper was left open at the end of the series, with the latter being driven away by a gang of angry Cairo businessmen, leaving many fans hopeful for a sequel.The Night Manager was based on le Carré’s novel of the same name and although he has not written a follow-up novel, there were reportedly advanced talks with the Ink Factory, the production company run by his two sons, for another series based on the same characters.The BBC’s £20m adaptation of le Carré’s 1993 novel already featured many changes, including the setting, ending and the gender of Olivia Colman’s character Angela Burr.
