10.01pm GMT22:01I’m off into the comments now once I have massaged my aching hands. But thank you for coming, once again, and keeping me company in what feels like a simultaneously pointless and completely vital service.If we didn’t afford a stupid reality show this much attention, we might have to think about actual reality and that would be bloody awful.Keep it virtual, friends. Until next week, same day, same time. And I’d advise you to have a giin handy.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.58pm GMT21:58Next week: well there was a white board with GIIN written on it. This is what Karrren would call her own brand of gin. I can’t wait to see how they ruin gin.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.57pm GMT21:57Jess confidently predicts that Dillon will be back at the house.Even when he doesn’t come back, she doesn’t seem to accept it. Grainne impresses on the rest of the house, how real this shit just got. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.56pm GMT21:56No! She goes back to the house instead. THEN she probably visits the conveniences. So a double firing tonight - Dillon and Sofiane are off in separate taxis like a couple in First Dates who’d rather not go for that drink after the meal.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.55pm GMT21:55It’s getting close to the end now, says Alan. It really doesn’t feel like it.WAIT. Sofiane is also fired. Grainne quietly shits herself.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.55pm GMT21:55Alan can’t deal with folk who have no regard for others, he tells Sofiane. Grainne says she’s won three tasks which isn’t none. Dillon tries to re-design the stupid game after the fact as Alan’s brow darkens and he gets.....the finger.Dillon is gone. No, not Dillon. I’d only just really noticed his eyebrows.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.53pm GMT21:53Dillon gives an impassioned speech a bit like the one Madonna does about turning up in New York with $37 to her name and a desire to make it in the big city. He is so like Madonna. For a moment there, he is in the spotlight but it is quickly snuffed out by Sofiane. The other two want Sofiane to go. Sofiane wants “definitely not me” to go. Hmmmm.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.52pm GMT21:52I really don’t want Grainne to go. Which probably means she’s gone. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.51pm GMT21:51Alana goes back to the house, little believing that she doesn’t have to have a full on verbal slap-fight with the others for her place on the show. I’m surprised too.Alan and his familiars have a quick conflab and they three marked ones are back in the room. Dillon’s face is all defiance and steel. The other two less so. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.50pm GMT21:50Sofiane is bringing back Dillon and Grainne. Graiine????!!! Whut?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.50pm GMT21:50Sofiane gets a tongue-lashing for going off-script during the pitch. Dillon says he stepped back because he didn’t want to talk over the others and look unprofessional, which Al and co would 100% have told him off for.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.48pm GMT21:48Alana is getting heat for not shouting louder over her teammates when their shit ideas took precedence. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.47pm GMT21:47A Gloucester Old Spot has literally just flown past my window.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.47pm GMT21:47Sofiane blames Alana for not coating him off about the rubbish idea sooner. Because he’d have loved that and totally taken it on board.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.46pm GMT21:46“If it was up to you, Super Mario would be known as Fat Plumber,” says Alan leaving everyone unsure whether or not they’d just witnessed his zinger. Was that it? Did I miss an earlier one?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
