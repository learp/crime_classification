Not content with having conquered the internet, cats now appear intent on taking over our cities. London commuters at Clapham Common underground station this morning were greeted with billboards showing cats, cats, and, you guessed it, more cats. The 68 cat photos on display took the place of the usual adverts for food delivery, weight loss services, and dating sites. Even the ticket barriers got a meowkover (sorry) and were branded “catflaps”.The brains behind this purrpaganda (sorry, will stop now) was CATS – the Citizens Advertising Takeover Service. This, in turn, was a project of Glimpse, a group which “aims to use creativity for good”. Earlier this year Glimpse ran a Kickstarter campaign with the rallying cry #catsnotads. Almost 700 people donated a total of £23,000 to the cause and this week the world saw the fruits of their efforts. In a Medium post explaining the purrpose (last one), Glimpse founder James Turner said: “We want to inspire people to think differently about the world and realise they have the power to change it.”Wherever your loyalties in the age-long cat/dog conflict lie, I think we can all agree that #catsnotads is a Good Idea and there should be more of this sort of advertising innovation. Sadiq Khan has appointed a night tsar for London – why not a billboard baron, tasked with bettering the city’s ad spaces with cute animals? Indeed, some city mayors have actually already initiated their own versions of #catsnotads (see Tehran, below). Most of the time, however, advertising takeovers are the result of concerned citizen initiatives. Here are some of the best examples from cities around the world.Paris      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A poster by Bill Posters as part of the Brandalism campaign in Paris in 2015, ahead of the UN climate change summit. Photograph: Benoit Tessier/ReutersLast year, Brandalism activists took over 600 Paris bus shelters with satirical art two days before the start of COP21, the UN climate change conference. The shelters were all owned by JC Decaux, one of the world’s largest outdoor advertising companies, and an official sponsor of COP21. Ads from official sponsors including Air France and GDF were swapped out with posters designed to make a statement about greenwashing and the hypocrisy of many of the sponsor companies. “We knew about the impact of fossil fuels but publicly denied it – Mobil,” read one advert. “We’re sorry that we got caught – Volkswagen,” read another. Joe Elan from Brandalism said: “By sponsoring the climate talks, major polluters such as Air France and GDF-Suez-Engie can promote themselves as part of the solution – when actually they are part of the problem.”MelbourneLukey (@_no_name)Nice little #adtakeover I saw today! Never give up! #invasionday2016 #noprideingenocide #… https://t.co/JZubdYPKyI pic.twitter.com/MGN6UdZkyiJanuary 27, 2016January 26 is a national holiday in Australia, marking the anniversary of the arrival of the British in Australia and the birth of the modern country. “Arrival”, of course, is a nice way to say “invasion”, and not everyone is happy about a national holiday that would seem to ignore what happened to Australia’s indigenous Aboriginal population. This year, protesters decided to make a point with a marketing campaign. Anti-Australia Day posters were placed over existing adverts in Melbourne’s central business district, reading “Sovereignty Never Ceded” and including the slogans #InvasionDay2016 and #NoPrideInGenocideTehran      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A billboard in Tehran displays Blue Window by Henri Matisse. More than 1,500 reproductions of art classics were displayed around the city. Photograph: Behrouz Mehri/AFP/GettyLast year Tehran replaced all its advertising billboards with artwork for 10 days. The project, called A Gallery as Big as a Town, was devised in an attempt to encourage people to visit Tehran’s museums. Despite there not being much artwork featuring cats, the initiative met with a very positive response from the city’s residents. Sadra Mohaqeq, an Iranian journalist, told the Guardian: “For 10 days, people have time off from the usual billboard ads just promoting consumerism. It is going to affect people’s visual taste in a positive manner.”Toronto ❤ #Youdontneedthis #subway #reading #Toronto 👀👍❌A photo posted by Jennifer Lee Dawson (@bigdealdawson) on Sep 15, 2015 at 10:13am PDTLast year the #youdontneedthis campaign encouraged people in Toronto (and later New York) to deface adverts promoting cosmetic surgery. “As a woman, it can be bit infuriating to have to ride a subway on your daily commute and look at these posters,” said one participant. You don’t need a Kickstarter campaign to change the face of advertising, sometimes you just need a pen.New York   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest In 2014 an augmented reality app called No Ad brought the idea of ad-blocking software to the real world. People could hold their phone up to an ad in the New York City subway system and it would be replaced by art. Unfortunately the app was shut down after a year because there wasn’t enough funding to keep continuously updating the content. Perhaps it’s time to Kickstart a No Ad 2.0 which replaces subway ads with dogs? Just a thought.Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion
