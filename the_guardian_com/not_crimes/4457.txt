Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, John le Carré has been looking for targets beyond the murky, mutual, spying of the cold war. He has directed his genuine and growing anger at more topical, straightforward, targets: a large pharmaceutical company (The Constant Gardener), extraordinary rendition (A Most Wanted Man), and Foreign Office/MI6 involvement in the work of private US military contractors (A Delicate Truth).The Night Manager recap: episode five – 'nothing quite as pretty as napalm at night' Twice in his later books, Le Carré (born David Cornwell) has acknowledged help from the human-rights charity Reprieve. He is no friend of MI6, nor of MI5, despite their attempts to forgive their former officer.His constant themes are corruption, money-laundering, rule-breaking and the moral equivalence between those supposedly on “our side” and the enemy. The Night Manager, the much-discussed adaptation now being shown on BBC1 on Sunday nights, is no exception. The question is how plausible it all is.Here are some guidelines. A very senior MI6 officer told the Chilcot inquiry that he and his colleagues were concerned about the UK joining the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, “not because we aimed to do something we knew was illegal, though, of course, by definition, all MI6 activity was illegal, but because we didn’t want to put our feet in the wrong place or get snagged.”The Scott arms-to-Iraq inquiry heard that soon after Saddam Hussein gassed Iraqi Kurds in Halabja in 1988, a senior Foreign Office official wrote: “It could look very cynical if, so soon after expressing outrage over the Iraqi treatment of the Kurds, we adopt a more flexible approach to arms sales.”John le Carré to reveal his 'secret world' in memoir Whitehall did adopt a more flexible approach, but kept it quiet. MI6 was directly involved, with the CIA, in the abduction of two prominent Libyan dissidents subsequently tortured by Gaddafi’s secret police. Phoney companies are par for the course.So, The Night Manager may be surprisingly plausible, as brutal and deeply cynical elements in MI6 and the CIA protect Richard Roper’s illegal arms-dealing and shell companies. Ministry of Defence officials have been known to accept bribes.Jonathan Pine’s infiltration of Roper’s outfit could certainly pass the plausibility test. Least plausible is Angela Burr. A former top MI6 officer would not get away with setting up a separate anti-arms-trader unit with links to the CIA. And would Roper’s contempt for Corky, his erstwhile front man, really blind him into trusting Pine so much, for so long?There are chauffeur-driven Mercedes rather than Aston Martins, and the villains – Roper and his friends – are archetypal Englishmen. There were some classic Le Carré lines in Sunday’s, penultimate, episode: “Anyone can betray anyone,” then, later, “the whole system keeps the country where we want it ... we made Richard Roper”.Yet Pine, helped by Roper’s girlfriend, Jed, is bringing Le Carré and Ian Fleming closer together, however much the incomparable inventor of George Smiley might not like it. No wonder Tom Hiddleston is hot favourite to be the new 007.
