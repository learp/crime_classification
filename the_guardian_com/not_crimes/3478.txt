I had a fantastic weekend’s running. Or perhaps I should say, I watched some fantastic running, then did a (considerably less fantastic) bit myself. On Saturday I took my small fry to the Anniversary Games to watch the athletics, culminating in Mo Farah setting the world’s best time this year in the 5km. An amazing performance given he was running pretty much alone from halfway - no one to push him, just him against the clock. Inspirational stuff, even if his finishing time was probably the point most of us get to the halfway mark in .. Then yesterday the Elmbridge 10km. It always seems to take me a couple of 10km races to ‘warm up’ for the summer, and this has always been a good course for me - flat, albeit mostly on gravelly towpath and very very muggy yesterday. So hooray for a PB! Not by as much as it probably should have been (39m 30sec) but given the previous days epic walking exploits (attempting to leave the Olympic stadium seems to involve walking via Outer Mongolia, and being kettled by marshals near the station for 20 minutes) I was pleased with a 16 second PB. Elmbridge also has a nice tradition of giving out gold medals for the first 100 runners, then silver for the next 100 and so on. So I was delighted to get a gold medal - albeit one of the very last. More importantly for me, a bit of confidence going into the heaviest bit of marathon training for Berlin - 10 weeks now. After all, goes my flawless logic, if I can knock 16 seconds off my 10km PB, I can knock a mere eight seconds of the marathon one, right? Right?So, over to you. Did you watch the ‘proper’ runners in action, did you race yourself or are you still on the mend? As always, share your tips, advice, triumphs and woes below the line.
