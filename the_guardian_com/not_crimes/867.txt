Perhaps it’s Mercury retrograde or the blood moon? Whatever the reason Facebook website was inaccessible for some users on Monday afternoon, its second outage in less than a week.A message displayed on facebook.com said “Sorry, something went wrong. We’re working on it and we’ll get it fixed as soon as we can.” Facebook could not be immediately reached for comment.Facebook – which now has 1.39 billion active monthly users – went down for about 10 minutes on 24 September. The latest outage (or should that be outrage) lasted close to an hour for some.People vented their frustration on Twitter, where Facebook had yet to comment on the outage.
