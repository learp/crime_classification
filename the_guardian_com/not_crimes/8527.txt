The spectacle of the fashion show is a uniquely theatrical one. There have been mise-en-scènes – Kate Moss’s hologram at a McQueen show in 2006, a 256-tonne iceberg at Chanel’s 2010 show and Fendi’s $10m “longest catwalk” on the Great Wall of China from 2008 – that have suggested a level of grandeur and opulence on a par with the ancient Egyptians. Or at least a supercut of an Olympic Opening Ceremony. As the show becomes just as important as the clothes, the move towards ever more awe-inspiring historical venues follows suit. In 2016 it’s all about the palatial show setting as a reminder of the roots. This summer, these are the most fashionable buildings in the world…Westminster AbbeyThe site of one of the key fashion moments in recent memory (the joyful union of Kate Middleton and her McQueen wedding dress), those famous cloisters will be enveloped with Gucci-ness by (former London habitué) Alessandro Michele for a spring/summer show on 2 June. westminster-abbey.org      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Gucci.

Stella Tennant walked during the pre-fall show – that was very “the Scottish Widow gone Bloomsbury” – combining layers of knitwear with tartan. Karl Lagerfeld wanted the “rough romance” of the West Lothian location, which made him sound like an Outlander shipper. historicenvironment.scot      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Chanel’s pre-fall show was in Linlithgow Palace.

Their massively plush country house is testament to their still hugely influential (Miuccia Prada, Christopher Bailey) look. It’s all “lady of the manor goes to art school”. chatsworth.org       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘The Kardashians of their time’: three of the six Mitford sisters who owned the Chatsworth estate.
