The latest novel by Rick Riordan is here! Apollo is being punished by Zeus in the worst way imaginable – being turned into a mortal teenage boy!He manages to reach Camp Half-blood only to find that the camp is in chaos. Campers keep going missing and the terrible monster Python has control of the Oracle at Delphi, so it is impossible to get a prophecy, and the fate of the whole world hangs in the balance.Apollo must find and save the hidden oracle before the Beast has the chance to destroy it, facing challenges like monsters, evil humans and acne!I love Rick Riordan and his latest work did not disappoint me. It is a tale of danger, adventure, friendship and an emotional journey that left me laughing, crying and wanting more. I admire Rick’s writing style; it is very casual so makes you feel as though you are actually talking to the character and he manages to inject humour, even during sad moments. I also like that his plots are not centred around romance; he manages to write convincing and compelling love stories without them dominating or detracting from the rest of the story, which I find really refreshing. Also, of course, I love the fact that his novels are based on mythology and how he manages to incorporate myth and legend so seamlessly into a modern day setting.Rick Riordan is one of my favourite authors of all time and I would recommend The Trials of Apollo to everyone, regardless of whether you have read his other books (although I highly recommend that you read them too!).Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
