Self-described as an author who “once happened to be a spy” rather than a “spy who turned to writing”, John le Carré has kept readers hooked on his astute and thrilling political and espionage novels for more than 50 years. But equally tantalising for fans are the very rare glimpses into his personal life; le Carré is as known for his extraordinary career and formidable knowledge of global politics and espionage, as he is for treasuring his privacy.As the actor Toby Jones, who appeared in the film adaptation of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy says: “It will be fascinating to see how le Carré deals with self-revelation in his memoirs. There is such an authenticity to the overheard world of his books that you feel he might have shared an awful lot of his experience already.”You have read the first extracts of le Carré’s first autobiography The Pigeon Tunnel, the most anticipated literary memoir of the year.
