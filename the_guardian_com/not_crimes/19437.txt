To mark 50 years since the publication of Nairn’s London, a classic, idiosyncratic and very personal guide to the city, we’ve been asking our readers to tell us about their own favourite London buildings. We’ll put together a gallery of their best submissions later in the week, but to tide us over, here’s a devilishly tricky quiz for you (or ludicrously easy, if you’re familiar with Nairn’s work). Who wrote each building description, one of our readers or Ian Nairn?Is there a London building you’re desperate to tell us about? There’s still time to contribute, if it tickles your fancy.
