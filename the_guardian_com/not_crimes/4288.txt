But the older I got and the longer I worked in this industry, the more I realised that it’s bullshit! And, worse, that I was complicit in allowing it to happen.”Kunis, 33, referred to another incident after she formed a production company with three women, in which an “influential male producer” described her as “soon to be Ashton’s wife and baby momma” during a discussion about a possible work project.The Black Swan star wrote: “He reduced my value to nothing more than my relationship to a successful man and my ability to bear children.“It ignored my (and my team’s) significant creative and logistical contributions. We withdrew our involvement in the project.”Geena Davis to produce documentary about Hollywood gender inequality Kunis said she vowed to stand up to sexist comments, adding: “I’m done compromising; even more so I’m done with being compromised.“So from this point forward, when I am confronted with one of these comments, subtle or overt, I will address them head on; I will stop in the moment and do my best to educate.“If this is happening to me, it is happening more aggressively to women everywhere.”Kunis and Kutcher, who married in July last year, are expecting their second child after the birth of their daughter Wyatt Isabelle in October 2014.
