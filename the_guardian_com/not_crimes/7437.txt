The largest tidal energy project in Europe can get under way after permission was granted for the first stage in the Pentland Firth.A demonstration project of up to six turbines will be built in the water between Orkney and the Scottish mainland following the decision by the Scottish government.Energy minister Fergus Ewing said: "Today we have granted consent to MeyGen Limited to develop the largest tidal turbine array in Europe and the first commercial project off these shores."This is a major step forward for Scotland's marine renewable energy industry. When fully operational, the 86 megawatt array could generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of 42,000 homes – around 40% of homes in the Highlands. This … is just the first phase for a site that could eventually yield up to 398 megawatts."Speaking at the Scottish renewables marine conference, Ewing also announced that developers Aquamarine Power Limited and Pelamis Wave Power are to share a slice of a £13m wave "first array" support programme, part of the Scottish government's marine renewables commercialisation fund.Ewing said the tide is turning for the wave sector."We must tackle climate change. We need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels through better and more efficient uses of energy. Marine energy – a home-grown technology with huge potential – is part of the solution," he said.The Carbon Trust has estimated that wave and tidal resources could provide 20% of the UK's electricity if fully developed.Lang Banks, director of WWF Scotland, said: "This is a significant announcement and a major boost for the marine renewable industry in Scotland."But he added: "There is little point in generating huge amounts of marine renewable energy on Scotland's islands if it cannot also be got to the mainland, we now need UK and Scottish ministers to find a way forward that enables us to harness the full potential of this clean energy source."
