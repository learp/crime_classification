But so far you're not very clever. For those of you who asked honestly, I thank you, and love you very much.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.13pm GMT14:13s1nnah asks:Whats the average yearly royalty on something like Bat Out of Hell … you must still be selling copies?

Do you consider yourself a singer who can act or an actor who can sing? Do you ever regret the fallout with Jim Steinman, it seems you two made a good team, for a while anyway!  Guardian contributor MeatL0af 02 November 2016 2:04pmMy health is fine. 2) Rob Cavallo, the producer of Hang Cool Teddybear - look him up - he said it best: Meat Loaf is an actor who acts like he can sing. Jim Steinman in 42 years have never had an argument or fallout, that is media BS. And that's what that is. You obviously believe everything you read, so if you believe anything you read, I have some land in Florida that I'll be more than happy to sell you.My next question to you is: have you bought the new record Braver Than We Are? Jim Steinman considers it the best record we've ever done. We changed everything around differently than we'd done before. Can you imagine the same artist painting the same rose for 40 years? The same band that does the same kind of material year after year, people get tired and go away fast. I've been doing this for 50 years in February.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.06pm GMT14:06karlcronin asks:How do you deal with fame, instant recognition, lack of privacy?  Guardian contributor MeatL0af 02 November 2016 2:01pmI don't. I'm a human being. People come up to me and talk to me - I'm no different to you, if people come up and talk to you about things. It's the same thing. I don't always like having my picture taken, but I'm sure you don't either.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.06pm GMT14:06Doug Neilson asks:You still tour and perform. Do you like/need to do that? Do to plan to go on forevermore? Put your feet up and play the records.  Guardian contributor MeatL0af 02 November 2016 2:00pmYes, I still tour and perform, but I also do film and I'm going to concentrate on that in the next few years. I would suggest you put your feet up and you play the records, because if you do put your feet up and play the records, there's a lot you can learn from playing those records. It's obvious that you have listened to them, but you've not heard them. My suggestion would be for you to actually hear the records.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.04pm GMT14:04RaoulChateaubriand asks:Do you still think you should have been given Total Eclipse of the Heart?  Guardian contributor MeatL0af 02 November 2016 1:59pmI never thought that! I think Bonnie Tyler did an extraordinary job. If I was meant to have sung it, I would have sung it. Bonnie Tyler was meant for it, and she did an incredible job. Absolutely fantastic.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.04pm GMT14:0425aubrey asks:Mr Meatloaf, have you ever been offered to have a sing off with Noddy Holder about who could shout “It’s Christmas!”the best?   Guardian contributor MeatL0af 02 November 2016 1:58pmFirst thing, Meat Loaf is not one word, but two. So if you're gonna ask me a question, make sure you spell my name right. It's on every album I've ever done. It's on my Facebook.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.02pm GMT14:02Borucs asks:I read somewhere that you were taken aback by the raciness of Rocky Horror during its final rehearsals. Surely nothing would shock after performing in the musical Hair?

It was the weekend before Led Zeppelin were about to play at Knebworth. When your track, with that incredible guitar solo, on the jukebox came on, I immediately started scoring triple twenties ... slight exaggeration but my motivation went up. Any chance you can write another record like that?  Guardian contributor MeatL0af 02 November 2016 1:56pmDon't ever change that story - you definitely scored triple twenties.Updatedat 2.01pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.58pm GMT13:58Ollie Tipler asks:Meat, would you point me in the right direction to help character development in a live performance?  Guardian contributor MeatL0af 02 November 2016 1:56pmYes, to build a real character you need to do what is called: backstory them. You need to start the character when it was born, who were its parents, what school did it go to, was it an athlete, was it bullied, who was this person that you're trying to find? That will tell you who the character is. Now, however old you think the character is at the time of what you're doing, you keep referring to the backstory, and you'll get more and more information about the character you're about to play.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.57pm GMT13:57SkavArt asks:Are you now able to talk about Fight Club? And are you in any other movie/TV roles in the near future?  Guardian contributor MeatL0af 02 November 2016 1:53pmNo. I've starred in 61 films, five Broadway shows, two Shakespeares, off-Broadway shows, standup comedy, guest hosted a TV show, and was the host of a game show. Why? To experience everything. I'm not done yet. I've also directed a film and six videos, but there is a lot more to experience. You can never stop learning.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
