One of the worst parts of being a parent, genuinely, is having to watch children’s TV with your kids. At first glance, during your tentative early dips into the channels you wouldn’t have touched with a bargepole three months earlier, all of it seems exactly the same. It’s either too loud or too stupid or too lazy.And to be fair, a lot of it is – I’ve adhered to a strict “no live action” rule since my son was born, since all kids’ shows that star actual people tend to come off as the kind of thing serial killers post to their next victims. But dig deep enough and you’ll find a handful of children’s television programmes that – whisper it – are actually quite good. If you’re a new parent, about to navigate the choppy waters of preschool TV, please cling to these few good shows as hard as you can. Take my advice as a grizzled old veteran.Hey Duggee (CBeebies)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Dizzyingly brilliant … Hey Duggee. Photograph: BBCIf, in December, you notice that the Guardian’s annual best TV list contains a weird little outlier about a giant scout leader dog, you’ll know to blame me. Hey Duggee is, simply put, terrific. It looks like nothing else on TV – all the characters are pared down and geometric, the locations are often just Kubrickesque blocks of colour, the music is old-timey gramophone fare culled from the BBC archive – and it seems as much made for parents as it is for kids. There are antelopes who whine about farmers’ markets, put-upon submarine-captain parents teetering on the brink of breakdowns and sporadic nods to Wes Anderson movies. To get started, try the episode entitled The Puppet Show Badge; I won’t spoil it for you, but the execution is dizzyingly brilliant.Sarah and Duck (CBeebies)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   It’s a treat … Sarah and Duck. Photograph: Karrot EntertainmentI have to admit to being a late conversion to Sarah and Duck. On the surface, it seems like another slow, dull show about nothing, which exists purely to keep toddlers occupied while you put the tea on. But let it in for a second and Sarah and Duck will take up residence. The characters just have a little bit more to them than is usually required, which makes the series feel preposterously rich. For example, one peripheral character is an old lady whose only friend is a bag that seems to have taken against her long ago for an unknown reason. The best thing about Sarah and Duck, though, is the lovingly crafted incidental music that ebbs and flows throughout each episode. It’s a treat.The clean, green and slightly bonkers world of CBeebies | Sophie Elmhirst Lily’s Driftwood Bay (Nick Jr)This is ostensibly an animation about a little girl who lives in a beach hut with her dad and has adventures with the animals on the bay. But it’s also unbearably sad at times, too. One episode tackles how the characters deal with the sudden death of their friend – possibly, it’s insinuated, as a reflection of the recent death of the main character’s mother – and it’s dealt with in a way that’s both sensitive and matter of fact. Don’t be tricked into thinking Lily’s Driftwood Bay is solely about grief, though. Dolly Parton pops up from time to time too, so that’s fun.Peppa Pig (Channel 5)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Infectious … Peppa Pig. Photograph: Channel 5Clearly, there’s a lot wrong with Peppa Pig, not least in its openly disparaging portrayal of dads. But there’s a reason why kids go loopy for Peppa Pig: it’s especially well made. The voice work is infectious, the storylines often jag off into unexpected areas and Brian Blessed is in it sometimes, which is basically the highest compliment you can give a TV show. You’ve probably heard that it’s annoying, but, trust me, it’s one of the best ones. That’s how ropey most children’s TV is.Teletubbies (CBeebies)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Revamped … Teletubbies. Photograph: Jeremy Porter/DHX MediaDragged back from the evil clutches of ironic nostalgia, the revamped Teletubbies is possibly even an improvement on the original. Watch a full episode of the old series on YouTube if you like; it’s almost superhumanly dull. Segments crawl along on their belly for what seems like hours, then die into nothing. Humans pop up and tell stories so abjectly tedious they might legally qualify as punishment. And the Teletubbies themselves were staggeringly creepy. The new version, though, manages to be tighter and brighter and funnier, and much easier for parents to sit through. That said, the Teletubbies still treat the Noo-Noo like a trafficked slave. God, I feel for the Noo-Noo.What are the shows helping you through parenthood? Let me know below. For the love of God, let me know below.
