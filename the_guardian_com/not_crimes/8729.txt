Britain's rain-sodden summer shows no sign of mending its miserable ways, with another day of thunderstorms and torrential downpours expected on Wednesday.Forecasters are predicting that up to 15mm of rain could fall in an hour in some places as the period of unseasonably wet weather that has brought flooding up and down the country drags on.The Environment Agency has three flood warnings – one in the south-west and two in the Midlands – and 26 flood alerts in place across England, while the Met Office has issued an amber warning of rain for south-eastern areas of Scotland and yellow warnings across large swaths of southern and northern England.A Met Office spokesman said: "The public should be prepared for the likelihood of localised flooding, particularly in the amber area."Gemma Plumb, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, warned that bursts of torrential rain could fall on already saturated ground, increasing the chances of flooding."Scotland and northern England will see spells of heavy, persistent rain today and there are indications that there could be some torrential, thundery outbreaks," she said."Elsewhere there will be showers, which could be persistent and heavy in some areas especially across southern and easterly parts of England."Forecasters predicted rainfall totals of around 20-30mm, but said double that amount could fall in local areas.Plumb said a further band of heavy, persistent rain would move in from the south-west during Thursday, increasing the flooding threat. More showers are expected in England and Wales on Friday."The rain is falling on already saturated ground and river catchments are already at very high levels so further problems are to be expected," she added. Sunday, however, could provide some respite from the rain with drier spells forecast.Showers hit most parts of the UK on Tuesday, causing problems to the transport network and public events, including the England cricket match in Manchester.The A35 in Dorset, which was shut by flooding, remained closed in both directions between the A37 and A3066 this morning.One of the country's largest agricultural shows was also cancelled after just a day because of the appalling weather.The annual Great Yorkshire Show in Harrogate began on Tuesday and was due to run until Thursday but organisers decided to pull the plug after one day.A spokeswoman for the £2.2m event said: "It is extremely upsetting because of all the tremendous hard work which has gone into the organising, as well as the great disappointment for visitors."The recent rainy weather has also forced the government and Olympic organisers to draw up contingency plans to deal with the inclement British summer, following a series of meetings to predict the extent to which London 2012 could be adversely affected by the dismal conditions.
