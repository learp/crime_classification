This is the second book about Fin, a boy who lives on the Pirate Stream, a magical parallel world, and Marrill, who one day happened to get onto a ship which took her onto the Pirate Stream. In the first book Marrill met Fin who is unable to be remembered by anyone except her. He grew up in an orphanage, and his quest is to find his mother and to be remembered. Marrill goes back to the Pirate Stream in this second book as she gets a message that her world is in danger and she and her babysitter are sent onto the Stream in the babysitter’s car.They meet up with Fin on the ship she went onto the Pirate Stream in the first book. It is owned by Ardent, a wizard. In this story, they are trying to find out about the mysterious Iron Tide, a curse supposedly from the Iron Master. They use their Map to Everywhere which they pieced together in the first book. It tells them how to get to the Shattered Archipelago, the place in the legends where the Iron Tide seemingly originates. They also find a stone which mentions The Syphon of Monerva, which can grant wishes.They see the Iron ship, and to get away from it, they decide to go down the whirlpool to Monerva, despite the danger. While in Monerva they encounter all sorts of weird creatures and have to battle with the Salt Sand King; Serth, the Oracle, whom they thought they had killed in the first book; and The Iron Master. All of these people want the Syphon of Monerva to grant them a wish. So do Fin and Marrill, who have to try and stop them, or else Marrill’s world will be destroyed, as well as the Pirate Stream. The book was cool because the parallel world is so well imagined and described. It is full of suspense and you can really feel how Fin is desperate to be remembered and for his life to make sense. I can’t wait for the third book! Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
