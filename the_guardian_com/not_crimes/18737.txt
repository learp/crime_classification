Foo Fighters have been confirmed as the second headliners of Glastonbury 2017. The band announced the news at a secret gig in Frome, Somerset, on Friday evening.The rock group were scheduled to perform at the festival in 2015, but were forced to axe a summer of live commitments when their frontman, Dave Grohl, broke his leg during a concert. They were replaced on the bill by Florence + the Machine – while Grohl subsequently spent the next few months performing from a giant throne.“We’re incredibly lucky to have the Foo Fighters headlining on the Saturday night this year,” festival organiser Emily Eavis said. “It was obviously devastating when they had to pull out in 2015 - and the thought, effort and generosity they’ve put into this announcement is just unbelievable.”Many speculated that a Foo Fighters Glastonbury announcement might be made earlier this week, when boarding cards for Obelisk Airlines featuring pyramid symbols arrived through fans’ front doors. This was followed by a mysterious countdown on their official website and a number of other clues dotted across the internet.RachMcP (@RachMcP72)Anyone else get a special delivery from @foofighters today?? #glastonbury2017 pic.twitter.com/u2N7QqKK2cFebruary 18, 2017Their gig on Friday saw the band swapping their normal stadium-sized venues for the Cheese and Grain, a building which has a capacity of 500 in its main hall. “I’m so happy that we’ve been able to help shine a light on Somerset’s local music scene by having one of the world’s biggest bands play in Frome. The Cheese and Grain is a wonderful, not-for-profit venue, which I’m very proud to be a patron of, and it was our first suggestion when the band asked where might be good to do a secret show. They’ve certainly put it on the map now,” Eavis added.Foo Fighters will headline the Pyramid stage on Saturday, Glastonbury have confirmed, marking their first appearance at the Somerset festival since 1998.Radiohead will top the bill at this year’s festival on Friday, with the third headliner yet to be announced.
