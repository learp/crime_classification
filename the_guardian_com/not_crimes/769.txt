When I set out I looked over my shoulderat my country falling away beneath me,the shining reservoir and sewage farm,the textbook motorway and ring-road,telling myself in so many words: no matter,everything will be here and almost the samesupposing I ever choose to return and find it;I am the one who will first become a stranger.But the will of others is rightly or not suchthat none of us can be certain of our choices;history does not exist to benefit ourselvesand bring us peace and homecoming at last.History flies onward like the lonely albatrosslaunched in the beginning from its high cliffthen riding the wind until it decides enoughis enough and lands roughly where it pleases.
