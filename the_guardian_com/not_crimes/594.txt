London’s film critics were in lockstep with most of their peers around the globe as they gave their top honour to musical romance La La Land on Sunday. Damien Chazelle’s third movie won film of the year after being nominated in six categories. Ahead of the London Film Critics’ Circle award ceremony, Barry Jenkins’s Moonlight and Whit Stillman’s Love & Friendship led with seven nominations apiece, and each movie went home with two. One of these they had to split between them: best supporting actor, which was a tie between Moonlight’s Mahershala Ali and Love & Friendship’s Tom Bennett. The latter film’s star, Kate Beckinsale, took the best British or Irish actress award for her performance as the toweringly bitchy Lady Susan. The actor thanked Stillman, Bennett, and those women who had been marching around the world on Saturday.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Kate Beckinsale: ‘Austen’s Lady Susan is like Emma on steroids’ Best supporting actress went to Moonlight’s Naomie Harris, while best actress went to Isabelle Huppert – although not for hotly tipped rape revenge comedy Elle (which isn’t out in the UK until March) but rather Mia Hansen-Løve’s drama Things to Come, in which she plays a lecturer struggling after her husband leaves her. Huppert also took the Dilys Powell award for excellence in film, and in her speech, thanked her late friend Alan Rickman, who she said she was “thinking about with emotion”.The best British/Irish film prize went to Ken Loach’s I, Daniel Blake, a drama about an unwell carpenter struggling with the benefits system. Picking up his prize, Loach praised distributor eOne for arranging for the film to be screened at community centres and other venues where those who might not usually go to the cinema would see it. But he said he had declined suggestions to screen it directly for MPs, as they were already aware of the situation. “We have to conclude,” said Loach, that the government knows what they’re doing and they’re treating the most vulnerable people with a conscious cruelty that’s really unacceptable.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Loach went on to draw a link between the election of Donald Trump and the rise of the far right in Europe with “the way we treat the most desperate people who are forgotten, who are ignored, told they don’t count”.The eligibility criteria of the UK awards led to further surprises, such as László Nemes taking best director for Son of Saul, which took the best foreign language Oscar last year. More predictable were wins for Manchester By the Sea in the screenplay and actor categories (the latter for Casey Affleck). Toni Erdmann, Maren Ade’s German comedy, took the foreign language film of the year prize; a trick which it is strongly tipped to repeat at next month’s Oscars.
