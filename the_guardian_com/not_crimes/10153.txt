A showdown between the conservation lobby and the construction industry will take place on Monday afternoon in parliament, as a committee of MPs questions experts on whether the government's proposals for sweeping reforms to planning regulations should go ahead.The fight pits the chancellor, George Osborne, and the local government secretary, Eric Pickles, against countryside campaigners and conservationists. At issue is whether the regulations should be loosened so that house-builders, retailers, industries and other commercial concerns should be allowed greater access to prime land, including the green belt.Simon Jenkins, chairman of the National Trust, will give evidence to the communities and local government select committee. The Home Builders Federation and the British Property Federation will also appear, making the case that the UK needs urgently to invest in vital infrastructure such as homes and industry.Jenkins is expected to argue that the proposed reforms risk a commercial free-for-all in which decades of protection for the countryside will be swept aside in favour of large building projects.Neil Sinden, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: "The government aspires to be the greenest government ever, but it will not achieve this admirable ambition with a 'business as usual' approach to economic growth. Planning reform gives an early opportunity for improvement. [The government] shouldintroduce a radically revised national planning policy framework with strong safeguards for nature and the landscape."Obtaining planning permission for any development – from housing to wind farms, waste treatment plants or out-of-town supermarkets – is usually difficult and costly, as local authorities have strong powers of veto.Developers argue that this is hampering growth prospects, pointing to the fact that house-building rates are far lower than they need to be to offer affordable housing to those in need.Reforms to the complex planning system were one of the key promises made by Osborne on becoming chancellor.He announced that under streamlined rules there would be a presumption in favour of "sustainable development", meaning that local authorities should look for reasons to go ahead with new projects on sites that previously might have been protected.This will, ministers have made clear, include considering building on land that is currently zoned as green belt, a move that has angered many green campaigners.But other groups have supported greater freedom in planning. William Worsley, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said: "For years, national planning policy has undervalued the countryside and failed to meet the needs of rural areas. It is well documented that the countryside has become part dormitory, part theme park and part retirement home.Rural businesses and communities have the same needs for jobs, homes and services that urban areas have, but rural England has suffered from urban-centric policies for decades, leading to a countryside that is less sustainable and less self-sufficient."One of the problems is that the terms under which local authorities should change their rules have been only very vaguely defined, and opponents of the plans say it is unclear what sorts of development would be termed "sustainable". Countryside campaigners fear that the new presumption will give councils the right to ride roughshod over environmental protections.Joan Walley, a Labour MP and chair of parliament's environmental audit committee, which is also examining the proposals, called on the government to bring forward more detail: "If the new planning framework protects our green belt and countryside, as the government claims, then there should be no problem in defining sustainable development more clearly to avoid misinterpretation."Another odd aspect of the plans is that, according to the UK's wind industry association, Renewable UK, the plans could hamper some forms of development while encouraging others. Onshore wind farms would face increased hurdles under the proposals, while developments such as out-of-town shopping centres would be made easier.In this debate, the role of the National Trust will be central. As one of the UK's biggest member organisations, it commands respect across the political spectrum, and its leading figures – Jenkins and Fiona Reynolds, director-general – have shown a willingness to stand up to ministers and other vested interests.At the front of ministers' minds will be the forest sell-off debacle earlier this year, which saw one of the first defeats of a major coalition government policy.The proposal by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to parcel out public forests, some to be sold to the highest bidder and others to be looked after by charities, was met with widespread opposition, from country grandees to the Socialist Workers party.Ministers will also be well aware that the same charities that are now voicing concerns over the planning regulation proposals were instrumental in forcing the rethink on the forestry proposals, which resulted in the environment minister, Caroline Spelman, making a humiliating climbdown.Although the National Trust did not adopt an official position on the forestry sell-off, it canvassed its members and provided a forum for them to make their views known. Crucially, the fact that the National Trust – one of the biggest owners and managers of woodland for public access in the UK today – was not consulted in any way before the government announced its proposals contributed to the U-turn, because it was perceived that in failing to gather this kind of support, the government had acted hastily and without sound advice.The government is anxious not to be seen to make the same mistake this time, but it may be too late. The National Trust remains unconvinced by the reassurances given so far that the new planning laws will not mean a free-for-all. If ministers press ahead with their plans without concessions, they risk once again the wrath of middle England.
