The long-awaited return of Jesus may be upon us sooner than expected. The website Birth Movies Death reports that the John Turturro film Going Places, currently shooting in New York, is a vehicle for Jesus Quintana, Turturro’s character from the Coen brothers’s 1998 classic, The Big Lebowski.Going Places had been thought to be a remake of 1974 French caper Les Valseuses, in which two petty crooks (to be played by Turturro and Bobby Cannavale) rope a woman (Audrey Tautou) into their schemes. Susan Sarandon is thought to play an ex-con who also joins the gang. Turturro has long expressed interest in a spin-off expanding his character, an egocentric bowler in a hairnet whose sexual deviancy is referenced by John Goodman’s Walter Sobchak.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Joel and Ethan Coen are not thought to be creatively involved in Going Places, but their long history with Turturro makes their blessing more likely.
