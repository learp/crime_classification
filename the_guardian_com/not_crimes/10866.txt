1 La La Land (12A)(Damien Chazelle, 2016, US) 128 mins   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Not quite a studio musical like they used to make, but this award-scooping retro-modern delight recalls the golden ages of Hollywood, jazz and youthful romance.

Lonergan orchestrates the emotional drama with such wisdom, wit and sense of place, it never feels like a formula.3 Endless Poetry (15)(Alejandro Jodorowsky, 2016, Fra/Chi/Jap/UK) 128 mins   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest No need for CGI or special effects when you have a bottomless imagination like Jodorowsky’s – still undimmed at 87 years old. Here, he renders his creative awakening in bohemian Chile as a beguiling piece of magical-surrealist performance art, taking in theatre, poetry, circus performance and even puppetry.4 A Monster Calls (12A)(Juan Antonio Bayona, 2016, Spa/US) 108 mins   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest A family fable with horror-movie imagery, this hits the right emotional notes thanks to fine special effects and sincere performances – from young newcomer Lewis MacDougall, Felicity Jones as his dying mother and Liam Neeson as the friendly tree giant who arrives at a time of need.5 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (12A)(Gareth Edwards, 2016, US) 134 mins   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest If you’ve been living on some distant galactic outpost, this Star Wars spin-off might have managed to pass you by. Suffice to say, you get your money’s worth: epic action, alien worlds and a likable cast signed up for the all-important mission.
