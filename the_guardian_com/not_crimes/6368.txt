The recipeWipe clean 400g of courgettes and trim their stalks. Using a vegetable peeler, cut the courgettes into long, wide ribbons running the peeler down the length of the courgettes.Put the courgette ribbons in a wide mixing bowl with 4 tbsp of olive oil, and some sea salt and black pepper. Lightly toast 4 tbsp of pine kernels in a dry, shallow pan, until pale gold. Warm a ridged griddle pan, then add the courgettes and let them cook until golden and lightly blistered.Pour 2 tbsp of olive oil into the bowl, then shred 10g of basil leaves and add them. Tip in the toasted pine kernels. Squeeze in 1 tbsp of lemon juice. As the courgettes come from the grill, tip them into the basil dressing and toss gently.Place 2 mounds of fresh ricotta on plates then add the grilled ribbons of courgette. Spoon the basil and pine kernel dressing over the ricotta and serve. I think some bruschetta would be good here. Enough for 2.The trickWatch the pine kernels closely on their short route from ivory to golden brown. They burn in seconds and will be very bitter if they do. There is no need to salt the courgettes. Place the strips flat on the griddle, then, when the underside is patchily gold and black, turn them over and cook the other side. They are best dressed while still warm, as the gentle heat teases out the flavour of the basil.The twistTarragon and mint, chopped or torn, will introduce notes of aniseed and coolness to the dish if you use them with, or instead of, the basil. You could involve garlic if you like â€“ either crushed into a paste and tossed with the raw courgettes, or roasted and mashed into the basil dressing. You could also bring in some ribbons of cooked pappardelle, folding them through the grilled courgettes and the dressing.
