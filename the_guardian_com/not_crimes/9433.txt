The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set withMachine Woman: 10.08.15   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  In between techno sets this glitches in all the right places. It also gives people a breather and the chance to regroup, which I’d advise before I get into my set.The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor James Ruskin: Work (Steve Rachmad remix)   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Other than being an absolute classic, this has such huge energy while having very little to it at points. There are those amazing sections with lots of space; that is a real skill.The track that currently gets the most rewinds Lana Del Rey: Cruel World    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’ve cheated here, it’s just been stuck in my head for the last week, over and over, so it is literally on rewind up there… ”Get a little bit of bourbon in ya/ Get a little bit suburban and go crazy”. I’ve been teetotal for six years now; my mind has a sick sense of humour.The track I wish I’d signed to my label Nathan Fake: The Sky Was Pink (James Holden remix)   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  I’ve had people crying on the dancefloor when I’ve played this record. When music makes people feel like this there really is nothing better; all musicians are looking to share emotions with their audience.The track I wish I’d never playedBizarre Inc: Playing With Knives (Quadrant Mix)   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Back in Florence a few new years ago I had been pushing the crowd into a more 90s techno direction, and decided to push it further and drop this record. Suffice to say it went down like a lead balloon; when they switched the lights on at the end, I realised I had been playing to barely legal club kids and it was just too far back for any of them to appreciate the value of rave.The track I’d play at my auntie’s weddingLana Del Rey: Serial Killer   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest You’ve met my aunt, right?The track I’d play at sunset in IbizaFuture Sound of London: Papua New Guinea   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  One of those tunes that everyone knows, even if you don’t know the name or artist. From the blissful sun-soaked bassline, to the shimmering synths, to those broken drums, right through to that vocal sample, everything about this track is spot on.The track I’d play at my funeral Rhythim Is Rhythim: Strings Of Life   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It’s a classic, but so beautiful and with so much energy. It just sums up my warped yet wonderful life.Rebekah plays The Rainbow Venues, Birmingham, Saturday 27 February
