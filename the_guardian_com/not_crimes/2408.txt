Heartbreaking scenes of self-censorship on Loose Women, as the ladies announce they are simply “too scared” to let viewers know which way they voted in the Brexit referendum. “We’re half and half,” explained Coleen Nolan of the panel’s psephological split. “And none of us want to sit here and say how we voted.” “We’re all too scared,” confirmed Saira Khan. “That’s why none of us are saying how we voted,” added Linda Robson.To put this into perspective, the discussion came in the same show that Robson gave viewers the full details of the time she urinated all over the floor of the loo on a Manchester to London train, then accidentally pressed the door’s open button “mid-stream”, to reveal herself to the guard with her knickers round her ankles and “mess all over the floor”.Well, now. Surely the time has come to ask which of us wants to live in a country where the Loose Women simply do not dare to be candid?
