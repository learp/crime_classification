From London’s Walthamstow marshes to Thirsk in North Yorkshire, the mayflower has been in unprecedented early bloom.A survey by the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) found that just over 600 wildflower species have begun to bloom across Britain and Ireland, far more than the 20-30 that are usually expected at this time of year.Kevin Walker, head of science at the BSBI, said the trend was down to the mild winter and a lack of frost. Last year’s December was the warmest since records began in 1910.“Certainly last year there were an awful lot of things in flower, but this year it’s been more pronounced,” he said. “When we looked at the normal flowering times for the species, around three-quarters were probably continuing to flower late because we didn’t have any significant cold weather before Christmas that allowed them to carry on.”A fifth of the species spotted were early bloomers, according to Walker, who said reports of blooming hawthorns – named the mayflower after its month for flowering – were the most surprising. “The fact that some of the shrubs that would normally flower in May were spotted was very unusual.”More than 850 volunteers surveyed their local area for wild plants in flower between 1 and 4 January, spotting 612 species flowering. Other spring-flowering plants already in bloom were lesser celandine, cow parsley and sweet violet.Average global readings show that 2015 was the hottest year recorded, with temperatures reaching 1C higher than that recorded between 1850 and 1900.Grahame Madge, senior press officer at the Met Office, said that December and January had been especially mild: “With weather you’ve always got natural variability, but if you add one degree warming in the mix it means extremes can be a little bit more extreme.”But he added that the mild weather might not last. “Meteorologically we are only just past the midpoint of winter, we still have a month of winter left and we know that we could have very cold conditions into March.”
