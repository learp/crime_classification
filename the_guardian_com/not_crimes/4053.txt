11.44pm BST23:44And that’s that. Congratulations to Ukraine, who might be pleased about winning Eurovision now, but only because they haven’t realised that they’ve basically just invited Heidi Stephens to rampage drunk through their country.With that, it’s time for me to say goodbye. Of all the Eurovision song contests I’ve ever liveblogged, this has certainly been the most recent. Thanks for your comments and tweets and general moral support. God knows I needed it. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m @StuHeritage, but I suspect you might not. Thanks again, world, and goodnight.Updatedat 11.51pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.42pm BST23:42Heidi StephensIt’s goodbye from Stockholm, but first a giant thanks to my lovely friend Alice, who has been amazing at helping me keep up with everything that’s going on backstage on what has been a crazy, crazy night.I’m on Twitter @heidistephens if you’d like to say hi, but right now I’m off to the Euroclub to dance the night away.

And how terrible for next year’s Eurovision, now that it’s going to be full of miserable UK garage songs about all the horrible things that happened to their grandparents.Updatedat 11.42pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.39pm BST23:39Heidi StephensThe press room has gone ballistic, the Ukrainians are screaming, and the Russians are in tears.

If my maths is right, Ukraine just pipped Australia, and Russia won’t be able to make up the difference.

But is it all meaningless, since the public vote hasn’t been revealed yet? I wish I knew. I basically haven’t got a clue what happens after this bit. If anyone makes Georgian Kasabian win, though, I’m going to have the world’s biggest tantrum.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.18pm BST23:18Petra is being unflappable in the face of all these national jury idiots.
