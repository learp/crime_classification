Kenneth Clarke in Laura Kuenssberg’s documentary on Brexit (Last night’s TV, G2, 9 August) commented that “the referendum result was not simply about Europe”. Exactly so. It occurs to me that the success of the leave campaign’s bus message (“We send the EU £350m a week – let’s fund our NHS instead”) had little to do with Europe but indicates the high priority the electorate gives to more spending on the NHS. Our government might do well to recognise this.Derek GambellBromley, Kent• No suggestions for an affordable holiday in the UK (Any answers?, Money, 13 August) but a question.

I tried a Blue Vinney cone overlooking Chesil Beach in Dorset a few years ago. I love blue cheese; I adore proper ice-cream; but one mouthful of this disgusting concoction was quite enough. Still, it helped me get my own back on the thieving seagull race. A hungry bird swallowed it whole and I swear there was a look of surprise on its face for a full two minutes.
