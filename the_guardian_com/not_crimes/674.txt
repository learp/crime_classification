Private equity veteran Guy Hands has priced the flotation of his Infinis Energy business at the bottom of the announced range amid speculation that investors' appetite for a wave of initial public offerings (IPOs) could be waning.Meanwhile, Bonmarché, the over-50s womenswear retailer, has priced its IPO at 200p before its debut on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market.Infinis, which operates 147 power plants across Britain, priced its IPO at 260p a share – the bottom of its original range of 260p to 310p. The shares were unchanged at 260p after an hour of trading at 9am.Hands's Terra Firma outfit raised £234m by reducing its stake in the company to 69%. The sale valued Infinis at £780m.The London market has been gripped by IPO fever in recent months as investors set aside grudges about past overpriced flotations in search of dividends and growth prospects.Massive demand for Royal Mail's shares last month highlighted investor appetite and encouraged a further wave of prospective floats, including property website Zoopla and furniture chain DFS.But some of the gloss came off the market this week when two life insurance flotations appeared to have flopped. Just Retirement floated on Tuesday at 225p a share – the middle of its 200p to 250p range – but the shares fell on the first day of trading.Just Retirement's disappointing debut came the day before Partnership Assurance, which floated in June, warned of slowing sales. The warning sent both companies' shares down further and both have been left trading well below their offer prices.Investors have warned that it might only take one or two badly managed IPOs to dampen enthusiasm for new share issues.Fund managers were angered in 2010 when they were hit by losses soon after the flotations of Betfair and Ocado. Investor groups told advisers on IPOs they did not expect companies coming to market to wring every last penny from them.Bonmarché, which is owned by buyout firm Sun European Partners, will raise £40m when it starts trading next Wednesday. It has 264 stores and expects its target market of women over 55 to increase by 16% in the 10 years to 2018.
