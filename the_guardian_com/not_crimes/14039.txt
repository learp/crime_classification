Jennifer Lawrence tipped Jodie Foster to run for US president as the Silence of the Lambs star was honoured by Bafta Los Angeles at the Britannia Awards.The ceremony, which celebrates British talent and Hollywood stars with a “strong connection” to the UK film industry, recognised a host of A-list stars, including Ewan McGregor, Samuel L Jackson, Ricky Gervais, Felicity Jones and director Ang Lee.Lawrence presented fellow Oscar-winner Foster with the Stanley Kubrick Britannia award for excellence in film and praised the 53-year-old for breaking down barriers in Hollywood.The Hunger Games actor said: “Jodie once said to me: ‘One day you’ll look back at the choices you made as an actor and it will reflect something that was going on in your personal life.’ Well, I did, and the consistent theme in all of my characters was they were all white trash with too much responsibility. When you think about it, it’s completely true.“Whereas Jodie’s … I see a brave woman in a scary place. It reminded me of a woman who went behind the lines and started directing when it was not trendy for women to do such a thing.”Introducing Foster to the stage, Lawrence added: “Please welcome my vote for the next president of the United States.”Foster, who was joined at the ceremony by her wife, photographer Alexandra Hedison, said on stage: “I can look to my wife Alex and say: ‘This is what I get to do for a living.’ Thank you for letting me stick around, and I’m not done yet.”Gervais joked that his award – the Charlie Chaplin Britannia award for excellence in comedy – showed the industry recognised him as a greater talent than Hollywood’s most famous silent comedian.The Office co-creator said: “What I’m taking from this is you, and everyone in showbusiness, is saying to me that I’m better than Charlie Chaplin. I humbly accept this award.”McGregor, 45, received the Britannia humanitarian award to honour his work with the charity Unicef.The Trainspotting star recently travelled to northern Iraq to see how conflict in the region has affected children’s lives.Speaking before the ceremony, he said: “It’s a funny one being awarded for your work you do for charity because you don’t do that work for awards. There are over 3 million people displaced in Iraq. I was pretty devastated by what I saw there.”Samuel L Jackson, 57, appeared visibly moved as he received the Albert R Broccoli Britannia award for worldwide contribution to entertainment.He said: “I got lucky. I continue to work. Fortunately Hollywood found me at the time I needed to be found, when I finally got my life together.”Oscar-winning director Lee, 62, was honoured with the John Schlesinger Britannia award for excellence in directing.Jake Gyllenhaal, who starred in Lee’s Academy Award-winning film Brokeback Mountain opposite the late Heath Ledger, presented the award to the film-maker.Paying tribute to Ledger, who died of a drug overdose in 2008, Gyllenhaal said: “Heath, Ang and I were at the centre of a storm that year, fielding the praise and controversy that came from telling a love story about two men.“Standing here tonight, I can’t help but think about Heath and how much he would have loved to witness all this incredible change that has been effected in the LGBT community in the intervening years,” he said.Tom Hanks presented Felicity Jones with the British artist of the year award in recognition of her achievements in 2016.The 33-year-old actor, who was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in The Theory Of Everything, can be seen opposite Hanks in Inferno, based on Dan Brown’s best-selling novel.She will also star in the upcoming Star Wars spin-off movie, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and won critical praise for her performance of a terminally ill mother in A Monster Calls.The ceremony at the Beverly Hilton Hotel was hosted by British actor and comedian Ben “Doc Brown” Smith.
