The figures, which include people looking at news content on the BBC’s Facebook page and on YouTube, show that TV has maintained its position as the most popular platform for international news.TV news – which drew 162 million viewers, up from 148 million – overtook radio for the first time in the BBC’s history last year.The BBC’s radio services attracted a total audience of 147 million, up from 133 million.Some 80 million people sourced BBC news online, up from 55 million.“These are fantastic results which show the BBC going from strength to strength around the world and demonstrate the global appetite for accurate, impartial news,” said Fran Unsworth, director of BBC World Service Group. The BBC World Service, which provides radio and TV news bulletins around the world, saw a huge boost in global audience of 17%, 36 million, to 246 million.The corporation said this was primarily due to new TV news bulletins in languages other than English.BBC World Service English radio also saw a significant increase, up 26%, from 52 million to 66 million.The BBC World Service has shut 15 language services since 2006, although it did launch a Facebook news service for Thailand in 2014.The BBC is planning TV and radio services for Russia and North Korea after securing £289m over five years from the government to strengthen the UK’s “soft power”. “We’re about to begin the biggest expansion of the World Service since the 1940s, thanks to the additional funding agreed by the UK,” said Unsworth. “This will ensure we reach more people than ever, especially in countries where media freedom is under threat.” The reach of BBC Global News, which comprises BBC World News and bbc.com, registered a small amount of growth from 105m to 108m.Top five markets for the BBC’s international news services1.
