I recently witnessed the opposite of sex. It was in the rain and cold in a seaside town where bedraggled women, tiaras askew, traded insults with a gang of belching men. This was a hen do encountering a stag do. No one’s heart was in the blurred innuendo. Sure, it could all be posher and involve a flight, a spa and a row over wedding favours, but this is England. And this is now the compulsory fun that must be had before some willing victim is offered up to the gods of matrimony. This last night of freedom – the acceptable way to admit that marriage is captivity – must be publicly and expensively enjoyed.It’s a deeply sad and conservative tradition that has become ever more popular. Many young women spend money they haven’t got and use up their annual leave going to Barcelona or Reykjavik for all sorts of carry on because one of their friends is getting married. Some choose a spa weekend for a few hundred pounds for the pampering before the storm, and some make do with a quiet night in, but surely the popularity of the hen do is a sign of how we are regressing.Like many things sold to women as essential, hen dos or bachelorette parties were presented as a kind of equality. He has a stag do: drinking, strippers, possibly actual sex. You can do the same! Girls just wanna have fun. Only don’t have the actual sex. Have a gay guy serve you sparkling wine in the buff. Because you’re worth it. Have vibrators wobbling on the table and games where you talk about how you first did it. Try to celebrate your sexual freedom just before you commit to losing it by sleeping with the same person until you are dead.This is a billion-pound industry, after all: hotels and flights for those who can afford it; handcuffs, angel wings and risque T-shirts for those who can’t. One girl I know complained that a male stripper got too close to her and smelled of wee, but hey, isn’t this is all part of the raunch necessary for female bonding?Yes, I am here to be the bad fairy, the full feminist killjoy, partly because all of this is a surrender to the marriage industry that has boomed in my lifetime. Not marriage itself, of course, which is as precarious as ever, but the time and energy and money consumed by all the faff around the “special day”. Hen dos didn’t really start here till the mid 80s and really got going in the 90s. This is exactly when feminism became devalued; now it simply means doing some of what men do. Men have stags. We can ape this and – woop-de-do – call it equality.This commodification of equality into consumer choice has been pumped out everywhere. It consciously avoids the central and difficult question: if we are to have special licensed nights when we can go wild, what exactly are we doing getting married? Never mind the special day, what about a special life?I am well aware that to question marriage as an institution now marks one out as some kind of throwback. Everyone is ultimately drawn into this fundamentally conservative institution, which is really about the transmission of property. Even gay people have been let in. Every so often a feminist will write about how she is tweaking a detail on her big day to make it something that it is not. But hey, love is compromise and feminism is commodified as simply a series of personal lifestyle choices.Men’s magazines still carry jokey articles on how to ask a woman’s father for permission to marry his daughter. It is apparently honourable, this custom. “Feminism has complicated such matters considerably,” said an article in GQ, but such customs “once lent honour and civility to our culture”. They suggest golf or bringing him cigars to soften him up.These are the days where the myth of feminism going too far is everywhere as an explanation as to why the poor guys have to kick back. In reality, the threat that liberation for women would challenge both marriage and the nuclear family has been successfully neutered for the past 15 years. Weddings have got bigger and even more expensive, with every part of them outsourced and extended. The ideology of romance – or more precisely coupling – prevails. Right now we are gearing up for the annual fest of the set menu eaten in silence: Valentine’s Day. Even harridans such as myself get sexted at this time of year: “Suzanne – surprise your loved ones with a carpet cleaning for the hallway and two standard rooms.”The stealing of joy, the heartlessness of all this, is what I am objecting to. Love, sex, romance, sure, is the stuff of life. The repackaging of these things as experiences that are compulsory and fairly uniform leaves so many of us cold. The repurposing of female friendship into hen dos accessorised with pink L-plates demeans it.The embedding of conservatism happens through everyday cultural embrace. But I remain a romantic. That’s the word, surely, for anyone who thinks we may find new ways to live and love.
