That might be reductive, but that’s the lesson to be learned from Forbes magazine’s latest list of the world’s best paid DJs.Las Vegas's gamble with dance music The list, billed as the “Electronic Cash Kings”, shows Calvin Harris topping the list for the third successive year, despite his earnings dropping from $66m (£50.8m) to $63m. The key driver of earnings at the top of the DJing trade, as Forbes notes, is the availability of lucrative residences in Las Vegas, where DJs can earn six-figure sums per set. The magazine says Harris is paid more than $400,000 for each of his Vegas appearances. His earnings are also boosted by his being a hitmaker in his own right.At No 2 is the Dutch DJ Tiësto, who earned an estimated $38m, with his 7 Up deal contributing to his income. David Guetta, who has a residency deal with the clubs owned by Vegas magnate Steve Wynn, netted $28m to finish in third.
