Tetris, the 1980s video game about stacking blocks, is being made into not one, but three films, according to Empire. Producer Larry Kasanoff is lining up a trilogy about the GameBoy favourite, which featured the simple but addictive formula of shuffling falling shapes into corresponding gaps. “The story we conceived is so big,” said Kasanoff. “This isn’t us splitting the last one of our eight movies in two to wring blood out of the stone. It’s just a big story.”Rumours about the narrative direction of a film about matching shapes have been tumbling through the internet since the project was first announced in 2014. Kasanoff says that speculation about the potential franchise’s content, including a prediction that anthropomorphised blocks will be going into battle, are way off target. “We’re not going to have blocks with feet running around the movie,” he said. “But it’s great that people think so. It sets the bar rather low!”No casting has been announced for the project as yet, though it’s understood that Kasanoff is looking to shoot in China and is planning to incorporate local stars. For now Kasanoff is not confirming which, if any, details have fallen into place. “No one has come remotely close to figuring out what we’re doing,” he said. This article was amended on Tuesday 28 June 2016. We said that Tetris involved “shuffling different-sized falling shapes into corresponding gaps”. In fact, as user 137Newton pointed out, all of the Tetris shapes are tetrominoes - shapes that can be made out of four squares of equal size. This has been corrected.
