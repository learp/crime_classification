The world must set a series of new goals for a greener economy at the Rio Earth summit in June, the environment secretary, Caroline Spelman, said on Thursday.Spelman said "sustainable development goals" similar to the Millennium Development Goals, which aim to tackle problems faced by the world's poorest people, were needed to address environmental issues.Spelman also called for countries to move away from using GDP as the sole measure of progress towards "GDP+", that would see governments measure the value of natural resources and the wellbeing of their population.She claimed the UK was leading the way on the concept. "We will call for governments to take steps to measure and account for their natural and social capital, as well as their GDP," said Spelman. "It's becoming more and more apparent that GDP is not a perfect measure of progress, because it deal's with soleley economic output," she said.Spelman was setting out her vision for what should be achieved at Rio+20, the UN conference in Rio de Janeiro this June marking 20 years since the original Earth Summit which set up action to tackle climate change and wildlife losses.The environment secretary is to lead the UK delegation, despite calls from MPs for the prime minister to attend the talks and show the UK's commitment to greening the world economy. But she held out some hope that that Cameron woulld join other world leaders at the three-day summit. "A final decisison has not been taken," she said.Spelman said Britain's second priority at Rio woiuld be to raise "sustainable agriculture" and water up the global agenda. "By 2030 the world will need at least 50% more food, 45% more energy and 30% more water. We need to produce more food with less impact, particularly if we are to feed one billion extra mouths in 13 years' time."The exact content of the new global sustainable development goals (SDGs) will be decided by governments before the Rio meeting and will not be introduced until 2015. However, they are expected to cover "priority" areas such as oceans, food, energy, water, consumption and sustainable cities.Eight new sustainable development goals (SDGs) will be proposed at Rio+20, but will not replace the 10 millennium development goals (MDGs) set by the UN in 2000 which promised to free people from extreme poverty and multiple deprivations. Unlike the 1992 earth summit when over 190 heads of state set in motion several legally binding environment agreements, leaders this time will not be asked to sign any document that would legally commit their countries to meeting any particular targets or timetables.Instead, they will be asked to set their own targets and work voluntarily towards establishing a global green economy which the UN believes will reduce poverty and slow consumption.Spelman told businesses and charities at an event at London's Guildhall: "Our economic and environmental security relies on ambitious outcomes from Rio+20. Rio+20 has to be a workshop not a talking shop."The international community has not made sufficient progress on important world challenges such as food security, access to clean water and sustainable energy."We need urgent action now. Sustainable development goals can drive international action on these key issues and build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals."I will be pushing for real progress on new goals to set us on the right path to a greener and more sustainable world."
