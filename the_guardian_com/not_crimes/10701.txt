Jennifer Lopez and Hamilton Tony-winner Lin-Manuel Miranda have teamed up for a song to benefit the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, which claimed the lives of 50 people and injured 53.A portion of the track – titled Love Make the Girl Go Round – was teased by the pair over 4 July weekend via their Twitter accounts. The chorus, sung by Lopez, strikes a resilient tone: “We’re not staying inside today; they’re not taking our pride away,” she sings. Miranda also raps on the song: “What we got is love, even when the sinners hate us. We cannot let ’em diminish or intimidate us. We sing out. We got the rhythm and truth on our side. We cut through the divide and we do it with pride.”Proceeds for the single – which does not yet have a release date – will go to Somos Orlando, a non-profit organization that provides crisis intervention and mental health care to people affected by the tragedy and the community at large. Miranda also memorably expressed his condolences to the victims of the worst mass shooting in US history while accepting the Tony award for best original score at this year’s ceremony in June.As well as this track, Lopez also features on the charity single Hands, which includes vocals from artists such as Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani, Mary J Blige and Selena Gomez. Money raised from the track - which is reportedly only available in the US so far - goes to the Equality Florida Pulse Victims Fund, the GLBT Community Center of Central Florida and GLAAD.
