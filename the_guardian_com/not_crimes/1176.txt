Barbra Streisand has revealed she once called the Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, to ask him for IT advice for her computer.The US singer told Good Morning Britain: “I couldn’t figure out something on my computer and nobody could figure it out, no IT guy, so I said; ‘Can you get Steve Jobs on the phone?’“Sure enough, I asked him about this problem and he couldn’t figure it out. He gave me his IT guy, who also couldn’t figure out. That was funny.” Calling Apple’s CEOs seems to be a regular occurrence for the singer. This week she revealed she recently called Jobs’ successor, Tim Cook, to complain about Siri. She told him Apple’s personal assistant kept pronouncing her name incorrectly. Streisand told NPR that Siri “pronounces my name wrong”. She said, it should be “Streisand with a soft s, like sand on the beach. I’ve been saying this for my whole career.“And so what did I do? I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name, finally, with the next update on 30 September. So let’s see if that happens because I will be thrilled.”Streisand is as famous not only for her singing and acting career but as the creator of the Streisand effect.Barbra Streisand calls Tim Cook to fix Siri’s mispronunciation of her name
