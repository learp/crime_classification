Royal Mail’s stamp issue celebrates this unique figure and some of his many celebrated personas.”The Royal Mail has paid tribute to musicians before, and last summer it published a 10-stamp Pink Floyd set, which also featured six album covers and four performances.The Bowie album covers featured are Hunky Dory, Aladdin Sane, Heroes, Let’s Dance, Earthling and Blackstar. The tours marked are the 1973 Ziggy Stardust tour, the 1978 Stage tour, the 1983 Serious Moonlight tour, and the 2004 Reality tour.You can pre-order various presentation packs of the stamps from the Royal Mail now.
