Sam Hunter has grown up in a relatively poor household. When his family comes into some money and moves to an affluent town, he feels out of place in his new school and environment. Sam now lives close to the imposing Bierce Priory. Its owners, the wealthy and influential Greenhills, are the town’s resident philanthropists and a case study in success. Slowly, Sam uncovers the terrifying truth about the Greenhills and the town they live in; a truth so disturbing that Sam’s life becomes a living, freakish nightmare, in which he is forced to doubt his own sanity.Imagine every nightmare you’ve ever had about doctors and surgeries, every terrifying dream you’ve ever had about being tortured and then maybe you’ll be prepared for this book. Cheshire has a talent for writing the terrifying and the gruesome, whilst making it so addictive that it’s impossible to stop reading, even if you can’t sleep for a week.The plot is amazing and felt like a classic horror story yet refreshing; however, the themes are just unnerving. It’s safe to say that the last pages will be stuck in your head for days. The story is definitely grim and you shouldn’t read it unless you have a strong stomach, and no lunch. At some points in the book you get spine-tingling chills that set you on edge. No book can scare you to death and grip you like this one; clear your schedule because you will not be able to put it down. I would recommend this book to people who like a bit of gore and good old-fashioned scaring, though only if you can handle its creepy contents. But I’ll warn you now, you will not want to go to the doctors for at least a year. How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? I have one thing to say about this book apart from the fact that it was amazing; sleep with the light on and with one eye open.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
