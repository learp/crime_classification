Is Finnegans Wake the most difficult novel ever written? With 60 different languages featured in it, a plot with multiple layers, impossibly varied interpretations and a complex “multifractal structure” recently discovered by mathematicians, James Joyce’s classic novel is at best challenging – even more so than Ulysses. Coinciding with the Irish author’s 134th birthday, a group of academics is launching Waywords and Meansigns, a project that sets the entire book to music, unabridged, with musicians and readers collaborating.  It’s all so simple. If anyone doesn’t understand a passage, all he need do is read it aloudJames Joyce The project was started by a group of Joyce fans who, mindful of the complexity of his work, are experimenting with ways to make it accessible to more readers. Waywords and Meansigns is a freely available, 35-hour-long audiobook of sorts. Each of the book’s 17 chapters was assigned to musicians – from amateurs to established artists like Grammy-winning producer David Kahne or American bassist Mike Watt; and from people who newcomers to Joyce fanatics. “The book is all about multiplicity, there are so many ways to interpret it – so we wanted to try different musicians from different backgrounds,” said Derek Pyle, the project’s director. The requirements were for the chapter’s words to “be audible, unabridged, and more or less in their original order”.“Ulysses was experimental enough that it blew people’s minds and accessible enough that they were able to read it,” said Pyle. Right after finishing his masterpiece, Joyce spent 17 years writing this “almanac of world history”, “far more experimental and bizarre” than Ulysses. It is a book about which science-fiction author Philip K Dick said (through one of his characters): “I’m going to prove that Finnegans Wake is an information pool, based on computer memory systems that didn’t exist until centuries after James Joyce’s era; that Joyce was plugged into a cosmic consciousness from which he derived the inspiration for his entire corpus of work.” Writer Joseph Campbell said that if the world burned down, the history of human consciousness could be reconstructed from it.Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter Daunting, perhaps – but Pyle argues that listening to this book out loud makes it much easier. “It’s all so simple. If anyone doesn’t understand a passage, all he need do is read it aloud,” said Joyce himself to Claude Sykes, as recalled in a 1954 interview with Joyce’s biographer, Richard Ellmann. “Hearing it out loud sheds different light on it,” he says. A big motivation for the project was to make the book more accessible, “but simultaneously, we want to appeal to people who really know and love his text – and that is why we did it unabridged”. He should know: the origin of the project was a party that Pyle and friends organised where they listened to an entire 25-hour Finnegans Wake audiobook – read by Patrick Healy – in one sitting. That session sparked the first musical edition of Waywords and Meansigns, in which Pyle works with with Sara Jewell – and he’s now ready for a third.

Different musicians frame different readings, and their different styles offer a series of unexpected transformations of this endlessly transformative text. Lift it Hosty!
