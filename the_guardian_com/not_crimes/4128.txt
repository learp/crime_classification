The fate of the Jews in Nazi Germany and the countries it occupied seems far more vivid to me now than it did in the 1950s and 1960s, when the term concentration camps rather than the word Holocaust was used to describe their deliberate elimination – as though it were barbed wire and overcrowding rather than gas and shooting that had killed them. For this I have to credit a wide range of books and films – from Art Spiegelman’s graphic memoir, Maus, to Claude Lanzmann’s 10-hour documentary, Shoah – and also, I suppose, the general feeling that produced these works: that the horror needed to be understood in its intimate particulars, which the passage of time had made us readier to see and hear.Lessons of Holocaust being forgotten, says Prince Charles To me, as I suspect to many others, the idea that those events could be mislaid by the public memory seems impossible. Nevertheless, this week Prince Charles told the charity World Jewish Relief, in what was seen as a criticism of Donald Trump’s refugee policy, that the work of “reaching beyond your own community” was particularly valuable “at a time when the horrific lessons of the last war seem to be in increasing danger of being forgotten”.Meanwhile the Trump administration came under more direct attack, from the scholar Deborah Lipstadt, who said the new regime was “flirting with Holocaust denial” by failing to mention in a statement issued to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Dayon 27 January that Jews were the principal victims.Neither remark pointed with any certainty to growing public ignorance, but evidence for it isn’t hard to find. An extensive survey published last year by University College London’s Centre for Holocaust Education, for example, found that most young people in England hadn’t grasped many of the most elementary facts of the genocide, despite studying the subject at school.How best to make sure this history is never forgotten? Three years ago, at a reception for survivors in Downing Street, David Cameron announced the launch of a Holocaust commission charged with exactly that task: to recommend to the government a scheme that by remembering the death camps would not only honour their victims and survivors, but also stand as a warning to successive generations against intolerance, prejudice and hatred.

Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty ImagesA year later, in January 2015, the commission delivered its report, proposing a “striking and prominent” new national memorial in central London (a neglected one, a garden of boulders in Hyde Park, opened in 1983) and a “world-class learning centre” that would share the same location, “driving a network of national educational activity”.The brief was ambitious. The memorial should be a place for contemplation and prayer but also “something people can interact with” that would provide factual information about the destruction of European Jewry and convey its enormity. The learning centre would be a campus, and not simply a room: a “must-see destination” where a lecture theatre and multiple classrooms would use the latest technology to inspire its “vast numbers of visitors”.Three possible locations were identified: Potters Field, on the south bank of the Thamesbetween Tower Bridge and City Hall; another riverfront site, at Millbank, next to Tate Britain; and what at that point seemed the most practical and likely choice, the Imperial War Museum, which opened its permanent Holocaust exhibition in 2000 and is spending £15m on renewing and expanding it – work that should be finished in 2020.In terms of survivor testimony and educational outreach, the museum already fulfils part of the proposed learning centre’s function, while its galleries display the events and their historical context. Nonetheless, the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation, which had been set up to take the project forward, rejected the war museum’s bid on the grounds that its site wasn’t central enough, and chose instead a little public park no more than half a mile away on the other side of the Thames, which had been offered by the government.I went there last week. Victoria Tower Gardens lies immediately upriver of the Houses of Parliament, an area of grassland tapering from east to west flanked by a busy road as well as the river, fringed on all sides with plane trees, and notable mainly because it contains the famous bronze by Auguste Rodin titled The Burghers of Calais.Cameron, announcing the decision in January last year, said it would stand beside parliament “as a permanent statement of our values as a nation”, and later pledged £50m of public funding towards its construction.The idea that a memorial to the Holocaust represents “British values” has become important to the argument for the site. According to the foundation, the new memorial will join the democratic theme of the park’s “existing memorial narrative”, which consists of a pretty little kiosk in Victorian gothic commemorating anti-slavery campaigners; a mediocre statue of Emmeline Pankhurst; and the Calais burghers (who represent French self-sacrifice in the face of English oppression, if we must bring nationalism into it).

Do those in Serbia represent Serbian values. Do Brazilian values infuse those in Brazil? Given Britain’s awkward relationship to events in prewar Germany, including the quota set on its refugees, a little less self-congratulation may be in order.A local opposition movement, Save Victoria Tower Gardens, stresses that the park is listed Grade II and set partly inside a Unesco world heritage site. Moreover, the siting of another memorial there would conflict with Westminster council’s well-publicised determination to keep new monuments out of its monument saturation zone (the borough has 300 of them, with a concentration around parliament and Whitehall, and more are continually proposed. Last year the council rejected an application by the Methodist church to place Homeless Jesus, a bronze of a rough sleeper on a park bench, outside Central Hall.)In an attempt to keep the appearance of the park intact, the learning centre will be buried underground, though its entrance ramp, lift pods and ventilation ducts will all make their mark on the surface as “a distracting paraphernalia” – in the opposition’s phrase – that will “kill once and for all the poignant simplicity of this park”. And as the architectural historian Lucy Peck, a local resident, points out, the learning centre has been considerably scaled down – no longer a campus but a few underground rooms, with another centre at the Imperial War Museum doing much the same work. Looking at them all, I felt a sense of their failure – their littleness, their useless abstraction Opposing a memorial to the Holocaust is a difficult thing, and the Tower Gardens campaign is careful to emphasise that the site rather than the monument is the issue. But perhaps looming over these smaller arguments is a larger question: are memorials still the best means of remembering?The winning design will be announced this summer by a jury whose chair is Peter Bazalgette. In the meantime you can see the shortlist of 10 online. Several big names are there: Ron Arad, Anish Kapoor, Studio Libeskind, John McAslan, the late Zaha Hadid. The most attractive, I think, is a reprise of the little anti-slavery monument in the same gardens – a lit-up spectre in Victorian gothic by Caruso St John Architects, Marcus Taylor and Rachel Whiteread.Looking at them all, however, I felt a sense of their failure – their littleness, their useless abstraction and vain attempt to give meaning or insight into such a barbarous thing. Perhaps there should be books, papers, photographs, interviews, film and no other memorial – the time for monuments having somehow passed.
