The BBC is facing a battle to hold on to The Great British Bake Off, with commercial rivals circling as its three-year production deal comes up for renewal.Its deal with the show’s maker, Love Productions, which is 70% owned by Sky, runs out after the seventh series of the hugely popular programme airs this summer.Commercial rivals including ITV, Channel 4 and Sky are set to swoop if the BBC fails to secure a deal for the biggest show on television.Great British Bake Off's success could be recipe for trouble at cash-strapped BBC The Great British Bake Off is a hugely attractive property to a commercial broadcaster, with the final of the last series, won by Nadiya Hussain, attracting more than 13 million viewers, making it the most-watched show of 2015. The popularity of the show, starring Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry, means it could be worth as much as £20m per year to a commercial broadcaster. As a result, Love Productions is pushing for a significant increase in its fee from the BBC in a new deal. The cash-strapped BBC, which faces finding £750m in savings over the next few years under the new licence fee deal with the government, has balked and the talks are at an impasse.The current deal was signed before the 2014 series, when Bake Off moved from BBC2 to the main BBC1 channel, which has also helped it to grow its audience.It is not clear whether Love Productions’ other programming deals with the BBC, which include The Great British Sewing Bee and The Great Pottery Throw Down, might also become a factor in the talks over Bake Off. On Tuesday, the BBC announced it had commissioned a two-part travel cookery show spin-off with Hussain, also to be made by Love.Broadcast, which first reported the stalled talks, said Love had called for the BBC to reclassify the show to take it out of the lower budget for factual programming and instead dip into the much bigger entertainment budget. When Bake Off was first aired on BBC2 it was commissioned by the corporation’s documentary department.In November, ITV secured The Voice in a three-year deal thought to be worth about £50m, after the BBC gave up the battle to keep the show. If the BBC fails to secure a new deal with Love Productions, commercial rivals would have to wait until 2018 to air the eighth series as it is understood that the BBC has a one-year cooling-off clause before it can be aired elsewhere.
