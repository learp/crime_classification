Anna Huntley is as further from being the typical ‘it girl’ than you could imagine. She’s clumsy, geeky and socially inept, often sticking with Marvel comics, classic movies and her golden labrador named Dog, in her free time.She’s far from popular when she accidentally sets Queen Bee Josie’s hair on fire. She’s now suddenly in the limelight but for all the wrong reasons. Josie makes a huge fuss (as expected) and Anna wonders if things could get any worse. In fact, things are going to take a very curious turn, whether for better or worse, it’s all up to Anna.I really enjoyed reading this novel. It’s light-hearted, comical but still with a brilliant plot and developed characters.   Photograph: prAnna as a character was very endearing, I could greatly empathise with her and her quirks. However, my favourite character has to be Marianne who (without giving the plot away) is kind of a sister to Anna. She’s older, sophisticated and beautiful, the perfect ‘it girl’. Anna feels very distant from Marianne at first, but as the story goes on, they develop more of a bond and we see that Marianne is a real geek at heart, just like Anna.I would recommend this to people who enjoy Holly Smale’s Geek Girl books as the style was quite similar. Overall, this is an honestly brilliant read with a great and engaging plot, relatable characters and not to mention a gorgeous cover! Why not give this a go, and if all else fails at least it will look good on your bookshelf!How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
