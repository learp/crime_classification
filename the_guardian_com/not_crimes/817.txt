Very nice energy and happiness, there are english language versions available on youtube but the lyrics deliver no more nor less than the music itself already communicates.Becoming maudlin and philosophical you tell yourself the light permeates everything (Paavoharju) – how deep! It certainly permeates and enhances the beauty of your Tiffany Glass lamp, by Orriel Smith, which, in the dying rays of the sun, sparkles like a Katy Perry Firework.Just another day in Sparkleville.
