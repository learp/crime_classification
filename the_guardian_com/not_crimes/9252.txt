Contrary to your report (12 January), Unesco has not given approval in principle to a tunnel under Stonehenge. While it acknowledged that a tunnel could improve the setting of the stones themselves, it was concerned about the huge damage that would ensue to the rest of the world heritage site. The only options in the consultation should be ones that do no further harm to the site, one of our greatest national assets. Anything less would be a betrayal of the government’s duty to safeguard this iconic landscape for future generations.James MacCollHead of campaigns, Campaign for Better Transport• Kyle Taylor, the director of Smart Brexit, appears delighted that Labour has accepted that Brexit is inevitable and hopes that a “decent crate of lager rather than a cheap three-litre of cider” is brought to the party (Letters, 12 January). Might I respectfully suggest that he has set his sights far too low and that good quality British cask beer might be more palatable, smart and acceptable to all of us, Brexiteers or not.Toby WoodPeterborough, Cambridgeshire• Transport secretary Chris Grayling does not believe cyclists are road users (Report, 13 January). He ought to read his department’s Highway Code. Rule 64 says “Cyclists MUST NOT cycle on a pavement”. As this is also a legal requirement, is he inciting us to break the law?Chris JeffriesStockport• As usual, I find difficulty interpreting the weather symbols. For instance, there seems to be no difference between “heavy rain” and “snow”. Why don’t you use colour symbols so that I’ll no longer have to use my magnifying glass?Lorraine HaldaneHove, East Sussex• I can understand Felicity Cloake’s difficulty with the Weetabix version of eggs benedict (G2, 12 January), but has she tried buttered Weetabix? It’s been a staple in our family for years and is delicious. You do need to be generous with the butter, though.Sue LeylandHunmanby, North Yorkshire • Regrettably, “insinuate” is the new “imply”, supplanting “infer” as the old “imply”. I give up (Letters, 13 January).David WebbLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
