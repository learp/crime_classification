While most people’s literary heroes include the likes of Shakespeare, Keats, JK Rowling and Jane Austen, those of us with green fingers worship a different band of authors - the garden writers. The shelves of my office at Hever Castle & Gardens groan under the weight of gardening books, from reference titles on herbs, perennials and citrus plants to bibles like The Gardening Year and everything Percy Thrower ever wrote. I love practical guides as well as books that explore the more unusual side of horticulture, such as plant hunting. Here are the ones that I couldn’t live without:      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest DG Hessayon’s Expert series Now, I know this is my first entry and I can’t be seen to be cheating, but I want to put forward a collection of books. David Gerald Hessayon, a British author and botanist, created this bestselling series of gardening manuals known as the Expert Guides under his title Dr DG Hessayon. The series started in 1958 with Be Your Own Gardening Expert and in 2008 it celebrated its 50th anniversary and the 50 millionth copy in print. I have all of the books at home and keep a copy of Hessayon’s The Armchair Book of the Garden in my office - not that I spend much time in my chair.The Cloud Garden by Tom Hart Dyke & Paul Winder For me, gardening is about passion and there’s no more passionate a gardener than Tom Hart Dyke. Tom’s commitment to horticulture took him to one of the most dangerous places on the planet - The Darien Gap in Panama. His jungle-bound search for a rare orchid to name after his grandmother led him into a perilous situation when he was kidnapped at gun-point by the guerrillas the Farc. Tom’s story, as told in The Cloud Garden, is mindblowing. It’s also inspirational and teaches us what we can achieve and what we can endure if we focus on horticulture. Hart Dyke managed to create gardens during his captivity in the jungle and these gardens helped to keep him sane. He gardens just down the road from us in Kent where he created his World Garden of Plants, designed during his period of captivity in the jungle. Emily Dickinson’s Gardens by Marta McDowell This book was originally published in 2004 but I didn’t discover it until two years ago when Mrs Guthrie, the owner of Hever Castle, lent it to me. Mrs Guthrie has a love of Emily Dickinson’s poetry and became familiar with the author after reading Marta McDowell’s book on Beatrix Potter. Emily Dickinson’s Garden is an exploration of the poet’s 19th century garden in Amherst, New England and lists the perennials and roses that she grew at home. We were inspired to take this list and create a shrub rose border at Hever as an homage to Emily’s garden. All of the rose plants listed (including the Damask rose, Greville rose, Blush rose, Cinnamon rose and Galico rose) now have a home at Hever thanks to this book.Growing Citrus by Martin PageI love this practical guide to growing citrus fruits. It’s quite avant grade and not what you’d associate the head gardener of Hever with, but I love to grow grapefruits, lemons, oranges and limes. I found this book at RHS Wisley garden - they have a great selection of books there, including some really interesting books on tropicals. RHS Gardeners’ Encyclopaedia of Plants and Flowers edited by Christopher BrickellIn the age of Google, it’s tempting to think that reference books are redundant, but this encyclopaedia by the RHS is a seminal text and should never be overlooked. It’s a wonderful reference point if you’re trying to find something specific. It’s well put together and divided into bi-annuals, annuals, and plants are also listed by colour, so you can chose a specific plant by colour and then size.
