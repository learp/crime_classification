An Italian artist acclaimed as a founding father of 1960s Arte Povera – the “poor art” movement that only used worthless everyday materials – will be next to colonise the stupendously grand halls of Blenheim Palace.

Photograph: Edd HorderMichelangelo Pistoletto, whose career was celebrated in recent solo exhibitions at the Serpentine and the Louvre, will be creating new work for Blenheim’s towering double-height great hall, as well as installing a retrospective covering more than half a century of his art throughout the palace and its grounds.The 18th-century building is now a World Heritage site covering seven acres, including a 55 metre-long library and a Capability Brown designed landscape. This will be the third major contemporary art exhibition at Blenheim, following Ai Weiwei in 2014 and Lawrence Weiner last year., and Pistoletto’s most comprehensive UK show to date.“Pistoletto’s powerful career has been a major influence on contemporary art and modern thought,” said Michael Frahm, curator and director of the Blenheim Art Foundation, who described the artist as “a counter-cultural figure who questions society and explores philosophy through a body of work which is witty, poetic and always unexpected,.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Michelangelo Pistoletto’s sculpture Venus of the Rags.

She finally had the building finished by Nicholas Hawksmoor, long after the duke’s death, insisting on cheaper materials and lower wages.“I am very pleased to be presenting a comprehensive show of my work within a place brimming with history, tradition, and craft,” said Pistoletto of the show in September. “I look forward to seeing my art in an entirely new context.”
