I helped get Nottingham Contemporary off the ground. So I like galleries, especially outside London. The objectors to the potential closure of New Art Gallery Walsall tactfully address their protest to “the authorities” (Report, 1 December). But that avoids the issue. The issue is that Walsall, as a non-southern borough, has seen its spending power reduced by £543 per household since 2011. Contrast that with many southern authorities, such as Tonbridge and Malling, which has seen its spending power rise by £23 per household since 2011. The government is responsible for most spending power. It has a political agenda. That agenda should be recognised and condemned.Finally, I could have written a similar letter to that of the objectors, about the need to preserve care for the elderly in Walsall with the same money devoted to the gallery. The council is between a rock and a hard place that is not of its making. It deserves understanding, not blame. The government, on the other hand…Cllr Graham ChapmanDeputy leader, Nottingham city council• The letter about the possible closure of Walsall’s New Art Gallery (1 December) seems to have been signed by a whole lot of people who rarely, if ever, visit Walsall.I have visited the gallery three times this year and there has never been more than a handful of people there.Earlier this year I wrote to Walsall council and the New Art Gallery suggesting how they could give art a boost in Walsall and I didn’t even get an acknowledgment. As there is no sign of Walsall council or the New Art Gallery Trust shaking off their unimaginative and lethargic qualities, perhaps we should move the current exhibits and use the building to house many of Walsall’s 569 homeless people, who could be helped and encouraged to come up with their own works of art, which I feel sure would attract more visitors than the present set-up.Thus at a stroke we will make real use of the building, create something truly original and give these unfortunate people their pride back.Roger WattsWalsall   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Video: Noddy Holder’s original lift announcements for new Art Gallery Walsall• Another sad casualty of the threatened closure of Walsall’s New Art Gallery would be the lift announcements, superbly and authentically voiced by Noddy Holder.Graham LarkbeyLondon• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
