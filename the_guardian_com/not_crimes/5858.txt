PUBSFox and Hounds, Ennerdale, Lake DistrictA fine stop on the coast-to-coast walk (Ennerdale is the first stop on Wainwright’s famous trail), this pub is also a decent pitstop for a pint after a less-ambitious stroll up Grike Fell. After the Fox and Hounds closed in 2010, the community came together to buy the pub lease, and it nails that winning formula: good beer (all sourced from West Cumbria brewers including the local Ennerdale Brewery), locally sourced food and a friendly atmosphere.• 01946 861 373, foxandhoundsinn.orgRed Lion, Preston, Hertfordshire      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest 10 of the best community-run cottages, hostels and guesthouses in the UK In the 1980s, the phrase “community-run pub” had all the allure of a parish council meeting. The Red Lion started a huge change in perception back then, as the first example of a community-owned public house anywhere in the UK, having been bought from Whitbread, and is still going strong with a recipe of hand-pulled pints, good food and convivial events.• 01462 459585, theredlionpreston.co.ukGolden Ball, York      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Recently transformed by community ownership into a great social hub inside York’s city walls, the Golden Ball story is an inspiration.

It works. Plus the food is excellent and seasonal – confit of sea trout, samphire and sorrel followed by elderflower and strawberry panna cotta, for example. The Clink at Cardiff (there are others at Brixton, High Down and Styal) won the Sustainable Restaurant Association’s three-star award and consistently gathers recommendations.• Three courses from £25, 029 2092 31310, theclinkcharity.orgBrigade Bar and Bistro, London      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: AlamyHoused in a magnificent Victorian fire station near the south side of Tower Bridge, the Brigade is a social enterprise that gives homeless people a chance to learn culinary skills, then apply them.
