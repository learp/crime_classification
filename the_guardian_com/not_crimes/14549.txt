It is one of those lovely September days poised at the end of summer and the beginning of the onset of autumn. While the sky is still a scatter of white clouds against a flawless blue, the breeze, despite carrying no hint of a chill, still manages to convey the feeling that change is on the way. Though a pair of greenfinches, year-round residents, are still feeding young in a nearby garden, many of the visiting summer breeders have left or will soon be on their way.Now, where once there were many, there are only a few wheatears and swallows to be seen and even these may not be birds that have passed the summer here but ones from further north passing through on their way to their wintering grounds. In contrast to these departing birds there are lapwing everywhere massing in large flocks. Occasionally a single restless bird will take to the air uttering a shrill yet oddly plaintive call of alarm, which is ignored by the rest of the flock. Scattered among the lapwing are their frequent companions â€“ the aptly named golden plover. It is only when looking at the flock through binoculars that it becomes apparent just how many there are, for despite the sunshine lighting their plumage to a rich golden brown, some remain surprisingly difficult to pick out against their surroundings with the naked eye.Suddenly something alarms not one bird but the entire flock and they take off en masse. Different silhouettes, different flight styles, the broad-winged lapwing and the smaller, sharper-winged plover move as one flock and settle together a few fields distant. There is a pleasure and a satisfaction to be found in watching this regular pattern of seasonal movement but there are unexpected arrivals too, birds whose temporary presence adds a little spice to the mix: the lost and weary travellers who drop in for a short time seeking a respite from their journeying and send birders hurrying to see them before they move on again.
