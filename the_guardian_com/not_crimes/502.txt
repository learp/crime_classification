The National Museum of Scotland will open 10 new galleries this summer devoted to science, art and design, increasing its exhibition space by almost half and putting many treasures from its collections on display for the first time.The £14.1m project will give the museum its first fashion gallery, creating a permanent display for what is an growing collection. Among its 50,000 objects are pieces by Mary Quant, Vivienne Westwood, Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen – and a jacket designed by Schiaparelli and donated by Frances Lovell Oldham, otherwise known as “Frances the Fabulous”. The US-born fashion editor of Vogue, later editor of Harper’s Bazaar, married the laird of the Invercauld estate, moved into the family castle – painting part of it sugar pink – and swapped her polar-bear coat for equally flamboyant Highland dress.

It includes combs and brushes, crystal bowls, bottles and glasses, toothbrushes and a tongue-scraper – along with tea and coffee pots, and a jug and wash basin.It was bequeathed by Pauline to a handsome admirer, Alexander Duke of Hamilton, a voracious art collector, who employed Napoleon’s favourite architect to build Hamilton Palace, one of the most celebrated Scottish treasure houses until it was demolished in the 1920s. National Museums Scotland managed to raise funds to buy it in 1986, but preparing it for redisplay, including delicately cleaning all the tarnished intricate silver pieces, has taken more than 250 hours of conservation work.Other rarities going on display include hand-painted 18th-century French wallpaper, the first Dunlop pneumatic tyre, and a 1910 engine from a plane built by the Wright brothers seven years after they made history with the first powered flight, 20 feet above ground level, covering 852 feet and lasting just 59 seconds.The new galleries will open on 8 July, and will add more than 40% extra exhibiting space to the museum. Three-quarters of the 3,000 objects haven’t been displayed in a lifetime and many others are newly acquired or coming out of the stores for the first time.The museum is still fundraising for the project, an appeal supported by patron and author Alexander McCall Smith, who called it “a place which connects Scotland to the world and the world to Scotland”.• This article was amended on 17 February 2016. An earlier version referred to a 250-piece, rather than more than 100-piece, travelling set. In addition, a reference to the National Museum of Scotland raising funds should have been to the organisation that runs it, National Museums Scotland.
