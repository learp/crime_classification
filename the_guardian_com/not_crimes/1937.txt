Charlotte C Gill (Music education is now only for the white and wealthy, theguardian.com, 27 March) argues: “To enable more children to learn [music], we must stop teaching in such an academic way.” While rightly noting the increasing chasm between state and private education in terms of music provision, her conclusions about musical notation and theoretical skills amount to simple anti-intellectualism.Gill dismisses the study of music “theory” and argues that musical notation is “a cryptic, tricky language … that can only be read by a small number of people”. This claim flies in the face of countless initiatives over two centuries, making musical literacy available to those of many backgrounds. As with written language, musical notation enables effective and accurate communication, as well as critical access to huge amounts of knowledge. In many musical fields, those without it will be at a deep disadvantage and dependent upon others.Gill’s comments about “limited repertoires of old, mostly classical music” are unfounded and presented without evidence: composing, listening, singing and playing are embedded in much musical education, which also widely encompasses jazz, popular and non-western traditions. Claiming that classical music comprises a limited repertory is inaccurate: composers have been adding to its repertory for centuries and continue to do so. We agree with Gill that aural and other skills are just as important as those in notation. However, through her romanticisation of illiteracy, Gill’s position could serve to make literate musical education even more exclusive through being marginalised yet further in state schools.Ian Pace Pianist, lecturer, head of performance, City, University of LondonJoan Arnau Pàmies Composer, aural skills instructor, Northwestern UniversityBarbara Eichner Senior lecturer in music, Oxford Brookes UniversityJim Aitchison Composer and graphic score artistSir Simon Rattle Conductor, principal conductor, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and conductor-elect, London Symphony OrchestraGillian Moore Director of music, South Bank CentreSir James MacMillan Composer and conductorHoward Goodall Composer, broadcaster and music historianNorman Lebrecht Writer and broadcasterMarshall Marcus CEO, European Union Youth Orchestra, president, Sistema EuropeMichael Nyman ComposerProfessor Brian Ferneyhough Stanford UniversityHelen Grime Composer and senior lecturer in composition, Royal Holloway University of LondonDavid Warburton MP Chair, all-party parliamentary select committee on music educationFiona Cunningham CEO, Sistema EnglandGordon Munro Director of music, Royal Conservatoire of ScotlandMark Everist Professor of music and president, Royal Musical Association (signing in a personal capacity)Professor Sir David Eastwood Vice-chancellor, University of BirminghamCamden Reeves Professor and head of music, University of ManchesterChi-chi Nwanoku Founder and artistic director, Chineke and double bassistSir James and Lady Jeanne Galway Flute players Imogen Cooper Pianist Stephen Hough PianistSteven Isserlis Cellist and more than 600 others (full list of signatories at https://ianpace.wordpress.com/2017/03/30/response-to-charlotte-c-gill-article-on-music-and-notation-full-list-of-signatories)• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
