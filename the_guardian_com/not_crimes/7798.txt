The Dunwich Dynamo is a roughly 120-mile bike ride to the Suffolk coast, on a date sometime near the fullest moon between the end of June and mid-July, setting off from Hackney’s London Fields park around 8pm and arriving at the beach sometime after dawn.If the description seems a little hazy that’s because the ride is technically unorganised. There is no registration, no timer and no number to pin on to your cycle jersey. Anyone can do the Dunwich Dynamo. Whether you’ve only ever ridden 15 miles before but someone lends you a posh racer so you decide to give it a shot. Whether you’re part of a lycra-clad cycle crew who’ve been in training for the past six months, or you cycle so slowly that you only arrive at at the beach after everyone else has left (our friend Toby in 2013). I’ve been doing the ride (not race) for five years with, as one friend succinctly put it a “ragtag medley of street cleaners, Greco-Roman wrestlers, lost people and one professional Italian”. This is supposed to be the ethos but as the dynamo grows in notoriety is it able to maintain this spirit? The morning after last year’s ride the Facebook group, which has become a space for people to ask questions, air grievances and post victory photos, exploded into a debate about the behaviour of some of the cycle club riders. They were accused by some of trying to turn the ride in to a sportive, cutting up people as they overtook people and jeering at them for being too slow. What was the big rush to get to the beach, many asked. Surely the overnight, century-plus aspect of the ride was challenge enough? This year the Facebook group admin Guy Wells said he had removed last year’s debates because he had been promised, presumably by said clubs, that “things would be different this year”, and the response in the comments seemed to suggest etiquette had been restored in 2016. But what is the “official etiquette” of the dynamo? Some might argue that using Strava rather than the fall and rise of the sun to track your time goes against it. Others may believe that using a Garmin, rather than an A4 piece of paper with very basic directions does too. David Molloy (@Davidmolloy03)A map showing where people cycled over night last night.

Maybe they’d have more of an experience if they didn’t, but then maybe that’s their loss? There are other issues up for hot debate. From the mundane, how many beers should you drink? How many bacon sandwiches should you eat? And are you an idiot for wearing a rucksack? To the more fundamental: should riders be allowed to rig up sound systems on their crossbars to get them through the darkest parts of the night? A post from one rider pleading with others not to “be selfish and inconsiderate” racked up hundreds of reactions and comments last week. One camp argued that it is disrespectful to the locals whose villages they pass through, and to a lesser degree, other riders who might prefer the silence of the Suffolk countryside at dawn. The other camp know how helpful drum and bass (insert other music taste as desired) can be to get you up an unexpected hill at mile 93. One user asked to “let common sense prevail and assume that people playing music will keep it to a discreet level through villages at 2am” perhaps getting to the crux of the argument. For the Dunwich Dynamo to survive in its purest form means no involvement from any authorities, who are only going to take a real interest unless they get a barrage of complaints from locals along the route. Cyclists will always come up against objections and it’s within everyone’s interests to act responsibly. This means being respectful to people you interact with on, or near, the roads you ride, not putting others in danger and not dropping litter. All things that could be used to mount a case against rides like the dynamo. The weather on Saturday was as close to perfect as possible. A golden sunset, a warm night and a dawn which didn’t take too long to come, which contributed to the jovial atmosphere. It also felt less crowded than usual which may have helped.

Conversations were random and most of the locals who watched the ride from their front door steps seemed to enjoy the spectacle. The elusive spirit seems to be being maintained. Let’s hope it stays that way.
