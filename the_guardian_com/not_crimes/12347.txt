Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood has become a father again, to twin girls, two days before his 69th birthday.He and his wife, Sally Humphreys, 38, welcomed their daughters on Monday. A statement said the couple were “delighted to announce the birth of their twins Gracie Jane (6lb) & Alice Rose (5.7lb). The girls arrived on 30 May at 10.30pm and all are doing brilliantly. The babies are perfect.”The twins are Wood’s fifth and sixth children, but his first with Humphreys, who is a theatre producer. His other children are Jesse Wood, with his first wife, former model Krissy Wood; daughter Leah and son Tyrone from his second marriage to Jo; and Jamie, Jo’s son from a previous marriage, who Wood adopted. The musician and Humphreys dated for six months before they married at the Dorchester hotel in London, with Rod Stewart as Wood’s best man, in 2012. In an interview with Hello! magazine, Humpreys said they did not notice the more than 30-year age gap, but Wood did say his wife is sometimes mistaken for his daughter. She said: “Maybe it’s the old-souls-young-soul thing, but we don’t notice it.” The couple met while Humphreys was working at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, where Wood was displaying some of his artwork.
