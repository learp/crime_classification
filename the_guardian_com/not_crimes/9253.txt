Name: Johnny Depp.Age: 53.Monthly outgoings: $2m (£1.6m).That seems a lot. It is the figure Johnny Depp’s former business managers claim he spends.Depp must be earning big bucks to sustain spending like that. That’s the problem. He has spent the past five years acting in some films that have been terribly received, but, apparently, this hasn’t been reflected in his spending patterns.Johnny Depp spent $3m blasting Hunter S Thompson's ashes from cannon, ex-managers claim Oh, I don’t know. He was good in 21 Jump Street. That was one cameo five years ago. Since then he has been in a disappointing Alice in Wonderland sequel, a disastrous Lone Ranger adaptation, a film about a naughty computer and Mortdecai.I forgot about Mortdecai. Everyone forgot about Mortdecai. It made even less money than Nick of Time. Remember Nick of Time? No, nobody does. And yet it still made more money than Mortdecai.We should probably get back to his spending. Yes, so, not long ago, Depp sued his business managers, claiming they had mismanaged his earnings.Right. But they have now countersued, with a long list of unthinkably expensive things that they claim Depp spends money on. Such as his 14 homes.Sorry, 14? They apparently include a Kentucky horse farm, an entire French village and a chain of islands in the Bahamas.Good lord. They also claim he spent money on a 45 metre (150ft) yacht, regular private plane travel, a collection of fine art kept in 12 different storage facilities, a failed record company that cost $4m and the $3m cost of blasting Hunter S Thompson’s ashes into the sky with a specially made cannon.Give that poor man a drink. Don’t worry, he has that covered too – the countersuit alleges that he also spends $30,000 on wine every month.That’s astonishing. If the suit is accurate, it means that Depp’s spending is almost as ostentatious as that of Nicolas Cage, who at his peak blew money on castles, haunted houses, Gatsby-style parties and dinosaur skulls. And look at him now. He’s having to churn out all sorts of garbage.Good thing Depp gets paid so much to be in Pirates of the Caribbean, then. Oh great, more Pirates of the Caribbean films. Punish us all, why don’t you.Do say: “Can someone point Depp towards a Lidl?”Don’t say: “Let’s all save him by buying Mortdecai on DVD.”
