The former X Factor presenter Dermot O’Leary has said Simon Cowell should rest the ITV talent show for a year and undo recent changes when it returns.The 42-year-old presenter told the Radio Times he was uncomfortable with alterations to the format on 2015’s show, which he suggested made it lack the warmth compared to BBC rival Strictly Come Dancing.O’Leary said the so-called Six-Chair Challenge element, introduced on the most recent X Factor series, which sees acts chosen then deselected by judges in front of a baying audience, was in his view not a “particularly nice bit of television”.He said producers should change the hyperbolic language used on the show, although he said the talent on the series was still “brilliant”.The presenter, who is hosting a new BBC1 driving entertainment show called The Getaway Car, which features The Stig from Top Gear, told the magazine: “If I was Simon I’d take it off air for a year. I’d rest it, and then I’d get back to the rooms.“For me it was always room, arena, boot camp. Also I was really uncomfortable about the Six-Chair Challenge. I don’t think it’s a particularly nice bit of television. One of the reasons people like Strictly is because it is a very warm show, and I think you’ve got to keep that in mind.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   O’Leary praised the warmth of BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing.

The Sunday night finale was watched by 8.4 million viewers, the lowest since Steve Brookstein won in 2004.When asked why the ITV show’s ratings had dropped so much in recent times, O’Leary, who presented the show for eight years, said he did not know, but added that viewers had “gone and watched Strictly”.O’Leary, who ruled himself out of presenting The Voice when it transfers to ITV from the BBC, admitted he does not speak to Cowell anymore, but also that he barely spoke to him when he was on the show.The TV presenter’s new 12-part car show features couples competing in driving challenges. It is is his first major entertainment series on TV since he left the X Factor.O’Leary denied he quit The X Factor because he knew he was going to be replaced, but admitted he had begun to feel a little stale.The Radio 2 presenter added the BBC should not get a “kicking” for successful shows like The Voice.
