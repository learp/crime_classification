Ringo Starr has followed Bruce Springsteen in canceling a forthcoming concert in North Carolina in protest over the state’s newly minted anti-LGBT law. The former Beatles drummer said in a statement: “I’m sorry to disappoint my fans in the area, but we need to take a stand against this hatred. Spread peace and love.”The law, known as HB2, prevents transgender people from using the public restrooms that correspond with their gender identity, decreeing that all public institutions must post signs saying that bathrooms and locker rooms are to be used only based on biological sex. It also prevents municipal governments from passing anti-discrimination laws.Describing the law as bigotry, Starr said of the legislators: “How sad that they feel this group of people cannot be defended.” He concluded his statement quoting the titles of two songs: Canned Heat’s Let’s Work Together and the Beatles’ All You Need is Love.Starr and Springsteen are not the only performers to have canceled gigs in response to anti-LGBT legislation in the south. On Sunday, Bryan Adams pulled a show in Biloxi, Mississippi, over a new law that allows religious groups and some private business to refuse to serve gay people. Younger artists due to play in the area soon include Beyoncé, Justin Bieber, Pearl Jam and Cindy Lauper, all of whom have been vocal in their support of the LGBT community, leading to speculation that they may also pull their concerts.
