The row over the BBC’s loss of the Great British Bake Off has broken into the open after a senior BBC executive said Channel 4 should be more tightly regulated and that the £75m raids made it more likely to be privatised.James Purnell, director of strategy and education at the BBC and a former culture secretary, was highly critical of the raid by a publicly owned, commercially funded broadcaster. Channel 4 was “too lightly regulated”, he said, calling for the “chasm” between the two publicly owned broadcasters to be closed.The furore over Channel 4 outbidding its publicly owned rival had “given ammunition to people who want to privatise it,” he said. “This has reopened an argument which was very much closing”.Bake Off will be a 'total disaster' on Channel 4, says Lord Sugar Government plans to privatise Channel 4, revealed by a leaked document last year, have receded under the new government following former culture secretary John Whittingdale’s departure. Jay Hunt, Channel 4’s chief creative officer, said Purnell’s comments on tighter regulation were “a slightly amazing thing to say – we don’t take a penny of public money”. “We are already well regulated,” she said.She described the BBC as “upset” about losing its hit show, but that the corporation “lost” the contract after its relationship with Bake Off producers Love Productions broke down.“The BBC lost Bake Off,” she said. “Channel 4 didn’t take it.”Hunt denied the change that buying a show which had been launched by the BBC seven years ago would reopen the debate about the broadcaster’s finances.“Our sustainability is not in question,” she said adding that Channel 4. Hunt denied that the channel was surprised not to be able to woo all four main presenters of the show. Channel 4 was “delighted at buying a successful format” and knew that the four main presenters were not part of the deal. Paul Hollywood’s decision to stick with the show was a “bonus”, she said.Mary Berry, Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc decided to quit the show and remain with the BBC, which is currently working on a rival format.As a former controller of BBC1, Hunt then pointed out that, unlike her, Purnell had never commissioned for such a channel.In an increasingly tetchy exchange played out in public on the Royal Television Society panel, Purnell said: “As a former culture secretary I helped set up [media regulator] Ofcom.”The former Labour minister, said he did not personally agree that it should be privatised.In a later sesssion, director general Tony Hall refused to discuss the views of his strategy director.
