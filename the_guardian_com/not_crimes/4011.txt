Steven Spielberg has joined a select group including the Queen, JK Rowling and Sir David Attenborough by being awarded a gold Blue Peter badge. The Oscar-winning director, producer and screenwriter said he had “always secretly privately wanted” the badge, which is the BBC children’s television programme’s highest accolade. The BFG review: delicate touch of Spielberg and Rylance proves hugely charming “I’m going to wear it with pride. I’ve been aware of Blue Peter ever since I started making movies here in 1980. I made Raiders of the Lost Ark here in the UK in 1980,” said Spielberg, whose latest film, The BFG, is in UK cinemas from Friday. “This is my first Blue Peter badge … so thank you.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  BFG trailer: see Mark Rylance as the Big Friendly Giant in new look at Steven Spielberg film – videoThe 69-year-old US film-maker was awarded the badge for his talent, passion and pioneering work, according to the CBBC show. Each year a handful of gold badges are awarded in recognition of outstanding achievements, bravery, inspiration and citizenship. Children are eligible, as well as adult guests on the show. Others to pin the ship-shaped badge to their lapels include Roald Dahl’s illustrator Sir Quentin Blake, children’s author Malorie Blackman and footballer David Beckham.To coincide with The BFG film and the centenary of Dahl’s birth, Blue Peter had been running a Dream Big competition, which asked young viewers to pitch their own fantasy stories. The winner, Betty, a 12-year-old from Hull, attended the UK premiere and was given the chance to discuss her winning entry with Spielberg.
