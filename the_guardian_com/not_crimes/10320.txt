If you are a gardener, in April your windowsills will probably look just like mine: a jumbled mass of tray after tray of tiny seedlings crammed on to every surface available. As they grow they inevitably become increasingly closely packed, shading each other from the precious little light available at this time of year. A gentle tickle mimics the action of wind and passing animals, causing seedlings to grow stockier Eventually they will start to grow long and leggy, in a process us botanists call etiolation. These etiolated plants will be weak and floppy, far more likely to fail when eventually transplanted out into the garden. That is if fungal diseases don’t pick them off before they ever get to that stage. A nightmare.Fortunately, there are two simple tricks that can dramatically reduce etiolation in young seedlings, creating stockier, sturdier plants. The best bit? They don’t involve any special kit, cost or chemicals, just five minutes of your time in total.As etiolation is caused by lack of light, a really easy way to prevent it is by simply improving the amount of sunlight that gets to your seedlings in the first place. Although even scrupulously clean window glass may filter out up to 20% of the wavelengths used by plants, dusty glass can slash the light getting through by half. A quick wipe (especially on the outside of your windows) could make a significant impact – even if they look pretty clean.Much of the light that is getting through the glass may additionally be bypassing your little army of seedlings so try to arch them towards the window in search of catching the most rays. A simple reflector can also instantly sort this out by bouncing back the rays on to the leaves.Aluminium foil is perfect for the job. Wrap a piece of cardboard in the stuff and place it on the interior side of the window or simply line the surface of the windowsill and you will see a noticeable improvement in light levels and more balanced growth as a result.Finally, here is an even simpler trick that requires just 10 seconds of your time a day. It may sound a little mad, but I promise it is based on sound science. A gentle stroking of the surface of your seedlings mimics the action of wind and passing animals and will trigger vibration sensors in the plants, causing them to respond by growing stockier and stouter to resist damage.It’s a phenomenon called thigmomorphogenesis (I love a good geekspeak word) and it is used by commercial growers employing large fans or even robots to boost seedling resilience as much as 70%. Fortunately a 10-second tickle each day will work just as well for the average home grower.
