George Orwell has won planning permission to return – as a lifesize bronze statue – to the BBC, which he left on bad terms in 1943 snarling that his work there as a talks producer “was wasting my own time and the public money on doing work that produces no result”.This time he won’t cost the public a penny: all the money for the first public statue honouring the author of Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal Farm has been raised from private donors, through a trust founded by the late Labour MP Ben Whitaker.Westminster city council has granted planning permission for the sculpture, which will be sited among the corporation’s smokers who tend to congregate at the entrance to New Broadcasting House. They will further be challenged by the quotation inscribed on the wall behind him: “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.”He will be warmly welcomed back. Robert Seatter, the head of BBC history, said: “George Orwell was one of many famous names to work for the BBC during the 20th century, and his legacy as a novelist and journalist lives on to this day. He reputedly based his notorious Room 101 from Nineteen Eighty-Four on a room he had worked in whilst at the BBC, but here he will stand in the fresh air reminding people of the value of journalism in holding authority to account.”Four years ago the project seemed doomed when the BBC turned down the gift, reportedly because more than 60 years after his death, Orwell was still viewed as too provocative a figure.

Jennings’s most recent work, a statue of the Jamaican-born Crimean war nurse Mary Seacole, sparked controversy, as some felt it was inappropriately sited on a terrace of St Thomas’ hospital in London, where Florence Nightingale founded her famous nursing school.He said he is eager to crack on with the Orwell statue, which he hopes will be ready early next year. “Orwell was not only a paragon of political journalism but an ideal subject for a sculptor: loomingly tall, skinny as a rake, forever fag in hand, body leaning in to make a point. He wore the kind of clothes that might have spent their off-duty hours hanging from a nail in the potting shed. I can’t wait to start.”
