In the Vancouver riots the police were surging, charging the crowd, the crowd scattering. It was one of those moments when the police stopped, I stopped, and I saw two people lying in pretty much an empty street. My first thought was that the woman was hurt. I zoomed in on the back of my camera and the centre of the picture was her legs. They were about 30m away. I shot two frames and moved on. It was only back at the hockey rink where we were based that my editors took over. That's where someone mentioned "that kissing couple picture". I didn't know what they were talking about. I've since met the couple a few times. I signed a picture for them, and they signed one for me. In fact, I just heard from Alex's mother and they are still together, doing fine in Melbourne. Rich Lam/Getty  Disturbing … Amy Winehouse in her final concert, in Belgrade. Photograph: Brian Rasic / Rex FeaturesI had been photographing Amy Winehouse since she started, and her PR and manager organised for me to cover this gig. I was born in Belgrade, so it was pure coincidence that the tour was starting there. What I didn't know was that I was the only photographer there. The gig was fairly disastrous, but we'd seen that before with her. It wasn't new and it wasn't anything you would think about afterwards. But because she was my client, I was protective of her. So the initial photographs that went out were as nice as possible. When she passed away, I went back to my pictures and decided to release a few more as I believed the world should see what happened there. They are disturbing photos: you could see she was troubled. When some of my colleagues saw them, they cried. I have mixed feelings and can't really be proud. I've been documenting music for decades now, but I think those pictures of Amy will follow me for ever. Brian Rasic/Rex   Ghostly vision … trees cocooned in spiders' webs. Photograph: Russell Watkins/Department for International DevelopmentI was in Pakistan a year ago for DFID, looking at the impact of British aid in helping people affected by the floods. We were looking at shelter and water needs. In northern Sindh a vast area had been flooded, but the waters had finally receded enough for local communities to start to return; they were coming back to discover they had lost everything. While we were there the local NGOs told us about this odd phenomenon; miles and miles of flooded land, where every piece of vegetation was shrouded in these spider webs, like candy floss. It was stunning – a surreal sight. The trees were the only things above the water, so it was a very strange landscape, definitely ghostly. A few people have told me since that you can get a population explosion in a species triggered by a mega environmental event like this, but I don't know if this is true. I have been trying to find out if it has occurred again this year when southern Sindh was hit by floods, but I haven't heard. People said that although they were used to flooding they had never seen this happen before. Russell Watkins/Dfid  Howzat? A young bowler draws a crowd in Chittagong. Photograph: Philip Brown/REUTERSI was in Chittagong to cover a cricket world cup match. Early one morning, I started photographing this boy throwing a ball in the air and catching it. After a particularly high toss, the ball landed on a roof and couldn't be retrieved. I bought a replacement and the boy began bowling with his new and more colourful ball. I positioned myself in the firing line. Later, I left a large print of this photograph in a local shop to be given to the lad. Philip Brown/Reuters
