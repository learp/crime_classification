The Twin Peaks revival is to air on Sky Atlantic in the UK, after the broadcaster secured the rights to Showtime’s entire catalogue, which also includes hit shows such as The Affair. Sky’s exclusive pan-European deal – thought to run for in excess of five years – is believed to be worth more than £500m. CBS-owned Showtime has just debuted eagerly anticipated Damian Lewis and Paul Giamatti Wall Street drama, Billions.“This is one of the most important content deals Sky has ever agreed, cementing Sky’s position as the market-leader in Europe for world-class drama,” said Sky managing director of content Gary Davey. “The agreement means our customers can enjoy an incredible slate of upcoming new dramas like Billions, Twin Peaks and also explore hundreds of hours of amazing series such as Dexter, Californication, The Affair and House of Lies on demand from the back catalogue of one of the world’s most exciting pay TV networks.”The value of the deal was not revealed but Sky is known to have paid at least £55m a year for a UK-only HBO rights agreement, which runs until 2020. The pan-European Showtime deal is thought to be worth about £75m per year.“This is the most significant international deal in the history of Showtime, and further signals the value and prestige of its content brand in the global marketplace.” said Armando Nunez, chief executive of CBS’s global distribution group. “This deal shows how robust and profitable Showtime has become as a standalone product and revenue stream. We look forward to working with our outstanding partners at Sky to present Showtime to its customers across Europe and on a wide range of their platforms.”Sky had previously licensed selected Showtime content, such as The Affair, on a programme-by-programme basis.In November, Sky extended its HBO deal to cover customers in Germany, Austria and Italy.
