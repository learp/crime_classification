Who’s your hero now?  Guardian contributor BilliePiper1 13 July 2016 1:51pmI loved Madonna, and Michael Jackson - I loved dancing, so... and Madonna was the beginning of all that chippy feminism wasn't it? It really was the beginning of that. Not of feminism itself, but that front-footed, sexually aware, ballsy, super smart, non-stop wonders.  Madonna’s Blonde Ambition tour, 1990.

Any tips for actors/actresses who are still learning?  Guardian contributor BilliePiper1 13 July 2016 1:49pmDo dance classes - I know that sounds stupid, but one of the most important things is to be aware of your body. In a great way, not a 'I hate my body' way. Feeling the floor beneath you, dance helps with that. And it stops you being physically awkward, and helps you to take the piss out of yourself. Clowning is really important. And don't make acting a bloodsport because it will destroy you - find stories you feel affected by and don't make it remotely competitive.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm BST13:49Katheriness30 asks:You inspire me. What is your life philosophy and work mantra?   Guardian contributor BilliePiper1 13 July 2016 1:47pmSleep with your script. Have life and work, because one feeds the other. Watch things and read things outside of what you're currently working on.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.48pm BST13:48I'd tell my younger self: Stay at school for longer!

Were you gutted to have had no screen time with Timothy Dalton?  Guardian contributor BilliePiper1 13 July 2016 1:45pmAs actors, it was pretty upsetting too. But I think in a way it sort of worked - everyone's story got tied up, and no-one was expecting it to be the end. So they sort of won in every way. It was just very sudden. I don't think I'd be able to keep it together if I shared a scene with Timothy - he makes me laugh so much. The twinkle in that man's eye is terrifying. He's one of the funniest people I've ever met. There's nothing better than seeing him stroll through Dublin in a hoodie - he dresses like a teenager, he really does, and it's the same outfit all the time. He's so handsome as well, my mum almost collapsed when she met him.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.45pm BST13:45tinyconfusion06 asks:Would you classify Lily Frankenstein [in Penny Dreadful] as a villain?  Guardian contributor BilliePiper1 13 July 2016 1:43pmI think she's a romantic villain. I just think she's a romantic in many ways, and her bad behavior is in the name of revenge.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.43pm BST13:43I love Doctor Who fans. I meet fans who were named Rose – it's terrifying!krumstets asks:How would you equate the fandomness that you experienced as a pop star and that of being in Doctor Who?  Guardian contributor BilliePiper1 13 July 2016 1:42pmThey are two totally different experiences. Because for the fans of Doctor Who, they're in love with Rose, they love what she stands for and represents. And with music, it was more a personality-based thing. I love Doctor Who fans. But the worlds collide sometimes. I meet fans of Doctor Who now who were named Rose when they were born - it's terrifying! It was ten years ago. I've met a few Billies too...Updatedat 1.44pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.42pm BST13:42Sophie24601 asks:How is Yerma different to the other theatre you’ve been involved in?  Guardian contributor BilliePiper1 13 July 2016 1:39pmThe way we're making it is very different to what I'm used to. We started with three scenes on day one, and that's really terrifying. The director and writer is writing it as we go, and that can be unsettling at times, but he likes to see things happen for the first time all the time. Normally you're drilling your body into perfection with a performance on stage, and I think he's more interested in the imperfections. Which is great for him, and terrifying for us.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.41pm BST13:41Emily Metcalfe asks:Considering you’re a mother, was it difficult getting into the mindset of your character for Yerma?  Guardian contributor BilliePiper1 13 July 2016 1:37pmI'm still getting into it, so it's not totally established yet, but I feel like I can access it. I know a lot of people who are in this world at the moment, and I know what it means to have a child so the reverse of that would be awful. In that sense, I don't find being a mother is affecting getting in there and understanding it. We've also spent a lot of time talking to people other than friends who have a treacherous fertility past - five minutes with those guys you know what's going on. It's awful - but there are success stories. But not for our Yerma...FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.40pm BST13:40I would love to play Lady Macbeth in a modern adaptation: it's my favourite Shakespeare playAllegra Giannini asks:If you could play one role in your life, what would it be? (I would love to see you as Lady Macbeth!)  Guardian contributor BilliePiper1 13 July 2016 1:36pmYes, I would love to play Lady Macbeth. I would like a modern adaptation - I'd be terrified about how I would bring something new to it, but it's my favourite Shakespeare play, so it would be a gift of a role. It's just a very, very tasty story. It's deep, isn't it? I don't know how to be articulate about it - it's just got everything you want in a tale.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
