Growing up, I remember the black bucket next to my nan’s back door. Filled with icy-cold water it held a fish, bought early in the morning by my grandfather from the docks. The fish would sit there, soaking, before it would be scaled, gutted, filleted and cooked for tea. It would have been caught overnight, by one of the small fishing boats that work the Solent. Fresh in every way that mattered, with a minuscule carbon footprint.10 things children should learn to cook My grandparents had an allotment, for vegetables. It wasn’t a huge patch of land, but Gramps had the knowledge and skill to ensure there was always something growing, whether it was beans or marrows (I used to hate marrows, and have eaten only one since I was seven – it was less vile than my memory had me believe).My nan could knit. And crochet. And sew. She could cook a meal from nothing, and knew how each of the plants my gramps brought home should be prepared. She could mend things, and he could make things. Window panes could be replaced and old sheets would find a new purpose in life as useful rags. I even caught Nan unravelling old jumpers, and winding the wool back into skeins. A new blanket, brightly crocheted, would appear a few days later.I grew up amid all this knowledge, taking the skills surrounding me for granted. And, like many others of my generation, and the one that went before, I mocked them as useless and archaic. My mum worked in an office, and when I grew up, I was going to power-dress and be far too important to soak fish in a bucket, or need to knit a jumper. My school had the same attitude. I remember one home economics class, where I made a fruit salad. Another, I was shown how to make bread, and had to write down the method as the teacher cooked it. We were allowed to take a roll of the rock-hard salty result home; it put me off homemade bread for two decades.When I moved out of home, I was 17. I had a baby daughter, a newly refurbished ground-floor maisonette, with a long garden, which soon got overgrown – I moved into a 16th-floor flat instead soon after. Now I would commit most crimes short of murder to have that plot of land back.

My daughter had Farley’s powdered food – remember them? The ones you have to boil a kettle and add hot water to. My grandfather had died, and Nan was ageing. Suddenly, I needed the skills I had taken for granted all my life, and I lacked them. I wasn’t taught at school how I was meant to budget, run a house, feed my family, do the weekly shop, mend a hinge, or change a fuse. I didn’t have a clue. Most of us don’t, unless we go out of our way to learn.And isn’t that the wrong way round? Our grandparents and some of our parents were taught these skills at school because they were recognised as vital. I, by contrast, had to learn to boil an egg from Delia Smith.How I learned to cook By the time I had my youngest daughter, a decade had passed since I was the Pot Noodle queen. Kebabs were replaced by home-cooked stews and handmade fresh burgers. The baby never even tasted a spoonful of baby rice – she grew up on pureed sweet potatoes, carrots and cauliflower. But I had to battle to teach myself the skills our education system no longer teaches. Twenty years on, I can knit, sew, crochet and mend. I have grown vegetables and had such a glut of runner beans I gave overflowing carrier bags of them away to my neighbours and wondered how on earth a small handful could cost £2 in Tesco. My sewing machine is always within easy reach, and beds are covered in brightly coloured crocheted blankets, made by me. Things cost less when you know how to do it yourself; I can budget to the last penny and cook a meal from next to nothing.In a time when more and more families are feeling the pinch, and are struggling to put good food on their tables, the ability to be able to provide even a bowl of freely picked blackberries can make a difference. To know where the bushes grow, and pick enough for a crumble, will save upwards of £2.50. We’re bombarded with demands to buy ethically and responsibly, yet there’s no importance given to teaching us how to sustain ourselves and our families, how to make a simple T-shirt, how to knock up a batch of pastry to go in the freezer, or how to do something as basic as plant a bean in a pot.Life was cheaper when it was simpler, and perhaps that’s what I had learned as I grew up topping and tailing runner beans, and shelling peas into a bowl at the small kitchen table. Only now do I realise how priceless such knowledge can really be. It’s knowledge we should all have. Maybe it’s time to go back, so we can move forward, and relearn the skills we’re losing. Teach them in schools, make them compulsory. Because one day we will need them, and there’ll be no one left to teach us.
