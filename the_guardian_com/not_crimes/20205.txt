Germany has bought the California home that once belonged to the Nobel prize-winning author Thomas Mann and plans to turn it into a “centre for transatlantic dialogue”, after fears it was being sold off as a “teardown” – of value only for the land on which it stands – caused outrage among German fans of the author.Three thousand curators and writers – including Nobel laureate Herta Müller – signed an online petition for the house to be saved after it went on the market at an asking price of $15m.The sale was secured earlier this week after a period of hard bargaining, according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. Germany’s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, told the paper the building had been a “home for many Germans who worked toward a better future for their country, paved the way for an open society and laid the foundations for common transatlantic values”.“We want to revive the Thomas Mann villa in that spirit,” he said. The renovation of the house is expected to take two years.Mann fled Germany with his family in 1933, when Hitler came to power, moving first to Switzerland and then to the US, where he had the five-bedroom house in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles built to his own specifications.

Mann died three years later in Switzerland.As the house was put up for sale in August this year, New Yorker critic Alex Ross wrote: “The ‘magic villa’ on San Remo, as the German press calls it, is more than the home of a great writer: it is a symbol of a fraught period in American history, one that gave a refugee from nazism feelings of deja vu.”
