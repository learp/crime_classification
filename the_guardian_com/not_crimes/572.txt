The mayfly is "up" on Derwentwater, a correspondent writes, and it is early. He adds that the abundant blackheaded gulls are getting more than the trout. Mr. Beach Thomas, in "Spring," says that “the appearance of the mayfly is telegraphed from one end of the country to the other, and the word is passed along with some eagerness, for sheer reasons of Sport." The mayfly must indeed be a tasty morsel, and when it is "up" the trout gorge themselves, and blindly take the angler's mayfly as well as the insect that is floating free. The flight of the perfect mayfly, its nuptial flight, is short; in a few hours, as a rule, all is ended. We look upon this last mad dance, its one opportunity of enjoying aerial existence, with pity; it seems to us as if the whole of its previous life was merely a tedious grind tolerated in the hope of a few hours' pleasure before the inevitable end. But are we right in our estimate of what we call ephemeral life? Does not the aquatic larva, feeding in the water and in some instances in the vegetation in the mud, really enjoy this continuous feast as much as its short winged life? Is our own mature life, though much longer in proportion, always happier than our juvenile and adolescent days? We know more when we are older, but we care more, and often suffer more in consequence. So during its life of at least a year the larval mayfly may thoroughly enjoy its food and its comparative immunity from danger. When as a subimago - in one of the commonest species the "green drake" of the angler – its perils increase, and in the last few hours it is beset by finned and avian foes. Probably even then it does not realise danger; it has one instinct obliterating all care, and if the trout or bird snatches it up in the midst of its ecstasy its end is hastened by but a few minutes or hours at the outside.
