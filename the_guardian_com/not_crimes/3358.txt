I start in my steam room, listening to hip hop and trap, and end up in there for longer than recommended. I get carried away with the music. Then, after a shower, I use coconut oil all over my skin and hair: I like how healthy and natural it is. The steam room opens up my pores, so I feel fresh, but I might use tea tree oil or a good face wash, too, because I like to feel very, very fresh.I like to see everything when choosing what to wear. My wardrobes go all around my room, so it’s easy to stand back to look at it all. It’s like a clothes shop: it is very organised. I usually have in mind what I’m going to wear, but when I can see everything, I might pick a jacket or jeans I hadn’t thought about.I put fragrance on first, so it doesn’t mark my clothes. I like to wear things that show my silhouette, because I feel that I’m in quite good shape. At the moment, my favourite pair of jeans are by Saint Laurent – I bought them in three colours. If I’m going for a more comfy look, I wear tapered high-end jogging bottoms. I like accessories, too: a pair of clear specs, maybe, or a nice watch. I know some people like their watches to look bashed-up vintage, but I prefer them nice and polished. Everyone has their own style, but my biggest no-no is dirty clothes.How I get ready: Pearl Lowe Preparation is key. I like taking my time and really getting into it. I have a drink – maybe imported Guinness, or rum and ginger beer if friends are coming over – and go at my own pace. You never know what’s going to happen when you’re out. One of my mates might be like, “Let’s stay out for seven more hours”, so before that happens, I like to be in control as much as I can.• Tinie Tempah’s Junk Food is out now.
