So how does the new PM and husband Philip do summer style on a break from Brexit Britain? They keep it neutral, with matching outdoor gear on a walking tour through a Swiss forest. It’s a basic, practical look, which says: “We’ve got a loyalty card at Snow & Rock.”Theresa May picks neutral Switzerland for summer holiday For the Mays this means sturdy hers’n’his trekking poles, Lego-bright, union-jack red and blue colour-blocked polo shirts. It’s all topped off with sensible backpacks featuring sternum straps that could almost double as jaunty neckerchiefs from a distance. It’s a very matchy-matchy, look; on trend with fashion’s current obsession with twinning, like Beyoncé comparing style notes with daughter Blue Ivy Carter or Mulberry’s model twins Odette and Lia Pavlova. Could Theresa and Philip be the normcore version of a Kooples couple?For anyone who’s really paying attention, sunglasses are the takeaway item: Theresa’s big, bug-eyed shades are a subtle, indisputably classic power look, aiming for the Jackie O zone. Philip’s are a bit more “bought these four years ago in WH Smith that time it got too sunny on the M4”.Students of Conservative party history will of course remember that the Thatchers were fond of summering in Switzerland, a reference that will play well with Tory grandees who lap up anything with a hint of Maggie. Fashionistas may be inclined to note that there was a outdoorsy tone to Erdem’s current season lookbook, and that hiking boots featured on the Bottega Veneta spring catwalk: Theresa is nothing if not capable of playing to more than one crowd. Makes a change from seeing David Cameron rotate his collection of blue shirts and espadrilles, at least.
