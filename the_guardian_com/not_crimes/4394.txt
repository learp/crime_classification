The Apple event that saw the unveiling of the iPhone 7 and AirPods opened with a short film of CEO Tim Cook in a Carpool Karaoke session with Late Late Show host James Corden. It was just about as awkward as it sounds.The video of Corden escorting Cook to the event in San Francisco, opens with the pair belting OneRepublic’s I Lived, which includes the lyric: “Hope when the crowd screams out, they’re screaming your name.” James Corden's Carpool Karaoke to debut as series on Apple Music Not to read too much into the choice, but is it a stretch to imagine this particular sentiment resonating with Cook, who is not and never will be Steve Jobs? I mean, he’s literally about to take the stage at an Apple product launch, and just last year there was an entire film dedicated to scenes of crowds rapturously greeting Steve Jobs as he took the stage at product launches.After the pair engage in some banter and messing about with Siri, the singer-songwriter-producer Pharrell Williams hops into the backseat, and the trio break into Lynyrd Skynyrd’s 1974 hit Sweet Home Alabama.Cook hails from Mobile, Alabama, which might explain the song choice – or could there be another element at work here? Lynyrd Skynrd wrote the song as a something between a response to and attack on Neil Young, who in recent years has become more and more devoted to the development of the Pono, a portable digital media and music player that Young would very much like you to believe is a competitor to Apple’s various products. Is Cook throwing shade?The video is the most fun you’ll have watching an ageing CEO strain to appear good-natured all day, assuming that the remainder of your day doesn’t somehow involve finding yourself in Elon Musk’s office as he realizes that someone has moved the blotter on his desk a quarter-inch to the left.
