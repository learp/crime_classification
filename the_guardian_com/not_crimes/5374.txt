Researchers exploring the value of different types of timber across the Amazon rainforest have produced a fascinating choropleth map to illustrate their findings.Shown above, it consists of timber values plotted on a gridded map of equal-area cells, each 0.25km-squared in size.

Hymenaea appears to be the most valuable variety across the rainforest as a whole, while Manilkara has something of a high-value hotspot in the northern central area.  Each of the 11 high-value genera, showing genus-specific spatial patterns in the distribution of timber value and differences in total value (US$/ha). Image and caption courtesy of authors.
