A candlelit vigil has been held outside the ArcLight cinema in Hollywood to coincide with first public screenings of The Birth of a Nation. The film, which opens in the US this weekend, has been overshadowed by the resurfaced allegations of sexual assault against its director, Nate Parker. The group protesting was Fuck Rape Culture, which issued a statement before the protest, explaining its motives. It ran: “FRC recognises the need to hold space for those celebrating the advancement of people of colour in Hollywood while continuing to fight for the victims of sexual assault and rape around the world.” Silent sit-in for victims of rape and sexual assault. #togetherwecan • • • #work #press #amwriting #movies #travelphotography #travelgram #traveljournalist #wanderlust #digitalnomad #ontheroad #solotraveler #locationindependent #travelpreneur #travelbug #journalism #writing #freelancer #freelancelife #losangeles #hollywood #birthofanation #protest #vigilA photo posted by Valentina Valentini (@tiniv11) on Oct 6, 2016 at 8:04pm PDTAbout 50 people gathered for the two-hour sit-in, which was conducted in silence. Appearances by Parker on TV over the past week, in which he explained that he would not apologise for the case as he was not found guilty of a crime, have done little to quell anger among some groups. Speaking to Variety, Elyse Cizek, the organiser of the event – who is a victim of rape – later said that she found Parker’s stance problematic. “I chose to be a part of the demonstration because, as a survivor, I wish for space to be held for myself and others who have been left voiceless in an industry that has the power to create change but refuses to listen to the needs of those they have silenced,” she said.The story of Nate Parker's rape accuser and a university's cold shoulder “We [women] are a huge part of their audience and are continuously victimised and shamed for the crimes committed against us, yet too often used as accessories and plot points for those who seek to gain from our experiences in spite of us. I am saddened not only for my own experiences but for those who were directly affected by the actions of both Nate Parker and those seeking to glorify him despite his negligence in addressing the issue of rape culture while simultaneously perpetuating it.”
