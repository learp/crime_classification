A group representing 60 local authorities has warned that recent closures of large power stations have left Britain heading for power cuts next winter, despite assurances to the contrary from the government.The Industrial Communities Alliance (ICA), an all-party association of councils from across Britain, said National Grid needed to act immediately to fill the supply gap by sending out new contracts for at least 2,500 megawatts (MW) of additional generating capacity – enough to power 2.5m homes.The alliance wants ministers to reconsider the level of carbon taxes, saying this is one of the key reasons why so many coal-fired power stations are being shut down early.Five plants, including Longannet, Ferrybridge and Rugeley, representing 7,000 MW of electricity-generating capacity, were available this winter but would not be fully in action by the end of the year, the group said.“The problem – and it is a problem for every electricity consumer in the country – is that if all these closures go ahead, there won’t be enough generating capacity to keep the lights on next winter,” said the ICA in a briefing document entitled Lights Out!Goodbye to Cockenzie power station, a cathedral to coal It continued: “Beyond the five power stations under threat, there are five more coal-fired power stations left on the grid – Aberthaw, Cottam, Drax, Ratcliffe and West Burton. How long before they too are proposed for closure?”In recent years, coal, nuclear and gas-fired plants have been shut because of low prices, high operating costs or old age. Windfarms have been erected and new nuclear facilities promised but energy companies say gas plants cannot be built without higher subsidies.Engie, the owner of Rugeley coal-fired station in Staffordshire, which made the most recent closure announcement earlier this month, blamed low wholesale power prices as much as carbon taxes for its decision.The alliance noted that late last year, the National Grid introduced a system of contracts to keep voluntary capacity in reserve, but it did not believe enough had been done.This leaves the power system “perilously exposed” to plant breakdowns, cold spells or calm weather that cuts output from wind turbines, the local authorities said, and this could hurt jobs as well as consumers.A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) denied blackouts were looming. “We are clear that providing a secure supply of affordable energy for our families and businesses is non-negotiable,” he said.“There will be no impact on this winter and action has already been taken to secure extra capacity for next winter. We will continue to work alongside National Grid and Ofgem [the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets] to take whatever additional steps are necessary to protect our energy supply.”What do you do with an old power station? The same message came from National Grid, a private sector company which has responsibility for balancing demand and supply. “We continue to work closely with industry, Decc and Ofgem and have already concluded successful tenders for an extra 3,600MW of [reserve power] for the winter of 2016-17 as well as continuing to focus on growing [demand reduction] activities,” a spokesman said.Ofgem said: “We are confident that electricity supplies will be secure next winter but there is no room for complacency. There are a range of tools to manage the electricity system. “National Grid will be conducting its detailed review of energy security for next winter in due course. National Grid’s review will take into consideration all relevant factors.”
