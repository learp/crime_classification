Berlin authorities say they shot and killed a wild boar after it attacked and injured four people including a police officer in a residential neighbourhood.Police said the 120kg (265lb) boar bit a 74-year-old man on the back and leg and knocked a 74-year-old woman to the ground in the Charlottenburg area of the German capital on Monday afternoon.It also bit a 24-year-old woman who escaped to safety by climbing on to a parked car. All three victims were treated in hospital. When a police officer arrived to tackle the boar, it attacked him and cut his leg. The officer pulled his gun and shot the animal.Wild boars are relatively common in Berlin, although they rarely cause problems beyond digging up gardens.
