Men, it’s a good thing that, when we’re blessed with children, biology has seen fit to designate us “fathers” rather than “mothers” because I, for one, would make a crap mum. To me, mums possess bottomless pits of patience and deep, endless wells of the kind of parenting skills I can only dream of, whereas I am seemingly powerless to prevent my own child from pouring her own urine from her potty into a sippy cup and drinking it while watching Peppa Pig. I wish I could blame the animated ungulate (as many have, for many things before me), but as neither Peppa nor George have ever, to my knowledge, been depicted drinking their own waste products, I must shoulder the blame. Does it make me question my abilities as a father? Yes. Should I also ask for the following to be taken into consideration? Hmm …The times they push me to the edgeOccasionally, when no one’s looking, I have a tiny, momentary fantasy of cheerfully throttling them. Take, for example, when Maisie, six, was in a fury over my positioning, on her shoulder, of the child car-seat belt. It was no different from usual, but the screaming and shouting on this occasion resulted in me accidentally reversing at speed into a parked van because her shouting had drowned out the beeps of the parking sensor. This incident pushed me to limits of endurance that would have made Bear Grylls snap and, for a fleeting moment, I would have happily taken the amusing battery-operated spinning fork I bought for her to twirl spaghetti with, and applied it to her hair.The times that bedtime is a jokeStories have been read (“Read it normally. We don’t like your funny voices, Daddy”), the correct nightlights (“No, Daddy! The flamingo one”) have been switched on and they are settled, so now it’s time to relax with eight bottles of Adnams Broadside and The Walking Dead. But no, who is this loitering at the top of the stairs claiming “I can’t sleep. I have tried, Daddy, but I just can’t” two minutes after being tucked in? Why it’s none other than Isla, four. And whose fault is it at 3am when she’s having zombie nightmares that have to be dealt with through a real-ale hangover? Mine, apparently.Fun times “We want to go to the playground, Daddy.” Words that strike “tedium” into the heart of any self-respecting father. Swings? Sure. Let’s do it. Climbing frame? Not a problem. Don’t fall off. Weird thing to sit on that – could be a caterpillar (or maybe a horse) atop a giant wobbly spring? Whatever. Initially, it’s all good. But two hours later … “Maybe we could go home? No? OK. The roundabout? Again? For the 200th time. Great.” You hear about people getting RSI from keyboards and the positioning of office chairs, but where’s the treatment and sympathy for fathers who’ve worked all morning, repetitively rotating a roundabout? And at my age a seesaw is just another way of reminding you that your spine could snap even more easily than your temper when faced with a child’s car seat.The times I attempt to do their hairDespite my penchant for deliberately entwining it in a battery-operated spaghetti fork, I have, on occasion, been left in charge of hair. Both daughters have waistlength reams of the stuff and dealing with it is like trying to tame an otter made of lightning. In their own words, I am “rubbish at hair”. Ask me to plait it, and you may as well be asking me to split its atoms and combine them with those of the brush that the dog has chewed into near oblivion. And if I am called on to create a ponytail, it will be one that belongs to a destroyed horse. As Hamlet said: “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” One of them is my daughters’ hair.We’re just scratching the surface, but suffice to say that when Darth Vader whispered those immortal words “Luke, I am your father”, Luke – if he’d known me – would’ve weighed up his father’s evil deeds, shrugged and replied: “Oh well, Dad, it could be worse. There’s this spaghetti fork guy in a galaxy far, far away …”• Portrait of an Idiot as a Young Man by Jon Holmes is published by Orion, £8.99.
