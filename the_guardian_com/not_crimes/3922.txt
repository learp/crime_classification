A glossy red lip is unashamedly high maintenance. It doesn’t lend itself to rushed weekday mornings, scoffing a piece of toast while running for the bus. Oh, no. It needs attention and care. And that is why nothing will ever beat it in the high glamour stakes. It’s pure queen bee. Perfect with swept back hair and huge earrings, as seen on the Kenzo SS17 runway. A matt base and high-shine clear top coat works well to create the look, but there are some brilliant gloss lip paints that hold their own, too.
