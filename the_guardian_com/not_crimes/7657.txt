Delia is a true British hero, in a way you don’t truly appreciate until you read How To Cook. Its pages are littered with references to culinary mistakes that are now, happily, dead and buried. She is one of that elite cadre to whom we should give thanks that dried pasta has become a staple item in British supermarkets. It’s down to people such as Delia that olive oil was freed from British pharmacists and delivered to dinner tables.Just as with veterans of long wars that made all of us better off, you have to forgive Delia for the odd lapse back to the dark era that she did more than almost anyone to bring to a close. It begins on page 376, as a good vinaigrette recipe gives way to a series of horrific visions, each a terrifying glimpse into the recent past. Preparing them is morbidly fascinating, like having a Neanderthal round for dinner: at first the insight into our ancestors is interesting, but before long, you just want them to leave and to have more palatable company.And perhaps the least welcome, hairiest, nastiest Neanderthal of all is to be found on page 387: the marinated kipper fillets and potato salad with coriander seeds and cracked pepper. Accompanied by a picture that looks closer to a medical textbook or perhaps a close-up from a war zone, this is surely Delia’s darkest hour.Delia’s recipe for chargrilled aubergines is a pain in the arm | The Delia project I have an iron rule that, the first time around, I can’t change Delia’s recipe – not at all. But it took everything to stay the course this time. The ingredients of this particular salad read as if all they have in common is a shared cupboard: kipper fillets, coriander seeds, peppercorns, shallots, bay leaves, lemon, wholegrain mustard, extra virgin olive oil, and dark brown sugar.So put off was I by this little list that I had to stop and remind myself that, thanks to Delia, I now make my own bread and I now know that an electric whisk isn’t just a toy, but the path to better, smoother mashed potato. Surely Delia must know what she’s doing this time?That question becomes a mantra as I turn myself to the task of skinning kippers. At this point, I wonder if Delia is trying to keep readers on their toes, as skinning kippers tests all the skills I picked up way back on page 267. I like to think Delia threw this in to punish anyone skipping ahead, because if you haven’t learned how to skin a fish properly, this is no way to learn.Still, thanks to Delia, I get to the end of the process without taking off a bit of a finger. That’s the last time today that I’ll write the words “Thanks to Delia”, because the resulting salad isn’t good. Not as bad as the terrifying photograph might suggest, but it does nothing to dispel the sense that Delia came up with this recipe to use up some leftover ingredients.Or perhaps – as there isn’t much of the book left – she threw in a curveball to test how far her budding cooks have come. Or perhaps it was just that she knew that you have to throw in something nasty at this point, because while page 387 hosts the world’s nastiest salad, page 388 gives me the chance to use one of my favourite words in the English language.That word is pudding.Stephen Bush is cooking his way through Delia’s Complete How To Cook (BBC Books, £40) in a year; You can watch Delia Smith’s free Online Cookery School videos at deliaonline.com; @deliaonlineStephen Bush is a writer and columnist for the New Statesman @stephenkb
