Snapchat is to get a weekly football “TV show” made by digital football network Copa90 and sports site Bleacher Report.James Kirkham, the head of Copa90, says that the new weekly show on Snapchat Discover will look “nothing like telly” instead it has been developed to fit with the ethos and style of Snapchat and its youthful users.“We want to give this [Snapchat] generation of football fans a show that resonates with them and contemporary viewing habits,” said Kirkham. “It’s a mad, fast paced, high octane, visually arresting feast on the senses combining video animation and typography too – borrowing the language and grammar of a generation weaned on Snapchat then dialling it up even more.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Copa90’s boss says its Snapchat channel is ‘a mad, fast paced, high octane, visually arresting feast’.
