1. The cake itself doesn’t matterOne of the best things about the excellent Women’s Weekly Kids’ Party Cakes book and its offshoots, iconic volumes that have raised a generation of Australians to thrill at the mention of The Choo-Choo Train or Leonard the Lion, is that all the recipes require “a 340g packet of cake mix”. Australian women know the score. Follow their lead and do not waste time on something that will mainly end up crumbled into your carpet. Source a cake however your conscience allows (bought, cake mix, strong-arm a baking relative). If all else fails, you could probably coat a house brick in sweets and buttercream to good effect.2. Don’t ask children what they wantAs in life, so in cake. You can, if you must, offer very narrow choices, such as vanilla or chocolate. But under no circumstances ask a child what kind of cake it wants because the child will answer carelessly, in the manner of a capricious Roman emperor: “The battle scene in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl where Pikachu uses Volt Tackle against Empoleon” or “Elsa and Anna riding Sven the reindeer through a magical winter wonderland” when, in fact, they would have been thrilled with a Poké Ball (round cake, half red fondant, half white fondant, cola string down the middle) or Olaf (three round-ish white cakes, Matchmakers or Twiglets for arms, a carrot-stick nose). Children are horribly imaginative, damn their sparkling eyes. Don’t encourage them.3. Approach Pinterest with cautionThere are some brilliant simple cake ideas on the aspirational online scrapbook, but the gulf between photograph and reality is often vast. Pinterest people live in a wholesome, brightly coloured netherworld of gluten-free bunting and hyperbole and their interpretation of the word “easy” is different from yours and mine. Choose carefully and beware the siren song of “20 super easy cakes with wow factor” or you may end up dashed on the “funfetti” and “unicorn bark” (no, no idea) rocks of your own hubris.4. Keep it simple Cake smart, not hard. Some variant on a round cake covered in sweets is actually pretty mind-blowing for a small child, especially in these sugar-averse times and can be very impressive. Look at – but on no account try to emulate – Cressida Bell’s incredible cakes for inspiration (she doesn’t bake either). Otherwise, pick something instantly recognisable and easy to reproduce. Minions (yellow icing, black and white fondant eyes) or Minecraft blocks (squares of chocolate on a green iced cake) are good. If you can sort bags of Skittles by colour and cut a round cake in half, you can make a genuinely excellent rainbow.5. Consider a templateIf you are planning a shape other than round, a template is essential: print it, cut out, place on the cake and cut round it with a sharp knife. You can find plenty of models on Pinterest, but no getting distracted by Paleo-friendly frosting. I’m watching you.6. Fondant is your friendThis isn’t The Great British Bake Off. Mary Berry isn’t going to clutch her pearls because you have used bought fondant, so buy a couple of slabs and get rolling. Yes, it tastes awful. No, no one will eat it apart from the children who get carrot sticks and rice cakes for treats at home. But fondant is perfect for bright colours and a clean(ish) finish. You also get a bonus feeling of professionalism from draping it over your rolling pin before you lay it over the cake.7. Props can hide a multitude of sinsYou have ignored all my instructions, made your own cake and it is a disaster. All is not lost: what you need are props. Raid your child’s toy box for forgotten farm animals, dinosaurs, trucks or Lego figures and allow your creativity to run wild over the craters, uneven surfaces, too-runny icing and bleeding colours. Edible glitter is also good here. Pro tip: if you cover a cake in a sufficient quantity of holographic glitter (about £2-3 a pot), it creates a sort of shimmering disco halo around your creation, blinding observers to its awfulness. Scientific fact, right there.
