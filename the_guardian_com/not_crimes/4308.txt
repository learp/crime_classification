A hotel in New Zealand has banned Lycra cycling shorts as it finds the “bumps and bulges” inappropriate and “unsightly”.In an effort to “raise dress standards” the Plough Hotel in Rangiora has put out of a sign on Thursday that read:“The bicycle is a beautiful object but they should never have invented lycra! No lycra shorts allowed please.”Mike Saunders, co-owner of the hotel, said he is trying to establish the cafe as an old-fashioned, family friendly meeting place, and has attacked Lycra shorts for revealing too many “unsightly bumps and bulges” of the human body.“I am not against Lycra in general, just Lycra shorts. A lot of our customers are elderly or children and they don’t need to know that much detail about the shape of somebody,” he told the Guardian.

Jandels [thongs or flip flops] are fine.“So far locals have respected the fact we are trying to enforce a dress code so they can eat their meals surrounded by people wearing trousers.”Siobhan Tolhurst, who once worked for Saunders’s at another cafe, explained the reasons for his lack of enthusiasm for Lycra.“I fully support Mike’s ban on Lycra. Because when the cyclists come in they do stink, they are sweaty and it is unhygienic sitting on the furniture and everyone, including little children, partaking in their post exercise demeanor.“We had a number of experiences with large men in tiny shorts and that’s not appropriate for children to see.”Pegasus Cycling Club chairwoman Tracy Clark told Fairfax New Zealand that the ban showed “a lack of understanding”.“There’s people in New Zealand now who have grown up disconnected from bicycles, have no understanding of what it is to get out there and ride and see the scenery, they are interested in getting in their car and driving place to place.“I think it’s just some ignorance or lack of understanding.”Ron Van Til, owner of Rangiora Bakery said the Plough Hotel’s stance was “a colourful and provocative move” but cyclists - and lycra shorts - would continue to be welcome in his establishment. “I have a different view that the world is a diverse place and we should embrace bodies of all shapes and sizes. I have no problem with lycra at all.”
