Interview With A Murderer 9pm, Channel 4 Like US cold-case doc The Jinx minus the gloss, this one-off sees criminologist Professor David Wilson probe Bert Spencer, previously imprisoned for killing pensioner Hubert Wilkes in Stourbridge in 1979. Spencer is also suspected of shooting paperboy Carl Bridgewater dead a year prior to Wilkes’s death, but has long protested his innocence. As Wilson explores both cases, expect difficult questions and grim retellings. Hannah J Davies The Extreme Cake Makers 12.30pm, Channel 4Baking, as you may have gathered, is big business. And the bakers featured in this scrumptious new series probably wouldn’t call themselves mere cake makers. Instead, the likes of Eloise Durrant and Rosie Dummer are “sugarcraft specialists” and “edible artists”, and their astonishing creations – anything from sponge solar systems to fondant swans – aren’t to be sniffed at. Just nibbled, respectfully. Ali CatterallEscape To The Chateau 7pm, Channel 4Retired army colonel and engineer Dick Strawbridge and his partner Angel buy an abandoned 19th-century chateau in the Pays de la Loire for a song. Although it’s been derelict for over 40 years, it’s not hard to see why they fell in love with its 45 rooms. Ignoring 200 pages of concerns from a surveyor, they’ve cracked on with the renovations regardless. Luckily, Dick has more than enough infectious joie de vivre to carry the whole show. Ben ArnoldPappano’s Italian Double Bill  7pm, BBC4Clemency Burton-Hill introduces performances of two short operas from the 19th-century Italian verismo tradition, under which the caprices and travails of demented nobility were disdained in favour of more everyday dramas. Antonio Pappano conducts the Royal Opera House orchestra through Cavalleria Rusticana by Pietro Mascagni and Pagliacci, which Ruggero Leoncavallo was inspired to write in response. Andrew MuellerCity In The Sky 9pm, BBC2 Second of three programmes following the global plate-spinning act of managing the million people airborne at any given time. Tonight’s episode follows an A380 night flight, with pilots keeping course by following a trail of digital breadcrumbs. Elsewhere, we learn about in-flight emergencies and two very different types of delivery: the transportation of racehorses from Belgium to Hong Kong and an online purchase from mousemat to doormat. Mark Gibbings-JonesChicago Med 9pm, UniversalThis sibling of Chicago Fire and Chicago PD takes up where ER left off, sharing both a city and a hospital department with the Clooney-launching hit. This week, Dr Choi treats an erratic patient convinced his heart is beating abnormally, while Dr Manning suspects a child admitted with a broken wrist is being abused – until a surprise diagnosis from Dr Charles suggests otherwise. Meanwhile, Dr Rhodes suffers the fallout after a death on the operating table. David Stubbs Educating Joey Essex: Reem Queen At 90 8pm, ITV2“She’s like the king,” says Joey Essex – by repute the least sparkling intellect of the Towie crew – “apart from she’s a girl.” Which shows you roughly where we are with this show, in which he attempts to meet the Queen to wish her happy birthday. Clearly, he’s going to need some help, so former press secretary Dickie Arbiter and royal correspondent Jennie Bond offer some advice. Surprise: some royal interaction does occur.

Photograph: THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY/Sportsphoto Ltd./AllstarSilver Linings Playbook(David O Russell, 2012) Sunday, 12.45am, Film4Rarely are laughs so emotionally charged as in David O Russell’s quirky romcom. Bradley Cooper is the volatile Patrick Solitano, returning to live with his parents (Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) after a spell in a mental institution following a violent parting with his wife. When he meets another awkward soul in young widow Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a sparky romance takes off. Not the most sophisticated account of mental disorder, but it’s a likable and often very funny tale. Paul HowlettThe Darjeeling Limited(Wes Anderson, 2007), 11.05pm, GoldAnother funny-peculiar comedy from Anderson, concerning three brothers (Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman) reuniting on the Darjeeling Limited train from Mumbai to the Himalayas, on the first anniversary of their father’s death, and locked in fraternal rivalry. A beautiful, eventful, sentimental journey. PHFrom Dusk Till Dawn(Robert Rodriguez, 1995), 11.50pm, ITV4A trashy, violent, Tex-Mex, ghouls-and-gangsters movie, lovingly scripted by Quentin Tarantino and directed with hard-rock energy by Rodriguez. George Clooney and Tarantino are murderous, bank-robbing brothers who kidnap the Rev Harvey Keitel and family (including Juliette Lewis) and turn up at a gruesome Mexican brothel swarming with rancid biker-vampires: a gorefest of staggering proportions.
