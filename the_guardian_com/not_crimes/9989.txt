Is it just me, or are we living through a royalist moment? The preposterous drama Victoria on ITV is soon to be followed (hot on the heels of his Queen-themed West End play The Audience) by Peter Morgan’s The Crown on Netflix. Comedy too is prey to our monarchic obsession. A new sitcom called Henry IX has been announced for Gold TV “about the king of England having a mid-life crisis”, while cartoonish royal soap opera The Windsors is to return for a second series on Channel 4. Jeremy Corbyn may demur from God Save the Queen, but no such scruples from the entertainment world, which is singing it lustily.BBC axes David Baddiel show that aired jokes about Queen's sex life I get that these are difficult times, from which many prefer to flee into a comforting fantasy world of palaces, ermine-lined robes and astronomic subsidy. And woe betide those who offend such a vision – witness the cancellation, announced last week, of David Baddiel’s Radio 4 show Don’t Make Me Laugh. The show’s apparent offence was to air an item, on her birthday, proposing – incontrovertibly enough – that “the Queen must have had sex at least four times”. Cue 100-plus complaints.“Trustees found it hard to imagine circumstances in which this broadcast at any time or on any day would not have given rise to significant unjustified offence,” said the BBC Trust in its ruling. Obviously it’s hard to judge without having heard the episode. But it’s not beyond my imagination to conceive of a time, or a day, when a less lickspittle Britain might have let mild monarch-ribbing pass. The 1970s, say, when sitcoms more closely resembled Citizen Smith, about a (hopeless) Marxist revolutionary, and pop culture squawked “God save the Queen / The fascist regime” at us. Or indeed the 1990s, when British art was Sensation, theatre was in-yer-face, and bedazzlement with the ruling class seemed like yesterday’s news.

But you’d think comedians, and lovers of comedy, would be disproportionately represented in the remaining 30%, wouldn’t you? Isn’t it (at least in theory) a dissenting art form, on the side of the little people, against unthinking privilege and unaccountable power? Isn’t it – as the rightwing press, and Andrew Lawrence, are forever telling us – entirely dominated by strident leftwing voices? If so, where is the counterpoint to the orgy of royalism now unfolding? Yes, there are Corbynista standups, and the “celebrate your grovelling servitude to the Queen” sketch on The Revolution Will Be Televised (four years ago now) leaps to mind. But there’s been nothing concentrated on the republican cause.Some would point to a number of (ahem) satirical TV and radio panel shows, and their jokes about the Queen’s “haunted fanny” (Frankie Boyle, way back when) or her sex life with the Duke of Edinburgh (Jack Whitehall on Channel 4’s Big Fat Quiz of 2012). You’ll notice a theme here: smutty sex jokes that substitute prurience for fawning. You might equally argue that The Windsors is “irreverent”, as indeed it is; it can be funny, too. But it’s also fundamentally affectionate, sponsoring an intimacy with this family (or their caricature alter egos) that supercedes any critique of the institution they represent.Now, I know – people keep telling me – that comedy is just meant to make us laugh, and isn’t meant to be revolutionary. (Tell that to Beppe Grillo, Jimmy Morales, Jón Gnarr, Russell Brand, etc.) I know that we (comedians included) have other, arguably more urgent things to worry about right now than monarchy. And of course – as per the republican argument that it’s not about whether the Queen or Princess Michael of Kent are good human beings or not – this isn’t an argument about the qualities of any individual comedy show.It’s just a request for comedy to oppose rather than bend the knee to the toadying tone of culture right now. A simple appeal for a comedy, an intervention or a satirical voice to call out the obsequiousness of our current moment, lay bare the anachronistic daftness of monarchy, and dismember its cheerleaders’ arguments piece (it’s good for tourism) by unconvincing piece (who’d want a president?). I suspect that activity won’t involve jokes about the Queen’s sex life. But even if it did, if we’d discovered a satirical republican mode with any teeth whatsoever, then that would be the least of her supporters’ worries.Three to seeRichard Gadd: Monkey See, Monkey DoPost-Edinburgh life begins for the show that won this year’s Edinburgh Comedy award, as the Fife comic brings his extraordinary confessional multi-media set, about abuse, masculinity and psychological breakdown, to Soho.• At Soho theatre, London, until 12 November.
