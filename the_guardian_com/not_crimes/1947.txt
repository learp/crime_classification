I hope other people were as cross as I was about the article regarding a survey that said the cut-off year for wearing jeans is 53 (G2, 3 November). What happens to us after 53? Virginia Ironside expresses the patronising view that Carol Klein, in her early 70s, can get away with wearing jeans, as she is a gardener. As can cowboys and physical workers.I hit 80 this year and intend to go on wearing jeans – and feeling good in them – for as long as I can pull them on!Marion GoughWalton-on-Thames, Surrey• What rubbish. I am 75 and will continue to wear jeans as long as I can get them on. I look great in them as do all my friends, skinny or ample. The whole point of jeans is that they fade, and adapt themselves to your shape.Sarah CarterCanterbury• So when are men supposed to stop wearing jeans? I suggest when they are 55, one year younger than Jeremy Clarkson. The cut-off point could move up a year each year.Margaret SquiresSt Andrews• So Virginia Ironside, what are people over the age of 53 supposed to wear, elasticated waist beige slacks? I’m a trim size 10, attend five gym classes a week, walk six to eight miles once or twice a week, plus a daily 30-60-minute walk each day with our dog. I’m 67 and wear jeans, and I can guarantee you I look better than someone 40 years younger than me wearing a “skinny” size 16! It’s about size and not age, just because Virginia doesn’t wear jeans it doesn’t mean everyone else can’t or shouldn’t.Dot WilkinsonCongleton, Cheshire• Sad to see Virginia Ironside capitulate to age paranoia, as we can never be truly ourselves for as long as we worry about what others think of us.Robert BellHastings• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
