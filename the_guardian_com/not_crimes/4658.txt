It has been two years since a joyful Rita Moreno took the stage to accept her SAG Achievement Award, where a star-studded crowd celebrated her impactful contribution to film and television. As an ex-actor and writer (but more importantly as a Latino) I witnessed with so much pride and admiration because it was a moment where Hollywood was rightfully acknowledging a Puerto Rican powerhouse, the first and only Latina to have won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony award. The historical importance of her career - or those of Desi Arnaz, Cantinflas or the Mexican spitfire, Lupe Velez (I recommend 1933’s Hot Pepper) - cannot be taken for granted because it opened the door of diversity and acceptance.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Fast forward to tonight’s Emmys and I find myself in a quandary: How is it, with all that we have to offer as performers and as an audience (Latino families are the most avid moviegoers in the country) that we find ourselves with ZERO nominations in any top categories? In a list of 150 performers, writers and directors there are only two Latino actors (Oscar Nuñez for Outstanding Actor In A Short Form Comedy Or Drama Series and Anthony Mendez for Outstanding Narrator) with nominations.Luis Guzman (@IamLuisGuzman)Not ONE LATINO NOMINATED FOR AN EMMY...OR AM I BLIND? #WOWJuly 14, 2016I’ve always thought of television as diversity’s Eden, a haven where we could marvel at the wonders of multiculturalism without ever leaving our living room. From ABC’s Fresh Off The Boat to FX’s Atlanta, we are not short of diversity and I applaud the heights it has reached in recent years, especially with the efforts of cultivating African-American talent. As The Undefeated poignantly calls it: we are about to enter the blackest fall in television history. Tonight, in the top acting categories, there are 17 African-American actors with well deserved nominations. But what about Latinos? One may argue that perhaps there are not enough shows or worthy performances from the Latin community or that if good material presented itself then a nod would surely follow. To that I ask: is the The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (ATAS) and its 1,500 member voters unaware of the tour de force that is Gina Rodriguez? Because the Golden Globes are. No other show on television cares about womanhood more than Jane the Virgin, and Rodriguez beautifully portrays the main character with strength and vulnerability - she is the Latina Mary Tyler Moore. Or how about the intoxicating Wagner Moura who steals every inch of Netflix’s Narcos whenever he enters the screen. And finally, let’s not forget Oscar Isaac in HBO’s Show Me A Hero. The Guatemalan-born American created a character that is both so decent and conflicted in a story of such social injustice. These performances were all worthy of an Emmy nomination. In addition, there is something to be said for the lack of material and if we want more Latinos on the screen, we need more Latino writers telling our stories. “You need to have Latino writers in the room,” said Felix Sanchez, chairman and co-founder of the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, in an interview with Mic earlier this year. “For 20 years we’ve been working on this issue when most people would not open the door. Now there’s an understanding that there is an urgency here.” When Viola Davis made history last year by becoming the first African-American woman to win an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama, she left us with a powerful message, “The only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity,” she said during her acceptance speech. “You cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.” A statement that should be revered and dealt with, especially when we talk about Latinos, the largest ethnic minority group in the country. Remember, when it comes to diversity and opportunity, the obstacles we have to climb are about all our stories and the Latino artist deserves more than it is getting right now.
