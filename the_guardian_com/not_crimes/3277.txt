Just over a week ago, I found myself sat in a bar with a carafe of sparkling water, making the best of a booze-free Friday night. I was just three days into the Royal National Lifeboat Institution’s (RNLI’s) H2Only Challenge, which requires people to go 10 days drinking nothing but water. Already, it was tough.No morning coffee, no freshly squeezed juice, no afternoon cuppa, no after-work cocktails. No squash, no smoothies, no shakes. The challenge has been taking place for three years; funds are raised through sponsorship, and by those taking part donating the money they would have spent on drinks. Last year’s campaign raised £222,351; this year, 3,648 people signed up to take part. I couldn’t quite face asking anyone to sponsor me. It was only 10 days – it should be easy, shouldn’t it? – but I did start keeping tabs on the money I would have spent. And while saving lives at sea is certainly important work – perhaps more so now than ever – I admit I undertook the challenge for entirely selfish reasons: would I see the health benefits of cutting out caffeine and alcohol? Would drinking more water than usual leave me feeling rejuvenated? And would I discover I was unwittingly spending a small fortune on unnecessary drinks?My donation page inspired by The Archers has raised over £135,000 | Paul Trueman I convinced a pal to sign up with me; we grudgingly sent each other commemorative photos of our final brews ahead of the 5pm start time. The following evening I received a photo of him holding a pint and the words: “Sorry! I’m on a date. I’ll start tomorrow, I swear.”Headaches and lethargy followed, and my own downfall came just a couple of days later, at a dinner too delicious not to have wine with (followed by a party too awkward to be sober at). Fortunately (and, I think, wisely) the RNLI offer a “lifeline” for such occasions: a £12 forfeit, in return for 12 hours “off”. I grabbed it – or rather, my colleague did, insisting she would pay the penalty for me, if only I would shut up and have a drink. The challenge certainly helps the RNLI raise awareness. I spent the 10 days repeatedly explaining why I was turning down teas and sipping water from a wine glass (what? It helped). I spent more time at the gym, where constant water-swigging is more acceptable, but I also ate more food, swapping caffeine for sugar to boost my flagging energy levels (something I should have anticipated from the time I gave up sugar and swiftly doubled my coffee intake). Fizzy water, I had reasoned on Friday night, was still just water – but with a few added bubbles. Not so, according to the FAQ, which states: “If it’s sparkling, it’s not H2Only. So, that’s a ‘no’ to fizz, I’m afraid.” I wish I had read that beforehand – and saved myself from another £12 fine. The savings, it turned out, were where it really stacked up. The website’s cost calculator is a little off (£2 for a tea and £3.50 for a glass of wine seems unlikely on both counts). But I made a note each time I would have bought a drink and, including the fines, found myself handing over a total of £70.50 at the end of my 10 days. And then sticking the kettle on.
