If it feels like an endurance test waiting for the new series of Game of Thrones, spare a thought for this chap who walked 20 miles through heavy Alpine snow and still didn’t get a sneak preview of the first episode.Snow artist Simon Beck walked all day and all night through heavy Alpine snow to create the emblem of the show’s House of Stark in the Alps, the size of two and a half football pitches. Anyone got a carrot for the nose?Sky Atlantic director Zai Bennett said it was the “perfect tribute to a truly epic TV show”. Yes, yes, but will Jon Snow be back?Game of Thrones will return on Sky Atlantic at 2am on 25 April, to coincide with its premiere in the US. If you can’t stay up that late, and are struggling to shake off your fondness for a linear TV schedule, it’ll be repeated later in the day at 9pm.  Eat your heart out, corn-circling extra terrestrial life.
