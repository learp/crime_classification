Six years ago, my husband – who has always suffered from depression and never held a full-time job – was diagnosed with a progressive degenerative illness. He sleeps all day, and drinks. After years working full-time and raising our daughters, I finally succumbed to the loneliness and had an affair. However, after four intense years, my lover’s wife found out and told my husband. Now, though the affair continues, it is plain my lover has no intention of leaving his wife.If it weren’t for the children (who are 10 and 12), I think my husband would end it. Over the years I have arranged therapists and psychiatrists and physical therapy for him, and he will go a few times, but his heart isn’t in it. He takes antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds and sleeping pills, but nothing seems to help.Meanwhile, I miss my lover. He had become my partner by default; I could turn to him for advice and conversation, and our bond was very intimate and emotional. My husband refuses to talk about the future: when the news broke, he merely said I must have been very unhappy.My overriding problem is loneliness. I do have friends, but I really want a partner, and a sex life. I have been to a therapist who feels my marriage is over. But my partner needs care and I couldn’t take the girls away from him. I try hard to keep their lives as normal as possible. Their dad has been unwell at least half their lives. They love him very much (and he does try to wake up when they come home from school).Still, increasingly I realise I don’t want to live the rest of my life like this. Is there any way forward?• When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
