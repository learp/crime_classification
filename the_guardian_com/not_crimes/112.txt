Regulations are likely to apply to all but the very cheapest drones before Christmas, according to an expert who helped write the upcoming rules.“Yes, registration will happen for this Christmas. And yes, it will be really bad,” says Bob Young, CEO of drone technology company PrecisionHawk, a member of the FAA’s Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Task Force. “What I’m focused on is just to be a little bit better tomorrow, and that allows you to embrace the fact that you’re really bad today.”Commercial drones could require direct human oversight for years, FAA says The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) set up the UAS Task Force last month after drones were blamed for interfering with sporting events and even wildfire emergencies, and commercial pilots reported seeing twice as many drones in the air as last year.The Task Force is due to deliver its report to the FAA on Saturday, containing recommendations for a registration process for the estimated 700,000 unmanned aircraft that are expected to be bought in the run-up to Christmas. Young’s company PrecisionHawk, which develops data and safety systems for drones, was one of about 25 manufacturers, retailers, hobbyists, trade associations, law enforcement and airport officials chosen to draft the suggestions.“Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of us are law-abiding people who will do our best to keep our drones from flying into the White House,” said Young. “Then there are 0.001% who are too stupid to know that’s not a good idea, and 0.0001% who are bad actors wanting to use drones to do something seriously dangerous. What we have to do is stay ahead of those bad actors.”At first, says Young, registration might include some kind of license plate on the drone itself. “On the registrations side, it’s as stupidly easy as that,” says Young. “But there are going to have to be multiple stages. In future versions of this registration system, you’re going to need a reasonably sophisticated way of connecting a drone to its operator.”Unlike cars, which have a driver physically present in the vehicle, drones can be controlled remotely via radio, or even over the internet from thousands of miles away. “Do you mandate that everyone who flies a drone has some sort of homing beacon connected to the drone?” wonders Young. “So that at the same time that the FAA knows where the drone is through the cellphone or satellite network, it also knows where the drone’s operator is on the planet.”Young does not see any technical reason why such a national, or even global, surveillance system should not be possible. “Think of the billions of devices connected to the internet. A few million more flying robots plugged in in the same way, where you know precisely which robot is connected to which operator, is technically trivial to do,” he says. In fact, PrecisionHawk is already developing a drone air traffic control system called Low Altitude Traffic and Airspace Safety (Latas) to power this “internet of flying things”. A prototype version, using Verizon’s 4G LTE wireless data, Iridium satellite links, GPS navigation and ADS-B radio surveillance technology for manned aircraft, is currently undergoing testing in North Carolina. The task force has recommended that all drones weighing more than 250g should be subject to registration, according to the Associated Press. Young believes that the registration regulations, whatever they end up being, will probably apply to all but the least capable toy drones on the market. “I don’t think they can make an exception,” says Young. “Unless they push severe constraints on the manufacturers and say, a toy drone cannot fly more than 300 feet away from the operator, in which case it can be unregulated and unregistered.”The FAA will now use the Task Force’s recommendations and public comments to develop an interim rule on registration, which it hopes to release in December and go into effect shortly after. There will then be another opportunity for the public to comment before the agency issues its final rule, probably next year.“I’m fully supportive of what the FAA is trying to do,” says Young. “Their first initiative will be flawed… but that doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t start somewhere, or that they shouldn’t commit to making it better next Christmas and even better the Christmas after that.”
