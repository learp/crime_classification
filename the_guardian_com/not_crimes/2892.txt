 True stories seldom have endings. I don’t want a happy ending, I want more story.” – Fly by Night Who had they been, all these mothers and sisters and wives? What were they now? Moons, blank and faceless, gleaming with borrowed light, each spinning loyally around a bigger sphere.‘Invisible,’ said Faith under her breath. Women and girls were so often unseen, forgotten, afterthoughts. Faith herself had used it to good effect, hiding in plain sight and living a double life. But she had been blinded by exactly the same invisibility-of-the-mind, and was only just realizing it.– The Lie Tree We always find it difficult to forgive our heroes for being human. – Well WitchedPhilip Pullman: 10 magical quotes from his books and the man himself  People were animals, and animals were nothing but teeth. You bit first, and you bit often. That was the only way to survive. – The Lie Tree “For many years I scarcely slept more than two hours a night, in spite of all the doctors could do. I dare say I should have been forced to rely on laudanum. Thankfully I now have my dear wife, who has a wonderful calming influence on me. As soon as Agatha begins to talk I find myself yawning”Faith wondered whether his ‘dear wife’ would thank him for his comment. – The Lie Tree Brand a man as a thief and no one will ever hire him for honest labour – he will be a hardened robber within weeks. The brand does not reveal a person’s nature, it shapes it.– Fly by Night Truth is dangerous. It topples palaces and kills kings. It stirs gentle men to rage and bids them take up arms. It wakes old grievances and opens forgotten wounds. It is the mother of the sleepless night and the hag-ridden day. And yet there is one thing that is more dangerous than Truth. Those who would silence Truth’s voice are more destructive by far.It is most perilous to be a speaker of Truth. Sometimes one must choose to be silent, or be silenced. But if a truth cannot be spoken, it must at least be known. Even if you dare not speak truth to others, never lie to yourself.” – Fly by NightThe ultimate top 10 Patrick Ness quotes  Do you know what courage is? Not a willingness to fling oneself into danger without proper thought – that is nothing, nothing. There is cowardice in all impulse.

And I can’t think about it too hard right now or it won’t work.– A Face Like Glass But easier, she reminded herself, was not the same as better. – Cuckoo Song Words were dangerous when loosed. They were more powerful than cannon and more unpredictable than storms. They could turn men’s heads inside out and warp their destinies. They could pick up kingdoms and shake them until they rattled.– Fly by Night'Characters that broke rules and changed minds': Frances Hardinge on Victorian rebels  Everybody knew that books were dangerous.
