They are known as the eighth-day dogs – animals whose fate is about to be decided. After seven days in a local authority pound, a lucky stray dog might be taken in by a rehoming centre, from where he may be adopted by a kind new owner. The alternative, however, is far bleaker. The latest results of a Dogs Trust annual survey found that 3,463 unclaimed strays – many of them healthy and happy – were put to sleep between April 2015 and March 2016.More than 80,000 strays were collected by local council dog wardens in the year up to March 2016, according to the survey. Of those dogs – who may have escaped from gardens, run off when on a walk or even been stolen and then abandoned – just over half were reunited with their owners. But 37,283 went unclaimed.Virtually all strays are previously owned, as ownerless dogs are extremely rare in the UK. “We don’t really have street dogs,” says Lee Paris, campaigns officer for Dogs Trust. “A lot of [those dogs] would have been abandoned pets, but there are cases of dogs escaping and maybe the public being unaware of how to find them.”Local authority dog wardens – who are usually provided by private companies – collect a dog after receiving reports that it is a stray. The animal is then is kept in kennels for a minimum of seven days. Kennel conditions vary: some are run by private boarding houses and sanctuaries, but there have also been reports of dogs being housed in council-run pounds with little or no bedding and minimal veterinary care.If it remains unclaimed after a week, says Paris, a “dog becomes the property of the council and they then need to find a new owner, whether by directly rehoming or finding rescue space. We try and take as many as we can, as do other rescue centres across the UK.” If it cannot be placed, though, the dog will be put down.“The hardest thing is when you go to the stray kennels and you know you’ve only got spaces for two dogs,” says Lauren Sanderson, deputy charity manager, of Rain Rescue, which rehomes stray dogs and cats in South Yorkshire.“Having to see all the ones who need your help and you have to leave them behind – that’s the heartbreak. Those dogs don’t have anybody. Our work is primarily to save as many of those dogs as we can. We’re a small charity working in a high [dog] destruction area.”Rain Rescue can only house 16 dogs at a time, with others placed in foster homes. However, the charity has taken in 130 dogs this year – almost all from local authority pounds. “We base [our choice] on the ones that are most in need – often they’re the ones who need emergency veterinary treatment, and sometimes the local authorities can’t stretch to that,” says Sanderson.There are, Sanderson says, spikes in summer, when people seem to abandon their dogs before going on holiday, and again at Christmas, when finances are stretched.There are penalties for abandoning a dog, but they are hard to enforce, says Paris. The good news is that fewer stray dogs were handled by local authorities in the last year than the year before. Paris puts this down to improved rates of microchipping, before the fitting of identification implants became law in April.Still, more than 37,000 unclaimed and unwanted dogs seems an appallingly high figure. Some of the dogs Sanderson sees have clearly been abused or neglected. On the other hand, Dogs Trust estimates that around an eighth of unclaimed dogs are cherished family animals, whose owners have simply failed to update their dog’s microchip details, and who would be horrified to find that their pet faces destruction.“Sometimes you look at the dog and can see it’s been well cared for at some point in its life,” says Sanderson. Rain Rescue recently took in Herc, a clever German shepherd-rottweiler cross. “He has clearly been well-trained. You think: ‘What has happened in that dog’s life, or its owner’s life, for it to end up in stray kennels with nobody to care for it?’”
