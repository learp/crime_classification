Jonathan Coe relished the culinary surrealism of 70s Dinner Party and Margaret Drabble luxuriated in The Long, Long Life of Trees - love them or hate them, the annual books of the year columns provide an irresistible insight into the reading year.Nearly 90 authors offered their favourites over the weekend in a two-part selection from the Guardian Review and the Observer New Review.Best books of 2016 – part one Among the most widely loved nonfiction titles of the year were Hisham Matar’s The Return, a memoir of his search for his father, who disappeared after being jailed in Libya (an unstintingly truthful masterpiece, according to Alan Hollinghurst), and Edmund Gordon’s biography, The Invention of Angela Carter, which was described as “luminous” by Philip Hensher.In fiction, Rachel Cusk’s Transit was widely cited, as was Zadie Smith’s Swing Time, while Kazuo Ishiguro spoke for many when he hymned Sebastian Barry’s “magnificent” Days Without End – “a lyrical, sometimes savage, often achingly tender western about two young gay Irishmen adrift in the American west before, during and following the civil war”.Best books of 2016 – part two Interestingly, among contenders for the Man Booker prize, it was two historical yarns, Graeme Macrae Burnet’s His Bloody Project and Ian McGuire’s “gleefully gruesome” (Hilary Mantel) The North Water that appear to have captured the imagination, with several contributors confessing that they were hoping to catch up with Paul Beatty’s winner, The Sellout, over Christmas. The two glowing mentions for another shortlistee, David Szalay’s All That Man Is (from David Nicholls and Alan Hollinghurst), would seem to confirm that it is a short story collection rather than a novel. I was personally delighted to see two nominations for Han Kang’s Human Acts, which was doubly disadvantaged this year in being published back in January and overshadowed by Han’s previous novel, The Vegetarian, which won the Man Booker International in the same month. Handily, Human Acts is just out in paperback, though a word of warning: this account of a massacre in South Korea is about as far from a cheering fireside read as they come. I was also pleased to see a mention for Martin MacInnes’s uncompromising debut, Infinite Ground. In the words of Macrae Burnet, it is “ostensibly a detective story … a dazzling novel of ideas, brimming with passages of jaw-dropping brilliance”. At this time of year, some best-kept secrets are best not kept.Please leave your books of the year in the comment section below or post them on Guardian Witness, with a brief explanation of why you liked them.
