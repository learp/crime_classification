I love Dune. It was one of the first science fiction books I read on returning to the genre after putting aside my early-teen love for the likes of Douglas Hill and Diana Wynne Jones for few years. And I love Kyle MacLachlan for his turn as Paul Atreides in David Lynch’s much ridiculed film version of Frank Herbert’s novel.So I don’t believe there’s much better to see as I write than the emoji version of Herbert’s tale that MacLachlan came up with when asked to explain the story on Twitter:Kyle MacLachlan (@Kyle_MacLachlan)🌏💧✋🕋🗡🚀🏜☀️🌡🌶💯🚱⏳🌅🌑😡💉😱😈💀💥🌛🌙🐭💥🚶🏻〰🐛️⌛️👳🙏💥😴🛌😳💥🐛💥👊⚔👑 #dune https://t.co/bXwpdYC8jzAugust 16, 2016There’s a hand-box-dagger sequence, which I’m assuming is referring to one of my favourite scenes: “From the folds of her gown, she lifted a green metal cube about 15cm one side. She turned it and Paul saw that one side was open – black and oddly frightening. No light penetrated that open blackness … Paul put his hand into the box. He first felt a sense of cold as the blackness closed around his hand, then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling as though his hand were asleep.”Fantastic stuff.MacLachlan has also got the worms, the sand, the lack of water, a Fremen-ish type character, and a mouse, old Muad’Dib himself. It’s a pretty good effort.Inspired, we asked on Twitter if you could write any other book plots in emojis – and of course you could.

As MobyLives says, it is, “as they used to say on the internet, flawless”. If you think you can beat it, tweet us on @GuardianBooks.
