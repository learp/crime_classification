A Melbourne cinema has cancelled a screening of a documentary on men’s rights activism for fear it could be “potentially damaging to our credibility” following online uproar. The Red Pill, a documentary by film-maker Cassie Jaye, was due to screen at Palace Cinema’s Kino cinema on Sunday 6 November, at an event organised by Men’s Rights Melbourne. The film professes to take a “balanced approach” to the men’s rights movement, documenting Jaye’s “life-altering journey where she would never see the world the same way again”. But it has faced backlash from members of the feminist community and has been criticised as unbalanced and in favour of men’s rights groups.The Australian premiere was cancelled on Wednesday, after an online petition calling on the cinema to abandon the “misogynistic propaganda film” eclipsed 2,000 signatures.Susie Smith, who founded the petition on change.org, said the film gave a platform to views similar to those of Daryush “Roosh V” Valizadeh, a self-described neo-masculinist whose planned visit to Australia caused a stir with immigration in February.“This is the kind of disgusting, violent message that is totally out of line with Australian values and law,” Smith wrote.Daryush 'Roosh V' Valizadeh cancels neo-masculinist meetings over safety “Please do not associate your cinema with the kind of people who teach men how to violate women physically and emotionally. Please stand with the women everywhere, and do not promote misogynistic hate.”The petition was directly referenced by Kino cinema in its email to notify David Williams, the event organiser and a spokesman for Men’s Rights Melbourne, that the screening had been cancelled. Guardian Australia has contacted Williams for comment.Williams pasted the email above a rival petition on change.org, set up to “stop extremists censoring what Australians are allowed to see”. At time of writing it had more than 5,000 signatures. In the email, the representative of Kino cinema told Williams that much of the feedback to the screening of The Red Pill assumed that it was a “curatorial decision ... which is potentially damaging to our credibility as we are yet to see the film so cannot stand by its contents in the face of the criticism we are receiving”. A spokeswoman for Palace Cinemas confirmed that the email pasted by Williams was sent by staff at Kino cinema.Benjamin Zeccola, chief executive of Palace Cinemas, told Guardian Australia on Thursday that the decision to cancel the screening was made “in the absence of any judgement of the film, filmmakers or attendees”.“However, what was initially booked as a closed, private screening was being publicised widely and this in turn upset a significant proportion of our customers, who communicated their feelings to us directly.“Upon receiving such direct feedback we realised that irrespective of the content, its presence in one of our cinemas was offensive to a large section of our core audience and movie club members. Therefore we took the decision to cancel the screening aware that regardless of the decision we took, a significant number of people would be disgruntled: so we took the decision that we think was best for our customer base at that time.”Jaye rallied against the decision on social media, and called for “one Melbourne movie theatre to defend free speech” and host the screening.“The numbers are on our side, people want to see The Red Pill, so why aren’t any Australian movie theatres wiling to stand up to censorship?” she wrote.Williams told the Herald Sun he was “determined” to find a new venue to screen her film.Cassie Jaye (@Cassie_Jaye)It's confirmed: @palace_cinemas has pulled The Red Pill, a film they have not even seen!
