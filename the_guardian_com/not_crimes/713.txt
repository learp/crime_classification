Pokémon Go had 21 million active users in the United States alone as of 18 July – less than two weeks after going live.Pokémon Go: why our dark world needs escapism more than ever  The game, which has been rolled out in 35 countries, is also available on Android devices. Martin said Pokémon Go’s ratio of paid users to total users was 10 times that of Candy Crush, the hit game from King Digital that generated more than $1bn of revenue in both 2013 and 2014.

Up to Tuesday’s close, Apple’s shares had gained 5% in market value, or about $25bn, since the launch of the game in the United States on 6 July.

It originally stated that Pokémon Go is a Nintendo one – it is in fact published by Niantic, which developed it in partnership with Nintendo. It also incorrectly stated that the game launched in the US in June, rather than July. These errors have now been corrected.
