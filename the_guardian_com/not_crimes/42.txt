A hacker claiming to have the log in details of millions of LinkedIn users is advertising the data for sale online.The extensive list of user IDs and passwords, which were allegedly sourced from a cyber attack on the networking site four years ago, is being advertised on the darknet – a sub-section of the internet not accessible through normal web browsers and often a platform for illegal activity. According to news site Motherboard, a hacker called “Peace” has placed the alleged details of 117 million LinkedIn users on darknet marketplace The Real Deal for the price of five bitcoin – the digital currency – worth around £1,500.At the time of the original breach in 2012, LinkedIn reset the accounts of those it believed were affected. However it now says the number of users affected was far greater than initially thought and it plans a more wide-scale reset.Around 6.5m details were posted online at that time – but LinkedIn’s chief information security officer Cory Scott said he does not believe the extra data was gained as the result of a new security breach.“In 2012, LinkedIn was the victim of an unauthorised access and disclosure of some members’ passwords. At the time, our immediate response included a mandatory password reset for all accounts we believed were compromised as a result of the unauthorised disclosure,” he said.“Additionally, we advised all members of LinkedIn to change their passwords as a matter of best practice.“Yesterday, we became aware of an additional set of data that had just been released that claims to be email and hashed password combinations of more than 100 million LinkedIn members from that same theft in 2012.“We are taking immediate steps to invalidate the passwords of the accounts impacted, and we will contact those members to reset their passwords.”News of the breach is the latest in a long line of cyber-attacks on major websites and companies, with telecoms firm TalkTalk and parental forum Mumsnet among those who have been the victims of security breaches in the last year.
