An alliance of nine European governments, led by Germany and including France, Spain, Italy and Poland, have written to the European commission to warn it not to dismantle nature protection laws.But conservationists have questioned why Britain is not part of the effort to publicly defend the habitats and birds directives ahead of a review by the commission aimed at cutting red tape for business.“The EU nature conservation directives have proven their worth and become an essential component of biodiversity conservation. It will not be possible to achieve the goal of the EU biodiversity strategy to 2020 without them,” say the environment ministers in an unprecedented letter to Karmenu Vella, the EU environment commissioner.The two directives form the backbone of Europe’s nature conservation. The habitat directive aims to protect some 220 habitats and approximately 1,000 species. It led to the setting up of a network of Special Areas of Conservation, which together with the existing Special Protection Areas form a network of protected sites across the European Union called Natura 2000. The birds directive aims to protect all European wild birds.There is growing fear in Europe that the tough conservation laws will be weakened at a meeting in December when they undergo a “fitness check”. EU president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has declared he would like to merge and overhaul the two directives to make them more “business-friendly” .The omission of the UK environment secretary, Liz Truss, from signatories to the letter sent on Wednesday, has led some conservationists to infer that the chancellor, George Osborne, backs moves to weaken the legislation.In 2011, Osborne said in his autumn statement that the government would “make sure that gold plating of EU rules on things like habitats aren’t placing ridiculous costs on British businesses.” His statement led to a review of the directives by the environment department which found the legislation broadly working well but needing 23 revisions.A spokesman for the RSPB said: “The RSPB is concerned by the silence from the UK. The government must move quickly to remove the uncertainty or questions will continue to be asked about their commitment to defending the laws that protect nature.”UK conservationist and former Tory MEP Stanley Johnson, who drafted much of the original habitats directive, said the review would put “everything up for grabs” and could result in key safeguards for the environment being removed, as well as prolonged uncertainty for businesses. “The government’s reluctance to make its position clear is all the more unfortunate given the clear commitments made in the Conservative manifesto about maintaining and strengthening protected areas. It is time for the government to come off the fence,” he said.“The [European] ministers have made it clear that the EU’s nature directives should retain their current form and that amending or merging the directives is not expedient. Some 500,000 people altogether - 100,000 of them from the UK - have made their views known to the commission in the course of a prolonged consultation and the overwhelming majority have expressed their support for the directives,” said Johnson. The nine ministers also warn the commission that weakening or merging of the laws could have profound legal consequences. “We all agree the directive should remain in the current form. There is now legal certainty as a result of advanced implementation. Those affected have learned how to deal with the provisions. Any amendment would require the allocation of personnel and finance for a period of many years. The result would be a legal uncertainty.”Ariel Brunner, senior head of policy for BirdLife Europe, said: “This is a loud and clear message that adds up to what is by now a deafening cry: hands off the birds and habitats directives. EU laws to protect nature must be better implemented, not tampered with.“The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence has also demonstrated the effectiveness of these laws and their importance in protecting nature and biodiversity in Europe.”A government spokesperson said: “The UK government has not yet taken a view on what the commission’s review may eventually conclude. We have an ambitious plan to enhance our natural environment and we will work with our European partners to agree how best to protect our valuable wildlife and countryside.”Industry also urged the commission not to change the directives. “Re-opening the directives would introduce a degree of unnecessary uncertainty to energy project developments that would damage investor confidence at a time when it is vital to deliver new energy infrastructure,” said Energy UK in a statement.
