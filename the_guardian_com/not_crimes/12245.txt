Divines review – exhilarating urban thriller froths with joie de vivre Despite the seemingly limitless resources at its disposal, Netflix has shown little interest in forging a brand identity. Instead, with its burgeoning parade of Netflix Originals, the platform has attempted to simultaneously appeal to everyone, from nostalgic thirtysomethings (Stranger Things) to excitable tweens (Haters Back Off) via the terminally masochistic (high-octane Kevin James romp True Memoirs Of An International Assassin, now streaming!).About the only demographic Netflix has failed to reach are those sophisticated torch-holders of the seventh art, the French. The platform faced massive resistance after launching in France in 2014, thanks to the incompatibility of its tricksy tax arrangements with the country’s commitment to reinvestment in the film industry. Its catalogue was also hamstrung by local customs: a French regulation prohibits films from streaming until 36 months after their cinema release.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Eager to break through in the world’s seventh biggest film market, Netflix continued to enthusiastically court French viewers, and this year it struck at the very heart of French cinephilia by acquiring a raft of titles at the Cannes film festival. First out of the gate is Houda Benyamina’s Divines, winner of the festival’s Caméra d’Or prize, which began streaming yesterday.The film follows 15-year-old Dounia as she navigates the Paris banlieues in search of an escape from the monotony of school life and a reprieve from the poverty of her small shanty town. If that sounds like the perfect framework on which to hang cliches, you won’t be surprised to hear that Dounia soon falls in with a charismatic but sporadically terrifying drug dealer and takes a shine to a tough but sensitive dancer.Divines director Houda Benyamina: 'It's better to make a film than a bomb' Familiar tropes aside, the film is a commanding coming-of-age story, thanks to its forthright refusal to deny the pressures exerted by gender and race in every aspect of Dounia’s existence, and its low-key understanding of the particulars of contemporary youth culture. For my money, Divines is never more alive than in the not-insignificant portions of its running time that take the form of triumphant, youthful Snapchats.The film feels like just the thing to heal the bad blood between Netflix and France’s reluctant industry gatekeepers, but if Divines does represent an attempt to woo French detractors with content tailored directly to them, the platform must be playing the long game. As per government policy, the film won’t be available to stream in its home country until August 2019.
