Emma Rice’s appointment at Shakespeare’s Globe was always going to shake things up so her first piece of casting is perhaps no surprise: her forthcoming Titania is to be played by the singer and performance artist Meow Meow.Meow Meow will star as Shakespeare’s queen of the fairies in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Rice’s opening production as artistic director.“She is literally a sensation,” said Rice. “I have never met anybody like her. She somehow manages to be a theatrical equivalent of everywoman, she is super-glamorous, super-empathetic to the world and one of the funniest creatures you will ever meet.”Describing or labelling Meow Meow can be tricky. “She would be very cross if you described her as ‘cabaret’,” said Rice. “She is a sort of post-postmodern performance singing sensation. She endlessly surprises me and she is quite one of the most charismatic performers I have ever met.”The Globe's Emma Rice: 'If anybody bended gender it was Shakespeare' Rice first saw Meow Meow perform at the Soho theatre about six years ago and met her the following day, determined to work with her. That resulted in Meow Meow, in 2011, starring as the Maitresse in Rice’s Kneehigh production of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Audiences may also know her from the La Clique variety shows and performances at London’s Southbank Centre.Rice’s appointment at the Globe, succeeding Dominic Dromgoole, raised eyebrows in some quarters, especially since she cheerfully admits to not having read many of his plays. Her job, she said recently, was to allow artists to tell great stories in an exciting way. “I bring story, I bring humanity, I bring event and I bring wonder.”A Midsummer Night’s Dream will run from 30 April to 18 June and be followed by Iqbal Khan’s production of Macbeth, which will have slightly more conventional casting in the shape of Ray Fearon as Macbeth and Tara Fitzgerald as Lady Macbeth.
