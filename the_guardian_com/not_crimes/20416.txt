Photograph: Bharat SikkaFeatured as this week’s My best shot, Bharat Sikka’s image is of a Goan villager and his pet eagle. “He seemed to have total control over her. After I’d taken a few pictures, he said: ‘I’ll make her do anything you want’... I managed to capture man and bird perfectly in three-quarter profile – although sometimes her beak was so close to his eye that, truly, I was scared.”What we learned this weekThe Ghent altarpiece, one of Europe’s great treasures, is cleaned up and more glorious than ever beforeGuernica has more power than ever in the age of AleppoThe National Gallery’s Beyond Caravaggio is a five-star wonderThe British Museum is putting on a big America-focused exhibition in MarchMarcantonio Raimondi – see above – helped bring porn to EuropeSalvador Dalí’s cookbook is out in time for ChristmasMark Rice-Oxley had a portrait of his mental health painted by Andrea TyrimosA new dance show celebrates Patti Smith and Robert MapplethorpeDavid Bowie’s art collection is a little bit boringThe Museum of Uncut Funk – a stunning collection of black cultural artefacts – is giving the Smithsonian a run for its moneyWe went inside the Barbican’s gorgeous modernist flatsGrayson Perry quoted me on a pot – in another of his snarky comments in lieu of true artThe Barbican is getting set to show off “vulgar” fashionGet involvedOur A-Z of Art series continues – share your art with the theme M for MajestyAnd check out the entries for the theme L for LondonDon’t forgetTo follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign
