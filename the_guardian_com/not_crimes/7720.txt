Anti-mining activists have launched legal action against the controversial expansion of Queensland’s Acland open-cut coalmine.The Oakey Coal Action Alliance (OCAA) on Tuesday lodged a formal submission on the $900m stage-three expansion of the project.Acland mine challenge likely after Palaszczuk government moves to restore objection rights The group last week made a decision to pursue an objection in the Queensland land court.The expansion should not go ahead because of the threat it poses to the local community, OCAA president Frank Ashman said.“Our case will be that the expansion should not proceed because of the impacts it will have on many aspects, including groundwater resources, important farming land and the health of local families,” he said.Ashman said the mine would destroy 1300 hectares of strategic cropping land on the western Darling Downs.Opponents of the project have previously questioned the approval of the mine by the former Liberal National party government in December 2014, claiming mine proponents had donated large amounts to the party beforehand.
