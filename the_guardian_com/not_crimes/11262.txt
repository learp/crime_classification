Green-minded individuals keen to play their part in tackling climate change, but also looking for a decent return on their cash, may be interested in the launch of a public share issue aimed at raising up to £15m to invest in new renewable energy projects.They are being given the chance to become shareholders in Triodos Renewables, an independent UK energy company managed by Bristol-based Triodos Bank which has more than 15 years hands on experience in the sector. This is its fourth public share offer – the last was in 2008.The issue price has been set at £1.80 per share, and the minimum investment at £540, with the aim of bringing in retail investors to join the 4,000 existing shareholders. "Proceeds will be invested directly into building new wind power assets to expand the company's portfolio," says the firm. It adds that as well as offering people "a chance to make a real difference," there's potential for a decent return.The prospectus states: "The group's long-term objective is to grow its portfolio of renewable energy operating projects and to deliver between 9% and 10% annualised returns on investment for shareholders."Triodos Renewables now owns and operates seven sites around the UK that can generate enough renewable power for up to 24,500 homes.But this is a long-term investment in a single share, with all the risks that entails. The prospectus lists a number of "risk factors". You may not get back the full amount invested, and it may be hard to sell the shares, though Triodos matches sellers with buyers. A less risky bet may be an ethical fund investing in lots of different companies.
