Artist and writer Sara Baume has won the 2015 Geoffrey Faber Memorial prize for fiction for her debut novel Spill Simmer Falter Wither.Spill Simmer Falter Wither by Sara Baume review – a deft and moving debut The Irish writer was awarded the £1,500 award for her first novel, published by Tramp Press in Ireland and William Heinemann in the UK. The book tells the story of a troubled 57-year-old man who adopts a one-eyed dog.Baume joins an impressive list of alumni that includes Seamus Heaney, Tony Harrison, Graham Swift and Don Paterson for the award given to a writer under 40. Winners alternate each year between poetry and fiction and last year it was shared by poets Liz Berry and Fiona Benson.Announcing the winner, judges Justine Jordan, Kirsty Gunn and David Headley cited Baume’s “irresistible” originality. “Sara Baume brings to fiction the sensibility of a visual artist and a nature writer’s skills of observation to create a novel that is tender and uncompromising, understated and profound,” the judges said.They added: “It looks anew at the neglected byways of human and animal nature, as well as the Irish countryside, to discover that even the tattered verges are depositories of celebration and devastation in unequal measure.”Spill Simmer Falter Wither is divided into four sections, each reflecting a season renamed to reflect her main character Ray’s experiences. The judges praised the writer, who was born in Lancashire for taking unpromising material – an ageing, lonely man who has lived his whole life at one remove from society, and the damaged, dangerous dog he takes to his heart – and turning it into a profound novel that is “a road trip, an almanac of the seasons, a family psychodrama and a mystery story”.Critically acclaimed on publication, the book was shortlisted for the Costa first novel award, as well as longlisted for the 2015 Guardian first book award and the 2016 Desmond Eliott prize. Baume, who has a master’s in creative writing from Trinity College Dublin, has said that she found the book hard to write. She is currently working on a second novel, which she has said will be “stranger and more autobiographical” than her debut.The Geoffrey Faber Memorial prize is now in its 51st year. It was created in memory of the founder of publishing house Faber & Faber. Receiving the prize has often been seen as a bellwether for future literary stardom.
