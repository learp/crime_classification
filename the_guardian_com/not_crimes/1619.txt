3.25pm BST15:25The unintended consequencesWhile today’s Q&A focuses on climate change and coffee, the panel has highlighted how much broader this issue really is. An insightful example is one provided by Emma Pinchbeck about WWF’s Sumatran elephant conservation work: the coffee farmers, faced with changing weather and reduced yields, are extending their fields and ranges, and coming into contact with elephants. In turn, this is leading to more human/elephant conflict (in both directions, I should add)Updatedat 4.30pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.17pm BST15:17To diversify or not to diversifyOn the question of crop diversification in the context of coffee and climate change, Macatonia says: We encourage livelihood diversification - it is key to create resilience. We have developed a bee-keeping project with smallholder coffee farmers in Guatemala. The benefit is additional income from selling honey, biodiversity, cross pollination, supplements diet. The training program also developed entrepreneurial skillsUpdatedat 4.31pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.49pm BST14:49CollaborationSteven Macatonia, co-founder of Union Hand-Roasted Coffee, says helping farmers adapt to a changing climate requires collaboration with other stakeholders: For example we’ve been supporting a project, Weathersafe.co.uk where the latest satellite technology is utilized to predict weather patterns - this information is available to coffee producers in Rwanda, mobile phone technology. We are hoping this project can be scaled up, it is currently backed by NASA.Updatedat 4.31pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.39pm BST14:39Coping with climate changeHugo Villela, regional agribusiness specialist from Oikocredit, says that farmers can modify their techniques to help cope with a changing climate: To face [a] drop in rain it’s important to manage the shadow on coffee crops, [...] with trees in different altitudes and avoid [exposing] soil directly to sunlight.

The physical impacts will be worse in areas around the equator, for example. The distributed impacts will be worse for communities that are poor, especially if they’re dependent for their income on natural resources. One of those resources is coffee - 1/4 of Ethopians make a living from growing coffee, for example.Updatedat 4.31pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.39pm BST17:39What we'll be discussingCoffee production provides work for more than 120 million of the world’s poorest people. Climate change, however, is a mounting threat. Rising temperatures in Central America are fuelling the growth of the devastating leaf disease known as coffee rust (pdf), leading to drops of 30% or more in coffee production in the region. In Ethiopia, where an estimated 25% of the population depends directly or indirectly on coffee for their livelihoods, climate change is also having a profoundly negative impact, with production predicted to significantly decrease in certain areas.What can be done? Join us on Tuesday 20 September, 2-3pm (BST), to debate how to protect coffee and support the people who rely on this vital commodity.Questions we will explore include:from diversifying to relocating, how can farmers become more resilient to climate change?where does technology fit in?who’s funding this support and how can that money be put to best use?how to reach the most vulnerable coffee growing communities?Updatedat 4.31pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.39pm BST17:39The panelAaron Davis, senior research leader of plant resources, Royal Botanic Gardens, KewSteven Macatonia, co-founder, Union Hand-Roasted CoffeeEmma Pinchbeck, head of climate and energy policy, WWFHugo Villela, regional agribusiness specialist, OikocreditModerator - Tess Riley, deputy editor, Guardian Sustainable BusinessFurther panellists TBC.
