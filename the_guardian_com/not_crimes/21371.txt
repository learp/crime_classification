I would agree that there is no doubt that The Women’s Library at LSE is outstanding and I would encourage everyone to visit (Letters, 22 September). In terms of it being “nationally accredited both as an archive and as a museum”, I was informed by staff at LSE in November last year that The Women’s Library withdrew from the museum accreditation scheme in July 2015, and Arts Council England, which administers the scheme, does not include The Women’s Library at LSE in its comprehensive database of museums in England, available on the ACE website.Sue JohnGlasgow Women’s Library • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
