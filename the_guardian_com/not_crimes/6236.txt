I really really appreciate you taking the time to ask me questions, because you are obviously Guardian readers, and I am a fan. (kiss ass!)

Do you ever get back to Toronto? (Come visit the Steppes)  Guardian contributor PeachesWebchat 03 November 2016 2:00pmTronna! Nettie, I totally remember you, much love.

Are you a true Scorpion Peach?  Guardian contributor PeachesWebchat 03 November 2016 1:58pmI am a true Scorpion Peach - I'm sexual and very loyal.

What do you think of the both candidates in the upcoming US election?If Trump does become president can we expect you to write a song or name an album after him like you did with Impeach My Bush, which is one of the best album titles ever!  Guardian contributor PeachesWebchat 03 November 2016 1:57pmWell thank you for that! I don't think Impeach My Trump sounds as effective. But also it's just too horrifying to think about. And my blood is boiling thinking about it. I'm not a huge fan of Hillary, I think she also is not very honest, but what politician will ever be honest? A two party system does not work and the system in general will never work. Bernie Sanders was my number one choice and I was really excited for the prospect, but then this abstract notion of super delegates took over, and not by popular demand, Hillary became the candidate. There's just so much corruption and greed on all ends, but Trump is the be all, end all, greediest, most sexist, dumb shit ever. In fact, my song Dumb Fuck should be dedicated to him.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.01pm GMT14:01James Leadley asks:I got my first Peaches experience at SXSW this year. You were ace. The champagne was flowing, the beats were dropping and you were dressed like a beautiful shimmering vagina. I’m seeing you in Manchester next week. Can i expect more of the same? And if you don’t mind answering two questions. Do you party as hard now as you used to?  Guardian contributor PeachesWebchat 03 November 2016 1:54pmFirst of all: vagina vagina vagina. Second of all: what is your idea of a party?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.00pm GMT14:00PatriarchyBottle  asks:How best are we to disassemble the patriarchy?  Guardian contributor PeachesWebchat 03 November 2016 1:53pmKeep fighting the good fight, and be aware of the language used, and what people are saying around you. Certain things that we say that are in the form of patriarchal speech... i'm not coming up with an example quickly but there are so many little innuendos that still need to be examined. It may seem like it's in the abstract, but it is, because we need to break down a system and we don't have another in its place. We need to listen to Angela Davis.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.59pm GMT13:59Hogangi asks:Hey Peaches, just wondering if Claude Cahun influenced you in any way? I discovered her while doing my thesis on queer politics and she was a big influence on me, much like yourself, thanks for keeping me (in)sane, you rock xxx  Guardian contributor PeachesWebchat 03 November 2016 1:51pmThank you for letting me know about Claude - I'm always thankful to find out about past incredible artists.

Guardian contributor PeachesWebchat 03 November 2016 1:49pmIt's a long drive to Dublin, so we're going to high tail it after the show. Concorde 2 forever! I've played there like a million times.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.52pm GMT13:52sbmfc  asks:Do you think the internet and increased media attention has changed the way music scenes form and artists create their songs?  Guardian contributor PeachesWebchat 03 November 2016 1:48pmIt's such a complicated question... in a way, your music can be heard more than ever because the internet is so vast, but again, it's the way that it's heard and how it's listened to for less than three minutes and over.It has allowed me to be even more hardcore, because things like MTV don't exist for what i'm doing and never really did, but now people can find my voice if they want it. But I was established before the internet exploded, so it must be really different for those just starting out.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.52pm GMT13:52curbahn asks:Being a musician seems like such a satisfying and dynamic life … you can express yourself through many different mediums to many people and (hopefully) have some kind of impact. What do you enjoy most about your art? Performing live? Having a respected (and heard) voice? mucking around with lyrics? Collaborating?  Guardian contributor PeachesWebchat 03 November 2016 1:45pmAll those things are incredibly exciting, and it's also an incredible privilege to be able to travel around the world and give your message and your music and your performance to those who wish to hear it. A day doesn't go by when I'm not appreciate, and that might sound cheesy to you, but I'm so grateful. My core message is just to feel comfortable in your own body. That's all. Which is not an easy thing to do. And it's very difficult for people to understand that it's ok. It's hard to wrap your head around it because of certain social constraints, and years of political and religious ideologies. And other people's general fear of one's own self-expression.I'm really not into the word sex-positivity though, because who isn't sex positive? How can you be negative about sex, your own body, and your own pleasure and needs? Again, the organic farmer analogy...FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm GMT13:49The language of feminismNewTech_News asks:Can feminism still be classed as “progressive” in 2016. Or is it’s focus on one specific group not the antithesis of being progressive?  Guardian contributor PeachesWebchat 03 November 2016 1:42pmFeminism needs new terminology. There has been talk of intersectional feminism, but I hope we can come to an agreement that the point is to just take down the patriarchy. Everything is divided, and exponentially growing in every direction more than ever. As long as the patriarchy still exists, there will be discussion around feminism. It's exhausting being anything today, but maybe that's because I'll be 50 on November 11 - did I mention it's my birthday in Liverpool, and people should send me presents? I have enough peach-related items and dildos though.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.48pm GMT13:48wutheringshiite  asks:Is there hidden meaning to Dick in the Air, such as an early influence by an aviator named Richard?  Guardian contributor PeachesWebchat 03 November 2016 1:39pmIf Richard was that pilot who was caught nude flying a plane, maybe it is about him! But mostly it's all on the up and up. I wrote that song as a response to "put your booty in the air" - dicks go up, they're very animated, so I'd like to see them shaking in the club. In my live shows, I have a 11-metre long inflatable dick-like condom that I walk through over the audience. I hope you can picture that. There is an Italian artist who calls himself Plastic Fantastic, who approached me one day in a bar and told me that: "I av a beeg dick for you". And before I could slap him, he explained to me about his inflatable, and we've been friends ever since.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
