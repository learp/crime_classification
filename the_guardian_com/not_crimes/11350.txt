Ice skating has witnessed a huge revival in recent years, with temporary ice rinks popping up all over the UK for the Christmas season – yet with the current unseasonably warm spell threatening to turn them to slush, at what cost to the environment?Mark Nelson, who runs the ice rink at Somerset House in central London, which opens today, says that 6C is the sweet-spot temperature. Any warmer, and increasing amounts of energy are required to maintain the ice. Any lower and "little, if any" energy is used, with "zero consumption" being reached at 1C. Once the air temperature falls below zero, natural icing produces a "harder" ice."On average, the ice rink requires energy for 50% of the time," adds a Somerset House spokeswoman. "The ice is made of purified water, which ensures that it is frozen more quickly and is more resistant to melting." And a computer monitors the quality and temperature, avoiding any needless refrigeration.Saving energy matters, not just for the environment, but for the operator's budget. In 2007, Salford city council said it spent £10,000 on electricity running its 200-square-metre Winter Wonderland rink. However, there is a melt-free alternative, "synthetic ice": high-density plastic panels that can be locked together like a jigsaw. But how Christmassy is skating on plastic?
