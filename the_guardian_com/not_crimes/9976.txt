Over the past two and a half months, Britain has faced the most extreme series of weather events we have ever experienced. The surge down the east coast of England in early December was the biggest in 60 years, and in some cases even higher than in the tragedy of 1953.The storms over Christmas and new year were unprecedented, and they have since been followed by the wettest January in the south since records began.Last week the highest waves ever recorded in Britain were crashing against the south-west coast. Serious flooding has resulted, in many different parts of the country.My heart goes out to those people whose homes, businesses and land have been flooded during this period. Flooding can be one of the most distressing experiences anyone can ever have.During the past 10 weeks, about 5,000 houses have been flooded, in many different parts of the country.At the same time, it's important to realise that some 1.3 million homes – that would otherwise have flooded – have been protected by Environment Agency defences and the dedicated work of EA staff.There's always more that we can do, of course. We have a forward programme of work, investing in new flood defences, in town and country, all over England.And the substantial new funding announced this week by the government is really welcome – it will enable us to repair the damage that the winter storms have caused without eating into the money for new schemes to provide better protection for the future.It's important, though, to realise a fundamental constraint on us. It's not only the overall allocation for flood defence work that limits what we can do. There is also a limit on the amount we can contribute to any individual scheme, determined by a benefit-to-cost rule imposed on us by the Treasury.Take, for example, the highly visible issue of the dredging of the rivers on the Somerset Levels.Last year, after the 2012 floods, we recognised the local view that taking silt out of the two main rivers would help to carry water away faster after a flood.The Environment Agency put £400,000 on the table to help with that work – the maximum amount the Treasury rules allowed us to do. The additional funds from other sources that would be needed didn't come in.So when politicians start saying it's Environment Agency advice or decisions that are to blame, they need to realise that it's in fact government rules – laid down by successive governments, Labour and Tory – that are at the heart of the problem.That problem has now, this week, been solved by two things. The first was the announcement of £10m for Somerset, made by the prime minister.The other, probably even more important, was the statement by the secretary of state, Owen Paterson, that the Somerset Levels are such a unique landscape – reclaimed land largely below sea level, with the Severn estuary at its back – that the normal rules shouldn't apply.That decision really does free up the chance to find a longer-term solution to the future of the Levels.It will certainly involve dredging, and the EA will play its full part in that.But it also has to involve changing land use higher up the river catchments, renewing pumps and stopping the Severn tides backing up the rivers from the estuary.What really saddens me, though, is seeing the Environment Agency's work and expertise in flood-risk management, internationally respected and locally praised in many parts of the country, being used as a political football for a good media story.In a lifetime in public life, I've never seen the same sort of storm of background briefing, personal sniping and media frenzy getting in the way of decent people doing a valiant job trying to cope with unprecedented natural forces.Our staff have worked their hearts out in order to protect as many people as possible in the face of extreme weather.They'll carry on doing so. But there's no place for playing politics in the serious business of flood protection.• Lord Smith is chairman of the Environment Agency
