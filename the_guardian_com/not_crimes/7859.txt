A giant, twisted, rotating blade of aluminium has been unveiled in London’s St Pancras station to welcome visitors and perhaps even calm them down.The monumental artwork by Ron Arad will hang above the Eurostar platforms until January, part of an annual partnership between the station’s owners HS1 and the Royal Academy of Arts (RA).The Tel-Aviv-born designer said he was particularly pleased to have his work in St Pancras. “This is a very busy place, one of the first places I visited when I first came to London in 1973. I looked up and thought: ‘Wow.’ I hadn’t seen anything like it. There is something humbling about the station.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Ron Arad’s sculpture at St Pancras.

The 18-metre blade of highly polished aluminium rotates slowly, creating an optical illusion of hypnotic movement.It was made and delivered by Dutch shipbuilders and put up by British riggers at what is a border control point in London, a place where installers needed to have their passports on them.Tim Marlow, artistic director of the RA, said Arad’s work always blurred the boundaries between architecture, sculpture, engineering and design.The work, called Thought of Train of Thought, literally reflects one of London’s great urban structures, said Marlow. “The experience should be both spectacular and thought-provoking and offer the visitor a genuinely new perspective on a national landmark.”The Arad work is the second in a four-year artistic partnership between the RA and St Pancras, encouraging people to take a moment to look up. Last year Cornelia Parker hung a replica of the station’s enormous clock, a work called One More Time.
