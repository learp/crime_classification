Even if you have tiny hands, like a Lego toy or a dangerous politician, they need attention and love, especially in chilling times of great unrest. Keep Frédéric Malle’s incredibly decadent new Iris hand cream by your side to make you feel a little better – about chapped knuckles, tight palms, brittle nails and the sense that nothing is OK. It is just the right level of richness. It’s not too sticky and it smells delicious.Get the lookPalmer Cocoa Butter Formula, £2.70 iherb.comComice Pear & Wild Honey Cream, £10 moltonbrown.co.ukAlmond Milk & Honey Cream, £12 thebodyshop.comL’Occitane Lavender Hand Cream, £14 marksand spencer. com Jo Malone Geranium & Walnut Hand Cream, £22 jomalone.co.ukFrédéric Malle Iris Hand Cream, £55 fredericmalle.com Decléor Hand Cream, £14 decleor.co.ukEnergy Bank Hand Makeover, £25 spacenk.comMiller Harris Lumière Dorée, £18 millerharris.comEmail Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman
