A film exploring the deaths of 23 Chinese cockle pickers in Morecambe Bay in 2004 has become one of the first acquisitions from a fund designed to get more film and video work into the UK’s public art collections.Isaac Julien’s Ten Thousand Waves was first seen at the Sydney Biennale in 2010 and has made its way into a number of permanent collections around the world, including MoMa in New York.On Tuesday it was announced that the film had been acquired for British collections, jointly purchased by the Towner Gallery in Eastbourne and the Whitworth in Manchester.They have paid £80,000 in total with the bulk of the money coming from a Moving Image Fund, an initiative created by the Art Fund and the Thomas Dane Gallery.Stephen Deuchar, director of the Art Fund, said film and video work had, in terms of wide public recognition, been held back because it was so expensive to make. “The buyers tend to be either the very wealthiest individuals or the very wealthiest museums,” he said.“With public funding for smaller museums ever harder to find, it has meant there are very few museums outside London who have been able to acquire major works of film and video.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The film includes footage and stylised sequences.

He was particularly pleased that it will be part of the Whitworth collection. “Ten Thousand Waves is a piece that began its life in the north of England and its homecoming is incredibly meaningful to me.”Julien’s poetic film includes genuine and harrowing police helicopter footage of a survivor trapped by the vicious tides as well as more stylised sequences including a re-enactment of a 1930s Chinese film.The Art Fund also announced that the Imperial War Museum and the Towner Gallery had jointly acquired Omer Fast’s 2011 film 5,000 Feet is the Best, with the Towner using money from the Moving Image Fund.The 30-minute film, which provides an eye-opening insight into the working life of a drone operator, was first seen at the IWM in London in the summer of 2013.
