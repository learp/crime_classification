This is one of those few moments when the purchase of a scented candle will not cause every one to raise a disapproving eyebrow. It’s cold – candles are hot. The world is miserable – candles are lovely. Your flat smells of sprouts – candles don’t. Make the most of it. This year, festive candles come in all flavours of winter cheer, including Christmas trees, spices and snow itself.AlternativesChristmas Snow £95 rojaparfums.comAcqua di Parma Red Berries £90 johnlewis.comNeom Christmas Wish £30 marksandspencer.comJo Loves Christmas Trees £50 joloves.comGuerlain Hiver en Russie £57 johnlewis.comEpices et Delice £48 diptyqueparis.co.ukOud & Sapphire £60 prismologie.comMiller Harris Hope and Joy £30 jarrold.co.ukEmail Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman
