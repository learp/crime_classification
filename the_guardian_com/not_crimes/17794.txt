It was quite an occasion – and Beyoncé was the undoubted star (in a non-sporting sense, of course.) Coldplay were lightweight but effective, Bruno Mars did what he does – and there were many interesting and funny ads and film trailers to savor. What a night. Our collective Super Bowl party was a great pleasure to put on, but now we’re engorged on mozzarella sticks and chicken dippers, so we’ll say goodnight. Thanks for reading.

Helen MirrenYou know, if I have to be shamed into not driving drunk today (or any day) it might as well be by Helen Mirren. Even though this is a commercial airing during the most highly scrutinized television program of the year, I really thought she was going to use another C-word besides “coward”. I guess I’ll just have to wait for the inevitable Funny or Die parody video starring Dame Judi Dench.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.51am GMT02:51Ad watch – Kia ft. Christopher WalkenStop telling me I need a car to stand out. I don’t. A car, especially one that’s a mass-market object like a Kia, doesn’t change me. It doesn’t make me special. If I go to my local Whole Foods, there’s 10 Priuses, eight Kias, three Minis and maybe one PT Cruiser driven by the neighbourhood laughing stock. We’re all the same. We’re all driving the same car that’s slowly poisoning our planet with black smoke, that runs on a fuel that people murder each other over. It’s just a freaking car! I don’t care how many crazy faces Christopher Walken pulls. It’s just a car! Leave me alone! I’m buying a bicycle just to shut you people up.

Those pearly white teeth. That turtleneck. He looks like he should be hawking handkerchiefs on the Home Shopping Network with Joy Mangano or Suzanne Pleshette. If this rap thing doesn’t work out, there’s always a high-tech vacuum cleaner that needs selling. Or maybe Champagne Papi brand white wine spritzers. Good luck, Drizz! I know you can do it.

This video from Instagram reveals how the crowd helped Coldplay look colorful, while still seeing Beyoncé beat Bruno Mars in a dance battle.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.39am GMT02:39Ad watch – the Super Bowl, or maybe sexSo, the NFL makes people horny, eh? I have to say it’s kind of gross thinking about all those kids’ parents having sex after watching a football game. After the Super Bowl is over, I’m usually bloated, a bit drunk, and incapable of doing much more than waddling to the bathroom every 20 minutes. The Super Bowl is not an erotic event, despite what Roger Goodell might want you think. It’s America’s favorite excuse to roll around on a couch passing gas for three hours. If you’re turned on by that, you might be the biggest sexual deviant not currently playing football for a living.

Wow, this takes me back. You should have seen our version of Hot for Teacher. I did the splits and everything. Anyway, this commercial features some dogs licking people in condiment costumes, proving that even dogs love mustard. Is that an endorsement of their products? Dogs will eat their own excrement under certain circumstances.

Jason Bourne. Given the teaser’s extremely brief 30-second running time, it’s unclear what causes Bourne to resurface. That said, the wall-to-wall action promises muscular entertainment, with Damon looking beefier than ever (fast-forward to the 25-second mark to see the impressive fruits of his labor). Current ‘it girl’ Alicia Vikander is rumored to play a pivotal role in the film, but only her voice makes an appearance in this spot.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.15am GMT02:15If you’re here for the ads and film trailers, fear not: we’ll have much more analysis from the excellent Dave Schilling and Nigel M Smith in due course.
