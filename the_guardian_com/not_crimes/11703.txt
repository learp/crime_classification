Straw houses will no longer be the preserve of little pigs and self-builders this week, as the first straw houses offered on the open market go on sale.The team behind the project insist that straw houses could help to meet housing demand in the UK sustainably – and are safe from huffing and puffing.The homes are the result of an engineering research project led by the University of Bath and specialist architectural firm Modcell.The seven houses, on a street of traditional brick-built homes in Shirehampton, Bristol, are clad in brick to fit in with the surroundings.But their prefabricated walls are timber-framed, filled with straw bales and encased in wooden boards.Homeowners are being promised fuel bills up to 90% cheaper than an equivalent brick-built house and a purchase price less than the cost of the average house in Bristol.

Around half of this is effectively discarded due to its low value and is used as animal bedding.The remaining 3.8m tonnes of straw could be used to build more than 500,000 new homes, as an average three-bedroom house needs 7.2 tonnes of straw.There has been a steady increase in straw bale construction around the world, with buildings found in countries including the US, Australia and China.Straw housing developments are also under way in Cornwall.At the award-winning straw-built co-housing community in Bramley, Leeds, residents benefited from a 20% lower build cost and 90% cut in bills than the average in the city.
