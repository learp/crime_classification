Rehearsal images below show the cast working with director Daniel Kramer - also newly appointed as ENO’s artistic director. The company’s first new production of Tristan and Isolde in 20 years has been designed by Anish Kapoor and features the UK debut of Skelton in the title role. Tristan and Isolde, with an English translation by Andrew Porter, is in rep at the London Coliseum from 9 June to 9 July.
