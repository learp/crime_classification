I was given the book A Day at elBulli a couple of Christmases ago and have opened it exactly once. I found that David Thompson’s Thai food cookbook made a good tray for a TV dinner. I have sent dozens of encyclopedic, clever, well-researched cookbooks to the charity shop. When it comes to cookbooks, my tastes are … unconventional. I love books with overstyled glossy photos, gratuitous cleavage shots and chatty rambling prose. I love recipes interspersed with lengthy personal digressions and flavoured with a good splash of healthy narcissism. I love celebrity cookbooks.Celebrity cookbooks are strange. To a degree, they’re just an extension of a person’s brand: they come right after the syrupy perfume and the clothing line for Peacocks. Attach a big name (anyone from Fearne Cotton upwards will do), throw in a behind-the-scenes “recipe developer” or two and fill the pages with cheery snaps of the personality with their food and you’re on to a cookbook winner that will defy the general downturn in sales of print books. The inevitability of it all is as comforting as ITV2 showing The Mummy again, or your weekly Tuesday-night spag bol. But there’s something incongruous about the dizzying heights of celebrity and the messy, ugly reality of cooking and eating, and all the humanity that entails. Celebrities know all about this strangeness. They know how their fame sits uncomfortably against a backdrop of domesticity, home cooking and family. So, every celebrity cookbook is a reminder that these big names eat, sleep and shit like the rest of us. It’s just that they look great while they do it, and they’ll be damned if they’re going to let you forget that. I can’t get enough of them.

I bought it in a fugue state after a marathon four-hour Keeping Up with the Kardashians session, dizzy on the wholesome visions of family that I had just mainlined. The Kardashian-Jenner tribe may be all about the drama, but it’s steady, familial love that underpins the whole operation, and that family unit finds its heart in the Kardashian kitchen. The cookbook draws inspiration from that homeliness. There’s a recipe for Cream of Wheat – just a box of Cream of Wheat, sugar to serve and some milk – in memory of Kris’s late husband and the Kardashian sisters’ dad, Robert Kardashian. (It was the only food he could stomach in the late stages of his cancer.) There are Armenian recipes that celebrate the family’s heritage, and anecdotes woven through the recipes.This is what celebrity cookbooks do so well. When Kris Jenner, or her ghostwriter, opens a lemon chiffon pie recipe with a story about how nostalgic it makes her for the chaos of her full house, before the kids flew the nest, it puts the food into context. And when food is put into context, it becomes far more interesting than any Michelin-starred meal ever could. In model and presenter Chrissy Teigen’s book Cravings, the recipes are seasoned with Teigen’s trademark irreverence. There she is, the Sports Illustrated cover star, in a swimsuit with a fried chicken wing; here I am, in my pants with a Tesco sandwich. We have a connection, I think, as I pick prawn from my teeth.Save BBC recipe archive petition signed by more than 100,000 people These cookbooks aren’t perfect, of course, and the recipes can be uninspired, tricky, even downright bad. There’s a walnut loaf recipe in Stanley Tucci’s The Tucci Cookbook that I had to play around with a few times before I got a dough that worked; Kelis has a recipe for Japanese sweet potato samosas in her debut cookbook, My Life on a Plate, which – to the best of my knowledge – are neither Japanese nor samosas. These books are no different to any po-faced “real” cookbook in this respect, though: take the infamous River Cafe chocolate cake, or the notorious naffness of cheffy cookbooks, haphazardly transcribed for home use from the chaos of the restaurant kitchen. Make any recipe to which Delia hasn’t given her no-nonsense stamp of approval, and you run the risk of cooking up a disaster. But that’s all part of the fun.In research carried out last year, it emerged that almost half of women over 55 no longer use cookbooks, preferring instead to turn to the internet. Consider, too, the outcry earlier this year when the BBC threatened to close its recipe site. Online recipes are more popular than ever and, in the face of this, print cookbooks need to be able to offer something more. Anyone can find instructions for a passable lasagne with just a Google search and a click or two. When we buy cookbooks, we want something personal, rich and exciting; something that tells a story about food and people, rather than just a manual. Something like the Ziggy Marley and Family cookbook, or Freddie Prinze Jr’s Back to the Kitchen. Give me them over the Noma cookbook any day.
