The first major exhibition of watercolours by the Anglo-American painter John Singer Sargent – better known for his swagger portraits of Edwardian beauties, worthies and rogues – will be shown at the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London next spring.Unlike his portraits, which often show his subjects in sombre – if expensive – clothing against plain dark backgrounds, his rapidly executed watercolours, usually made in the open air, sparkle with light and colour.The exhibition will be co-curated by Richard Ormond, former director of the Maritime Museum, the great-nephew of the artist and an acknowledged expert on his work, who said the pictures revealed Sargent’s “zest for life and his pleasure in the art of painting”.

With this exhibition we hope to demonstrate Sargent’s mastery of the medium and the scale of his achievement.”Ormond said Sargent had been painting in watercolour from the start, but often used it later in his career as an escape from his studio and the weight of his society portrait commissions.How John Singer Sargent made a scene The 80 works are coming from more than 30 lenders, including a 1911 The Lady With the Umbrella – recently identified by Ormond’s co-curator, Elaine Kilmurray, as Sargent’s niece Rose-Marie Ormond, painted elegantly sprawled in a white dress in the dramatic cropped composition typical of his watercolours – which has never been exhibited in the UK before.The pictures – which include figure paintings, landscapes and details of architecture – are coming from collections including the Tate, the British Museum, the Fitzwilliam in Cambridge, Oxford’s Ashmolean, the Museu de Montserrat in Barcelona, the Calouste Gulbenkian in Lisbon and the Petit Palais in Paris, as well as from private owners.The exhibition at Dulwich Picture Gallery will run from 21 June until October 8 2017, during celebrations of its 200th anniversary.
