 Why do rabbits appear as part of Easter? And which are the best stories about rabbits for children?Unseen Beatrix Potter story featuring an older Peter Rabbit to be published Rabbits, and hares too, appear to have become linked to Easter in the 19th century when stories from Germany about them were translated. Both rabbits and hares have a great many babies and that may be the reason why they are linked to Easter as it is seen as a season of growth and reproduction.In general, rabbits in children’s books have little or nothing to do with Easter. However fertility is very much the point of Emily Gravett’s fabulously witty and brilliantly produced, The Rabbit Problem. Lonely and Chalk Rabbit live in Fibonacci’s Field and they keep on having more and more babies! How this rabbit family survive the complexity of their growing brood, the different seasons and more is hilarious for adults and children alike.

Illustration: Emily GravettThe most famous fictional rabbit is of course Peter Rabbit, in Beatrix Potter’s The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Published in 1902 it was the first of her long sequence of beautifully written and exquisitely illustrated stories about animals with human characteristics. Peter, one of a family of young rabbits, who has been expressly told by his mother not to go into Mr McGregor’s garden, does exactly that. Peter’s adventures in a place which offers great temptation but is also the scene of his father’s death, described warningly by Mrs Rabbit, “your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs McGregor.”, is one of the great adventures of children’s literature. Peter’s initial defiance, his growing terror and his final brave escape are all remarkably human; it is easy to see why The Tale of Peter Rabbit is one of the best-selling books of all time. Beatrix Potter studied rabbits closely and wrote other books about them including The Fierce Bad Rabbit and The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies. In Alison Uttley’s books about the motherly Little Grey Rabbit and her friends the animals are even nearer to humans than those created by Beatrix Potter. The series began in 1929 with The Squirrel, the Hare and Little Grey Rabbit, illustrated by Margaret Tempest and Uttley continued writing about her animal characters until 1975. Little Grey Rabbit and her two friends live in a tidy little house on the edge of the woods and have adventures with woodland creatures including a hedgehog, a mole, a rat, a badger and an owl. Hare is the most bumptious of the characters and he is also the one who has a specific association with Easter in Hare and the Easter Eggs. It’s a delightful story in which hare becomes entranced by all the sugary delights of Easter and especially by the wonderfulness of Easter eggs and determines to give some to all his friends. Little Bunny Foo Foo, the star of a poem of the same name, is a much less mice natured creature than either Potter’s or Uttley’s. Instead, he is a nasty little creature who makes a habit of terrorising field mice. “Little Bunny Foo Foo/ Went hopping through the forest/ Scooping up the field mice/ And bopping them on the head”. Luckily, a good fairy turns up in the nick of time and Little Bunny Foo Foo has to learn some lessons. Michael Rosen’s Little Rabbit Foo Foo, illustrated by Arthur Robbins is an excellent presentation of the poem. Axel Scheffler has created a delightful pair of young rabbits in Pip and Posy, stars of a series of books for toddlers including Pip and Posy: The Super Scooter and Pip and Posy: The Scary Monster and Pip and Posy: The Snowy Day. Although rabbitty (and mousey) to look at – except that they are wearing clothes - Pip and Posy’s activities, anxieties and delights are those of human toddlers too.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest A pair of hares are the stars in Sam McBratney and Anita Jeram’s classic Guess How Much I Love You. In phrases such as “I love you right up to the moon- and back” and “I love you as high as I can hop”, Big Nutbrown Hare and Little Nutbrown Hare delight in telling each other just how much they love each other. The stuffed rabbit in Margery Williams’s much-loved The Velveteen Rabbit wants something more than being loved: he wants to become real. Derided by the mechanical toys that he finds himself with, the Velveteen Rabbit has an aching desire to transformed and consoles himself with the wisdom he has learnt that toys can become real when they are loved enough. But when the boy who owns him is ill with scarlet fever, the Velveteen Rabbit, along with all the other toys, is bundled into a sack and sent off to be burnt. Luckily, the sack bursts and the Velveteen Rabbit survives, is rescued and then kissed by a fairy and becomes – real! William Nicholson’s illustrations capture the anguish of the Velveteen Rabbit in this classic story.Guess how much I love you – in pictures Who are your favourite bunnies and hares in children’s fiction?

Higgins (@monneehiggins)My fave 🐇book is The First Tomato:Voyage to The Bunny Planet by Rosemary Wells. @GdnChildrensBks @bostonathenaeum https://t.co/0ujl3azo3ZMarch 21, 2016Mary and Peter, via emailMy all time favourite bunny Easter book is Daddy Long Ears by Robert Kraus.The Country Bunny and the Little Golden Shoes by DuBose Heyward and Marjorie Flack is a stunning book about a mommy bunny’s domestic work (bringing up young bunnies to be effective workers) but her personal accomplishments. She gets chosen to be an Easter bunny as she such a GREAT bunny! (swift, sure and organized). I also really like Humbug Rabbit by Lorna Balian. The drawings are wonderful and it is multi-generational, and lots going on above and below ground for an easter egg hunt. It’s very good too.Lindsey, via emailThose Pesky Rabbits by Ciara Flood, published by Templar – utterly adorable.
