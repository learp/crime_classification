The Venezuelan government extended the Easter holiday to an entire week this year, and it’s all because of the weather. Although Venezuela is a big oil producer most of its power is produced by hydroelectric generators.The massive Guri dam, one of the largest in the world with a capacity of more than 10GW, provides almost half the country’s hydroelectricity. However, power generation needs adequate rainfall.In 2010 there were power cuts due to dry weather, and now Venezuela is experiencing its driest spell for decades, with three consecutive years of drought. The situation is blamed on the strong El Niño. According to the water minister, Ernesto Paiva, the country’s reservoirs are “at critical levels”.This has led to water supplies being limited. A journalist in Caracas reports that in her neighbourhood water is on for 20 minutes three times a day, and at unpredictable times.The compulsory five-day Easter break was an emergency measure to reduce electricity consumption. While some commentators have blamed planning by the Venezuelan government, the same problem affects other countries.

The long drought has also hit power production at Brazil’s huge 14GW dam at Itaipu, and Chile has also suffered due to a reliance on hydroelectricity.“When it rains, we all get wet,” according to a Latin American proverb. But when there is no rain, nobody has hydroelectricity.
