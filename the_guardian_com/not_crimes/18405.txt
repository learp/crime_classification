The Smithsonian, the world’s biggest museum and research complex, has abandoned its plan for a bespoke outpost in London and will instead stage joint exhibitions with the V&A on the former Olympic site in east London.The two organisations released a joint statement on Monday announcing what they called a “major new international collaboration”. Both will be part of the new cultural complex being created in Stratford on the site of the London 2012 Olympic games – but not as originally envisaged.Inside the new Smithsonian: a vivid exploration of African American history The Smithsonian, one of the world’s most famous museum names with 19 outposts in Washington and New York, had been courted by former London mayor Boris Johnson to be a major presence in the “Olympicopolis” project, joining the V&A, Sadler’s Wells and two university campuses.The idea was for the Smithsonian to have its own building, its first base outside the US, and send over exhibits from its vast collections of about 138 million objects, everything from works of art to space rockets and Judy Garland’s ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz. Instead it will be a partner in the V&A’s planned 18,000 sq metre building opposite the Aquatics Centre with jointly organised permanent exhibitions as well as opportunities to do things separately.The V&A’s deputy director, Tim Reeve, said they had been talking to the Smithsonian for a long time and both agreed “this is the best way of getting what they want”. Details of how the arrangement will work had yet to be fully worked out but it would be a genuine exhibition partnership, rather than staging consecutive major shows in the same place, Reeve said.Similarly the Smithsonian secretary, David Skorton, said: “This would not be a ‘Smithsonian outpost in London’. It would be a collaboration with the V&A, giving both of us opportunities to engage with diverse audiences in innovative ways.”Al Horvath, the Smithsonian’s undersecretary for finance and administration, said the high cost of a new building had played a part in the decision but getting hold of real estate had never been the prime motivator. “We feel this is a big win for us,” he said.London doesn't need a Smithsonian – but how about Hull? The new London mayor, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the transatlantic collaboration as “growing London’s cultural sector is one of my core priorities as mayor”. He added: “These plans would create an exciting new cultural venue in east London, which will help many more people enjoy the extraordinary collections managed by the Smithsonian and the V&A. It is great news for everyone who wants to see London’s cultural and creative sectors even bigger and better.”The east London project has been inspired by the grand museums on South Kensington’s Exhibition Road and the Southbank Centre complex, each born out of major national events: the 1851 Great Exhibition and the 1951 Festival of Britain.Sadler’s Wells is creating a 600-seat contemporary dance house, while nearby will be the University of the Arts London, which wants to move its London College of Fashion, with 5,000 students and 500 staff, to Stratford; and a new research campus for University College London, which will include the university’s first school of design and a centre for experimental engineering.The aim is to be fully open by 2022.
