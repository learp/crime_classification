Against Me!’s logo has been used by Topshop with “no permission” according to the punk group’s frontwoman, Laura Jane Grace.According to a post from Grace, a $700 leather jacket sold by the high street clothing store has used their name along the arm of one of its jackets, alongside punk rock group Vandals.

The photo of the Barbadian singer was taken by an independent photographer who owned the copyright in the photograph, and licensed the use of the image to Topshop. Rihanna and two of her corporate licensing companies subsequently launched legal action alleging that the use of her image for fashion clothing was not licensed and claimed those buying the T-shirt would falsely believe she had endorsed it.
