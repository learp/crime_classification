FilmLa La LandThis year’s Oscars best picture frontrunner, La La Land might – on the face of it – sound like a classic piece of awards-courting. It’s a love story between aspiring performers in LA, and a musical to boot. Yet, that isn’t to reckon with the kinetic energy of Damien “Whiplash” Chazelle’s direction, as well as the almost preposterous chemistry between leads Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.On general release from Friday 13 JanTVNo OffenceAmong a phalanx of po-faced police procedurals, Paul “Shameless” Abbott’s series stands apart. Here’s a rare cop drama that’s up for having a laugh, as best exemplified by Joanna Scanlon’s gloriously bawdy DI Deering. She and the show are back for series two.Continues Wednesday 11 Jan, 9pm, Channel 4Chewing Gum      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Michaela Coel, the writer and star of Chewing Gum.

Last time we saw Tracey she had just been chucked out of her mum’s house and had upended her sister’s wedding, so there’s tidying up to be done as this second series begins, though that’s unlikely to slow the show’s steady stream of gags.

Teaser single On Hold sees the band combine their trademark slow and spacious sound with the rapturous sampling that will be familiar to fans of Jamie xx’s solo career. On Hold, maybe, but certainly not stuck in the mud.ExhibitionsBeyond BoundariesSituated amid a whopping 500 acres of rural hillside, Yorkshire Sculpture Park is home to more than 100 works of art.

This year’s roster, comprising 120 performances, is nothing if not varied: purveyor of dazzling ball-chuckery Gandini Juggling prepares to amaze with its new show Smashed; Compagnie MPTA and Mathurin Bolze’s drama Barons Perchés untaps the narrative potential of the trampoline; and Les Antliaclastes adapt Mark Twain’s Is Shakespeare Dead? using, er, taxidermy puppetry.

Chiefly that nightlife is not dead. At Fabric, EC1M, Friday 6 Jan to Sunday 8 Jan
