Sir Ed Davey has today added his voice to the ranks of energy and climate change experts warning ‘Brexit’ would undermine the UK’s energy security, its ability to combat climate change threats, and its burgeoning green economy.Writing on BusinessGreen today ahead of a roundtable event on the implications of Brexit for energy and climate policy this morning at MHP Communications, where Davey now holds a senior adviser role, the former energy and climate change secretary warned a vote for Brexit can “only be bad for Britain’s green businesses”.“Perhaps a greener government than the current Conservative majority could offset the damage - but who’s to say a Brexit vote won’t unleash even stronger anti-green forces in the Tory Party and across the right of British politics?” he warned. “But you don’t have to take a party political position as I do. You only have to contemplate the years of uncertainty that would follow a Brexit vote. Energy investment thrives on political certainty because of the huge amounts of cash involved and because the financial returns come over a long period.”He added that if Britain does vote to leave on 23 June, green businesses “better have a good export strategy”.Drawing on his experience during his stint as energy and climate change secretary, Davey warned that giving up the UK’s involvement in Brussels’ negotiations would undermine both its energy security and its ability to help shape international climate policies.Specifically, he detailed how the UK helped lead the EU response to the energy security threat posed by Russia’s annexing of Crimea in 2014, pushing for a new energy security strategy which was subsequently adopted. “With energy security the ultimate in ‘soft power’ - a force for peace perhaps better than military spend - this experience shows we are more secure, at a lower cost, because we’re at the EU table,” Davey said.He also warned the UK’s role at ongoing international climate change talks would be compromised if it left the EU, arguing that it was the UK-backed Green Growth Group of ministers that helped push the bloc towards a more ambitious negotiating position ahead of the successful Paris Summit.“On climate change, it would frankly be environmental madness for the UK to leave the EU,” Davey warned. “It’s of course logically impossible for Britain to solve climate change alone - we only produce two percent or less of global greenhouse emissions: we have to work with other countries to achieve our own domestic goals on climate. By exercising influence at the EU, we can force others to do their share; and with the EU, we exercise much more influence on the global stage of the United Nations.”Davey’s analysis follows similar warnings from his successor as energy and climate change secretary, Amber Rudd, who last month warned Brexit would jeopardise much-needed new investment in energy infrastructure and push up bills for households and businesses.It also comes in the same week as a major new report from the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) revealed the green sector’s strong support for EU membership. The analysis, based on the committee’s extensive evidence sessions with ministers, EU officials, businesses, and NGOs over recent months, underlines the role the trading bloc has played in strengthening Britain’s domestic environmental legislation, spurring green business innovation and boosting the UK’s influence in international climate negotiations.The report also warned there remains “significant unanswered questions” over the fate of Britain’s environmental policies if it left the EU, with EAC chair and Labour MP Mary Creagh highlighting to BusinessGreen the risk of core green legislation being overturned by eurosceptics intent on deregulation. “Most politicians who support Britain’s exit would like to see a deregulatory agenda, and in areas like air and water and waste it opens the door for future governments to quietly drop beneficial legislation,” she said.
