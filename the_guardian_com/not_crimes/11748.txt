Celebrated playwrights often seem to spend their later years in a kind of exile that is less common for successful novelists. Perhaps because putting on a play is more complicated than putting out a book – a script needs a producer, director, actors, stage and audience – award-winning dramatists can find themselves locked out of theatres that once royally courted them.Arnold Wesker endured a long English wilderness of the kind also experienced by peers such as John Osborne, Peter Nichols, David Storey and Edward Bond. New plays went unperformed in his own country, though they were often produced elsewhere, while recognition from British theatre was restricted to a long service knighthood and revivals of his heyday plays.Gratifyingly, those revisits to his greatest hits proved the enduring quality of the work. The plays that first brought Wesker to attention at the turn of the 1960s categorised him as an autobiographical writer, although he benefited from having life experiences that either soon became unusual or were rare among writers: the national service conscription that informed Chips with Everything (1962); employment as a sous chef led to The Kitchen (1957); while growing up in a family of communists inspired Chicken Soup With Barley (1958), the stock that he thickened into a reputation-making trilogy by adding Roots and I’m Talking About Jerusalem.The sense given by these plays of Wesker as a leftwing, working-class Jewish memoirist was accurate, but was shown to be only part of the story by two tremendous productions in 2011. Dominic Cooke’s Royal Court revival of Chicken Soup With Barley made Wesker’s presentation of his personal dispute over political purity – a lapsed communist who clashed with his still observant mother – feel relevant to broader disputes in politics and culture over the extent to which ideology should be diluted by events. The play was also notable for the daring of its time structure, following a family across 20 years in around two hours, a pages to decades ratio that few other dramas have equalled.

The way that Wesker played theatrically with time in Chicken Soup With Barley and space in The Kitchen demonstrated that, although his plays were often based on socially realistic material, he was also inventive and even experimental in his storytelling and stagecraft.One reason for Wesker’s long period of neglect in British theatre was a tendency to fall out with theatres and critics. The cancellation of The Journalists, a work of reportage about a newspaper written for the RSC in 1972, following what Wesker regarded as political censorship by the cast, made the playwright serious enemies in both Equity and the National Union of Journalists, a most unfortunate combination for a playwright. Four years later, when The Merchant, a thoughtful reworking of Shakespeare’s Shylock, was expected to be such a success on Broadway that Wesker was advised to take advice from super-tax accountants, its star, Zero Mostel, died suddenly during previews, ending the run.Another advantage of novels is that they can’t be closed down due to the death of someone in them, and that may be one reason why Wesker turned to prose fiction during his theatrical hiatus. But, unlike many dramatists who go out of fashion, he had the consolation of revivals that confirmed his worth, and his trilogy and The Kitchen will surely be seen again.
