Will & Grace, the hit sitcom about the romantic highs and lows of two New York friends, is reportedly returning for 10 episodes on US network NBC.Leslie Jordan, who guested on the show as the character Beverley Leslie, said in a radio interview: “It’s back. Here’s the way it works: NBC has ordered 10 episodes. It’ll be for next season, so they’ll [film] in July.” NBC is yet to confirm the show’s return.After running for eight seasons between 1998 and 2006, the show returned with a 10-minute episode in September 2016, with the titular pair discussing Donald Trump’s presidential nomination. Asked then about a more long-form return for the show, Eric McCormack, who plays Will, said “it’s a never say never type of situation”.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Will & Grace was unusual in the late 1990s with its frank – if rather stereotyped – depiction of gay romance. Outgoing vice-president Joe Biden once said: “I think Will & Grace probably did more to educate the American public [on gay people] than almost anything anybody has ever done so far.”By its third season it was attracting over 17m viewers an episode, and netted guest stars including Woody Harrelson, Minnie Driver and Alec Baldwin. Debbie Reynolds, who died last week after a stroke, appeared in every season as Grace’s mother Bobbi. Reacting to the news, Debra Messing, who plays Grace, tweeted “I loved her dearly” and called her “a legend”.
