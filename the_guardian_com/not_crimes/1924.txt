One of the world’s greatest private collections of modern art is to go on show for the first time outside Russia, museum curators have said.The collection of more than 250 paintings put together by Sergei Shchukin before the Russian revolution will be displayed in its entirety in October at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris – a major coup for the newly opened gallery.The super-rich collector filled his Moscow mansion with some of the finest French impressionist and post-impressionist art, making a kind of orthodox altar in one room with 16 of Gauguin’s Tahiti paintings.But his hoard of 50 top-notch Picassos, 38 works by Matisse, 13 Monets, eight Cézannes and four Van Goghs that the textile merchant picked up on business trips to Paris, was seized after Russia’s October revolution in 1917.

Arnault opened the private Fondation Louis Vuitton at the end of 2014.The paintings will go on display in the spectacular building designed by the architect Frank Gehry on 20 October, with the Icons of Modern Art show running until 20 January.The show will also include 30 major pieces from the Russian avant-garde suprematist and constructivist movements, loaned by the Tretyakov State Gallery in Moscow and the Russian Museum in St Petersburg.An art lover's tour of Russia Shchukin, who fled Russia for France after the revolution, had a particularly close relationship with Henri Matisse, who he brought to Moscow in 1911 to decorate his palatial home.He also commissioned two of the artist’s most important works, The Dance and Music, which are likely to be centrepieces of the Paris show, curated by the former head of the city’s Picasso Museum, Anne Baldassari.The exhibition is the fruit of years of negotiations between LVMH boss Arnault and the Russian authorities, with a partnership agreement signed on Wednesday at the Russian foreign ministry between the foundation and the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg and Moscow’s Pushkin Museum.

A great private benefactor, Bernard Arnault, wanted to pay homage to a great collector,” he said. “Big private collectors often play a key role in putting together the collections of great public institutions.”
