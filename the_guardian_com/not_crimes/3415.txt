Congratulations to all those who made Spencer Tunick’s Sea of Hull such a success (Report, 9 July, theguardian.com). The streets looked stunning in the early hours of Saturday and it was wonderful to see spectacular images across the world’s media. But it was the atmosphere – filled with warmth, friendliness, humour and positivity – that made it a huge privilege to be involved. To be part of a diverse group of thousands, gathering together to cooperate in the production of art, was inspiring, life-affirming and liberating. It was a simply beautiful day. Initial nerves evaporated once the cue to strip and apply paint was given. Impromptu teams formed to make sure the painting was to Spencer’s exacting standards: bodies were checked for coverage; strangers painted strangers. At a time when we need a much greater sense of hope and togetherness, such collaborations can inspire. Hull has been a good news story around the world this week. I have never been more proud of my home town.Richard ClaxtonFiley, North Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
