The baby flatback turtle climbs out of its sandy nest and stares at the perilous shore with a look that says “bring it on”.Even before they’re born, these blue-eyed beauties are built to withstand the greatest dangers of Australia’s northern continental shelf.A flatback mother puts her energy into laying fewer but larger eggs than other turtle species to ensure her babies have the best start in life.They’re also born with a serrated shell and a feisty attitude that helps them fight off predators like sea eagles.
