All that jazz: remembering my grandfather and John Wayne April is officially jazz appreciation month, an annual event created by Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History to pay tribute to the history of jazz music, as well as a celebration of jazz in its existing form. This is the 16th edition of JAM proving that the music genre is very much alive and well, and can be ranked among America’s greatest cultural achievements and global exports. While the event originated in America, we’d like to see your photos and stories of what impact jazz has had on your life wherever you are in the world.Have you been to a jazz festival that made a lasting impression on you? Do you have a favourite jazz artist or venue you’d like to pay homage to? Maybe there’s a specific piece of music you’d like to recommend?
