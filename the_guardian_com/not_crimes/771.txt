During my fourteenth summer, my mom bought me a book to read on our beach vacation. She’d seen a review of it in the newspaper and thought I’d like it.It was about rabbits.I was fourteen. I didn’t want to read a book about bunnies. However, I also didn’t want to hurt my mother’s feelings, so as we settled on blankets at the beach I opened Watership Down and started reading. And my head exploded. These weren’t rabbits who drank tea and lived in cozy cottages, they were real rabbits, driven out of their warren, struggling to survive in the open, hunted by dogs, and men with shotguns, and cats, and other rabbits.

Hazel, their leader, wasn’t particularly large or fierce, but he was wise. General Woundwart, the fascist leader of Efrafra, the Soviet Union of rabbit warrens, was as large and mean as a badger. When Hazel led his small band into Efrafra to free repressed rabbits, my heart was in my throat. I also had the worst sunburn of my life, because I hadn’t moved from that blanket. I hadn’t gone in the water, or to the nearby amusement park. By the second day I had to cover myself in beach towels from head to toe to escape the sun, but still, I read on.

To this day, the thrumming ecstasy I felt reading Watership Down is still vivid. I channel it into my own writing. I strive each day to capture a little of that magic to share with others. My first novel for teens, Burning Midnight, has no rabbits in it whatsoever. It’s about a pair of poor teens hunting for mysterious coloured spheres in New York City, spheres that give you powers. If they’re lucky enough to find one of the rarest spheres, they can sell it for millions. Or they can find out what power it gives, because no one knows.See? No rabbits whatsoever. But Watership Down is in there, between the lines. How could it not be? It is the book that made me want to be a writer.Will McIntosh’s Burning Midnight is available from the Guardian Bookshop.
