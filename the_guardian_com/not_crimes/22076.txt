Who is really in control of Top Gear? Even before the PR car-crash that was the Cenotaph filming, the BBC would not reveal who is officially executive producer on the BBC2 motoring show. Although Chris Evans apologised over the Cenotaph incident, sources say he will not be listed as a producer – instead he will be billed as “creative lead” on the show. That explains why Evans asked for changes to the “car-studded entertainment” marketing plan, which was due to feature presenters seen through the Stig’s visor but now looks as though it will include more footage of him and co-host Matt LeBlanc. Top Gear: Chris Evans apologises for 'disrespectful' Cenotaph stunt However, like other BBC presenters, Evans can’t be named as executive producer since the “Sachsgate” incident – when Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand were suspended over a prank call in a show in produced by the latter’s company – even if he is taking all the major decisions. When asked who will carry the can as executive producer, a BBC spokesman said: “There is a senior editorial lead from in-house production who is now looking after Top Gear.” So is the “senior editorial lead” BBC controller of fiction and entertainment Mark Freeland or UK controller of entertainment production Katie Taylor? The BBC won’t say. With about eight weeks to go until the first episode (which is expected to feature a South African road trip search for a band) the new Top Gear chief will have to be unveiled to TV listings mags soon.
