Douglas Walker, who has died aged 87, was the longest-serving managing director of the agricultural and grounds care equipment company John Deere.Doug, as he was known, was a key figure in the company’s establishment and growth in the UK and Ireland after it started trading from headquarters at Langar, near Nottingham, in January 1966. In the 25 years under his leadership it developed into a strong, well-known organisation.Born in Edinburgh, Doug was the son of James, who owned a haberdashery shop, and Alice (nee Barton). He was educated at George Heriot’s school in the city before gaining his National Diploma of Agriculture at Edinburgh School of Agriculture. Thoughts of becoming a vet or farmer after graduating were overtaken by a growing interest in agricultural machinery.He lectured on the subject at Lancashire County Institute of Agriculture’s machinery department, which he established. After marrying Helen Bell in 1951, he later did the same at the relatively new Shuttleworth College in Bedfordshire. Several years later, he joined the tractor maker David Brown, moving through many departments before taking up his first appointment with John Deere.He became the company’s first territory manager for Scotland and, three months later, its first sales manager. He was appointed managing director in October 1968, a position he held until retirement in February 1993, after 27 years of service with the company. In this time turnover grew from £3m to £120m and the original 11 outlets expanded to 132 dealerships.In the late 1960s, Doug also oversaw the introduction to the UK market of high-horsepower tractors, at a time when the average farm tractor was in the 50hp class. In recognition of this he was appointed an associate of the Royal Agricultural Societies in 1992.Doug, a freeman of the City of London, served as president of the Institution of Agricultural Engineers and twice as president of the Agricultural Engineers Association in the 1970s and 80s. He was chair of the Royal Smithfield Show joint committee and president of the Motor and Allied Trades Benevolent Fund charity, BEN.Doug’s hobbies included travel, photography and walking.
