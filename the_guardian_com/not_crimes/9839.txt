Hollywood’s leading men age and grey, while their female co-stars remain forever 23. Here is a fact that is engraved so deep that woodlice live there. And yet the world is surprised when a female actor tries to stay young looking.When the film critic of Variety, Owen Gleiberman, wrote 1,500 words on Renée Zellweger’s face in the trailer for the new Bridget Jones film, discussing how disappointed he was to see that she no longer looked like “herself” (“I just hope it turns out to be a movie that stars Renée Zellweger rather than a victim of Invasion of the Face Snatchers”) the actor Rose McGowan responded with descriptions of her own career, filled with harassment and judgment. “Her crime, according to you, is growing older in a way you don’t approve of,” she wrote in the Hollywood Reporter. “What you are doing is vile, damaging, stupid and cruel. It also reeks of status quo white-male privilege… You are an active endorser of what is tantamount to harassment and abuse of actresses and women.” There are two ways an actress’s face can change – ‘naturally’ and through surgery. The problem is, with both she loses Zellweger is 47, and since the last Bridget Jones film her face has changed. There are two ways a famous actress’s face can change over time – “naturally”, allowing wrinkles, and through surgery, in an attempt to stave them off. The problem is, with both she loses. After the first her career options are hacked in half; after the second she disappoints her fanbase, including the sensitive critics who appear to take her youth and beauty personally. Last week in the Guardian Isabella Rossellini recalled her mother Ingrid Bergman telling her: “There is no job for women between 45 and 60, because you are in between. You are not young enough to play the young girl, but you are also not old enough to play the matriarch, the witch or grandmother.” And what else is there in Hollywood/life?But the problem doesn’t start at 45. It is already obvious at the beginning of a career, when the young actor’s face is so distracting, so luminous, that often it blinds a critic. In a profile for Vanity Fair’s August cover, writer Rich Cohen (co-creator of HBO’s just-cancelled Vinyl) failed to find a way to deal with Margot Robbie as a human person. The piece has been beautifully ripped apart online, both for its description of Australians as “throwback people” living in a country 50 years behind America, and for the tone, one that suggested he was the first person in the world to ever see a woman. It is already a classic in the genre – the Telegraph put it at the top of a list of quotes from “the most sexist celebrity interviews ever”, including an Esquire profile of Megan Fox that sighed: “She’s a screen saver on a teenage boy’s laptop, a middle-aged lawyer’s shower fantasy, a sexual prop used to sell movies and jeans.”On Twitter it was suggested that Cohen had perhaps written his Robbie profile with his penis. Robbie, he begins, is “26 and beautiful, not in that otherworldly, catwalk way but in a minor knock-around key, a blue mood, a slow dance.” Her eyes, he says, are “painfully blue”, as if her beauty is an act of aggression. It would be funny if it wasn’t so familiar. Robbie’s face, like Zellweger’s, like Rossellini’s and her mother’s before her, must become a mirror for every crumb of anxiety and lust an audience is made of.After reading that Vanity Fair profile, an actress’s pursuit of a plump and lineless face becomes all too understandable. The appearance of youth is so precious and magical that mere language is not capable of holding its weight, hence writers like Cohen reaching around for new similes with which to describe its effect on him. For Zellweger to make the decision to change her face is not necessarily a “rejection of the self”, as Gleiberman claims. Far more likely, it’s the product of an entirely logical assumption that she must conform to the standards her industry (and our own dumb domestic world) has set. That before her matriarch, witch and grandmother years arrive, she must strive to be seen as a young girl, one worthy of a critic’s desire, worthy of the kind of Vanity Fair yearn-alism that makes people look.Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman
