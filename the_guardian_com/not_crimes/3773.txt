At 8am on Easter Monday, Ruby Tandoh’s Guardian article urging a joyous, guilt-free attitude to food appeared online. The 2013 Bake Off finalist shared it on Twitter, then joyously fired off a series of tweets attacking a slew of celebrity cooks and diet-mongers. Tom Kerridge’s carb-cutting dopamine diet bestseller was “total bollocks”. Buying a co-written Hemsley sisters’ offering meant “half the fucking brain cells for double the price”. Joe Wicks was “bish bash boshing himself to a multi million £££ turnover”. Even the beloved Jamie Oliver, Hairy Bikers and Lorraine Pascale were accused of “swinging from ‘comfort food’ to ‘superfood’ and back again whenever the price is right”.Jibes at culinary rivals are nothing new. Gordon Ramsay has sparred with Oliver and Marco Pierre White. Anthony Bourdain is a serial chef slicer. Delia Smith, queen of the 90s, slated Gary Rhodes and Antony Worrall Thompson – both retaliated – and later MasterChef’s judges. Raymond Blanc bashed Bake Off although he then said sorry (criticised by him for “female tears”, Tandoh told him, “don’t be an idiot”, warming up for her post-series jab at “peacocking manchild” Paul Hollywood). Even cooking’s Queen Mum, Mary Berry, has said she wouldn’t eat at Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck and was seen as dissing Delia in noting that Smith “hasn’t had the advantage of having children [and so their feedback] like I have”.Almost all such put-downs relate to celeb chefs as TV idols, whereas the former philosophy student’s Easter Monday offensive unusually zeroed in on their writing (“disingenuous ‘makeover’ food books ... fatphobic, cruel, self-serving ‘foodies’ dominating the food press”), presumably with the aim of boosting her own Flavour above the “diet industry shills” and “superfood shills” in the sales charts. This may be the first example of food feuding that is a mixture of book PR and literary criticism.
