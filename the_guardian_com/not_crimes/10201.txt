Pierogi and kopytka (dumplings)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Pierogi are a staple of Polish cuisine. Photograph: AlamySeek out domowe (homemade) behind the deli counter or robione ręcznie (made by hand) in the refrigerators. If you can’t find any, go for frozen ones over machine-made, chilled offerings.Although commonly served boiled, pierogi can also be baked or fried (ideally in rapeseed oil) after parboiling. Serve them drizzled with fried onions, smalec (pork fat with pork pieces) or both, and accompany with your choice of surówki (salads of raw or pickled vegetables) – such as sauerkraut, cucumber or yoghurt and dill – and pickles, for balance.Similar to gnocchi, kopytka (little hooves) are tiny, potato-based dumplings that suit shallow frying, but can also be deep-fried as a moreish snack.If you’re avoiding wheat, try golumpki or gołąbki (dumplings encased in cabbage leaf).Chleb, pączki and ciasta (baked goods)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘A thing of wonder’: sernik with raisins. Photograph: -lvinst-/Getty Images/iStockphotoThe Polish have been obsessing over sourdough for centuries. Any Polski sklep worth frequenting will have a daily delivery of rye, wheat and other breads, if not an in-house bakery. Fresh pączki (doughnuts) are huge and glorious. There’s a longstanding tradition of elaborate, French-style cream creations, too. Sernik (baked cheesecake) is also a thing of wonder.Kiełbasy, wędliny and schab (sausages, cold cuts and pork)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Expertly cured meats ... smoked sausage. Photograph: MiroNovak/Getty Images/iStockphotoBeyond the standard pork kabanos, there are expertly cured meats, including chicken and turkey. These come delicately or heavily smoked or cured – and can be hung further at home if they are not punchy enough. For those not disposed to sausage, there are myriad wędliny (cold, cooked, sometimes-smoked meats), as well as pasztety (patés) such as pasztet z gęsi ze śliwką (goose and plum paté) and pasztet cielęcy (veal paté).Karkówka (pork shoulder) is fattier, and therefore more moist, than loin. Have your butcher prepare thin steaks for griddling or slow-braise the entire cut. Poles adore golonka (pork knuckle), the fine skin of which makes for light, crispy scratchings.Kefir, kvass and kiszonki (ferments and pickles)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Pickled vegetables are widely available. Photograph: Diana Taliun/Getty Images/iStockphotoMany delis will have home-pickled ogórki (cucumbers), whether soaked for a couple of days with dill, garlic and other herbs (ogórki małosolne) or left to ferment and soften (ogórki kiszone). Pickled mushrooms, beetroots, tomatoes and cabbage concoctions, such as sauerkraut, are also widely available; seek out the Krakus brand.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Amber is one of Poland’s leading craft breweries.Kvass, a Baltic and Slavic staple, is a fermented bread drink that is gaining plaudits as a health food due to its purported probiotic powers. As well as being the key ingredient in żurek, a rye-bread soup, it can also be used to add a refreshing sour note to stews.Kefir, milk fermented with bacteria and yeast, is apparently brilliant for your microbiome.Kasza and piwa (grains and beers)Kasza is an umbrella term for grains. The most widely used is kasza gryczana (roasted buckwheat), served hot with fried lardons, onions and mushrooms as a simple supper or added to cooled salads to bring a welcome nuttiness. Kasza jaglana (millet groats) is usually served as a breakfast dish, but also makes for a comforting, sauce-absorbing side for meaty mains.Brits have already taken to Polish lagers such as Tyskie and Żywiec, and boutique brewing is on the rise in Poland. The Gdańsk-based Amber brewery is well regarded and makes natural and low-intervention brews. Ales such as Lwówek Jankes and porters are also beginning to arrive in the UK. Żywiec’s fine porter and wheat beer are rumoured to be on their way here, too.This article was amended on 11 November 2016 to correct the spelling of several Polish words.
