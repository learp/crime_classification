Sonia Friedman, the West End producer responsible for some of the biggest stage hits of 2016, has been named the most influential person currently working in UK theatre and performing arts.Friedman has for the first time been placed at No 1 in the Stage 100 list, an annual league table organised by the long-established industry newspaper.A big part of her taking top spot is the stellar success of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the pair of plays which she produced and watched become one the biggest theatrical events for decades.“She has had such a phenomenal year,” said the Stage’s print editor Alistair Smith. “Harry Potter has been an extraordinary success both on a box-office level and an artistic one. As long as I’ve been writing about theatre I can’t think of another show that has been as big – you’re going back to the mega-musicals of the 80s.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Harry Potter And The Cursed Child with Jamie Parker (left) as Harry Potter and Sam Clemmett as Albus Potter.

But she has been a major player for years and was producer on big hits such as the West End transfer of Jerusalem from the Royal Court and The Book of Mormon.Friedman replaces Howard Panter and Rosemary Squire in the top spot. Panter and Squire, the co-founders of Ambassador Theatre Group – the largest commercial theatre company in the world – had topped the list since 2009 but were in 2016 unexpectedly replaced at the helm by Mark Cornell and Adam Kenwright, who are new on the list at No 4.Andrew Lloyd Webber goes up to second spot from fourth, while Cameron Mackintosh remains at No 3.Friedman, often to be seen with her two bichon frise dogs in tow, is the first No 1 not to own or operate West End theatres. She is only the second woman at the top as a solo entry, the previous one being Janet Holmes who in 1998 was in charge of Stoll Moss Theatres.Smith said there had been a small increase (up 2% to 34%) in representation of women in the list, but a striking rise in the number of women in the top 10 (up 50% on 2016).They include Emma Rice (No 10) who was hired to shake up Shakespeare’s Globe but will step down in 2018 because trustees wanted a return to natural lighting.The number of entries from black, Asian and minority ethnic professionals remains low, a reflection of what Lord Lloyd-Webber recently called the “hideously white” theatre industry. There are seven people, up from five in 2016.Among the big risers in the list are Rufus Norris and his executive team at the National Theatre, in the top five for the first time. After a rocky start which saw the departure of chief executive Tessa Ross, the high placing was a sign, said Smith, “of that team bedding in and Rufus Norris starting to really make his mark as artistic director”.

Other actors include Sheridan Smith (40), Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart (44), Mark Rylance (48), Billie Piper (60), Simon Russell Beale (65), Maxine Peake (66), and Paapa Essiedu (71).Smith said the aim of the list was to recognise people who are doing well in the industry. “It is the same reason people do award ceremonies, it is to reflect on success.”It was also a good way of keeping tabs on theatre trends over a period of time and there is, of course, an element of it being fun: “People like lists.”Friedman said of her top ranking: “This is an amazing recognition of the extraordinary people I have been privileged to work with over the year, and also of my sensational team at Sonia Friedman Productions who helped me produce, co-produce and develop over 20 shows in 2016 and who are already preparing for an even busier 2017.”The Stage 100 top 10 1 Sonia Friedman2 Andrew Lloyd Webber3 Cameron Mackintosh and Nicholas Allott4 Mark Cornell and Adam Kenwright5 Rufus Norris, Lisa Burger and Ben Power (NT)6 Nica Burns and Max Weitzenhoffer7 Gregory Doran, Catherine Mallyon, Erica Whyman (RSC)8 David Lan and Lucy Woollatt (Young Vic)9 Josie Rourke and Kate Pakenham (Donmar Warehouse)10 Emma Rice and Neil Constable (Shakespeare’s Globe)The full list will be available at www.thestage.co.uk and in the 5 January print edition of the Stage.
