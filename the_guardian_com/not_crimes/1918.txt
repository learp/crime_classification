Police patrols are continuing off Tasmania’s east coast after a man was killed by a shark as his daughter watched.Man killed by shark while diving with daughter off Tasmania’s Maria Island The man, in his late 40s from the Hobart suburb of Kingston, was diving for scallops with his adult daughter early on Saturday near Maria island.When he failed to surface, the woman, in her 20s, went back down to check and saw what she described as a large shark attacking her father.He was pulled up by the air hose he was attached to, but he had been fatally injured. It is only the second recorded unprovoked shark attack in Tasmania in the past 100 years.John Hammond, from the Scallop fishermen’s association of Tasmania, said he was shocked by the news and there were a number of other divers in the water when it happened.“[The diver was] in the shallow water there. It just struck out of the blue, and bang,” he told the ABC.“... [It’s an] absolute tragedy for the family. Bloody terrible ... From what I understand his daughter was swimming with him so it would just be horrendous for [her].”On Friday fishermen in the area had spotted a 4.5-metre great white shark and alerted local marine authorities, but it does not appear the usual marine radio warning was issued.The mayor of Glamorgan Spring Bay, Michael Kent, said his community was in shock and devastated by the man’s death.“There’s been a so-called white pointer seen a couple of times over the last week out and about but not particularly a lot of sharks in and around that particular area,” he said.“I don’t know how long the shark’s been in the area.”Patrols are continuing and people are being warned to stay out of the water.Divers told local media that a diver had been harassed by a great white shark at Port Arthur about a week ago.The only other unprovoked recorded shark attack in Tasmania in the past century was in 1993 when a woman was killed while diving off Tenth island on the north coast.On Sunday morning a shark sighting forced several beaches on the NSW far north coast to be closed.A large shark was spotted about 50 metres off Angels beach in Ballina, which led to that and Shelly beach, Lighthouse beach and Angel’s Flat Rock being closed until 11am on Monday.“It is believed the presence of baitfish has attracted large sharks to the area,” police said.
