Politicians and activists in India and Pakistan are campaigning to ban the popular Japanese cartoon cat Doraemon from television screens because they say it corrupts children.Social conservatives have called on the authorities to banish Doraemon, a blue feline robot from the 22nd century, for encouraging children to misbehave at school and at home, according to media reports.The new science of cute | Neil Steinberg The campaign gathered momentum this summer when Malik Taimur, a member of the opposition Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party, said Punjab should ban 24-hour cartoon channels and singled out Doraemon as the worst offender.The assembly in the most populous province was due to discuss the resolution later this month, Japan’s Nikkei business paper said.“The language that is used in the cartoons is destroying our societal norms,” the resolution said in urging the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority to banish the cat from TV screens.
