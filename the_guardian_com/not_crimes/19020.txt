The internet’s cycles are as old as the internet itself: we discover something en masse, fixate upon it, and then, inevitably, cool towards that thing. With the notable exception of cats, it happens for everything from pastries (bless the Cronut) to diets (hello, 5:2!).But have you heard the one about the internet’s latest boyfriend? The wheel of fortune has landed its arrow on Oscar Isaac, and a frenzied and hysterical adoration of the American actor is under way. Yes, the communal crush is in full swing.Here’s what we know about Isaac, 36: he was born in Guatemala and raised in Miami in a Christian home. He played in punk bands as a teenager, living a “straight edge” (ie no drugs) life, before drama school and Shakespeare in the Park.But I knew none of this when I first saw him in 2011’s Drive, in which he played the no-good but incredibly magnetic husband, Standard. It’s a supporting role, but Isaac shone: his face has a remarkable sincerity (great for playing both heroes and villains), and a natural Pacino-esque intensity.And, yes, he is very handsome, with soulful eyes, a strong jawline, and boing-able curls. You can see why JJ Abrams cast him as dashing hero pilot Poe Dameron in the latest Star Wars film – and why the internet wants him to be in a relationship with every one of his co-stars, from Lupita Nyong’o to John Boyega.Crush of the week: Bruce Willis Off-screen, he exudes natural charm, like the time he turned the head of his Poe Dameron doll to face Nyong’o while she spoke in a joint TV interview, and there was a swooning outbreak. Next up is a role in the latest X-Men movie. Long live the internet’s boyfriend.
