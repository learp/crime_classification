Ryan Reynolds, he explains in his advert for BT, is a busy guy. He can’t even sign autographs any more, scrawling a straight line across multiple headshots of himself instead of dedicating three seconds to the devoted fans who make it possible for him to drive the Mercedes C63 he doesn’t have time to park in a technically responsible manner. Reynolds’s is a hectic schedule in which even reading a film script before accepting or dismissing it is too taxing. (Citation: Green Lantern, 2011)What he does make time for, of course, is filming an advert to plug BT’s Infinity broadband service, which needs to be as fast as his lifestyle – up to 52 megabits per second, for those taking notes. At the nucleus of this advert’s premise lies a troubling question that should haunt us all: just what, exactly, is Ryan Reynolds running from?Perhaps Reynolds fears the silence that would engulf him when alone, away from Hollywood’s white noise and sycophantic applause. He fears that he would hear nought but the voices in his head. “Green Lantern,” these voices shriek in piercing discord. “Green Lantern was a mediocre film at best.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest
