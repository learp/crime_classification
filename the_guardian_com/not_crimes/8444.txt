Nairobi, September 17Women’s fashions were blamed today for the gradual extinction of the leopard.An official statement by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which is holding a conference here, said illegal trade in leopard skins was endangering the leopard’s future in Africa.In certain parts of Africa the leopard was already extinct and in others it would become so within five years if this trade was not suppressed. The price of leopard skins had soared to £70 to £80 sterling because of the demand for leopard skin coats, especially in the United States and Western Europe.Dr L.S.B. Leakey, director of the Coryndon Museum, Nairobi, told the conference that primitive man was “not guilty” of the ravages caused to tropical Africa’s natural resources over two million years of history.He said there was evidence to prove that dozens of different varieties of flora and fauna disappeared during this period “without intervention of any significance by man.”One important reason why East Africa was rich in evidence showing early human occupation was the region’s variety of altitudes and also the availability of water, around which primitive man gathered.Dr Leakey said water still dominated the tropical African scene today, and he recommended that schemes should be devised for the inexpensive conversion of the world’s saline and unusable masses of water into drinkable and useful water.Asked by Sir Julian Huxley, chairman of today’s session, how he could establish the existence of man two million years ago. Dr Leakey said his view was based on geological and palaeontological as well as “potassium argon “ dating.
