For FrancesSomehow it all gets done and over with–The office emptied of its archival dross,Papers re-read, and chucked, the years of breathRe-breathed, moment by moment. Why feel crossAt this departure? Why feel worse than sadFor fag-ashed, faded memos, decisions taken,Or not taken, the good, indifferent, bad,Right ways of doing, and the mistaken?Permit no tears, but still, allow a sighClosing a door on what was once my life,My days, my work. Farewell, and so goodbyeWhile haar is forming over North-East Fife.It’s like The Cruel Sea, the ship going down–Jack Hawkins with his duffel-coated frown.“Confidential books over the side? Carry on.”We should have lit a bonfire on the lawn,Thrown on the lot. Instead, my Number OneLugs binbags to the shredder, day by day,As slow as patient archaeology. Shiver me timbers! But it’s not much fun.Not pushed, but oh-so-very-gently shovedTowards the book-loaded van and a pension,Then shelving shadows with the books I’ve loved.
