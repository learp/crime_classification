Essex-born comedian, actor and writer Alan Davies, 50, performed his first standup gig five months after leaving university in 1988, and just three years later was named best young comic by Time Out. Having made the move into television, he is now best known for his role as amateur sleuth Jonathan Creek in BBC1’s Bafta-winning series of the same name, and as a panellist on the quiz show QI. His partner is the children’s author Katie Davies, whom he met backstage at QI and married in 2007 with his friend Bill Bailey as best man. They live in London with their two children. He is currently appearing alongside Jo Brand in Channel 4’s social worker sitcom Damned, on Tuesdays at 10pm.1 | PlayHow (Not) to Live in Suburbia      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘Highly recommended’: Annie Siddons’s How (Not) to Live in Suburbia. Photograph: Claire NolanI saw this play by Annie Siddons at the Summerhall in Edinburgh. Siddons was raised in London, then when she moved out to Twickenham her marriage broke up and she found herself there with two small children and no friends. It’s about coping with loneliness, really. To preserve their privacy the children were represented by two olive trees, because they put down shallow roots and need looking after – that was very funny and clever. It’s a show about parenting as much as anything, and I’ve got two small children of my own. Highly recommended!      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest 2 | NonfictionSo You’ve Been Publicly Shamed by Jon RonsonI’m a big Jon Ronson fan and I try to read all his books and watch his documentaries. What he’s done with this book is look at people who have been taken apart on social media; people going about their lives, putting up a tweet and before they know it they’ve gone viral and everything’s ruined for them. Rather than giving ourselves a platform for freedom of expression, we are creating an environment where everybody’s cowering in fear of being pursued by an angry pitchfork cyber-mob. I speak as somebody who was on Twitter for a while and now doesn’t go near it because of the toxicity of much of what’s on there.3 | DocumentaryPeace Officer      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Documentary film Peace Officer.I was touring my standup in New Zealand at the same time as the international film festival, and watched a few films while I was there. I saw this documentary, which follows the founder of Utah’s first Swat unit. He investigates the death of his son-in-law and other shootings related to an increase in violent Swat team raids. He thinks the deaths were unnecessary and presents a compelling case, but also has sympathy with the officers who are putting their lives on the line. I found it very interesting because although it’s not a film motivated by race relations, the victims all happen to be white. When there is much publicity rightly being given to Black Lives Matter, it’s an interesting parallel issue.4 | RestaurantDavid Bann, Edinburgh      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A chili pancake at David Bann. Photograph: thevegancookiefairyThis vegetarian restaurant in Edinburgh is one of my favourites. I don’t eat meat – I do eat seafood sometimes, but usually because there isn’t a good vegetarian option. Everyone should try veggie food. If you think it’s only for vegetarians you’re making a big mistake. The dishes are always quite surprising, they do some quite clever and inventive things on the menu, but equally they’ll do you some stir fry, noodles and veg. It’s a classy, upmarket kind of place, but entirely unpretentious. I wish there was one on every street corner in the country.5 | NovelGone With the Wind (Margaret Mitchell, 1936)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in Gone With the Wind. Photograph: Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty ImagesThe best novel I’ve read in the past 12 months is Gone With the Wind. The reason I read it is interesting: my mum died when I was six, and on her bedside table was a copy of Gone With the Wind, which was left there by my dad. It was her favourite book. When I was growing up it was thought of as a woman’s book, therefore not of interest to me. It’s written by a woman and the central character is a woman, but it’s about the history of racial tension in the US. I was expecting some elongated Mills & Boon scenario and I found something profoundly interesting about a period of history that I’m quite interested in. It’s a broad, sweeping novel, an epic of Dickensian scale, and I had no idea.6 | ComedyWill Franken      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘Quite sardonic’: Will FrankenHe was the best comedian I saw at the Edinburgh fringe this year. You can’t really describe it as standup because he does so many different voices, and goes off on so many tangents. It’s quite a sardonic approach. Sometimes you see a comedian who has so much talent and such little recognition, you feel like there’s an imbalance in the world. Some people are so inventive that it makes them almost inaccessible to a wider audience, but I thought he was a brilliant comic.7 | VenueGlasgow film theatre      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘A fantastic place’: Glasgow film theatre. Photograph: AlamyI’ve just been filming a Jonathan Creek Christmas special based in Glasgow. I didn’t know about the Glasgow film theatre, but I stumbled upon it quite early in my stay and what a fantastic place it is. I saw Born to Be Blue, the Chet Baker biopic, as well as this Danish film, The Commune, which was compelling. At work the director would say, “What did you do last night?” I’d say, “I went to the GFT again!” You can sit there with a merlot and watch this amazing film and you’re really comfortable.
