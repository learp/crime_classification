Former Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour will perform in the preserved ancient Roman town of Pompeii this summer, Italy’s culture minister has announced.The psychedelic British rock band that propelled Gilmour to fame made a film in 1971 at the site, which lay buried under ash for more than 1,600 years after nearby Vesuvius erupted in AD79. “Agreement reached. After 45 years David Gilmour will play again at Pompeii on 7 and 8 July,” culture minister Dario Franceschini tweeted. It is likely Gilmour will play at the site’s amphitheatre rather than the Large Theatre where the documentary Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii was made, a spokesman for the town said. The stone amphitheatre was built to hold gladiator fights more than a century before Rome’s Colosseum and can hold about 2,000 people.Gilmour, 70, will have an audience this time, having played to an empty theatre over four days to film the documentary. The concerts have not been listed on Gilmour’s official website. On 10 and 11 July he is due to play in a first-century Roman amphitheatre in Verona, northern Italy.Elton John is also scheduled to perform at Pompeii in July.
