Think about your favourite fairy tale. Think about Prince Charming. Actually, think about any boy, in a book or a movie, of whom you’ve thought, What if he was real?What if your perfect guy, the one you’ve only wished into existence about eight thousand and forty three times, suddenly did come out of the page? What if the universe (and your own stubbornness) decided that maybe you deserve what you were wishing for?Delilah wished for her prince from a children’s fairy tale novel, and out he came. Well, it wasn’t that simple, but the bottom line is that he’s here. In the real world, impersonating the son of his creator, going to dreaded high school and learning to live like a normal human being.And everything should be perfect, but it’s not. Because wishes are powerful things, especially one from the purest desires, but stories have ways of rewriting themselves, and not everything is under our control.Can I just start with: Off the Page is the ULTIMATE book for ALL fangirls. It’s what we’ve been dreaming/praying/wishing/living for, only better! It’s hilarious: Game of Thrones is a GAME played with thrones, the SAT’s are extremely easy because all one has to do is fill in the bubbles, and Victoria’s Secret will not be publicised.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
