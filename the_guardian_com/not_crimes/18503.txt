The Rosemary Branch theatre, a fringe venue in north London, is appealing for copies of Fifty Shades of Grey to build a set for a one-woman show by performance poet Hannah Silva. According to the theatre, Silva’s show Schlock! is a performance about “gender, sexuality and power” that “takes the language of Fifty Shades, rips up, rewires and reshapes it”. Finally, a chance to turn EL James into something approaching art, you say. But I’m not so sure.I couldn’t help thinking of the sculptures made from books that appeared at the Edinburgh festival a few years back, and a bookshop I once visited in Venice, that kept its books in bathtubs and piled them high at the front of the shop in a gondola. The picturesqueness only increased behind the shop, where a fire escape offered a view over a canal. Visitors were encouraged to climb a staircase constructed out of soggy hardbacks and lean over the wall. Staring out over the misty waters, I reflected that nobody was going to be flicking through any of the books I was standing on any time soon.A book is a promise to the future, a parcel gift-wrapped in the unlikely hope that someone might actually want to read it – which makes a little tragedy out of each and every one of the millions of copies sent to be pulped each year. Maybe you’ll be able to pick up your copy after Schlock! has finished, but my feeling is that that every time a book gets turned into something else a little piece of magic dies. A book is a mysterious object, a machine that transcends time and paper and ink to take you into someone else’s imagination. Even if all you find there is Christian Grey.
