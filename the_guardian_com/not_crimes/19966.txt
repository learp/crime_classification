The BBC is to open the iPlayer to partners for the first time, starting with arts content including the Royal Shakespeare Company’s latest production of Richard II starring David Tennant.The BBC has teamed up with arts organisations including the British Film Institute (BFI), Shakespeare’s Globe, the Royal Opera House and the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust to launch an online festival marking the 400th anniversary of the bard’s death.The six-month schedule of digital content, part of an initiative called Shakespeare Lives that includes TV and radio programmes, will also feature the BFI’s Sir Ian McKellen-fronted production Shakespeare on Stage, Screen and Elsewhere.The digital festival is being co-curated by the British Council.Hands off our cherished BBC, say older voters The move to allow third-party content on the iPlayer stems from a pledge made by Tony Hall, the corporation’s director general, last September to create a new “open” BBC based on partnerships. The “open” initiative is part of a major reshaping of the BBC designed to respond to the government’s attempt to curb the scale and scope of the corporation as it faces royal charter renewal.“For the first time, the BBC will be showcasing the great talent we have in our leading cultural institutions on BBC iPlayer,” said Hall. “It’s another step towards an open BBC – something we all believe in. This weekend [23 April] we’re experimenting live with digital formats like never before. Alongside a fantastic lineup on radio and television, we’re hosting a digital festival, shaped with partners, to bring their creativity to millions here and the world over.”
