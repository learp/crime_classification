As Colorado's fierce Waldo Canyon fire continues to burn and displace families in the Colorado Springs area, small crews of locally stationed air force reservists have been tasked with battling the flames from the sky.For some, like loadmaster Chris Linquistit of the US air force reserve command's 302nd airlift wing, it means fighting a fire that threatens their hometown. "It's numbing," he told the Guardian. "It's hard to watch your home burn."About 32,000 Colorado Springs residents were being evacuated on Wednesday. "It was like looking at the worst movie set you could imagine," Governor John Hickenlooper said after flying over the blaze. "It's almost surreal. You look at that, and it's like nothing I've seen before."Stationed at Peterson air force base, the 302nd has provided a crucial tool in combating the fire; two massive C-130H aircraft equipped with modular airborne firefighting systems, or Maffs. Two more of the specialized aircraft have been provided by the Wyoming air national guard's 153rd airlift wing. Together the four planes represent half of the nation's elite firefighting tankers.The hulking C-130Hs are considered a last resort in combating fires. Their use requires that all other options – including private aircraft – have been exhausted. On Sunday the National interagency fire center – which provides guidance for US fire agencies – informed the 302nd that their equipment and capabilities were needed."They requested that the aircraft be ready to fly by Monday," said Ann Skarban, chief of public affairs for the 302nd. Shortly after noon on Monday, the mission was launched.The first stop was a tanker base in Pueblo, Colorado, where the planes were filled with a special flame retardant known as Phos-Chek. The Maffs tanker system allows the plane's crew to drop 3,000 gallons of the substance in under five seconds, covering an area one-quarter of a mile long by 100 feet wide. Maffs crews are made up of six members: a pilot, a co-pilot, a flight engineer, a navigator and two loadmasters. Once the retardant load is dispersed the aircraft can be refilled and back to the mission in less than 12 minutes. Air-bound firefighters have compared the high-stakes refuelling process to Nascar pit stops. According to a US forest service report, the planes cost $6,600 an hour to fly.The mission of the planes is to stop the spread of the flames by creating suppression lines, allowing ground personnel to move in and provide containment. To do this the aircraft are forced to fly low, hugging close to the earth, often barrelling through clouds of smoke.On Tuesday, the crews completed their first full day of operations. The planes are limited to daylight hours, meaning they make as many runs as possible before the sun goes down or the smoke gets too thick. After roughly seven hours of dropping retardant, refuelling, then repeating the process, the planes had to pull out due to low visibility at 4pm Tuesday afternoon. It was at the time that high winds pushed the flames over a mountain ridge, turning the Waldo Canyon fire into an inferno that forced the evacuation of more than 32,000 residents, including the air force academy, and destroyed an unknown number of homes.The reservists in Colorado Springs have a history of battling such conditions. In 2008 the 302nd responded to fires in California, while 2011 was a record season for Maffs operations, with missions launched in Mexico, New Mexico, Arizona and Texas. Still, Colorado's wildfires, the Waldo Canyon fire in particular, present an unique challenge to the crew members stationed at Peterson."This is their hometown," Skarban said. "They're extremely professional. They work diligently and very hard on every task they're given.""But I know for many of them, this is home," she said, noting that some members of the crew live in the city's evacuation areas or have friends and family that do."It means a lot to them," Skarban said.This is Linquist's first year fighting fires, and he admits it has been difficult. But, he said, he is grateful for the opportunity to help protect his community."It's one of the most satisfying missions I think that I've ever been on," he said. "I'm very happy that they brought us in."The blaze is just one of over half dozens wildfires to take hold in Colorado in recent weeks, fuelled by exceedingly dry conditions, record heat and unpredictable winds. In northern Colorado, just outside the city of Fort Collins, the High Park fire has burned 87,284 acres, displaced over 11,000 people and led to at least one death. It is the second largest fire in the state's history. The local sheriff's department hopes to see all evacuees returned to their homes within the next two days.
