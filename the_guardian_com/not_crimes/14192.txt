NWA could be set to reunite at this year’s Coachella festival, according to Ice Cube. The rapper is set to play the California festival as a solo artist, but told US show The Talk that he hopes to do more than just that.“I’ve got some tricks up my sleeves,” said Ice Cube, one of the group’s founding members. “I’m gonna try to bring the members of NWA together. Give everybody a little history lesson on Ice Cube and NWA, Westside Connection, everything I’ve been doing over the years.”There are even rumours that the late Eazy-E could make an appearance in holographic form, although this seems to be based largely on Ice Cube’s promise of “some great visuals”. Three of NWA’s key members – Ice Cube, DJ Yella, MC Ren – joined each other on stage at the BET Experience in 2015 ahead of the release of the biopic Straight Outta Compton. Dr Dre was not present, however, and it’s over 25 years since the group last performed live together. Elsewhere at Coachella, there will be headline slots from LCD Soundsystem, Guns N’ Roses and Calvin Harris. Other acts confirmed include Sufjan Stevens, Run the Jewels, Courtney Barnett, M83, Major Lazer, Chvrches, Ellie Goulding, Skepta, Lush and Hudson Mohawke.
