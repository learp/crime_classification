10.00pm GMT22:00With that in mind, you’d better join me here next week to see what on earth they do next. There’s no way Amanda Holden can follow the Dyer WDYTYA so skip that, make a strong drink and meet me here just before 9pm.Byeeeeeee.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.59pm GMT21:59Lord! Al is already advertising for contestants for NEXT year. Every year I kind of assume that’s it. It must be over now. The experiment to find the occupants of the next Golgafrincham B Arc. But no, on it goes.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.58pm GMT21:58“I’m just looking forward to seeing my mum,” says Paul in the back of the terminal taxi. Spoken like Danny Dyer after he’s just found out he’s NOT related to Henry III after all.Bye Paul, you big unreconstructed misogynist what Al could not afford to be associated with and who probably had a balls business plan anyways.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.56pm GMT21:56And so to Al’s decision.He says that Paul is not a potential winner and firs his arse right out of the door. He’s STILL telling both “ladies” to calm themselves down because they live to fight another week. Paul is fired, Jess and Fran continue.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.55pm GMT21:55 Al accuses Paul of aggression like he doesn’t think that’s a good thing. If Paul wasn’t aggressive, he’d tell him he was a pussy. No wonder these candidates go mad. There is literally no way for them to win.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.54pm GMT21:54Jessica is finding this really hard to to listen to and tries to turn away from the table because she knows crying is not acceptable in a boardroom situation.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.53pm GMT21:53Oh women, with your feelings and your hormones.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.53pm GMT21:53Paul was always the one I thought of as like Lord Sugar and that he’d see as a kindred spirit. But I’ve gone right off him now. Both women get passionate in their own defence and both of them are told to “calm down” by Alan. Sitting on my hands here.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.52pm GMT21:52Could this be Jessica’s last stand. I find myself suddenly sad to see her on the cusp of going. I hope the women realise it’s time to turn on Paul because it’s their own means of survival and he’d do the same to them.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.51pm GMT21:51Naturally, Paul is coming back with Jessica and... Fran. Wow. That’s got to hurt when she thought she’d gained safety by becoming his wing person. I hope Fran actually tries to kill him.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.50pm GMT21:50This is unexpected. Paul is now getting heat for demoting Jessica. It’s like they’ve noticed that he doesn’t really like women and they’re not OK with that. Fair play.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.49pm GMT21:49Paul’s team learns that the shitty canapés they served actually cost them a pile of cash in refunds. Everyone sucks lemons as Fran tries to give Jess some props for trying to save the situation.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.47pm GMT21:47Paul and team have drained their polystyrene cups and returned to the boardroom. Sofiane makes the fair point that his sales went down the toilet the minute his punters heard the tickets were going cheaper elsewhere.Trishna adds weight to the argument that Jess was to blame. Paul agrees with her and the knives are fully out for Jess. She might as well be smeared in blood and be tethered to a hook dangling over a shark tank.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.45pm GMT21:45Trishna brings up Jess’s hot food thing. She has sensed blood and sees Jess’s feet stumbling into the quicksand. There’s no way she’s going to support her fellow sister now, not wishing to be dragged down with her.
