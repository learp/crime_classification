EditorialWe are not, fortunately, so far ahead of Adam that we cannot take pride in a successful bit of digging. The war, indeed, has to its credit side the fact that it forcibly reminded us as a nation of the value, as well as the fun, of making something edible grow on unused land. Many thousands of citizens whom the army did not want waged, in the days of potato queues, an unaccustomed campaign on neighbouring nettle-beds and turned the dull face of suburban waste land into nursery gardens. They did it as a matter of duty. They continue to do it because they find it profitable and enjoyable.Even a successful bout with Colonel Bogey is a minor triumph compared with wringing from the earth a tribute to one’s labour and tending, and the loquacious golfer in the morning train is properly silenced by the man who has a few square yards of well-groomed allotment to boast of. But the land available for this most valuable and healthful of hobbies does not keep pace with the number of would-be gardeners, and, though more than one Act of Parliament facilitates the acquiring of allotments, there is need of the measure to which the House of Commons yesterday [see below] gave a second reading without a division. It will enable properly constituted allotment societies to draw on public funds in order to acquire land, and it will secure to the allotment holder not only a longer warning in cases where he has to be ejected, but, if his holding is from a local authority, the provision of “alternative accommodation.” There were complaints yesterday from the spokesmen of all parties that even this measure does not go far enough towards achieving that ideal which even a pocket-handkerchief of unlikely land which one has cared for rouses in every man – security of tenure. But at least the measure should be helpful in giving to an activity that began as a war-time expedient that permanent place in the social and economic life of the country that is its due.
