Boarding school left me with a profound distrust of rules and authority. I remember the headmaster smashing me over the head and shouting, “You’re such a self-righteous little boy, Poliakoff.” I had no idea what self-righteous meant, but I thought it wasn’t wise to ask while being walloped.My mum took an inordinate interest in the ups and downs of my career. When I was young I had a play accepted by the Hampstead Theatre which they cancelled when new management took over. She told me: “You’re 17 and your career is going nowhere.” It was quite a pressure.Just after Anthony Blunt was disgraced as a spy, a friend of mine rang up and asked if I’d like to have dinner with him because, he said, he was a great fan. I was sure he was making it up, so I didn’t go. I missed what would have been one of the most fascinating meals of my life. I left my mum in the foyer when I went backstage to see Peggy Ashcroft. It was an act of extraordinary cruelty I found myself alone with Tony Blair after being on The Andrew Marr Show. I said: “I’m going to ask you something you’re not expecting.” There was that look of panic in his eyes, as in, “Oh God, here goes Iraq again.” I said, “How did you overcome your fear of flying?” He explained how you sit with the pilot, and how it works, and he became very paternalistic.I relax by wandering in little circles fiddling with a plastic straw. I used to fiddle with a Biro, but then I’d spatter ink. So an actor changed my life and suggested a straw. It goes back to childhood when I would pull off a branch, fiddling or swishing it, and wander into the woods to tell stories to myself.I watched Brexit through a fog of rubble mixed with tears. Just before the polls closed, my wife and I were by the telly and part of our ceiling fell down, like an extraordinary metaphor. We watched David Dimbleby, the air thick with dust, along with the disintegration of the Remain cause.My father had an incredibly Russian temper. He would threaten to turn the dining table over and cutlery would slide off the table. He was a tiny man bristling with rage, and I’ve never been like that. I used to have a temper, but it’s got better; I think as you get older it mellows.One of my greatest achievements was passing my advanced maths O-level due to a miraculous act of a boy in front of me who did all his questions really quickly and left his paper on his desk – the last three answers were exposed to the elements.An act of extraordinary cruelty was going backstage to meet Peggy Ashcroft and not taking my mother, who was with me at the time. She was a huge theatre fan and we went to see Peggy at the National in Watch on the Rhine. I left my mum in the foyer. I was still quite young and thought, “Oh, she’s going to embarrass me in front of Peggy.” But she would so love to have met her. If I could replay one moment in my life, it would be that.Memories can rear up, sink their teeth into the present and not let go. The past is one of the things I write about a lot. It’s not always a nice place.Close to the Enemy is now available on DVD and digital download
