Greenpeace has attacked a tie-up between conservation group WWF and the owner of the John West tuna brand as “green spin”.Greenpeace said John West’s owner, MW Brand, had backtracked on a public commitment to eliminate the use of controversial fishing methods.Under a deal with WWF, MW Brand has pledged to source all its products from fisheries and farms certified by the Marine Stewardship Council or the Aquaculture Stewardship Council. It will also push for the elimination of illegal, unregulated or unreported fishing. WWF will assess the group’s supply chain to see how it can be made more sustainable over the next six months. But the deal does not set a time by when MW Brand will ensure its fish is sourced sustainably.Previously, MW Brand promised Greenpeace that by the end of next year it would stop using a controversial fishing method that can kill sharks, rays and turtles. The purse seine method employs large nets which scoop up all kinds of ocean creatures attracted by floating rafts known as fish aggregation devices (FADs).Last week, MW Brand went back on its pledge to stop using FADs and said it planned to use something it terms “eco-FADs” instead. “John West is reneging on its promise and our faith in the company has been demolished,” said Sarah North, head of oceans for Greenpeace. “This new deal is an attempt by John West to give a green spin to breaking their promise to go FAD free.”WWF said that John West recognised it had to make changes, partly as a result of pressure from Greenpeace, and had brought in the conservation group to help it move in the right direction. “We want to work with businesses and we have the track record to show we can bring about change,” said Stuart Poore, director of corporate stewardship at WWF.MW Brands said its No 1 priority was “the conservation of the marine environment and the protection of fish species. We are vehemently opposed to fishing practices that jeopardise threatened species or endanger non-target species.”
