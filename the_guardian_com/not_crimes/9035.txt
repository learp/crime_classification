Chances are you are going to loathe at least one of your kid’s friends, sometimes for no good reason, but this is one situation where you have to tread very carefully.1. Never admit it. That’s the fastest way to make them infinitely more attractive to toddlers and teenagers. If you want to change a vague friendship into something resembling Romeo and Juliet in terms of passion and intensity, just say you don’t like someone. Also, never enthuse about anyone you think is a great influence as that can put the kiss of death on the friendship.2. Take the long-term view. Children grow up, teenagers stop rebelling and parents learn to relax a little. Friends you are currently not keen on can be dropped overnight, turn into absolute charmers, or become the friend who is always there for your child, no matter what. Stay quiet and keep an eye on things, as well as being honest enough to admit you got someone wrong.3. It’s not about you. Sometimes you don’t like a parent or a different way of bringing up children and that can translate into an unreasonable dislike of a child. Try to be honest with yourself – does a very confident child make yours seem timid, or a different approach to discipline undermine what you always previously thought was reasonable?4. Befriend them. This works at every age. Don’t be sycophantic or overeager – just practical and friendly. When they are younger, do things with them such as making cakes, or include them in slightly odd activities, such as clearing out a shed and taking rubbish to the dump. Talk to them, listen to them, be interested. Give them slightly more responsibility than they are used to, so that coming to your home makes them feel more grown up. Similarly with teenagers. Treat them as adults and they find it hard not to respond. Also, your teenagers might find that the coolest person in school isn’t quite such a rebel with their feet under your kitchen table having a cosy cup of tea.5. Be wary. If your dislike is based on something tangible and harmful, such as bullying, over-influencing or dangerous behaviours, you will have to do something, but approach with care. With a younger child who is being bossed or bullied by a so-called friend, try empathy and chat about what they can do, especially in their own home, to be in charge for a bit. Never interfere directly as your child won’t welcome that and it might mean they stop telling you what’s worrying them. Focus instead on building their confidence and developing other friendships alongside the one that troubles you. When it comes to peer pressure and drink, drugs and sex, keep talking, but shift the balance slightly, asking if they worry about friends indulging and what the outcome has been if they have. If that takes the conversation on to their own involvement, do not blame anyone else; be glad your teenager has confided and concentrate on helping them.6. Don’t be cool. It’s your job to worry. Stranger danger changes in early teens and it can be hard for them to realise that they are more likely to be tempted into dangerous behaviour by someone close to them, such as a sibling, cousin or friend, so have that chat in plenty of time. Pretending you don’t worry is pointless and might inspire attention-seeking behaviour. Always be the parent who can be called in a crisis – whether for your child or their friend. You’re not condoning, but you will help them deal with difficult situations.You can’t choose your family – or your children’s friends 7. Applaud their confidence. Remind them occasionally that, as they get older, they will widen their friendship circle and may meet people who will try to influence them, but imply confidence in them making their own decisions. If they accuse you of considering a friend a bad influence, instead focus on their own determination and influence. Something as simple as, “I always thought you were more likely to influence than be influenced” can put a different perspective on relationships for them, without any parental criticism of their friends.
