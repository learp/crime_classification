The Project presenter Waleed Aly could become the first back-to-back Gold Logie winner in almost 10 years.Not since Home and Away star Kate Richie took home the top prize in 2007 and 2008 has someone won consecutive trophies.Aly was announced by TV Week on Sunday as one of six nominees alongside The Project colleague Peter Helliar, Family Feud host Grant Denyer and actors Rodger Corser and Samuel Johnson. Love Child and Wrong Girl actress Jessica Marais is the sole woman in contention for the Australian television accolade.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  The Project’s Waleed Aly wins the 2016 Gold LogieThe editor of TV Week, Emma Nolan, responded to criticism that the awards were snubbing female talent, telling News Corp this year’s results were “what the viewers wanted”.Marais plays midwife Joan Millar on Love Child and TV producer Lily Woodward on The Wrong Girl and said her nomination was down to the quality of the two shows.“It makes me incredibly proud that Love Child is well loved [and] probably just reaffirms that we have a great thing going and that people are excited to see the show, because it’s definitely got legs,” she told News Corp. “As for The Wrong Girl, the show has the potential to cover material that we haven’t seen on Australian television before. Lily as a character is such a juicy, open and accessible character. I feel very lucky to be playing [her].”Waleed Aly: don't take social media bait of misogynist provocations It’s the sixth year running a presenter from The Project has been nominated. Denyer and Aly are also nominated for best presenter.When it came to nominations for programming, the ABC led the way with 26 followed by Ten with 18, Seven with 14 and Nine with 11. Australia’s public broadcaster swept all five nominations for most outstanding comedy program. Black Comedy, Shaun Micallef’s Mad As Hell and suburban snapshot Upper Middle Bogan are all in the running.Corser is also up for best actor for his work in ABC crime series The Doctor Blake Mysteries which is set in the Victorian town of Ballarat. He’ll have stiff competition though from lead Craig McLachlan (Doctor Lucien Blake).After a breakthrough nomination last year, streaming service Stan received its second nod with Deborah Mailman nominated for best actress and most outstanding supporting actress for playing Bernadette in six-part drama series spin-off Wolf Creek. Half the Logies are jury-voted and recognise excellence in entertainment, comedy, children’s television, news and sport, as well as series and miniseries.
