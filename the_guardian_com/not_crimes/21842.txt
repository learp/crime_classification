The groundbreaking American stage musical Hamilton, winner of 11 Tony awards and the Pulitzer prize, has named cast changes for this summer. Brandon Victor Dixon, who starred in Shuffle Along on Broadway and The Scottsboro Boys in London, is to replace Leslie Odom Jr in the role of former US vice-president Aaron Burr. Last month, Odom Jr won a Tony for his portrayal. Lexi Lawson will make her Broadway debut by taking over from Phillipa Soo in the role of Eliza Schuyler, the wife of founding father Alexander Hamilton.Hamilton review – founding father gets a hip-hop makeover Lawson’s previous credits include the US national tour of In the Heights, which Lin-Manuel Miranda created before his runaway success as the star, writer and composer of Hamilton. When he leaves the show on 9 July, Miranda will hand over the lead role of Hamilton to Javier Muñoz, his current understudy, who has been playing the role every Sunday. The alternate Alexander Hamilton in the production will now be Michael Luwoye.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Lin-Manuel Miranda, centre, with Hamilton cast members at the Tony awards.

I can’t believe we get him in the building.” As for Lawson, his verdict was: “You guys ain’t even ready. @LexiLawson IS THE TRUUUUUUTH.” And Luwoye? “Been a fan since seeing him in a workshop of Invisible Thread! Tremendous talent, AWESOME Hamilton!”Miranda has suggested he will return to the part of Hamilton in the future, saying: “I think this is a role I’m going to be going back to again and again.”Hamilton will be coming to the UK next year, and is scheduled to open at the Victoria Palace theatre, in London’s West End, in October 2017.
