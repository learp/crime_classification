HotDocs – the Australian edition of North America’s largest documentary festival, which has been held in Canada for 23 years – has announced its inaugural program of films, a curated selection that will show in Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney from 14 June.Jim: The James Foley Story review - simplistic but powerful look at journalistic bravery The Australian festival’s 24 documentaries cover a wide range of topics from sports to the arts, journalism, politics and female empowerment, and include explorations of medical marijuana, corruption in China and a profile of the US photojournalist James Foley, who was kidnapped in Syria and killed on camera by Islamic State.Its artistic director, Richard Moore, said hotDocs will be the country’s first major film festival dedicated solely to documentaries, sitting alongside some state-based documentary festivals including Antenna (New South Wales), the Australian International Documentary Conference (Melbourne), and Stranger than Fiction (Australian Capital Territory).Many of the documentaries will be of high interest to Australian audiences, Moore said. “These stories are happening now: the women in Gulistan, Land of Roses are fighting Isis today. The corruption taking place in The Road is a reality for anyone doing business, or thinking about doing business, in China today.”Other festival highlights include Diving into the Unknown, which captures underwater tragedy in Pluaden, Norway; a look inside the first girls’ school in a small Afghan village (What Tomorrow Brings); a film following attempts to create a sexually inclusive Moulin Rouge in Sweden (The Sex Temple); and a movie that captures the world of the Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin, Mr Gaga.

There are hundreds of stories out there and hundreds of people armed with brains, a keen eye and equipment to capture them. “My interest, as an ex-doco maker, is finding ways to get these stories on a big screen in front of a live audience, and I hope that hotDocs at Palace Cinemas provides another real opportunity to do just that.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Gulistan, Land of Rose looks at a brigade of female Kurdish guerrillas fighting Islamic State.
