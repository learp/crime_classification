It was 3.30am on Monday morning when 13 people, one dressed as a polar bear, cut through the wire at Heathrow airport and chained themselves to its northern runway. The runway’s three-hour closure has resulted in 13 cancelled flights, around 1% of the airport’s daily landings and departures. Direct action group Plane Stupid said its protest aims to highlight “the terrifying consequences of flying”, by bringing climate change back into the debate on airport expansion in the UK. It was reignited two weeks ago when the Airports Commission published its “clear and unanimous” recommendation for a £17bn expansion plan, including a third runway, at Heathrow. As debates go, it’s not new. In the 12 years since then transport secretary Alistair Darling first published a white paper calling for a third runway at Heathrow, the resulting deliberations have paid witness to demonstrations on the rooftop of the House of Parliament, clashes with police, a manifesto promise and a high court battle. Opponents to the plan have not lacked for high-profile supporters.The London mayor, Boris Johnson – who has championed an alternative hub in the Thames Estuary – immediately dismissed the recommendation, claiming that “I don’t think my services as a bulldozer blocker will be required for decades, if ever, because I don’t think it’s going to happen.” Zac Goldsmith a West London Tory MP now himself running for London mayor, criticised the commission for spending “vast sums of taxpayer money subsidising the creation of a huge foreign-owned monopoly”.It’s been six years since David Cameron uttered the words chanted by the protesters strapped to the tarmac on Monday: “No ifs, not buts, no third runway at Heathrow”. Having ruled out a third runway as part of his 2010 manifesto, the commission’s recommendation now leaves the prime minister in a difficult position. In the years that have passed, climate change has slipped quietly out of the debate, says Leo Murray, co-founder of Plane Stupid and A Free Ride, which campaigns for “a fairer, green tax on air travel”. Opposition has instead been focused on the concerns of local residents. Climate change has been markedly absent from Goldsmith’s recent vocal protestations against the runway, with him citing noise and air pollution and the resulting investment he says would be required for surface transport links for his opposition.The commission says that a fully utilised third runway is compatible with climate change reduction targets and that “the environmental costs are borne by the (relatively) few” in comparison to the many who will benefit economically from expansion. Aviation consultant John Strickland says: “At the end of the day aviation is a core part of 21st-century economy life and it is doing its very best in terms of the reductions of emissions. The airline industry is investing millions in efficient fuel and engines. It is an ongoing process.”The commission profiles a raft of measures to appease the local community, including a ban on night flights from 11.30pm to 6am, a noise levy on airport users, a pending legal commitment on air quality and training and apprenticeships for local people. But Murray says the absence of climate change in the debate is not only down to those lobbying in favour of expansion but by a lack of focus among green groups.“Everybody has taken their eyes off the ball. When they scrapped the policy everybody stopped working on it. There was no policy to campaign on – nothing to oppose,” he told the Guardian.The story of this shifting debate is perhaps symbolised in the land itself, part of which was purchased by Greenpeace at the height of their anti-Heathrow campaign. Actor Emma Thompson, the comic Alistair McGowan andGoldsmith all bought some and persuaded 100,000 members of the public to join them. Both Cameron and Nick Clegg had trees planted for them.But in 2012, the land was quietly – and voluntarily – sold back to the landlord for £1. The trees soon after died. Land bought by Greenpeace to defy Heathrow expansion quietly sold for £1 Murray says that although “one protest won’t be enough to refocus this debate on climate”, the recommendation by the Davies Commission is starting to shift the debate back again, giving protesters something to oppose. Since it was published, Friends of the Earth have already launched a new campaign against airport expansion. “Heathrow is a test of the UK’s resolve on tackling climate change,” says Murray. “If we are then we don’t build another runway at Heathrow - or anywhere else. It’s as simple as that.”
