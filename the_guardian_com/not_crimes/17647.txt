8.57pm BST20:57And that’s it for the liveblog this evening!We’ll be back at noon tomorrow. Join us then for the big day! And to bid adieu, here’s a picture of some people dressed for Where’s Wally?

And there he saw Corinne Bailey Rae! With the late evening sun penetrating the fringes of the rammed Avalon tent, Corinne Bailey Rae’s soulful vibes provide an uplifting delight, but a calming one. When she says “A lot of us feel the country isn’t going in the direction we want it to, but we are the people and people have the power,” the reaction is muted. By now at the festival, people are looking for simple good times, no less and no more.”Updatedat 9.51pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.50pm BST20:50A proper pop goddess  Ronnie Spector … Pictured in concert in London. Photograph: Andy Hall for the ObserverCraille Maguire Gillies popped up to the Park stage to have a look at Ronnie Spector: ‘Don’t leave me baby. Don’t tell me it’s over, Ronnie Spector sings with something like a smile. ‘You said you loved me … I’m going to miss your loving arms.’ Who knows if she had the Brexit in mind, but the former Ronette had already lulled everyone at the Park stage into something like carefree joy. No one was letting anything burst their little bubble of rollicking, nostalgia-tinged bounce. ‘Look,’ Spector said, peering out from the stage at the sky, ‘the sun came out just for me.’”Updatedat 8.52pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.44pm BST20:44Why do Foals fall in love?  Jack Bevan and Yannis Philippakis of Foals. Photograph: Yui Mok/PAHarriet Gibsone has been in front of the Pyramid stage, where she’s been feeling a little horse. (Here all week, try the lamb). And this is what she’s been thinking about the whole experience: It’s a burly beginning to Foals’ Pyramid stage set – a sturdy metal assault starts the show, before the groovy, aquatic funk of Olympic Airways bleeds beautifully amid the sunset. With so much fury loaded in their music you’d assume some type of political statement would be inevitable – and yet we’re told to “forget about all that stuff” and have a good time (we’re not ones to speculate but it’s worth noting frontman Yannis Philippakis had previously shared his concerns regarding Britain remaining in the EU). Perhaps what’s most exciting about tonight’s performance is the prospect that Foals could be one of the few contemporary bands to ascend; their status as potential Glastonbury headliners seems very possible given the vast and adoring audience tonight. While lacking in warmth and showmanship, their set is full of brilliantly danceable, anthemic hits during which the audience know each and every word. Tonight the Oxford band provide an indie disco on the grandest of scales.”Updatedat 9.57pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.40pm BST20:40Did they survive?Disaster for one unlucky punter, sucked into a sinkhole.

Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty ImagesSheffield’s foremost practitioners of grinding noise, Bring Me the Horizon, are currently rocking the Other stage. Kate Hutchinson is there, on the grounds that she was nu-metal fan, and sends us these words STRAIGHT FROM THE FRONTLINE: The Sheffield metallers pummel out a refreshing, thrashing wall of riffage. Frontman Oli Sykes, mouth bleeding, is impressed with the turnout: ‘And here was me thinking Glastonbury was a bunch of fucking shite,’ he yelps.”I saw Bring Me the Horizon at a festival in Johannesburg a few years back. They followed a band singing in Afrikaans about the fatherland. Which was unnerving.Updatedat 8.23pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.46pm BST19:46Later tonight!The Pyramid stage headliners tonight are Muse. We are currently running a book in the Guardian cabin on whether or not Matt Bellamy will be passing comment on the referendum result. The big money is on him saying: “Fucking get in! Free from the Euro lizard overlords at last!” Alexis Petridis will be reviewing the headline set and offering his thoughts shortly after Teignmouth’s premier sci-fi conspiracy theorists finish their work. While you ponder that, here’s a lesson from the Ken Tamplin vocal academy on how to sing like Matt Bellamy.Updatedat 7.51pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.42pm BST19:42It’s hard to disagreeThere are flags.

Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty ImagesGwilym Mumford has been to Pyramid stage to see the grizzled veterans of the Texas boogie … Skepta this ain’t, but ZZ Top’s somewhat more mature audience seem to be having at least as much fun as the lads in the moshpit earlier today. The dress code of bandanas and – yep – novelty beards is scrupulously adhered to and the mood is buoyant as zer Top rattle through the classics: Sharp Dressed Man, Foxy Lady et al. “Is everybody having a good time?” Billy Gibbons yelps. In truth it was a question that barely needed asking.Updatedat 7.47pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
