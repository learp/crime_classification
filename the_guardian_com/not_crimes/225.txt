With the historic People’s Climate March taking place in cities around the world last year, the landmark US-China deal, as well as record carbon-dioxide levels and the hottest year on record, awareness of the potential devastation of climate change continues to grow. Now, even the Pope has spoken about it – and yet, public concern over the issue remains low.There once was a time when climate change was very popular to discuss. Al Gore made that movie, Leonardo DiCaprio snuggled polar bears, there was a potential green economy and even dumb ol’ Congress debated carbon cap and trade. Then, somewhere along the way, our focus shifted to a crap economy, fighting terrorists and the government seeing our dick pics.So climate change took the back burner as people had more important things to worry about. And who could blame them? Frankly, if you do believe in the realities of climate change, the future seems pretty scary. Of course, if you don’t – well, your life is probably great!Global warming is totally a lie liberals tell to distract us from their commie agendas | Bonnie McFarlane The worst part about climate change is the longer we don’t do anything about it, the more likely it is to be as bad as scientists say. We’re at the point in human history when our population is rapidly expanding and our resources are being exhausted. And as the science continues to show, burning fossil fuels and filling the atmosphere with chemicals is still a horrible idea. The only glimmer of hope is that if we all start making better choices as a species, the worst parts of climate change could be avoided.It’s naturally hard to see that glimmer of hope behind the giant shroud of depressing facts, so maybe it’s time to make the facts a little less depressing. A fantastic way to do this is with humor (or as some of you call it, “humour”). By interjecting some ‘funny’ into the climate change debate, we can prove the science true, make fun of its objectors and make it easier to understand at such an imperative time. Because while the battle to save our planet must be won with action, we need to make the topic of climate change more approachable for people to take that action – and humor is a pretty good tool.Luckily, people are embracing the potential of the funny for communicating about climate change. On The Daily Show last year, Jon Stewart took aim at the idea that global warming is a hoax.Jon Stewart’s diatribe on climate deniers on The Daily Show last year.Meanwhile, Stephen Colbert discussed a UN climate change report on The Colbert Report.Worth saving: landscapes we don't want to lose to climate change Stephen Colbert discusses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, as well as an ExxonMobil forecast calling government action on climate change “highly unlikely”.John Oliver held a debate about the issue featuring three deniers versus Bill Nye and 96 other scientists on Last Week Tonight.

But if we want more people to care, it’s got to be all over the internet, it’s got to be interesting and it’s got to be funny.
