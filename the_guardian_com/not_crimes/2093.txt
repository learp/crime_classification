Anthony Vaccarello has been named as the creative director of Saint Laurent, confirming what had been suspected with the fashion industry. He was widely expected to replace Hedi Slimane, who left the house on Friday. In a statement, Francesca Bellettini, president and CEO of Saint Laurent, praised Vaccarello’s “modern, pure aesthetic … Anthony Vaccarello impeccably balances elements of provocative femininity and sharp masculinity in his silhouettes.”Vaccarello, a 33-year-old Belgian-Italian, is a logical successor to Slimane. Like the French designer, he has a penchant for rock-inspired glamour. If Slimane’s comes through the prism of youth culture – with babydoll shapes and punky tiaras – Vaccarello’s is slicker and more grown-up. His last eponymous collection was largely black, with skinny trousers, short skirts, blazers and high heels dominating. The Versus collection had a hipper vibe with slouchy outerwear and camisoles.Hedi Slimane announces his exit from Saint Laurent Vaccarello might not be a household name as yet, but his rise – largely due to a confident, distinct aesthetic – has been swift. He began showing his own label in 2011. He started working with Versus Versace in 2013, with a capsule collection, and became creative director last year. He was early on the see-now-buy-now trend, with clothes on catwalk at the Versus Versace September show available to buy immediately afterwards.Versus Versace is fast becoming a finishing school for talent to come through before moving on to further success. Christopher Kane and JW Anderson have both worked with the brand. Donatella acknowledged this in her statement. “Their time on Versus Versace led to them making a huge advancement in their design career,” she said. “I’m proud that Versus can be such a remarkable global platform for emerging design talent.”This position for Vaccarello may be the highest that a Versus alumni has attained. Slimane’s four years at Saint Laurent brought huge commercial success for the house. Revenue grew from around £282m in 2011 to £564m in 2014. Vaccarello’s challenge is to put his mark on the brand while keeping the fanbase Slimane has developed.
