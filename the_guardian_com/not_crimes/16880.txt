Kevin Costner is suing a Chinese production company for allegedly using his name to help sell a film and then removing him from the project without paying him.According to the Hollywood Reporter, Costner says Kylin Pictures signed a contract with his Treehouse Films production company to produce and rewrite the screenplay for a film called Shanghai Sojourners. The suit claims that under the terms of the contract, Costner and fellow producer Armyan Bernstein would receive $3m, and their production companies, Treehouse and Beacon Films, would receive a further $1m and a share of profits from the film. Costner goes on to allege that during this year’s Shanghai film festival, Kylin attracted investment in the film as a result of promoting Costner and Bernstein’s involvement.The suit says that Kylin had already decided it did not want Costner, Treehouse, Bernstein or Beacon involved in the movie by the beginning of the festival, on 12 June, but did not tell them until 29 August.Costner also says he had already rewritten some of the screenplay, but was not paid for his work, other than an initial $150,000 fee.The lawsuit for fraud, breach of contract and goods and services rendered, which can be seen here, was filed in Los Angeles county superior court.Kylin describes Shanghai Sojourners as a second world war film. “While Shanghai was under control by Japanese forces,” a description on their website reads, “a young Chinese woman falls in love with a young Jewish man exiled from his home in Europe. Together, they plot his escape from China before the Nazi movement implements their ‘final solution’.”Kylin Pictures has not responded to a request for comment, but told the Hollywood Reporter it was “unable to discuss the matter at this time, although we will be happy to make a statement once the suit has concluded”.
