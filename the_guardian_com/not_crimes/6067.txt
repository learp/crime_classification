Certain activities may spring to mind when you think of stag parties: paintballing, pub crawls and heady weekends away in Europe.But these celebrations aren’t for everyone. A new study suggests that men do not enjoy some of the characteristics of modern stag dos, which can include “extreme shaming, humiliation, and deviance”.Men do not enjoy debauchery of stag dos, study finds The study was carried out by Daniel Briggs from Madrid University and Anthony Ellis of Salford University, and published in the journal Deviant Behavior. This suggests that men often succumb to peer pressure during stag nights, taking part in activities they aren’t always comfortable with, leaving them feeling degraded and scared.The researchers recorded the story of one man who during a weekend in Europe became separated from his party and spent a harrowing evening trying to find them. He called the best man for help, saying: “I’m genuinely fucking scared mate. I do not know what has happened to me in the last few hours.”Do you feel the same about stag parties? Have you felt pressured to take part in activities or behaviour you didn’t enjoy? Or perhaps you enjoy the fact they can be debauched? Did you organise an alternative event? And are there any other primarily male events and activities where the atmosphere makes you feel uncomfortable, or forced into a role that doesn’t feel natural to you?Share your views by filling in the form below.
