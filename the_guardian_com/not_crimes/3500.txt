The director of Star Wars: The Force Awakens has said it was a “nightmare” to think of people watching the big-screen sci-fi adventure on a mobile phone. “Anyone who makes movies will say: ‘Please don’t watch my movies on that,’” JJ Abrams, told a seminar at the South by Southwest film festival in Austin.Mark Hamill: Luke Skywalker could be gay  “It is the nightmare of every storyteller that people are going to watch something you made on something so small,” he said, adding it was inevitable that people would find it more convenient to watch the movie on a handheld device.The Force Awakens is the third-highest grossing film ever worldwide. It was made for about $200m and has taken in more than $2bn globally. It will be released on iTunes on 1 April. Abrams, who produced the indie sci-fi film 10 Cloverfield Lane, which grossed $25m over the weekend, said one of the benefits of the proliferation of smartphones was that anyone could make and distribute movies. He also said the outcry about the lack of diversity in this year’s Academy Award nominations served as a wake-up call for the industry and led his production company, Bad Robot, to broaden its list of candidates for films. He said it would take time but be good for the bottom line in the long run to have more unique stories being told. “This is about opportunity to give people who might not be the usual suspects a chance in front of, and behind the camera,” he said. “There is no quota. It’s simply about consideration.”
