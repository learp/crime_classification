Now it’s autumnand another year in which I could leave youis a slowly sinking ship.The air has developed edgesand I am preparing to let myself liein a curtained apartment,safe in the knowledge that strangershave ceased to gather and laughin the lane belowand the brazen meadow no longerpresumes to press its face to the windowlike an inquisitor.Soon even the river will evince a thicker skin,my breath each morning will flower white,and all of summer’s schemes will fly like cuckoos.The leaves are turning and the treesare shaking them off. Bonfire smokebetween us like a promise lingers.• From The Met Office Advises Caution (Carcanet, £9.99). To order a copy for £8.19 go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
