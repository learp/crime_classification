The number of people tweeting social and political banter from Africa has exploded in the past three years, sprouting a subculture with its own set of rules. Of 1.6bn geo-located tweets posted last year, Egyptians sent the most and Nigerians came second, with South Africa, Kenya and Ghana in third, fourth and fifth, according to a study by Portland Communications. #NigeriaDecides, which tracked the Nigerian election, was the most popular hashtag.But the real rules of the ‚ÄúAfrican internet‚Äù are not drawn up during times of political discourse but emerge from jokes and memes. Here is an etiquette guide to get you through.Always defend your country  If you are an African online you will, at one stage, be called upon to defend your country on Twitter. It is a duty and an honour that requires you to congregate at the hashtag. Never ask how it started and offer defence first, questions later. If you have a Twitter account, you have already been conscripted. #SomeonetellNigeria vs #SomeonetellKenya provides a helpful example of how quickly one might kick off. In 2013, a Kenyan sports journalist complained that his national football team were being poorly treated in Nigeria.Then someone suggested starting a Twitter war, using #SomeonetellNigeria, and succeeded. Aspiring Sponsor (@kmaore)Kenyans should start #SomeonetellNigeria due to the way they are treating our stars!March 20, 2013Janus Fayce (@JFayce)@kmaore you realise u started war, right? Good one.might need #TwitterICC & #TwitterGuantanamobay #SomeonetellNigeria #SomeonetellKenyaMarch 21, 2013Despite getting royally burned, Nigerians still galvanised against Ghana last year. The #GhanavsNigeria battle was initially triggered by Nigerians apparently dissing their west African neighbours over their complexion.BiGxGh.Com (@bigxghdotcom)Nigerians are always saying Ghanaians are dark, as if being dark skin as an African is wrong ... #GhanavsNaijaAugust 11, 2015The call to arms could come at any time and whether it‚Äôs about football, complexion or jollof rice you must always defend your country ‚Äì and a meme inferring national pride is usually your best weapon.Pan-African camaraderieAt other times Africa online knows no borders. Many issues are pan-African, and the camaraderie that exists from a common history preceding colonialism means there is a lot of shared wisdom to be found. A good place to start is #AfricanProverbs, bringing biblical advice to the modern age.
