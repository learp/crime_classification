A second UK member of the Greenpeace crew arrested by the Russian authorities during a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic has been denied bail.Frank Hewetson was seized with 27 other activists and two journalists on the Greenpeace ship the Arctic Sunrise last month.His partner, Nina Gold, said: "Frank has now spent three weeks locked up thousands of miles away from his family. He is accused of an absurd crime which clearly none of the Arctic 30 are guilty of committing."The only thing he is guilty of is participating in an entirely peaceful protest to raise awareness of a cause that he passionately believes in â€“ protecting the planet and the fragile wilderness of the Arctic."He has two teenage children back home who miss him terribly, and not knowing when we'll be able to see him again is agony."John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: "The court's refusal to grant bail to Frank Hewetson flies in the face of all logic. Frank, like the other 29 being held, presents no threat to Russia and should be allowed to return home."Greenpeace has offered sureties that will guarantee the return of all of those charged for any future court case. This is looking a lot like punishment before conviction."Videographer Kieron Bryan, from Devon, was also denied bail at an earlier hearing.
