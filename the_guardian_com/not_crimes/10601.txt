Jay Z has expressed his delight at becoming the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, saying: “This is a win for us. I remember when rap was said to be a fad. We are now alongside some of the greatest writers in history.”Jay Z’s induction, which will take place at a ceremony in June in New York, was announced on US TV on Wednesday by Nile Rodgers of Chic. Rodgers suggested that it had taken so long to induct Jay Z because, “even though he’s had more pop albums than anyone else … he did it through rap”.Rodgers said Jay Z’s induction was “massive. He has changed the way that we listen to music. He’s changed the way that we have fun.”Jay Z’s fellow inductees for 2017 are Max Martin, the Swedish songwriter and super-producer who has dominated worldwide pop charts for 20 years, Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds, Berry Gordy, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and three members of Chicago – Robert Lamm, James Pankow and Peter Cetera.“With our 2017 roster of inductees, the Songwriters Hall of Fame moves definitively into recognising music creators of the 21st century while continuing to honour the greats of earlier decades,” said SHOF co-chairs Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff – the masterminds behind the Philly soul sound – and president Linda Moran. “The songwriters we honour cross genres, regional and even national boundaries. We are thrilled to once more have the opportunity to preside over an event that recognises the convergence of songcraft and musical performance at the very highest level.” However, in an interview with the New York Times, Moran noted it had been a struggle to get Jay Z inducted. “To be honest with you, last year we talked about it a lot,” she said. “Our board and community wasn’t ready. This year we felt that they had been educated enough.” She added that Jay Z was “so over the moon” about the induction. She added: “He was flipping out, he was going crazy.”
