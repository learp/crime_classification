Champagne drinkers in Britain face higher prices in the next year as the impact of the Brexit vote on the pound takes its toll, the drinks industry has warned.A “triple whammy” of Brexit, inflation and possible rising alcohol duty is forecast to push up the prices of champagne and prosecco in the UK by £1 and 59p per bottle respectively, the Wine and Spirit Trade Association has warned.Duty on a bottle of still wine in the UK is £2.08, meaning that 55% of the average-priced bottle goes on duty and VAT, while for sparkling wine drinkers duty is 28% higher than still wine. On Valentine’s Day UK couples sharing a bottle of sparkling wine including champagne will pay £2.67 in duty, compared with a couple in France who will spend slightly less than 6p. The UK is the biggest export market for French sparkling wine. Brexit's mixed bag: good for scotch, bad for washing machines Higher inflation, the impact of the pound’s devaluation and the potential for duty increases could be devastating for the wine industry in the coming year, the WSTA says. It predicts that the cost of an average-priced bottle of champagne will go up by 5%, or £1 per bottle, while a bottle of sparkling wine will go up by 9% – adding another 59p per bottle. An average-priced bottle of still wine sold in the UK could go up by 10%, equating to an additional 53p per bottle.“With Brexit costing 29p per bottle and rising inflation indicated by the Bank of England last week adding a further 17p, further duty rises could make it a triple whammy for consumers who are already paying a staggering amount of wine and spirit duty,” said Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association.The WSTA is urging the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to make a 2% duty cut in his budget next month.In 2016 Brits bought more than 131m bottles of fizz from UK shops and supermarkets – up 13% on the previous year. Some of the country’s biggest supermarkets, including Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Waitrose and Morrisons, triggered a price war by applying deep discounts.
