The Queensland opposition has urged the government to resist a scheme to cut marine wildlife deaths by restricting plastic bag use because they say it will raise the cost of living.The environment minister, Steven Miles, raised the issue of plastic waste causing deaths in turtles on Monday, World Oceans Day, while highlighting the government’s establishment of an advisory group on ways to tackle the litter issue.Miles said turtles were particularly vulnerable, with 940 being stranded on Queensland beaches last year, nearly half in Moreton Bay near Brisbane.A recent environment department survey found more than 40% of small turtles passing through the bay – and more than 70% of endangered loggerhead turtles – had ingested plastic.Miles said Brisbane’s litter was putting turtles at risk, the plastic causing “blockages in their digestive system, leaving them unable to feed and facing a slow and painful death”. “The terrible toll on marine life is one of the reasons the Queensland government is looking at a possible restrictions on single use plastic bags,” Miles said.An advisory group will report back after consulting with the public on plastic bag use and a separate container deposit scheme later this year.However, the deputy opposition leader, John-Paul Langbroek, said jobs and the effect on consumers ought to take priority for the government. “We are concerned whether these are measures that might lead to increased cost of living for Queenslanders,” Langbroek said. “It’s really important that Labor get with the other things that Queenslanders would like to see and that is a plan for jobs.”
