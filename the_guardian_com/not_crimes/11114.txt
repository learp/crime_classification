Channel 5 has been accused of exploiting David Bowie’s death for ratings after Celebrity Big Brother aired “tawdry” scenes of housemates screaming at each other following a misunderstanding over who had actually died.Media regulator Ofcom confirmed on Wednesday morning that it has now received more than 200 complaints about the show’s coverage of the death of Bowie. The star’s former wife Angie is one of the contestants.The latest farcical scenes were sparked after US TV reality star Tiffany Pollard went into hysterics after Angie Bowie told her that “David” was dead.Pollard thought the singer’s ex-wife meant fellow housemate David Gest and she went on to tell other contestants that Gest had died, not Bowie.Pollard, who discovered Gest was alive and in bed, then started screaming about the grieving Angie Bowie, accusing her of being “sick”.As a result of the chaos, the show saw its ratings jump from 2.1 million on Monday night, to 2.4 million on Tuesday night, the highest audience for the series so far. It launched with 2.1 million and the eviction on Friday was watched by just 1.9 million.Celebrity Big Brother viewers criticise C5 for showing Angie Bowie crying But some viewers were upset by the scenes, which ran at length during the highlights show, broadcast between 9pm and 10pm.One viewer wrote: “Big Brother, absolute tasteless tonight, using the death of Bowie for viewing figures and publicity.”Another added: “Only Big Brother can turn the death of a global icon into a tawdry farce.”Angie Bowie had earlier been told about her former husband’s death off-camera and decided to stay on the show. She told Gest and actor John Partridge about the news when she returned to the house.After Pollard noticed she was upset, Angie Bowie, who was married to the star for 10 years, then told her the news. When Gest was found to be alive, although feeling a little unwell in his bed, a backlash against Angie Bowie began, with housemates thinking she had been making a twisted joke. This led to uncomfortable scenes of a grieving woman being yelled at by other contestants.Angie Bowie had told Pollard: “You gotta do me a favour, you can’t say a word. David’s dead.”When Angie Bowie took retreat from the mayhem in the diary room, she confided: “It’s a mess. It’s a comedy of errors.”She then added: “I forgot that she screams and she just started screaming and she thought it was David Gest and then she thought it was a joke … She didn’t know who I was talking about.”The beginning of the programme contained a warning: “Be prepared for intense scenes of emotional distress, very aggressive confrontations, entirely offensive language right from the very start and constantly throughout adult and sexual themes.”Ofcom said it has received 208 complaints related to Big Brother’s coverage of David Bowie’s death.It is understood that more than 150 of the complaints have been about how it was bad taste to have shown Angie Bowie grieving on camera and also that the show was “making entertainment” out of the confusion about who had died. Angie Bowie had been show weeping after hearing about the death of David Bowie, saying it reminded her of her mother’s death.More than 40 complaints objected to what they regarded as the “bullying” of Pollard after her misunderstanding. A further 16 people objected to Pollard’s “hysterical” reaction and aggression over who had actually died.A spokesman said the regulator would “assess these complaints before deciding whether to investigate or not”.
