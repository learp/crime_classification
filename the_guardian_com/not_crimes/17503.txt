All4Son Of A B****Timed to coincide with the start of Euro 2016, Walter Presents’ latest import is a Brazilian comedy tackling the less attractive side of the beautiful game. Son Of A B**** follows referee Juarez Gomes da Silva, who has designs on officiating the World Cup final, but whose sordid personal life threatens to spill on to the pitch. Enjoyably bawdy, it makes for a salacious double bill with Walter Presents’ other Brazilian acquisition, the excellent porn-industry drama Magnifica 70. Available from FridayBBC iPlayerExtra GearFollowing in the esteemed foosteps of er, Take Me Out and Big Brother, the revamped Top Gear has been given it’s own spinoff show.

Originally airing between 1984 and 1985, its adventures of astronauts piloting huge robots for interstellar dust-ups never found the same traction as Transformers. This re-imagining follows the same basic premise, and boasts Rhys Darby and The Walking Dead’s Steven Yeun among its vocal ranks. It’s also a Netflix partnership with DreamWorks, so superior quality animation can be assumed.Available from FridayBBC StoreTime TrumpetArmando Iannucci’s spoof nostalgia show – which saw talking heads including Adam Buxton, Stewart Lee and Richard Ayoade reminisce about the early 21st century from the year 2031 onwards – only aired for one series in 2006, but managed to create an entire alternate universe in that time. Fork out £5.99 at the BBC Store to look back on such seminal events as the war between Tesco and Denmark, and Sebastian Coe murdering Justin Lee Collins after learning the London Olympics were a hoax by the Friday Night Project.Available nowPodcastBowraville MurdersDescribed as Australia’s answer to Serial, this podcast, concerning the murders of three Aboriginal children 25 years ago, has had a similar impact to Sarah Koenig’s effort: as a result of public attention, the case has now been referred to court for a possible retrial.
