Oh God, will it ever not be funny? Will the Oscars catastrophe ever stop unfurling new petals of merriment to us, like a mysterious lotus flower that blooms eternally? Not if Warren Beatty’s sister has anything to do with it. Yes, days after the cock-up that amused the world, Lost in Showbiz is finally able to type the words it has been longing for: ENTER SHIRLEY MACLAINE.“I think we’re all processing the horror of it,” says Shirley with typical local understatement. “I’m still dealing with it. I’m concerned with how [Warren] must have felt, being so close to him. I’m three years older and I’m protective. We know how difficult it was for him, but it was also for me.” A reminder that we may never know the full tally of victims.Even so, any corporeal intervention from Shirley is always welcome – 93% of the time this Proper Celebrity is detained in another dimension, conveyed there by whichever fringe therapies she is currently espousing. Psychic surgery, radionics, a past-lives catchment area that stretches from the Ottoman empire to Atlantis – has anything prepared her for what happened in the Dolby theatre on Sunday? “I’m basically a mystic,” Shirley tells USA Today. “And I’m wondering what that was all about. And I am not sure yet. I’ll have to think about it some more.”It says something of the historical magnitude of the incident that there is nothing in Shirley’s vast repository of quackery to handle what went down when her little bro was flummoxed by the wrong envelope. Stay with this, because I’m just giving free voice to nagging energy currents in my aura, but is it perhaps explained by something Warren himself did in a past life? It certainly sits at odds with most of what he did in this life. Look: I love him and stuff, but Beatty’s behaviour as the mistake became clear is best described as persona-aborting. Admittedly, there’s often something rather narcissistically doomed about his characters. But honestly, half a career spent in wistful exultation of the ideals of Frank Capra, and what does he do when the chips are down? He pushes his way to the microphone and explains that this had nothing to do with him. He wasn’t trying to be funny; he gave it to Faye; it wasn’t him. It wasn’t him! Thanking you Warren. You’ve stood up and asked NOT to be counted.As for what happens next, who can say? Hollywood is a town that takes being made to look silly about as well as Kim Jong-Un does. The consequent show of strength could be horrifying, and you are advised to gird your loins accordingly.
