Dug’s tribe are shown to be an entirely hapless bunch who scupper Dug’s hunting expedition by causing too much noise. They later find themselves terrorised by a long-toothed bunny - a nod perhaps to Wallace & Gromit film The Curse of the Were-Rabbit.Early Man is directed by Aardman veteran Nick Park. Joining Redmayne and Hiddleston on the voice cast are Game Of Thrones star Maisie Williams, Timothy Spall, Richard Ayoade and Johnny Vegas. The film will be released in January 2018.
