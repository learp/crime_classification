The government is to investigate a council’s plans to turn some of its libraries into gyms with unstaffed book-lending sections, following a protest against the scheme – which won support from authors including Nick Hornby and Ali Smith.The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said it was treating objections to the Lambeth council plans as official complaints, the first stage in an investigation process that will determine if the south London authority has potentially breached the law.The 1964 Public Libraries and Museums Act compels councils to maintain a “comprehensive and efficient” libraries service, an obligation which several councils have fallen foul of amid severe central government spending cuts.According to a BBC analysis this month almost 350 libraries have closed over the past six years, with the loss of about 8,000 jobs.Lambeth, which is cutting its libraries budget by 25% amid greater reductions to other services, is moving or changing four of its current 10 libraries. Two of these will be closed for around a year and revamped as so-called healthy living centres, comprising privately run gyms with a section for books and computers. The council has yet to publish plans for these but confirms the new book sections will not have dedicated staff, something the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals has argued means it isn’t a library.One of the affected sites, the grade II-listed Carnegie library in Herne Hill, was occupied by a group of campaigners on 31 March, the day it was due to close. The occupation, which ended on Saturday, won the support of 220 writers and illustrators who signed a letter condemning Lambeth’s plans.Also among the signatories were Stella Duffy and Toby Litt, who organised the letter, David Mitchell, David Nicholls, Francesca Simon, Sandi Toksvig, Ian Rankin, Will Self and Val McDermid.Rezina (@RezinaChowdhury)Library occupation looks fun. Wonder what kids living in temporary accommodation in Lambeth will make of this. pic.twitter.com/4d6ZO17pz3April 2, 2016A DCMS spokeswoman said: “The department has received a number of representations concerning the changes made to Lambeth council’s library service provision. After careful consideration, these are being treated as formal complaints in accordance with the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964.”If the investigation finds the revised library service is insufficient the culture secretary, John Whittingdale, could intervene and order a local inquiry.Laura Swaffield, chair of the Friends of Lambeth Libraries, said the complaints to the DCMS also centred on a feared lack of space in remaining libraries.“They’ve only closed two libraries so far and the remaining libraries are absolutely packed out, with children queuing to use computers, people sitting on the floor,” she said. “And this will not improve in the future – when these buildings reopen as so-called libraries these will be without the capacity they have now.”Lambeth argues that handing part of the two libraries to social enterprise Greenwich Leisure Limited so they can be turned into gyms is the only way to ensure their survival. Jane Edbrooke, the Lambeth councillor whose brief covers libraries, said last week that there had been “thorough discussions with residents and community groups about Lambeth libraries both in public and at private meetings”. She added: “We understand that people are passionate about this issue, but it’s a simple fact: there is less money to go round, so savings have to be made.”Matthew Bennett (@CllrMattBennett)While they knock back wine in the library, almost 5000 homeless Lambeth children go to bed in temp accommodation... https://t.co/DjjLrVLWtCApril 2, 2016Opponents, however, argue that the gym option was not included in public consultations and that the council has yet to produce any public plans on how the health centres will fit into the buildings. Already heated emotions were stoked by a few slightly intemperate tweets from councillors while the occupation was taking place, including one mocking those in the library for drinking wine donated by locals with a meal.
