BBC1’s The Voice UK continued its climb back on Saturday night from one of its worst starts in years, adding 300,000 viewers over last week to draw an audience of 6.9 million on Saturday.The rise in ratings gave the show, which will move to ITV next year, a 32% share of all viewing, and took its ratings close to the 7.1 million who tuned into the debut on 9 January, which was one of the show’s worst opening nights for years.Call the Midwife also scored a hit for BBC1 on Sunday, pulling in 7.6 million viewers and more than 30% of the total audience. The third episode of the fifth series was down slightly on last week and the almost 8 million who tuned in for the series opener, but was comfortably the most-watched drama show of the weekend, beaten only by Countryfile.However, the gore and guts of the Napoleonic wars and a dose of full-frontal nudity failed to boost the channel’s War and Peace, with 5.1 million viewers tuning in on Sunday night, giving it just under 22% of the total audience.More than 1 million viewers have stopped tuning in since the show’s premiere on the first weekend of the year. It was just beaten by Vera, ITV’s detective series starring Brenda Blethyn, which brought in 5.4 million viewers once viewing on the ITV +1 channel was included. The return of Channel 4’s celebrity reality series The Jump drew an average of 2.3 million viewers, down 500,000 from the 2015.The winter sports reality show, which features celebrities including former Superman actor Dean Cain, Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding and Olympian Linford Christie, managed a 9.5% share of total TV viewing between 7.30pm and 9pm.Viewing was well down on the 2015 series opener, which drew a healthy 2.8 million viewers, and the 2.6 million that tuned in for first series debut in 2014. The Davina McCall-fronted show was up against tough competition from BBC1’s Call the Midwife and ITV’s Vera.
