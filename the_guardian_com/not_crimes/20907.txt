Look out next week for webchats with Louis Theroux and Underworld, announced in the coming days.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.42pm BST14:42On austerity: 'We are being silenced and erased'RaoulChateaubriand asks:I worry what long-term effects (as well as short-term) the austerity policies of this government will have on the wellbeing of the nation. Things like the arts seem to be relegated more than ever. I would be interested to hear your take on what effect you think all this might be having on today’s poets and on the poets of the future.  Guardian contributor SimonArmitage 04 May 2016 2:41pmI worry about that too. A lot. The museums and libraries in the valleys around the West Riding are being closed or handed over to volunteers because of lack of funding, and the local structures - physical and otherwise - are being left to rot. Our cultural venues and proud public buildings are not treasure houses and tourist attractions as they are in some of the big cities, but storehouses of identity and community and belonging. Someone earlier in the day asked me what makes me passionate - I feel passionate about this. I feel as if by taking away those institutions our inheritance is being closed down and we are being silenced and erased.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.37pm BST14:37PurpleShark asks:Walking Home is an inspirational read and audiobook. What are the plans for recording more of your work i.e. All Points North (please!), Seeing Stars (again yes please!). Subject to no dodgy back (and a good supply of diclofenac) when is the next walk? (Keen to join the taxomomy of fellow hikers!)  Guardian contributor SimonArmitage 04 May 2016 2:36pmThere was a plan to record Walking Away but in the end I couldn't bear to sit in a small sound-proofed room for three days listening to the sound of my own voice. They were threatening to find someone else to read it... maybe one of those other Simon Armitages - keep things simple.Updatedat 2.39pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.35pm BST14:35Throthelookingglass asks:How’s your dad Peter doing?

Photograph: RMAX/Getty Imagestom black asks:Does Oxbridge strangle UK culture?  Guardian contributor SimonArmitage 04 May 2016 2:32pmIn my view it definitely needs to work harder in admitting people from state schools. Everyone I’ve spoken to at Oxford (admittedly I’ve only been there six months) seems to want to do something about it but nobody appears to have a firm plan of action. To my mind it’s about recognising potential. Most applicants would seem to have the required qualifications (ie a clean sweep of top grades) but get filtered out at interview – why?Updatedat 2.35pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.32pm BST14:32'Morrissey gave me a look that would curdle milk'ewanbarr asks about Simon’s band:Did Morrissey ever tell you what he thinks of The Scaremongers? I remember that when you interviewed him for the Guardian a few years ago, you hid a CD in the book of poetry you gave him.  Guardian contributor SimonArmitage 04 May 2016 2:30pmThe look on his face as he turned to leave said it all. A look that would curdle milk, as they say. But it's nice to think of it blasting out of his car as he cruises the streets of LA with a Sinatra in the passenger seat.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.29pm BST14:29Siobhan007 asks:Dear Mr Armitage, I really liked your poem The Manhunt, and I wondered if you found it easy to write it from the point of view of the wife? Would you say that you are sending an anti-war message in your poetry, or concentrating more on the individual tragedies resulting from war, or both? Also, I’m intrigued by the title of this poem as it usually suggests something very aggressive, and yet here the wife’s attitude is very tentative. Could you say why you chose this title? Is it to suggest that the poor man is so badly hurt mentally and physically that even being close to his own wife is as difficult as being the object of a manhunt? Thank you.  Guardian contributor SimonArmitage 04 May 2016 2:28pmThe poem is taken from a film I made with director Brian Hill called The Not Dead, about war veteran suffering from PTSD. Eddie had served as a peace keeper in Bosnia and had struggled to reintegrate with life back at home. But I wanted a woman’s voice in the film, to speak from the perspective of someone dealing with those traumas, so I wrote the poem in the voice of Laura, Eddie’s wife, who narrates the journey of bullet that hit Eddie in the side of the face and finished up somewhere in his chest. The title comes from the idea that she is searching for her husband, the one she knew previously and was trying to rescue.Updatedat 2.40pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.25pm BST14:25Joe Bradbury asks:The sonnets in Book Of Matches are meant to be read in the same amount of time it would take for a match to be lit and burn out...Will cook’s matches do or will this ruin the overall rhythm and flow of the work?  Guardian contributor SimonArmitage 04 May 2016 2:25pmCook’s matches are best, especially if you’re a slow reader.

Is it in any way an attempt to give a voice to a Mumbai street-seller?  Guardian contributor SimonArmitage 04 May 2016 2:24pmI bought a balloon from a Mumbai street seller - it was an embarrassing act of patronage and it backfired. There's guilt in that poem.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.23pm BST14:23lordbasil asks:Simon, I was born & grew up in Marsden & am roughly the same age as you - I found it a magical place to inhabit as a young kid and it developed my love of the outdoors & the emotions it can stir within - what effect did this place have on you & did it inspire & influence your work?

One of my favourite poems by the way.  Guardian contributor SimonArmitage 04 May 2016 2:22pmI was. It never got better than that. Later on I became a wicket-keeper – more fun and more involving, but it insulated me from the physicality of the world by the thickness of the pimpled gloves and the wet chamois inners. Some of the old school stumpers reportedly slipped a slice of steak inside their gloves to soften the blows – highly tenderized after fifty overs I would have thought but I never tried it.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.21pm BST14:21GlobalViewpoint asks:What word rhymes with “Orange”?
