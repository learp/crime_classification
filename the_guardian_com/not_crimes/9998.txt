During our journey to the tip of the Lleyn Peninsula – the most westerly point in all north Wales – the landscape was softened by light mist. As we arrived both the hill behind us, known as Mynydd Mawr, and Bardsey Island opposite were topped with cloud. Flocks of chaffinches and skylarks sailed overhead veiled in grey, but we could track their westward passage by a downward drizzle of lark notes and the clear simple "spink" calls of the other birds. They are all autumn migrants, concentrated at this last terra firma by the Lleyn's geography, and it was a pleasure to see them. Yet, in truth, we were more excited by the presence of another bird, whose magnetic pull to this same singular place is deeper and unchanging. It is called the red-billed chough, but the last explosive syllable is name enough, and a human echo of the glorious raw, high, resounding sounds of these crow-related birds.Until the early modern period, choughs were found widely on most British coasts and upland areas, but the advance of arable farming triggered an inexorable retreat to the Celtic fringe. It is now largely a creature of western Wales and Ireland, of the Scottish isles and a few tors and cliffs in west Cornwall. Here, however, the choughs were in their element, planing through the soft light across the headland. They were also of their element. The birds may know nothing of the 580m-year-old rocks against which their plangent notes resound. They may know nothing even of their own habitat: that rare coastal heath, with its prostrate heathers and mats of gorse, interspersed with lawns of grass so springy they feel like deep-pile carpet. Yet the choughs are the genius loci of Uwchmynydd, while their curious voice, with all its wild, wind-flung resonances, is the signature music of this landscape.
