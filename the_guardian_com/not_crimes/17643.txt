In 1946, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis won the second world war, in this version anyway which is the opposite from what really happened. The Nazis conducted experiments in labs on concentration camp prisoners; this included fiddling around with genetics to create a new type of “human” and ended up creating a being who had the ability to shift from their physical appearance to the face of someone else. The Nazis’ adapted Yael.After Yael escapes the concentration camp she becomes part of the resistance to end Hitler’s reign as Chancellor in Germany. However after numerous assassination attempts the Fuher rarely attended public events so it complicates the situation. However, when Adele Wolfe wins the Axis Tour, a motorcycle race, she gets close enough to dance with Hitler at the Victor’s ball. An opportunity springs up for Yael and her team to complete the assassination: to steal Adele Wolfe’s identity. This book shows an amazing exploration of identity and how the world would have changed if the Nazis won the war, not to mention identity theft. The inner struggle Yael has with her ability of changing identities is paired with a heart-pounding plot, in an intricate web of mystery. However, Yael gets bundled with more than she bargained for when she is faced with the complications of being in an extremely competitive motor cycle race. The novel is full of love and back-stabbing, with a fast-paced plot.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
