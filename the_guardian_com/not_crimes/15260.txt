Charlize Theron is reuniting with the creative team behind the 2011 dark comedy Young Adult for a film about motherhood.Charlize Theron: five best moments According to Deadline, the screenwriter Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman – who also worked together on Juno – will collaborate once again with the Oscar-winning actor. Little is known about the project at this stage, other than the subject matter of parenting.While Young Adult received positive reviews, it failed to resonate with Oscar voters and made only $22m (£15.5m) worldwide. In his New York Times review, AO Scott called it a “brilliant, brave and breathtakingly cynical” film, while Roger Ebert praised it as a “fearless character study”.It’s a busy time for Theron. Having impressed with her performance in Mad Max: Fury Road, she’s playing the Evil Queen in the fantasy prequel The Huntsman: Winter’s War, which is released this week. She’s also heading to Cannes with the Sean Penn-directed drama The Last Face, and is currently filming spy thriller The Coldest City. She’s then set to star alongside David Oyelowo and Amanda Seyfried in American Express, in another spy thriller, The Gray Man, and possibly as a villain in Fast & Furious 8.The untitled Diablo Cody film will hopefully be a comeback for Reitman who, after breaking out with a string of successful films, has most recently made a double whammy of flops, with the melodrama Labor Day and the dark comedy Men, Women & Children. Similarly Cody, who won the best original screenplay Oscar for Juno, was most recently behind the Meryl Steep comedy Ricki and the Flash, which made only $40m worldwide and received mixed reviews. She is also working on a Barbie movie.
