Spoiler alert! Be careful with this review as it gives a bit of the plot away - read at your peril! The Parent Agency is an amazingly funny book, it’s about a boy called Barry who wished he had better parents and his wish magically comes true! Everybody believes there is only one world but Barry knows differently. While his parents are worried sick about him because he banged his head and was put in a coma, he is having fun checking off what he wishes his parents were like: rich, fit, famous and favouring him as the favourite child. But he soon finds out that his parents are the best in the entire world, as good as he can get. Poor or not. This is one of my favourite books and my favourite chapter is when Barry has the animal racing party with the Cool Parents. My favourite character is Ginny because she and her twin Kay annoy their brother by doing things you wouldn’t expect to be annoying. I rate this book 10/10 because it is hilarious and I didn’t want to put it down!Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
