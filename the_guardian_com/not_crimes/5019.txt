There is a moment of pure beauty in the first 20 minutes of the 2014 thriller John Wick (I watched it for the first time last week; it’s great): a man lifts a tiny beagle pup and places her on a makeshift bed. But it’s not just any pup – she is the Platonic ideal of a puppy. And it isn’t just any man – it is Keanu Reeves, who is perhaps the Platonic ideal of a movie star. He is certainly one of the loves of my cinematic life.Now 51, Reeves first came to my attention in the 1989 comedy drama Parenthood. His rueful delivery of the line, “You need a licence to catch a fish, but they’ll let any butt-reaming asshole be a father”, made me sit up and stare at him. And there’s a lot to look at: he’s a tall drink of water, with soulful eyes, a firm jawline (see Speed) and a warm smile (see Something’s Gotta Give). If I could, I’d take a nap in the depths of his voice (see everything).Reeves is somehow reassuring, with an enviably serene manner. This makes people see him as wooden, but I think it’s actually more about a man who likes to measure his movements; a movie star who understands space. I could write an essay about Keanu’s walk: rangy and relaxed, but precise; the gait of a man who never needs to hurry. It’s why I loved him in The Matrix: Keanu Reeves seems to know exactly where he’s going to end up.Why I love... Winona Ryder Some other things to love: his general eschewing of the Hollywood machine, his cliched male love of motorbikes, his acceptance of the weird “Sad Keanu” meme (based on a photo of Reeves eating a sandwich alone on a bench: just look it up). And the fact that he’s now shooting John Wick 2.
