Oversized sleevesOnce an afterthought, sleeves are the red carpet tweak of 2017. Owing, perhaps, to their one-size-fits-all quality, they feel like a way to snazz up an affordable outfit without much fuss. However, on the red carpet, mimicking the catwalk, they will doubtless be the power move of this coming awards season.Choose from fluted, cropped, bunched and oversized, and try anything from Marques’Almeida to Balmain. Sarah Jessica Parker, often a bellwether of future trends, chose cold-shoulder Vera Wang and a loose homage to the late Carrie Fisher (and indeed Hillary Clinton, an early adopter of this trend). Hailee Steinfeld also went cold-shouldered in a loose-sleeved lilac dress with half-sleeves. Drew Barrymore, meanwhile, wore a Bianca Jagger-esque batwinged dress by Filipino designer Monique Lhuillier. Sleeves. Likely to reappear at the Oscars.Frozen (the film and the weather)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Claire Foy, Gina Rodriguez and Anna Kendrick. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock/APInspired presumably by Frozen, or rather a sympathetic nod to those outside of LA being cold, icy shades of pink blue and silver dominated the Globes red carpet. The tones were feminine but provided sweet respite from the usual princess gowns that dominate awards season. There’s a lot to unpack with this theme, although metallics, shine and brassy tones were takeaways at the spring shows, chiefly Marques’Almeida, MM6 Maison Margiela, Christopher Kane and Versus. Here, given the mood of the US this month and the remonstrative tenor of the acceptance speeches – from Meryl Streep to Tom Hiddleston – it suggests the guests were also in reflective mood. Claire Foy went for safety and modesty in Erdem, while Gina Rodriguez’s waterfalling plunge dress by Naeem Khan evoked Marilyn Monroe’s go-to Travilla dress.

Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty ImagesThere’s always one rebel, he’s generally a man and generally, he’s an award winner: Donald Glover (who won a Globe for his FX show, Atlanta) wore a brown velvet suit by Gucci. Black tie usually means satin peak lapels, so the risk was twofold here and ordinarily this shouldn’t have worked. But it did, not least because it was not the obviously branded bright/embroidered Gucci from designer Alessandro Michele – but also because it was velvet: this season’s fabric (Gucci and Balenciaga for men, Valentino and Victoria Beckham for women).The meme hunter      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Miranda Kerr at the InStyle and Warner Bros Golden Globes After Party. Photograph: Cook/Variety/REX/ShutterstockSomehow not yet a meme, Miranda Kerr’s Angelina leg was a nice reminder that Hollywood glamour is as encouraging of flesh as it is of fabric and Tiffany. Kerr, of course, picked the wrong leg – Jolie has of course patented The Right Leg – but Kendall Jenner (who appeared later, in Paula Ke, at the NBCUniversal party) followed Jolie’s lead and showed her right thigh under her burnt orange dress. That all three women chose to do it in similar gowns suggests there is some sort of sartorial obligation if you’re wearing a strapless, long-line dress.Black and white       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Jonah Hill in Prada.

Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty ImagesA nostalgic colour scheme on one hand, on-trend on the other (Topshop Unique was all about zebra stripes, and monochrome was also a running theme in Jim Jarmusch’s Paterson), it suggests a polarised world or at least no grey area. Moreover, it’s versatile – see Jonah Hill zhoosh up his black tux with white trainers, or Janelle Monae in Armani Privé. That and it photographs well.
