The Guardian is taking command of the streaming station Beats 1 on Apple Music with the show Breaking Good, where special guests from the forefront of music will play tunes by artists they think are getting it really, really right now and zooming in on breaking music trends from around the world.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest In the third Breaking Good, Kate Hutchinson is joined by Joe Mount from Metronomy, and the Guardian’s head rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis. Joe is one of the current stars of idiosyncratic British indiepop. His band Metronomy have coupled danceable beats and angular melodies with 60s songwriting and 80s synths, which has propelled them into the massive stages of London’s Alexandra Palace and festival headline shows. Their 2011 album The English Riviera was nominated for the Mercury prize, while 2014’s Love Letters added Motown, psychedelia and baroque sounds, with a video for the title track directed by Michel Gondry.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest As the Guardian’s chief pop critic, Alexis Petridis is well placed to chew the musical fat with Mount. The pair discuss everything from the greatness of “the French Adele” Christine and the Queens and the French touch sound that spawned Daft Punk to the giants of 90s indie and the perks of emotional pop in a post-Drake world, plus there’s some exclusive Metronomy album news. Further music comes from former Let’s Wrestle main man Wesley Gonzalez, Erykah Badu favourites King, Soulwax side-project the Shitz, as well as from Guardian contributor Joe Muggs, with a primer on the resurgent British dance music genre, broken beat.Breaking Good is at 7pm GMT on Beats 1 on Apple Music, with shows at the same time every Saturday for the rest of March. All shows will be available on demand.
