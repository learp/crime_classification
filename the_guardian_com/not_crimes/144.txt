Samsung Electronics announced on Tuesday that it had signed “a final settlement” for workers who contracted cancer in its semiconductor plants, but a victims’ advocacy group said key issues remained unresolved.The deal, signed by the South Korean electronics company and two groups representing the victims and their families, aims to improve health and safety conditions at all Samsung’s plants.The parties agreed to establish an independent committee to conduct “a thorough inspection of Samsung’s facilities and release reports on any areas for improvement”, the company said.Samsung promises to compensate factory workers who suffered cancer Lawyers for the victims say 244 employees at Samsung’s chip and display plants developed rare diseases linked to hazardous conditions; 87 died.Samsung fought the claims for years but issued an apology in May 2014, and then set up a compensation fund last year.In its statement on Tuesday, the company thanked the mediation committee for its dedication to “making this final settlement possible.” “In the big picture, it is correct to say everything has now been settled,” a Samsung official said. “But Samsung remains open to talks as the agreements are put into practice.”However, Banolim – one of the groups representing the victims – said the matter was far from closed, arguing that Samsung’s apology and its fund had never been fully approved by all the victims’ families.“Samsung has refused to discuss the issues of apology and compensation with us,” Kwon Young-Eun, a member of the group, said. “We will continue to demand Samsung address these issues properly.”Samsung says it has given financial compensation to more than 100 of 150 applicants to its fund.
