Everything Kimmy Schmidt sees, it’s as if she’s seeing it for the first time – 15 years trapped in a bunker-cult will do that to a person. But when Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt returns for season two in April, she’ll be wonderfully familiar to her countless fans – and her world of candy-coated insanity shows no signs of change.Based on the season two trailer, which premieres here, Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) is headed for new adventures in work, love – and with a sketchy gutter Elmo who wants to do drugs and get her fellow molewomen pregnant. At the end of last season, things were up in the air for our heroine. She had travelled back to Indiana and helped put the Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne (Jon Hamm) behind bars, her boyfriend Dong (Ki Hong Lee) married another girl from their GED class for citizenship, and her boss, Mrs Voorhees (Jane Krakowski), left her wealthy husband and decided to move back home to South Dakota. Suddenly Kimmy was broken-hearted and out of a job.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Now, it seems, she finds gainful employment at a year-round Christmas store – her idea of heaven. Mrs Voorhees is back, and she has fallen in love with her dog masseuse, Douglas.From the looks of it, Kimmy is also going to try therapy (there should be layers and layers to unpeel there) and get a visit from Gretchen, the most conservative molewoman, who looks set to have a bit of Rumspringa in New York.  We don’t see much from Kimmy’s roommate Titus, though he does get to deliver a few bon mots and call everyone’s favourite cult survivor “Kimbecile”. He doesn’t reprise his hit song Peeno Noir, though Kimmy launches into a few bars of a new song called Bunny and Kitty, which might be the show’s second breakout dance single. #Bunny and Kitty, being best friends, together forever, the fun never ends, solving mysteries one hug at a time, Bunny and Kitty, two of a kind ...#The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt season two is on Netflix from 15 April
