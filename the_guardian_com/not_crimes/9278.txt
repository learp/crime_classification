Alex Salmond has been warned that his government has no clear plan to find the £11bn likely to be needed to meet a target to cut Scotland's CO2 emissions by 42% in less than a decade.A study by Audit Scotland, the spending watchdog, said it remained unclear how the public sector would find the money at a time of "intense pressure" on spending.It highlighted the Scottish government's particular failure to cut transport emissions since 1990. Roads, rail and shipping now pump out more than a quarter of Scotland's overall emissions, compared to less than a fifth 20 years ago.Scotland's overall emissions have fallen by more than a quarter since 1990, but the report said part of that was owing to the recession rather than government policy.Robert Black, the auditor general, said: "To meet the 2020 target new policies will need to be delivered successfully, especially in transport. The challenges will be that much greater over the next few years when the pressures on Scotland's public sector finances are likely to increase."The report confirmed disclosures in the Guardian that the Scottish government's plan to meet its targets will rely heavily on climate policies being pursued by the UK government and European Union.Scottish ministers are directly responsible for less than a third of Scotland's CO2 emissions, which equal about 8.6% of the UK's total. Scotland's population is 0.07% of the world total and its emissions twice that, at 0.15%.Despite steep falls in emissions from agriculture, housing and the energy sector, transport emissions continue to rise and are now the most significant contributor, excluding energy.The Scottish government said it had set aside £680m over the next three years for low-carbon, energy efficiency and homes projects. The costs of cutting emissions had to be met by the private sector, not just taxpayers, it said.Stewart Stephenson, the environment minister, said: "The £11bn is pretty much what we have been working on all along. It is in line with the advice that we had from the UK committee on climate change."A very large proportion of the money will of course come from private industry investing in new power stations, investing in energy efficiency on their own campuses. So it is a large sum of money but of course, as Lord Stern said in his report, the cost of not dealing with climate change is substantially greater."The Scottish government has repeatedly been criticised for focusing on renewable energy and frequently avoiding unpopular measures on driving and congestion. It has also relaxed planning controls on opencast coal mining, which is now expanding in Scotland.This week the Scottish government confirmed an expansion of the roads network as part of a £60bn infrastructure plan. It confirmed several rail modernisation projects but did not publish any analysis about the overall impact on CO2 emissions or its 2020 target.Sarah Boyack, Labour's shadow Scottish environment secretary, said: "This is a stark reminder which shows the scale of the challenge now facing Scotland. We need a serious, credible, and urgent plan from ministers to implement them in a way that is fair and economically sustainable. For some time now, we have warned that warm words are not enough and the lack of a serious plan would cost us dear – both in terms of public finance and missed targets."The report called for much more accurate recording and measuring of emissions. Boyack castigated ministers in November for claiming it had cut CO2 emissions through its climate challenge fund by 700,000 tonnes when it emerged the actual figure was 125,886 tonnes. She said Salmond had "duped" Al Gore, the former US vice-president turned climate campaigner who repeatedly lauded the first minister in October, and had accepted an international climate award "under false pretences".Dan Barlow, head of policy at WWF Scotland, said the Audit Scotland findings meant ministers had to amend their draft budget for environmentalists to have any confidence in the Scottish government's action plans. "Improving the energy efficiency of our homes, supporting more walking and cycling and tackling our reliance on the private car will save us millions on our fuel bills and offer health benefits worth billions of pounds," he said.
