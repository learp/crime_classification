The makers of the Oscar-winning documentary Amy are working on a film about former prime minister Tony Blair, it has been reported.According to the Telegraph, members of Blair’s staff met producer James Gay-Rees, whose On the Corner production company was behind the Amy Winehouse film, which won the best documentary Oscar in 2016, as well as Formula One documentary Senna and music film Oasis: Supersonic.A source is quoted as saying: “Blair’s people met with James Gay-Rees. It got to the stage of Blair’s people saying ‘What about making a documentary around Tony?’ They were really keen on the idea. It just ticks all the boxes … If you look at everything that James has done, he has focused on really interesting people.”Gay-Rees is currently making a documentary about Diego Maradona with Amy director Asif Kapadia, though it is not clear if Kapadia will be involved in any Blair-related project.Blair’s spokesperson said: “We receive many requests from documentary makers on a variety of subjects, but have neither sought nor agreed to do anything of the nature you describe.”Any film is likely to be part of Blair’s attempt to re-establish his credibility as a political force, which recently saw him announce a new policy unit for the centre ground, and an end to his business activities. Blair was previously the subject of George Galloway’s film The Killings of Tony Blair, released in 2016.
