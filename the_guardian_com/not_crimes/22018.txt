10.00pm GMT22:00Next week looks fully Carry On or a particularly lively night in Hi-De-Hi’s Hawaiian ballroom. I won’t be missing that. If you think you can stomach it, join me here next week at the same time. I must go, my jet ski is waiting. Good bye.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.59pm GMT21:59So, and then there were nine. Did you predict the leavers? I certainly didn’t. I mean I predict Karthik’s departure every week but he just seemed unkillable as the weeks went on.

Samuel?” Samuel’s gone, friend. And he’s not coming back.Oh the sailor’s hat is from NEXT week. That’s something to look forward to.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.57pm GMT21:57I fall for it every time, like a labrador being dummy-thrown a ball. How on EARTH is Samuel leaving for knocking a couple of quid off a snorkel? Or whatever it was.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.55pm GMT21:55Is it Dillon? No. It’s Samuel.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.55pm GMT21:55Dillon knows it’s Dillon.

Alan doesn’t want to hear anymore and the piano arpeggios of expectant doom rise on the soundtrack.Oh the finger it moves and Alana is let off this time. So, Samuel or Dillon. It’s obviously Dillon.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.54pm GMT21:54Karrren tells Alana she’s too quiet and softens it with a bit of praise, but she’s basically using her enormous hair to dominate her. Alana cowers.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.52pm GMT21:52Samuel must, however, defend his record on independent price-setting first. Maybe Alan really doesn’t want a loose cannon. Or perhaps he’s just throwing shade at Samuel first before firing the other two into the sun.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.51pm GMT21:51Grainne and Courtney are sent back to the house and the other three are told to go outside and think about what they’ve done. Karthik is in the taxi of no hope, saying it should have been Sam-yew-elle. Funny pronunciation. Karrren, Alan and Claud discuss who to kill/fire next. Or maybe just keel-haul? And back they come - Alana, Dillon and Samuel. It can’t be Samuel.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.49pm GMT21:49Grainne is asked to choose two colleagues to bring back into the boardroom instead. Zoinks!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.49pm GMT21:49Dillon talks up his visual flair but can’t put his finger on where things went wrong oh wait, yes he can. It’s Karthik’s fault.Alan makes some dreadful quip about the skipper skipping his duties and then goes all serious. I think he’s going to actually chop his head off he’s so angry.He does! Karthik is fired! No bringing two team mates back, he’s gone. Who is next?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.47pm GMT21:47If it’s a straight fight between Karthik and Samuel, I’d bet the farm on Sam staying. Meanwhile, Alana is embarrassed at her £42 worth of sales and says it’s only for the lack of “two more fish”. Those two fish may have cost her the game.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.46pm GMT21:46Karthik calls it a “very horrible day in business” in an attempt to come up with something as iconic as the Queen’s annus horribilis.Claud says the team should have “approached customers” during the day to ask them if they’d like to buy a jet ski. Yeah, cold-selling jet skis. That’ll work. Oh Claud.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.45pm GMT21:45At the sad cafe, Courtney is furious to be drinking “shit coffee” as well he might. Samuel’s early blame-shifting is recalled efficiently from his rolodex memory while Karthik flails wildly, telling him he’s a snake in the grass. Hey, it worked for Trump. Just shout, It’s rigged. It’s rigged, until someone lets you win.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.44pm GMT21:44Fran thinks the curse of Nebula has now been broken, before getting into the boat and presumably watching it sink beneath the waves.
