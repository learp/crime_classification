How satisfied are you with your life? A study from Granada in Spain suggests your answer depends on the balance between envy and compassion. On a scale from 1 (totally disagree) to 7 (totally agree), how much do you agree with each of the following statements:I am not worried about how much money I have; what worries me is that there are people who have more money than I have.I am not worried about how much money I have, what worries me is that there are people who have less money than I have.The first statement measures envy. If you scored 1 or 2, then you are about as envious as the average person. If you scored 4 or above, you are more envious than three-quarters of the respondents. Obviously, envy is inversely related to life satisfaction: the more envious you are, the less satisfied you are with your life.The second statement measures compassion. If you scored 3-5, you are about as compassionate as the average respondent. If you scored 6-7 or 1-2, you rank, roughly speaking, among the 25% most or least compassionate respectively. Compassion is related to happiness, but in the opposite direction to that which you might expect. Those who reported worrying about the less well-off were happier than those who didn’t. It may be that those who show concern for others are nicer people to be around, and so enjoy more pleasant everyday interactions.A fully referenced version of this article is available at benambridge.com.
