Deprived by time and circumstances of almost all my strength, I find that my daydreams of being a Wimbledon singles champion divide into two kinds: real and unreal. My daydream of being Roger Federer is unreal, because he moves so gracefully and I do not, and never have. It goes without saying that I could never play like him, either. Of course I couldn’t: the whole point of a daydream is that it lets you do the enviable thing. For the daydream to be real, however, it has to be plausible that it’s you doing it.My daydream of being Rod Laver is real, because he, like me, was never an adonis. Pigeon-toed and jug-eared, his image on screen made few women sigh. But that’s exactly what makes my daydream of being Laver so poignantly real. Whenever he hit his famous cross-court running forehand, he could have been me; and the shot seemed all the more uncanny because he himself was an ordinary-looking Aussie bloke. Then, as now, I did all the sighing necessary.When Federer floats up on to his toes so he can get the racket high enough to sweep the ball smoothly into one of the opposite corners, there is no woman in the world who is not sighing. You can imagine them all passing out: Angelina Jolie, Angela Merkel, the Empress of Japan. But I promise, cross my heart, that it’s more what he can do, and not how gorgeous he looks while doing it, that I so envy. With that fact kept in mind, the daydream shifts safely into the area of the plausible.Clive James: 'These boots say: I am not Taylor Swift' Armed with our wishful thinking, we can keep Wimbledon always the way it was, an annual fixture as reliable in its format as Trooping the Colour. The wish is so deep that even some of the regular participants behave as if nothing will ever change. This year, Sue Barker was still, ah, the voice of the, ah, BBC, saying “ah” every few words, as if approaching the moment when, ah, one “ah” would actually precede the next and, ah, succeed it also. What would Wimbledon be like without her? Don’t worry, the chances are that you will never find out.I, on the other hand, to be realistic, should prepare the small suitcase of memories that I will take with me into the beyond, so as to be ready when I meet other people who will know what I am talking about if I mention the splendour of Evonne Goolagong moving at full speed, or the stunning moment when Clive James, two sets and three breaks down against Novak Djokovic, hit the inside-out backhand line drive that changed the game. “And on Henman Hill,” said Sue, “they’re going, ah, mad.”
