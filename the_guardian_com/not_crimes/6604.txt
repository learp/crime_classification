The Vegetarian Society held its fifty-seventh annual conference yesterday in the Memorial Hall, Manchester. Professor John E. B. Mayor, Cambridge, presided, and many of the principal supporters of the Society were present.Professor Mayor, in opening the Conference, said he always looked on the English heavy dinner – especially what was called a public dinner – as the most astounding function in the civilised world. If one talked to great travellers who had lived among what were called savages, one would hear that the most painful thing they experienced on returning to this country was their “lionising” at great dinners. They would rather be in the company of naked savages or wild animals than in the company of the beef-eating Englishman at his feast.“SOCIETY” AND THE MARRIAGE RATE.What we needed was the establishment of a simpler home life. People were asking one another why marriage was not more popular. It was because of the extravagant style of living demanded by “society.” People insisted on having parties and entertaining company, instead of on having a home and friends. In families where “company” was entertained one hardly ever saw a mother with her children. Living in the simple way adopted by most vegetarians, it was possible to experience the delights of a quiet and comfortable home with real friends. The choice lay between home and children and parties and the rich people who gave them.EXPERIENCES OF A LONG-DISTANCE WALKER.Mr. G. H. Allen, of Leicester, who walked recently from Land’s End to John o’Groat’s (908½ miles in 16 days 21½ hours), was asked to read a paper, which had been written by Mrs. W. M. Green, of Nottingham. The paper described the system of treatment used in a sanatorium. Mr. Allen declined modestly an invitation to relate any of his experiences during his walking tour. Instead, he criticised very frankly the wanderings of some vegetarians from the simple mode of living, which he held to be the ideal of vegetarianism. Some of them, he said, had not only failed to adopt a simpler diet than ordinary meat-eating people, but indulged in an even more elaborate one. He knew of one vegetarian who had four cooks. – (Laughter.) Unless they set their minds on simplicity of living, vegetarianism would not help them much.Vegetarianism meant really the adoption of a simplicity in living, and town life as now organised was a huge, miserable error. As to the marriage question, he knew a man who earned £350 a year and yet said he could not afford to get married. “Why, bless your life,” Mr. Allen said, “I don’t get £100 a year, but I can afford to be married and to keep my family.” The fact was men would not deny themselves. They were too selfish. The vegetarian movement, he feared, was in danger of being captured by traders. It was being exploited by people who were not vegetarians and, like pills and piety, it was being turned into a business.Mr. Allen then read through Mrs. Green’s paper, interposing some lively comments upon the dietary and the elaborate scheme adopted at the sanatorium for the recovery of health. Five meals a day, “with cakes and sweets after supper on festive occasions,” was too much for the reader. “Air baths were a most important feature of the cure,” but Mr. Allen thought that next-door neighbours would object to you taking open-air baths.Continue reading here
