Britain’s decision to leave the European Union was not a vote against climate change, nor was it a vote against the innovation key to fighting climate change, UN climate chief Christiana Figueres told an audience of business and policymakers at the annual Business & Climate summit in London today.EU out vote puts UK commitment to Paris climate agreement in doubt In her last speech as the head of UN’s climate change body the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Figueres said, “It’s absolutely clear that should article 50 be triggered, the UK would have to reconfigure trading relations with the EU … there’s going to be quite a bit of volatility and uncertainty for at least about two years.” But, she added, “there’s no reason to upset the apple cart on this,” she urged the UK to “stay calm and transform on.”The second annual Business & Climate Change summit, convened by The Climate Group, focuses on businesses’ role in implementing the targets set out in the Paris climate agreement, the first legally binding commitment to curb carbon emissions to keep global temperature rises below 2C.While organisers expressed concern that Britain’s political instability will distract from broader questions about climate action, Figueres told attendees that climate change action was now unstoppable and much bigger than the shorter term political instability we currently face. “The UK has a very important leadership on climate change and there is no reason to change that,” she said. These were sentiments echoed by Paul Simpson, CEO of environmental data non-profit CDP. “Of course it’s a time of uncertainty but there is cross-party consensus on climate change in the UK that will continue to exist.”How can we make Brexit work for the environment? | Craig Bennett Simpson was at the conference to launch a new report, produced by CDP in partnership with climate coalition We Mean Business, which puts figures on the amount of carbon emissions businesses could save if they act on climate change. Based on businesses signing up to five global climate change initiatives, including science-based targets and zero deforestation goals, the report claims that by 2030 companies could cut 3.7bn tonnes of CO2. This is equivalent to the emissions of today’s EU and more than 60% of the total emissions cuts pledged by countries at Paris. If every relevant business signed up to these initiatives emissions savings could be as high as 10bn tonnes, says the report, equivalent to those of China, the world’s largest emitter. Government action will be key to business hitting these figures, said Steve Howard, chief sustainability officer for Ikea and We Mean Business board member. “To go further and faster, we need a policy framework”, he said. These would include policies which favour a low-carbon economy, carbon pricing, incentives for companies to build their own renewables facilities and financial incentives around energy efficiency. The report identifies transport and the heating and cooling of buildings as areas where more climate action is needed. It also calls for inclusion of more companies from the global south, currently underrepresented in the initiatives considered.Simpson said the report, which will be updated annually, is a work in progress and will be expanded in the future to cover further business initiatives. During an earlier press conference, Figueres, who steps down from the UNFCCC in July, did not deny rumours that she is gearing up for a bid to become the next UN secretary general to replace Ban Ki-moon. She maintained she was keeping her “full focus” on her current role until her term ends.
