Suspicions of ChristmasFor the postal employee the Christmas season inevitably brings an overdose of work. This year he is afraid he may suffer more than usual while the rest of us relax. The object of his suspicion is the “Greetings Telegram”, that missive which for threepence over the usual rate is delivered on a form emblazoned with doves and music in scarlet and gold and enclosed in an envelope of dazzling magnificence.The Greetings Telegram has not yet outlived a Christmas. Conceivably the public may seize on it as the solution of many of the little problems that arise on that day. The distant relation inexcusably forgotten when the list of presents was made out, the friend who unexpectedly sends a calendar for Christmas morning and so stirs the conscience, that other who should long ago have received the overdue letter one was too lazy to write – for these and others such the Greetings Telegram might well be thought a happy invention.

Anything that saves trouble has a way of catching public taste in these hurried days, and though the more discriminating may think the gilt and trimmings of the new missive a trifle florid at least it will save the bother of choosing something more tasteful at the stationer’s.The postal employees have reason to be shy, since they have been once bitten. The shilling night call on the telephone has been a huge success from the public’s point of view and from the Postmaster General’s. But it has greatly added to the labours of the staff. Their fear of a glut of decorative telegraphic greetings at Christmas is not groundless, and the authorities with whom they are now discussing the matter should see that they do not unduly suffer.
