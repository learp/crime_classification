Nike and Tag Heuer have become the first major sponsors to cut ties with Maria Sharapova after the tennis star revealed she had tested positive for the banned substance meldonium, with Porsche also suspending promotions with the player.The five-time grand slam winner announced on Monday that she failed the drug test after she was knocked out of the Australian Open in January. She has been provisionally suspended from the sport by the International Tennis Federation.Maria Sharapova's PR machine limits damage but raises uncomfortable questions | Bryan Armen Graham Nike, Sharapova’s most high-profile sponsor, said it would be suspending their relationship. “We are saddened and surprised by the news about Maria Sharapova,” it said. “We have decided to suspend our relationship with Maria while the investigation continues. We will continue to monitor the situation.”Swiss luxury watchmaker Tag Heuer, which has had a relationship with Sharapova since 2004, said it had stopped negotiations with the player, whose previous contract ended on 31 December. “We had been in talks to extend our collaboration,” a spokeswoman said. “In view of the current situation, the brand has decided not to renew the contract with Sharapova.”Porsche, which signed a three-year-deal with Sharapova to become its first female ambassador in 2013, also said it would be suspending promotional work with the player.

Her lucrative eight-year contract with Nike was signed in 2010 and worth almost £50m.Other endorsements for the former world No 1 include Avon, Evian and Head tennis rackets. Avon told the Guardian it would not be commenting for the time being on the future of its relationship with Sharapova.Evian expressed disappointment but said it was reserving judgment. “We were surprised by the announcement of Maria Sharapova during her press conference,” a spokesperson said. “Evian has been a partner of Maria Sharapova for many years, and until now, we have maintained a trustworthy professional relationship. Evian attaches great importance to health, to integrity and to transparence, and we will follow closely the development of the investigation.”The star also owns her own gummy sweet brand, Sugarpova, launched in 2012 and sold in 22 countries, and had plans to launch a chocolate brand in a collaboration with Baron Chocolates this year.What is meldonium and why did Maria Sharapova take it? On Tuesday, Russia’s tennis chief, Shamil Tarpischev, called Sharapova’s failed drug test “a load of nonsense” and said he expected she would still compete at the Olympics in Brazil this summer.“The sportsmen take what they are given by the physiotherapists and by the doctors,” he said. “I think Sharapova will play at the Olympics. However, we will need to see how this will develop.” Russia is barred from international competition after a major doping scandal involving its athletes last year but hopes to meet anti-doping standards set by the International Association of Athletics Federations in time for the Olympics, though many international observers believe this is unrealistic.Sharapova has also said she hopes she can eventually return to the sport, despite being plagued by injuries. “I let my fans down, I let the sport down that I have been playing since the age of four and I love so deeply,” she said at a press conference in Los Angeles on Monday. “I know with this I face consequences. I don’t want to end my career this way and I really hope I will be given another chance to play this game.”The drug Sharapova was using was placed on the banned list by the World Anti-Doping Agency from 1 January because of “evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance”. Sharapova claimed she had taken meldonium legally for years for health reasons.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Sharapova admits to failing drug test: ‘I made a huge mistake.’ Steve Simon, the chief executive of the Women’s Tennis Association, called Sharapova “a woman of great integrity”. “Nevertheless, as Maria acknowledged, it is every player’s responsibility to know what they put in their body and to know if it is permissible,” he said. “The WTA will support the decisions reached through this process.”
