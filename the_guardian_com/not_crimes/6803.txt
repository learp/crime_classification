Exhibition of the weekDutch FlowersThe Dutch Republic in the 17th century took flowers seriously – so seriously it was gripped by tulip-mania. The flower-growing obsessions of the age still shape the look of Holland today. In art, flowers offered a perfect subject for the realist artists from an age when the microscope was pioneered. Paintings by Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder, Rachel Ruysch and others showcase fascinating visions of colour – but look out for the worm in the bud, the lizard under the leaf.• National Gallery, London, 6 April-29 August.Also showingGlasgow InternationalThe only British city that rivals London as a centre of new art (and has a nicely rougher and less commercial creative edge) celebrates its vibrant scene with a host art events, including a group show at the Tramway co-designed by Martin Boyce and featuring Alexandra Bircken, Sheila Hicks and Amie Siegel among others.• Various venues, Glasgow, 8-25 April.The Other Art FairFancy your chances as a talent spotter?

Photograph: National GalleryCaravaggio is a mean painter of reptiles. Like the snakes that writhe on a human head in his terrifying portrait of the monster Medusa, the lizard that nips a sensuous youth’s filthy finger in this early work is highly realistic. It has been painted from life as have the dusty water in the flower bowl through which the studio’s yellow windows are refracted. Such details of raw life give Caravaggio’s art its biting power.• National Gallery, London.Image of the week      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   This is a photograph ofMovses Haneshyan, 105, one of the last survivors of the Armenian genocide, as he sees a picture of his former home for the first time in a century. ‘He started to cry and then sing: “My home.
