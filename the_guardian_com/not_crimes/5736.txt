Try to get heritage or speciality leeks and a good-quality tin of Spanish anchovies to make the most of this salad. I use Ortiz anchovies for the dressing and the salad, and eat any leftovers with toasted bread – chef’s perk! This zingy, caesar-style dressing is a great one to have on hand – it should keep for three days.(Serves 4)For the caesar-style dressing: 1 clove of garlic, degermed and minced2 anchovy fillets4 tbsp red wine vinegar1 tsp dijon mustard3 egg yolks250ml grapeseed oilJuice of half a lemon100g parmesan cheese, gratedSalt and pepper to tasteA splash of worcestershire sauceA splash of tabascoFor the salad:A small bunch of radishes, different sizes and colours, thinly slicedSea saltBlack pepper4 medium-sized organic leeksExtra-virgin olive oil2 slices of bread (country loaf or quality sourdough) for small croutons6-8 anchovy fillets A handful of chervilIn a food processor, blend the garlic, anchovies and vinegar to a paste, add the mustard and egg yolks, continue to slowly blend, then pour in the grapeseed oil, to emulsify. Season with remaining ingredients, mix in the cheese and set aside.Toss the radishes with a touch of salt, pepper and olive oil.Top and tail the leeks, slice them in half and brush with olive oil. Grill on the open side under a high grill. When they start getting nice marks, turn and cook for another 3-4 minutes at a lower temperature. Set aside.Meanwhile, for your mini croutons, toast two slices of bread, then brush with olive oil, break into pieces and set aside.Spread the dressing over the bottom of the plate and place the grilled leeks on top. Scatter with the radishes and croutons and lay the remaining anchovy fillets around the plate. Finish by drizzling some olive oil and fresh ground black pepper over, and top with the chervil.
