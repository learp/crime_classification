I have nothing against young people. I know every one of them wears earphones all the time, cutting them off from real human communication, but I can handle that. I know they say “can I get” rather than “can I have” when ordering at any of the nation’s coffee houses, yet the anguish this causes me is momentary, and ultimately forgivable. But I also know that the young people are our future, and if things continue as they are, the future will be devoid of marmalade. And I want no part in such a future.Yes, they are killing marmalade. People under 28 now account for just 1% of sales. More of them have probably sent a fax in the past year than eaten the stuff. I imagine they say, “Marmalade is, like, so Brexit” on their Snapchats. Marmalade is probably the name of an Instagram filter that makes everything look repulsive. Marmalade has presumably been the subject of a diss track by Stormzy. Even worse, maybe they don’t think about it at all, much like their waking thoughts are unlikely to be occupied by the demise of Teletext.Marmalade in decline as Paddington struggles to lift sales My concern is that young minds are made up on the matter, and as a result there will be no marmalade by about 2030, which only goes to show that we are currently in the midst of a slow-motion civilisational collapse. Allow me then to proclaim its wonders in a last-minute and probably futile attempt to avert such a catastrophe.You see, good marmalade, endowed with hefty chunks of peel, is everything that bad food isn’t. In terms of flavour, it walks the tightrope between bitter and sweet with grace; in terms of texture, each mouthful is alive with possibility; in terms of ingredients, it is simple and natural. Marmalade at breakfast is refreshing, invigorating, sharp; marmalade at tea is comforting, warming, restful; marmalade before bed is thrilling, subversive, transcendent. It is not a jam; it is not a spread; it is marmalade, and there is literally nothing in the world like it.I can rhapsodise about the exquisite delights of marmalade for months at a time. I often come across like Lou Bega singing Mambo No 5, only with all the ladies’ names replaced with the word “marmalade”, or like Craig David recounting his 7 Days, with marmalade taking the place of the courtship, romance and sexual union. The fact that the marmalade-shunning generation probably won’t know what on earth I’m now going on about just adds to the pain.But I think I understand why its wonders are not necessarily obvious to everyone. You see, you have to persevere with marmalade. You try it when you’re small because you think it’s going to be like orange jelly, and you hate it because it’s nothing at all like orange jelly. In this world of instant gratification, when you don’t even need to wait for computer games to load, it’s easy then to disregard it and just move on to foodstuffs whose appeal is more immediate. But imagine if you did the same with wine, just because it doesn’t taste like grapes. There’s still time to win hearts, minds and tastebuds. No palate is beyond redemption Those whose disposition is less apocalyptic than mine will doubtless find solace in the rise in popularity of “artisan” marmalade. They will counsel that all I need to do to restore my customary joie de vivre is be patient and wait for its inevitable renaissance, in the manner of real ale and Rick Astley. To me, that just makes it seem like a vaguely irritating minority pursuit when it should be a national force for good, a bit like the Labour party.But maybe the real fight really does start now. There’s still time to win hearts, minds and tastebuds. No palate is beyond redemption. We surely write our own destiny, at least when it comes to the popularity of fruit preserves. I remember when the future was bright and the future was orange; we need more than ever to recapture that optimism. As the timeless words of the song that imagines the citric ambrosia as a sultry temptress nearly go: “Itchi gitchi ya ya da da. Itchi gitchi ya ya here. Mocha-choca-lata ya ya. Don’t give up on marmalade.”
