The haircut of Mr Robot’s Elliot Alderson, worn under a conspiratorial black hoodie, has become the ’do of the season. Paper-thin on the sides and long on the crown, it highlights the character’s inner angst and the angles of actor Rami Malek’s face. It is hair worn as a prop, tailormade for HD streaming.Recently, the Mr Robot has been seen on Ronaldo at Euro 2016 (with an added serrated swipe), on Love Island’s Tom Powell and on Frank Ocean. Essentially a short back and sides with the beginnings of a pompadour top, it is also related to an undercut.The undercut is a men’s hair perennial. The ’do straddles two extremes, both militarily precise and shaggily rebellious. Of the former, the historical examples are bleak: Kim Jong-un and army officers. Of the latter, we have the grown-out version of the style adopted by Skrillex. Neither are particularly desirable, but as a compromise you get a Mr Robot: streamlined and precise with an air of cool modernity.
