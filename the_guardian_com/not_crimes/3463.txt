With pop culture crushing hard on all things 80s, it was only a matter of time before MTV came up. Music Television launched in August 1981, with the logo transferred on to the flag on the moon. The implication? The age of the video had began. The channel went on to air classics like Thriller and Like a Prayer, before the internet happened and arguably killed the video stars, or at least wounded them. That logo is now iconic of a golden age of music videos and other awesome things like House of Style. If, now, the channel is all Geordie Shore gossip and animal listicles, the 25th anniversary provides an excellent excuse to look back to its 80s roots. Enter Marc Jacobs, a designer who knows how to turn an 80s pop reference into clothes you want now, now, now. This sweatshirt – with the MTV logo rendered with the kind of patterns usually reserved for bedding in 1983 – is a case in point. It’s poppy, bright, and slots into a world where shows like Stranger Things, Halt and Catch Fire and Deutschland 83 are on repeat. Stick with these, and avoid Geordie Shore, and your MTV references will be the right ones for fashion in 2016.
