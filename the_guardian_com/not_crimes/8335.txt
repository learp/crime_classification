This writer is gay,and the priest, in the old love of his church,kneeling to pray.The farmer is gay, baling the gold hayout in the fields,and the teacher, cycling to school each day.The politician is gay,though he fears to say,knotting his tongue, his tie;and the doctor is gay,taking your human pulse in her calm way.The scientist is gay,folding the origami of DNA,and the judge, in his grey wig, is gay.The actress is gay,spotlit in the smash-hit play;the butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker,our children, are gay.And God is gay.
