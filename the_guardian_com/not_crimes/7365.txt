Aren’t HMRC a bizarre outfit? Last week, they sent a letter to my friend Janet in Cumbria. They had discovered that she was selling art works and hadn’t told them, so naturally they were on it, demanding that she fill in a tax return.But Janet is a pensioner, living on £155 a week, hasn’t paid tax for nine years, and her “art work” earns her nothing. She rang them up and explained, for ages, that she belongs to the village amateur artists’ group, sometimes puts her paintings into local exhibitions, designs and prints packets of 10 cards, which she sells at the post office, but after paying for materials, framing, mounting, exhibiting, printing and packaging, her profit is about minus £400 annually.HMRC understood. They wouldn’t be bothering her any more. But three days later they rang back, and poor Janet had to explain all over again. And I thought they were understaffed, overworked and up to their eyeballs in the Panama Papers. Why bother with Janet? And they’ve had a go at Fielding as well. Because instead of taking his pension out straight away, he left it for three years, by which time it made a small lump, and HMRC pounced and taxed it.“I was going to buy a record player,” says he glumly, “but I couldn’t.” A record player. Not a yacht. “If you earn £10 too much,” it seems to him, “they’re after you, if it’s £10 drillion, they’re not.” He’s not starving, but he is a dust-mote compared with the Panama people, whom he hoped HMRC might be after like a battalion of Colombos, leaving them little time for shrimps like him or Janet. Or Mavis, who is freelance, and once in her life earned £68,000 in one year. And £11,000 the next year. Back to normal.What a suspicious change in income, HMRC probably thought, perhaps not noticing “freelance”. So they inspected her, being particularly concerned about an incoming amount of £113, which Mavis found, after three days of intense searching and anxiety, was an insurance repayment for the cat’s vet’s bill. Just don’t get me started on the Rich List.
