We’re now running a regular weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review and the next theme is ‘family.’ So whether it’s a snapshot from a family album, a copy of your favourite family publication or a fond memory of togetherness, share your photos of what family means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Thursday 21January at 10 am. We’ll publish our favourites in The New Review on Sunday 28 January and in a gallery on the Guardian site.
