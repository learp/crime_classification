Those who haven’t started watching Stranger Things yet might like to stop reading now – Barb is one of the series’ highlights and we don’t want to spoil those, do we? Those who have, however, have taken her to their hearts. In a series based in 80s America, with a reference to a movie classic seemingly every five minutes (ET! Star Wars! The Goonies!), Barb – the geeky friend to Nancy, who disappears in episode three – is a stand-out style tribute to the era.

Barb’s 80s is real – more Rita, Sue and Bob Too, or Martha Plimpton’s character from The Goonies, than Dynasty. It comes with bottletop glasses, Farah Fawcett flicks on a too-short haircut, a ski jacket, buttoned-up neck frills and a whiff of tinted Clearasil. It’s fabulously awkward. As such, it hits all the fashion notes for 2016. The ski jacket is quite Gosha Rubchinskiy, the jumper and glasses totally new Gucci – it’s all the kind of thing you want to find in a thrift store but never do. No wonder #weareallbarb trended on Twitter this week, and her face is on a wall. She might be the mercilessly teased outsider, but her current cult style status is the ultimate revenge of the nerds. Take that, Steve.
