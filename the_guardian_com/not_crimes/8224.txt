The Leveson report states “politicians and the press have traded power and influence in ways which are contrary to the public interest”. I would like to know how Theresa May and her government will avoid at least public perception of this problem in its relationship with the editor of the London Evening Standard (May defends Osborne role at newspaper, 6 April).Roy GrimwoodMarket Drayton, Shropshire• I have a solution for the old actor/actress chestnut at award ceremonies without halving the number of awards and spoiling the fun (Letters, 5 April). Divide the performers into “actor wearing a suit” and “actor wearing a dress”.

We’ve put the kettle on.Joachim BoxManchester• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
