The traditional playground conker fight is under threat from an invasion of alien moths, conservation experts warned on Thursday.In response, gardeners, walkers and other sharp-eyed observers are being asked by universities and the Forestry Commission to monitor horse chestnut trees for signs of damage by leaf-destroying caterpillars which the government has classified as an "exotic pest".First reported in the leafy London suburb of Wimbledon nine years ago, the horse chestnut leaf miner has since spread out from the capital at the rate of up to 60km (37 miles) a year. Botanists initially thought that wilting and fading of leaves, caused by the tiny caterpillars' burrowing, did no lasting harm, but signs are emerging that infestation may stunt tree growth â€“ and worse.Darren Evans, a lecturer in conservation biology at Hull university, which is carrying out the joint study with Bristol university, said: "One of the country's most traditional games could be under threat, because trees infected with the alien moth produce smaller conkers. It is serious enough to invite people from all over the country to see if horse chestnut trees in their area have been infested."The study builds on a database set up by the Forestry Commission which involved 3,500 leaf-watchers last year. Their reports showed that the moth, a species of the Cameraria genus or family of moths unknown until its discovery in Macedonia in 1978, had spread as far as Cardiff and the north Norfolk town of Wells-next-the-Sea.This year's monitoring has already found affected trees in Cornwall and Yorkshire, suggesting gaps in the amateur "radar" system. Evans said that strengthened survey arrangements, including a mobile phone app (iPhone version; Android) to make it easier for recorders to upload pictures, would help to plot the spread increasingly closely.Detecting leaf miner activity is child's play, like conkers. The caterpillars cause large, whitish blotches on leaves which then shrivel and turn brown. Inexhaustibly greedy, the larvae live in colonies as large as 700 on a single leaf and can defoliate a large tree by midsummer, leaving it apparently dead.Affected horse chestnuts recover and sprout new leaves in spring, but grow weaker and produce smaller conkers if miners strike year after year. The study could result in measures by landowners to destroy major infestations but the monitoring also may show that natural predators of the caterpillars are also on the increase.Keen monitors are being asked to keep sample leaves in plastic bags and document insects which hatch from pupae within about a month. As well as the adult moths, they are expected to include small parasitic wasps, harmless to humans but deadly to the next generation of caterpillars.Organisers of the UK's annual moth count emphasise that Cameraria ohridella, as the new species was named in 1986, is among a handful of pests which form a tiny percentage of the country's 2,500-odd moth species. The other main offenders are the rare oak processionary, whose caterpillars damage oak trees, and two species which attack clothes and stored food, especially cereal products.Michael Pocock of Bristol university, a specialist in species interdependence, said: "This is an exciting opportunity for people to take part in a real scientific experiment on a national scale. It's a big mission for which we're reliant on the public's help. We're hopeful that they will play their part in discovering more about the threat to the future of our much cherished conker trees"
