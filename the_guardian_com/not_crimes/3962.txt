After several fairly anguished months of waiting and staggering around exhausted with breathing difficulties, Rosemary eventually got a proper appointment with the heart doctor, some improved medication and advice. Apparently, her left ventricle is only 60% functioning so, like a fool, she went home and looked up “ventricle muscle damage” and “effects of exertion on heart failure” on Google, saw the word “fatal”, and frightened even more of the life out of herself. Naturally, by the time we trudged off on our dog walk a few days later, she was planning her funeral and had us both blubbing.Oddly enough, once the plans were under way she felt much better. She fancied, for the music, me on cello and the talented daughter-in-law on violin, but as my cello playing is not up to scratch – or perhaps a bit too scratch – we thought the daughter-in-law conducting her choir would be much better, perhaps singing a bit of cheery Handel, a heartbreaking poem, then ashes to ashes.Not that her plans were up to Günter Grass’s standard. He made “extensive preparations for burial” and went for beautifully crafted wooden coffins, all ready in the cellar for himself and his wife. They had a lie down in them to check the fit, and planned to be covered in seasonal leaves, which Rosemary found tremendously poetic and moving. Frankly, I could have done without Günter’s information on bloated corpses and worms but, if it perked Rosemary up, then fine. Whatever floats your boat.And another reason to be cheerful: we feel we are taboo-breakers here, chatting about death. Up there with Joan Bakewell and Fielding, who does it regularly since his stroke. He is anxious about his anxiety, which may kill him, so makes him even more anxious. “I’m not frightened of extinction,” says he bravely, but then, “I just don’t want to go. I like reading books and looking at my granddaughter and the sea.”He looks pretty robust to me. And so does Rosemary, since her plans were made. The damaged ventricle has lasted 10 years already. I bet there’ll be another 10, for her and for Fielding.
