The Screen Actors Guild has announced its award nominations, a key indicator of who will be in favour when the Oscars are awarded early in 2017.Manchester by the Sea is leading the film nomination list with four nods: Casey Affleck (best male actor), Lucas Hedges (best male supporting), Michelle Williams (best female supporting) and best ensemble. Both the leads of La La Land, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, were nominated, as were Natalie Portman and Denzel Washington for Jackie and Fences respectively.

Having been handed a best actor (comedy/musical) nomination by the Globes, Hugh Grant was given a best supporting nomination by SAG for his role in Florence Foster Jenkins.Conversely, Martin Scorsese’s clerical passion project Silence found itself excluded again (though star Andrew Garfield was nominated for Hacksaw Ridge) – but rather more surprisingly, so was interracial-marriage drama Loving, whose two leads, Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton, each received Golden Globe nods.In the TV nominations, three series each received three nods: Stranger Things, The People v OJ Simpson and Westworld. The People v OJ Simpson is perhaps the most eye-catching, with three lead actors nominated: Sterling K Brown, Courtney B Vance and Sarah Paulson.The Screen Actors Guild award winners will be announced on 29 January 2017.FilmBest male actorCasey Affleck, Manchester by the SeaAndrew Garfield, Hacksaw RidgeRyan Gosling, La La LandViggo Mortensen, Captain FantasticDenzel Washington, FencesBest female actorAmy Adams, Arrival Emily Blunt, The Girl on the Train Natalie Portman, Jackie Emma Stone, La La LandMeryl Streep, Florence Foster JenkinsBest male supporting actorMahershala Ali, MoonlightJeff Bridges, Hell or High WaterHugh Grant, Florence Foster Jenkins Lucas Hedges, Manchester by the Sea Dev Patel, LionBest female supporting actorViola Davis, Fences Naomie Harris, MoonlightNicole Kidman, Lion Octavia Spencer, Hidden FiguresMichelle Williams, Manchester by the SeaBest ensemble performanceCaptain Fantastic Fences Hidden Figures Manchester by the SeaMoonlightBest stunt ensembleCaptain America: Civil War Doctor Strange Hacksaw Ridge Jason Bourne Nocturnal Animals       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Best female actor in a TV movie or miniseries nomination … Bryce Dallas Howard in Black Mirror.
