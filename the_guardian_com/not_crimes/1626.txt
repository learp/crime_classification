Perijee and Me is a fabulous book to read. It’s funny, but it can get tense in places. There is a girl called Caitlin and another called Phee. And Perijee is a little monster Catlin found on the beach. In the story, Caitlin lives on an island with her parents. She is really lonely. But when a storm hits the island, she finds a friend to spend the summer with.There are some really funny bits – like the bit with a cow in. But I’ll let you find out what’s funny for yourself.There’s a lot of suspense too and some funny, strange characters along the way.You’ll just have to read the book to find out about the gang of tough old ladies…When I read the book it felt like Caitlin was chatting to me. I felt like I knew her and she was my friend, which was nice.I liked this book because it’s a book you wouldn’t have ever really read, its unique! There were some words I found hard to understand but most books have that and it means I know them now.It is not a picture book, but it’s a book that you’ll get into straight away. The cover makes me feel happy and excited! It really suits the book. I would recommend this book to everyone who likes monsters and humour.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
