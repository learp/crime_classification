The track we always play to rescue a dancefloor The House Master Boyz And The Rude Boy Of House: House Nation   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Nothing rescues a dancefloor like a classic house record, and this is top of the pile if things are starting to go a little south.The track that currently gets the most rewinds William Onyeabor: Fantastic Man   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest We’re currently playing this half a dozen times in a row; at home, at least. Not sure we’d get away with quite that many times in a club, but man this is a good record.The ideal festival track Patrice Bäumel: Roar   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest No kick drum, barely any melody, just pure craziness. Something that would work as an opening track at big festivals where sometimes you only have an hour, so you’d better start with something that shakes the people up.The track we’d play at our auntie’s wedding Wham! Everything She Wants    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It’s hard to not like this song, right? The bassline is just too good to not move you. A guaranteed floorfiller and wedding anthem.The track we’d play to show off our eclectic tastes David Sylvian: Let The Happiness In   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Not something we’d think of as super eclectic, but not many people seem to know it. Every time we play it, people ask who he is. The whole album Secrets Of The Beehive has been one of our favourites for many years, it’s just exceptional.The track that got us out of bed this morning Soul Connection: Get Up To Get Down   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest We highly recommend waking up and celebrating the morning with some old soul or funk. It makes you smile and really move your ass; we all need a bit of motivation from time to time.The track we’d play at our funeral William Onyeabor: Atomic Bomb   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Another song from William Onyeabor, but hard not to go for this one. It’s a snapshot of the absolute apex of happiness and hedonism: a space where no bad vibes can exist.M. A. N. D. Y. play The Nest, N16, Fri. The album Double Fantasy is out on 11 November via Get Physical Music
