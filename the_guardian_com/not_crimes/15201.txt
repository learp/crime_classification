MIA is to be the curator of this year’s Meltdown festival at the Southbank Centre in London. Despite having announced her retirement at least twice – once in 2008 and again last year when she said she planned to release her album and then quit music – she apparently remains very much unretired.MIA: Is the musician paranoid, or is everyone out to get her? Each Meltdown festival is curated by a different artist, with a variety of shows and art events in the Southbank Centre’s venues. “For me, this Meltdown will be about putting on a musical week that shows different types of music which have inspired each other to exist,” MIA said. “Genres that support other genres, redefining the concept of a melting pot. Respect the history, don’t live in it. I plan to bring together music’s best forward-thinkers who have contributed to all our lives. When music acts as inspiration, it’s boundaryless.”MIA released her fifth solo album, AIM, in September 2016. It peaked at No 63 on the UK chart and No 66 in the US. Despite never having been hugely commercially successful, she was named a defining person of the decade by Rolling Stone magazine in 2009, and as an influential person by Time and Esquire.This year’s Meltdown will take place from Friday 9 June to Sunday 18 June.The festival’s previous curators are:1993 – George Benjamin1994 – Louis Andriessen1995 – Elvis Costello1996 – Magnus Lindberg1997 – Laurie Anderson1998 – John Peel1999 – Nick Cave2000 – Scott Walker2001 – Robert Wyatt2002 – David Bowie2003 – Lee “Scratch” Perry2004 – Morrissey2005 – Patti Smith2006 – No event2007 – Jarvis Cocker2008 – Massive Attack2009 - Ornette Coleman2010 – Richard Thompson2011 – Ray Davies2012 – Anohni2013 – Yoko Ono2014 – James Lavelle2015 – David Byrne2016 – Guy Garvey
