My kitchen is … the place I immediately feel at home. I have only just moved, so right now it is a work in progress. I have a marble topped butcher’s block, perfect for rolling pastry, with ample pot and pan storage underneath, and open shelving with rows of things in Kilner jars. My kitchen table is draped with bright hand-blocked fabrics from India, with stacks of cotton napkins.My favourite kitchen tool is … a heavy, stone pestle and mortar that was a gift from a friend. Spices are the backbone of my cookery. Without them, it would be the culinary equivalent of elevator music. I could use an electric grinder, and sometimes I do, but the results are never quite the same.My storecupboard staple is … condiments and pickles – for me they are a distinct food group. I love how they lift the simplest of dishes – a dal served with my mother’s lemon pickle or baguette with some sharp cheddar and chilli jam.When I’m starving I … like crisps that are light, thin and crunchy; salt and vinegar, in particular. A kitchen porter at work recently balked at me for scarfing a bag of crisps when there was a lobster up for grabs on the kitchen counter. I go to sleep thinking of the Kettle Chips in my cupboard.My culinary inspiration is … my mother and my grandfather. I grew up in an extended family in Nairobi. There were always between 15 and 25 people at mealtimes, which had to be handled with military precision. The commander in chief was my mother and, when I was five, she marched me into the kitchen and told me I had to learn to cook. It wasn’t really until my grandfather’s interference, though, that my love for food and feeding began. He bought me a little aluminium stove that could be lit up with newspaper. I took to making piles of chapatis. He was so encouraging.Molly Yeh’s kitchen: ‘I’m so full from tasting that I’m not hungry’ | Kitchen encounters My best-kept kitchen secret is … I don’t believe in secrets in the kitchen – I am suspicious of those who won’t share recipes or kitchen wisdom. The kitchen is a place for generosity of spirit.When I’m invited to dinner I take … flowers and Laurent Perrier pink champagne, which everybody likes. It is rare that people cook for me, but I love it when they do. I am not remotely fussy, just happy to be there.Everything tastes better with … a partner in crime. The boundless pleasure of demolishing a cheeseboard or an indulgent takeaway is always heightened when there’s someone to grin toothily at while you eat.When I go shopping I … buy even more condiments!For dinner tonight … I’ll have a chicken schnitzel at Fischer’s around the corner from my restaurant. I am often too busy to eat at lunch so post-service I often want something hearty. I can hardly ever resist the sachertorte or a cold coupe of vanilla ice-cream with wafers and hot butterscotch sauce afterwards.Ravinder Boghal is a chef, food writer and stylist the chef patron of Jikoni restaurant in London, @cookinboots; jikonilondon.com
