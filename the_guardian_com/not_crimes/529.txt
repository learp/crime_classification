We keep hearing about this horror boom that’s allegedly been going on for a couple of years now: The Harvest, It Follows, Goodnight Mommy and the forthcoming The Witch. But while good horror movies do, of late, seem a little more abundant than usual, they remain the tip of an iceberg whose submerged nine-tenths consist of hundreds of boring, bad, unscary little movies like The Forest.Friday Flyer with Natalie Dormer I schlepped a long way across Los Angeles to find The Forest – like a lot of box-office bombs it had been swiftly retired to the lowest echelons of the distribution hierarchy: a clapped-out six-plex in an otherwise abandoned and, even in the bright daylight at 2pm, bracingly bleak Van Nuys shopping mall under the flightpath west of Burbank Bob Hope airport. It was the multiplex end of days.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I was delighted. Firstly because I love spooky abandoned malls, and because I first saw the mall movie ne plus ultra, Dawn Of The Dead, in a spooky, suburban American mall at midnight in 1981. And compared with the sterile fast-food experience of the modern multiplex – designated seats, all that crap – this place was a time machine back to seeing horror movies in some of the sleaziest moviehouses in Washington DC and Baltimore. Guys were making out with their girls, people were tipsy, they yelled out “Look behind you!” at the screen, the place was packed with kids, and nobody really even cared what the film was. I’d forgotten this was how we used to go to the pictures. Incredibly, my ticket cost $1.50 – probably what a first-run ticket cost in the early 80s.Natalie Dormer: ‘Female empowerment shouldn’t be only about sexuality' There was a boom in good horror movies back then, too. Well, there were a couple of dozen keepers and all-time-besters floating atop an ocean of blood-soaked Z-movie dross. But at least they were all R-rated and gratifyingly nasty. That was before the scourge of the PG-13-rated horror movie, with its fixed ceiling on bloodshed and mutilation. The Forest is rated PG-13, so expectations were low.But apparently not low enough. Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell in Game Of Thrones) sets off into a Japanese forest at the foot of Mount Fuji known for attracting suicidal people, perhaps even inducing them to commit suicide. She’s looking for her vanished identical twin (that’ll be black-haired Natalie) but keeps wandering off the safety path and finding ghosts and malign spirits. The forest is said to dredge up one’s worst self, or worst nightmares, and so it does. Mostly, this involves a big-jolt rush of noise on the soundtrack and something whizzing out of the shadows at us. It’s incoherent, self-contradictory and, most shameful of all, never spine-chilling. The best thing about it was the trailer for The Witch (1630s New England, dark forces, lots of fog). Now that might be worth coming back here for.
