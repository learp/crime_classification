Few people have shaved their head, hung from under a fast-moving truck and been catapulted through the air all in the name of work. But then not many people are as tough and determined as stuntwoman Dayna Grant. She has worked as a double for A-list actors including Charlize Theron and Tilda Swinton during her thrilling 20-year career, but to the easy-going Kiwi, it’s all in a day’s work.Like the actors they’re doubling for, stunt artists also have to get into character during a shoot. For the action film Mad Max: Fury Road, Grant spent nine months in the Namibian desert as Oscar-winning Theron’s double. “I lived and breathed that film,” she says. “We became the characters. I had to shave my head. Everyday we were pumped into our characters. The whole film was a stunt from start to end – I was flying, running, sliding under a moving truck, hanging out the side of a truck door.”Stunting isn’t just about jumping out of buildings and fighting scenes, though. “Our job is to train the actor,” says Grant. “In some jobs we train with the actor every day. We could be in the gym with them to make sure they have the right body type for the film. We’re with them the whole time, and any time they have downtime we are training ourselves to make sure we’re fit for the scenes.

You get there three months before filming starts and have full on training for 12-hours a day. You’re rehearsing all the time.”Grant fell into the world of stunting when she was 18 when some male stunt friends asked her to audition to be a stuntwoman in cult hit TV show Xena: Warrior Princess, which was shot in her native New Zealand. Although a keen gymnast and horse rider, Grant admits she knew nothing about the profession and didn’t expect to get the job. But they liked her and she started the next day. “I was thrown into it and it was pretty full on,” she says. “I was fighting, stunt riding and catapulting through the air.” From there she continued working in TV shows before landing bigger roles including doubling for Tilda Swinton in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. “There were never any auditions,” reveals Grant. “As soon as you are known, you’re just contacted.”Amanda Foster joined the industry when she was slightly older, in her late 20s, while working as a PE teacher and a film extra after hearing that there were no British black stuntwomen. She landed her first major role in 1997 when she doubled for Whoopi Goldberg in A Knight in Camelot. “I was sword-fighting, jumping over tables, getting thrown about,” Foster recalls. “It was good fun.” She also doubled for Halle Berry in the Bond film Die Another Day. “It was practically all action – I was abseiling down wires and involved in dagger fights. Berry was very sweet and often stopped by to watch the stunts.” I was sword-fighting, jumping over tables, getting thrown aboutAmanda Foster Foster says the best bit about being a stunt performer is the variety involved in the job. “I love that I’m consistently challenged and learn new things.” But how worried is she about accidents when faced with challenging and sometimes dangerous stunts? “We don’t talk about that stuff,” she replies. “It’s a good day when you get in your car at the end and don’t leave in an ambulance. Accidents can happen everywhere. Here you’re reliant on other people doing their job. It’s a joint effort.”How lucrative a career path is it? “I don’t feel wealthy because [work] can be sporadic; it can be full on then nothing for months,” says Essex-based Foster. “I’m involved in a little bit of directing and I want to take up clay shooting professionally.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Amanda Foster was the first British black stuntwoman.

It’s a career and lifestyle she loves. “I take my family with me when I’m stunting and we’ve been to Budapest, Namibia and London. They pay for my accommodation and I just bring the kids.” She admits it can be intense, however. “I can be away for six to nine months per film and it’s pretty much six or seven days a week and 18–19 hours a day. It’s full on. I’ll spend my day off with the kids.” Both women are well aware they’ve chosen very unusual careers. Grant recalls when her son came back from school one day: “‘I’ve just realised you’re not a normal mum. Most mums drink tea and sit on the couch. You jump off buildings and set yourself on fire’. He had thought that was normal, actually.” Now her son, who is 15, is a stunt performer as well.Does being a stunt performer have a certain lifespan? “I’ll keep going until my body won’t allow me to,” says Foster.Looking for a job?
