There are songs that crash into your brain and take up residence, often without your permission. These earworms – think novelty hits belatedly dubbed “song of the summer” – are often terrible. But my current earworm is a work of art. I can’t stop thinking about it, and more importantly I don’t think I want to. The reigning champ, AKA the #1 of my heart is a song called “Girlfriend” by British singer-songwriter Nao.I heard about Hackney-based Nao, 28, late last year, when someone put me on to her stunning single, Bad Blood. Have you heard it? It sounds like a series of powerful incantations: “I worship you like holy days,” she croons, and I feel my soul glow. It led me down a rabbit hole, seeking everything she’s ever recorded. The BBC selected the former session singer as a finalist in their Sound of 2016 poll (she calls her style “wonky funk”) and listening to her, you get why. Lin-Manuel Miranda: 'The man is a genius – and that's a fact' There is a marked brittleness to her sweet voice, which hits beautiful dips when you least expect it. Her debut album, For All We Know, sounds like the 70s and 90s remixed with generous modern synths. She sings: “If I was your girlfriend, could you pull me through? To make us fly” and the pause between the last two words feels almost sacred. In fact, the whole record sounds like a devotional, albeit one set to an electronic accompaniment. She reminds me a bit of Kate Bush – girlish and carefree but also incredibly wise, filled with secrets she may never share.For now, Nao’s sharing just enough—her album is getting rave reviews and she’s gigging all over. I’ll just be over here with my earworm, waiting for a chance to see her live.
