The clip in question is used repeatedly through her 2014 song Ring the Bell, and she reportedly claims that the “unique characteristics of the female vocal riff” have been copied. When asked about the case, US DJ Diplo, who worked with Bieber and Skrillex on the Jack Ü project, told TMZ: “I thought they sampled it, but I thought they cleared it. I’m sure they’ll work out a deal with her. They don’t want to go to court with it.”Sorry was instrumental in launching the credible comeback of Bieber, topping the charts in countries including the US and the UK. It has been streamed more than 6.5m times on Spotify, while Ring the Bell, White Hinterland’s version, has racked up 500,000.As well as Bieber and Skrillex, Sorry was written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter and Michael Tucker – all of whom are reportedly included in the lawsuit.
