Three schoolchildren from Theresa May’s Maidenhead constituency have designed the festive cards for her first Christmas as prime minister.Jade Windsor, 11, drew a picture of 10 Downing Street with a Christmas tree and flying union flag, and an image of the prime minister’s Christmas dinner. May has said she prefers to cook roast goose rather than the traditional turkey on Christmas Day.Sophie Brazil, also 11, drew Father Christmas visiting Downing Street with his elves, with the famous black railings hung with holly, stockings and a Christmas pudding.

The greeting inside the card, which will be sent to politicians and dignitaries, reads: “Best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.” It is signed by the prime minister and her husband, Philip.

She will switch on the No 10 Christmas lights at 5pm on Thursday.The colourful cards are a marked contrast to what turned out to be David Cameron’s last card as prime minister in 2015, which showed him and wife, Samantha, smiling on the steps of No 10 on the day he was re-elected.Cameron regularly chose pictures of himself and his family for his Christmas cards: in 2010 they featured the couple cradling their newborn daughter Florence, and again in 2013 when she was three. The Camerons’ cards also regularly used photographs from special events at Downing Street, including the royal wedding street party and a welcome party for the London 2012 Olympics.Nicola Sturgeon is the only other UK political leader so far to reveal the design for this year’s Christmas card.
