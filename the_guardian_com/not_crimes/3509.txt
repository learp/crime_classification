Question: what do you do when you have been responsible for Wimbledon’s uniforms for 11 years? Judging by Ralph Lauren’s latest designs, the answer is to bring a take on current trends to centre court. The tracksuit designs for ball boys are totally athleisure, and with the tracksuit a bit of a thing right now, we imagine said ball boys might be wearing this off court too. Other designs that bring a Serena-worthy serve of style include a ball girl skirt that could feature in the world of Beyonce’s Ivy Park, and the classic cable knit jumper. Worn oversized, and with matching white bootleg trousers, it’s quite Annie Hall, so totally allowed in 2016’s vintage-influenced fashion moment. And the umpire’s uniform of trench coat, hat and striped shirt? It wouldn’t be out of place in the wardrobe of Scream Queens’ Chad Radwell. That’s match-winning dressing right there.
