One of the world’s biggest private art collections is to be housed in a new Paris museum close to the Louvre.François Pinault, the luxury goods billionaire who also owns Christie’s auction house, is taking over the Bourse de Commerce in the capital to show his €1.2bn collection of modern masters.The city’s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, who negotiated the deal, described the museum as “an immense gift to the heart of Paris”.Pinault, 79, has amassed an enormous collection of work from artists including Mark Rothko and Damien Hirst. He displays them at his private museums in Venice after failing for decades to find a suitable home for them in Paris.“I am delighted, it’s a big plus for the city,” Hidalgo said, pointing out that the new museum was also near the Pompidou Centre, home to Europe’s biggest contemporary art collection.

With this and the Fiac art fair, Paris is regaining its place in contemporary art,” she said. The historic grain exchange being taken over by Pinault is part of a €1bn project to give what Hidalgo calls a “new beating heart” to the city’s Les Halles district.Paris’s 19th-century central market was bulldozed in the 1970s to make way for an airless underground shopping complex and transport hub, which most of its residents loathe.But a vast steel and glass canopy unveiled this month by Hidalgo to solve the problem has also been derided, with the Guardian critic Oliver Wainwright calling it a “custard-coloured flop”.Under the terms of the deal, Pinault and his family will be given a 50-year lease on the building, which they must also renovate. It was not revealed how much the work would cost or how much rent he will pay.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Very Hungry God skull sculpture by Subodh Gupta, owned Pinault.
