It’s been a busy few months for big global discussions on social and environmental issues. From the launch of the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs); to a new vision from the EU for a circular economy; negotiations in Paris for the COP21 climate agreement; to a European refugee crisis triggered in part by climatic impacts in the Middle East.But as much as we may welcome the sustained attention to sustainability challenges paid by global leaders, companies and NGOs must not forget that many of the solutions we need to create a more sustainable world reside at a very local level. We may participate in a hyper-connected digital world but our lives are still grounded in locality.The places we live, work, learn, play and relax in are for most people still defined in terms of a few square miles. Our interests and wanderings may be informed by the entire world, but at the end of the day most people return to a place called home. Indeed in a world that can seem overwhelmingly busy, complex and sometimes frightening that sense of home becomes more important than ever.More than 35 million customers tell us that they want a better future. They want governments and businesses to take a lead and do the heavy lifting. They are willing to participate in creating this better future, particularly for their children, but they largely want to make a difference in places and with people that are relevant to them: in their neighbourhood, their school, their sports club, with their friends, neighbours, colleagues or fellow sports fans. For global businesses like ours, these are the communities that surround our shops, our factories and our offices; the communities where our customers and employees live. We must link our global voice with our local presence. Our interests and wanderings may be informed by the entire world, but most people return to a place called home We saw this trend start a few years ago and responded to it. Today every M&S store has a direct relationship with its local community. Every store supports a local charity of the year, from cleaning local beaches and canals to offering work placements for unemployed folk who live nearby. The response from our customers and employees to this has been fantastic. They feel empowered and engaged, which in turn motivates them to deliver great outcomes for the community. We see higher employee motivation and customer trust.To deliver this we work with a new digital platform called Neighbourly, which enables our stores to identify micro community groups local to them that would benefit from support. Neighbourly in turn lets us share stories with our customers in these communities. Each of our stores is now using Neighbourly to connect with local food charities so they can donate unsold food at the end of the day to prevent it becoming waste. At the UN climate talks in Paris in December we helped launch an initiative that is helping millennials call on their own university and sports teams to commit to use clean energy. This works with the grain of people’s lives, creating clusters of shared interest and proximity. Why local makes senseWhy are these initiatives working so well for a company that has stores worldwide and is committed to working on big issues, including climate change, overfishing, human rights and animal welfare?Local feels more sustainable for consumers: food grown in a region local to you, carrier bag charges that help fund the town’s best-known charity, green walls outside your store attracting wildlife, employees volunteering in your community and sponsorship of the local sports team. It is where your customers see the difference your business makes and it simply feels real and tangible for your employees.Smart data is already allowing promotions, rewards, partnerships and opportunities to be tailored to individual customers. And as businesses get smarter with this data, sustainability professionals have the opportunity to reach individuals by donating to their favourite charity, improving their favourite products and helping them take action where it matters most to them. It’s no longer good enough to lead in sustainability on a global platform. You have to get it right on a macro and micro level – at UN climate talks and on the high street. Those that do will be rewarded with brand loyalty, a huge advantage in a world where trust and loyalty is increasingly difficult to win and retain.There is one last compelling need to build customer engagement through local action. As the Earth’s resources become more finite we must start to shift to business models that are circular, low carbon and enhance wellbeing. These sustainable business models will need a deeper, richer connection with customers and this will only come from a local, personal connection with them and their lives.
