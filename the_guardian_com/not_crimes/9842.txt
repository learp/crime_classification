Here’s a crumb of comfort for Gordon Ramsay, who has revealed that he was once asked to stay away from parents’ evenings at his daughter’s school after asking the headteacher for a selfie.At least the celebrity chef can feel sure that his conduct would never feature in the parental cliches a teacher I knew thought would be the basis for a decent game of bingo. The teacher shared this idea with his department, and one day he turned his words to actions: after an hour we had our first cry of “House!”, while parents looked on perplexed.Parents’ evenings are an afterthought for some adults. Some teachers tumble into position seconds before curtain-up, covered in crumbs. Others manage their appointments like mortgage applications. Many mums and dads plan for them like a raid on a casino; some pinball through their appointments like drunks.How to ace your child's parents' evening The parents who attend these evenings are a self-selecting, unrepresentative sample. This means that many of the parents we need to see most aren’t there, unless we’ve lassoed them. And if you’re meeting a secondary humanities teacher (who may have between 200 and 300 pupils on their registers) early in the year, it’s not unusual to see the teacher stare blankly at you as they work out exactly which Darren’s dad you are.The school’s duty to put on these evenings begins with regulation six of the Education (Pupil Information) (England) Regulations 2005. Once a year a school must provide a report on pupil progress, and “make arrangements to enable the recipient of the [annual] report to discuss its content with the pupil’s teacher”. Technically that doesn’t have to mean a parents’ evening, but unless the school fancies losing a third of every school day, to tidying up classrooms for a constant flow of visitors, then it makes sense to shepherd them all in together. It also means that in theory you should be discussing some kind of formal assessment (academic or pastoral) given to you in advance. No one should have to start the meeting with “So how is Rahena doing?”, because everyone should have an idea already – that’s the point.Here’s how to walk away knowing at least one thing about your child.Do: prepare your questions. You have less time than it takes to whip up a Pot Noodle to understand your child’s progress and position, probe opportunities and plan strategy.Don’t: sit down and say nothing, expecting the teacher to take the lead. It feels like a visit from the Krays.Do: think like a teacher (1): ask how they’re doing now – where do they stand in relation to the expected average? What benchmarks have they reached? Then ask about their progress.Do: think like a teacher (2): What problems need to be remedied? Then, how can they improve? Teaching is a combination of removing obstacles to learning and providing material opportunities to learn, so ask about both sides.Secret Teacher: I can't help but judge on parents' evening Don’t: take a phone call. For God’s sake.Do: think like a parent. Ask if your child is happy; enjoys the lessons; has good peer relationships; has any bad habits or abundant virtue.Don’t: come in looking for a fight. If you see the parents’ evening as a chance to set that bloody teacher straight, then do everyone a favour and mail it in instead. I’ve not met a teacher in my life who didn’t want your child to do well, however clumsily we execute it. Let the principle of charity be your muse, and assume everyone is in the game for good reasons.Do: think like an inspector. Ask to see examples of your child’s work, or come in having already looked at it. Ask for teacher comments to be explained. Ask why homework has/ hasn’t been set.Don’t: tell the teacher how to teach. By all means discuss pedagogy, and sharing useful intel is always welcome – but don’t barrel into someone else’s job. Do tell the teachers your little marvel needs more of a challenge; don’t tell them their lessons stink.Do: above all, ask how you can work with the teacher to make things better.Don’t: turn up five minutes before the gates shut. It’s like walking into a Costa and asking for a smoothie after they’ve closed down all the machines. Expect terse answers.
