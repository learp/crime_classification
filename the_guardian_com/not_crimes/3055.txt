This garden used to be a tipping ground. For years I thought about using it to grow fruit and veg for my restaurant, Yasmin’s. I’d come here and dream about it. Everyone said it was a good idea – but how to get the soil here? That was the problem.There was so much rubbish, we had to get a digger to create a level to work on top of. I then added God knows how many hundreds of tonnes of topsoil. I didn’t know anything about growing or polytunnels before, and lots of people have helped. Roger from the local garden centre showed me how to plan the planting, while another Roger gave me lots of tomato plants, horse muck and so much information. The man’s an angel. My landlady loved the idea that I could do this with the land and let me have it for free. Then she sent her son down in his school breaks to help with the digging. Even the local councillor gave us a load of pallets – she dragged them all the way up here herself.Food means a lot to me – as does gardening. It’s life. I’ve got three children, but one of them, Camilla, passed away. She came into our lives for 10 months and we cherished that. She is one of the reasons I started this garden.I grow tomatoes, cucumbers, salad leaves, runner beans, chillies, pumpkins, marrows, Indian spinach, mint, coriander and cauliflowers. This year I grew lots of radishes, which I’ll use in mixed veg; the leaves I cook as spinach in dishes with chicken, prawns or vegetables.Me and my garden: ‘I grew my first apple tree when I was 12’ I’ve got a huge area for my chillies. I stick manure at the bottom of the bed and give them a seaweed feed every two weeks. I normally get four flushes of chillies over the growing season. I grow loads of different types, including a green chilli from Bangladesh. I don’t know its name – but wow, it’s hot. I use it as my main chilli base for dishes.We were finalists for the British Curry Awards last year and they told me what we’re doing is unique. There’s the investment at the beginning but long-term it will save me money. You could have a beautiful restaurant with million-pound chandeliers but what’s the point if you don’t have good food? For me it’s about the quality of the produce and knowing it from the beginning to the end. I want it to be the best.Favourite spotEverywhere.
