Britain's major banks have pledged to support flood victims with a package of financial measures, including "payment holidays" on mortgages, following intense Whitehall pressure.RBS and NatWest, majority owned by the government, have led the way with a promise that victims will be able to defer mortgage payments for three months to help ease the financial burden caused by the widespread flooding. It is also increasing the daily amount that affected customers can take out of cash machines from £300 to £500.It is understood that other banks have been pressed by government officials to offer similar assistance.Santander said it will offer loan payment holidays or allow victims to convert their mortgages into interest-only to reduce the monthly cost. It is extending credit facilities to farmers by up to 12 months, and for small businesses it is extending credit by six months, with additional support available on a case-by-case basis. It is also paying £100,000 into a fund dedicated to helping communities recover.HSBC said it will "fast track" requests for loans and overdraft extensions and is promising to "lend to customers according to their needs and not constrained by any overall cap."Nationwide building society said it will do its best to help customers, acknowledging that flooding will mean that many people have no access to the usual documentation needed to do their day-to-day banking.The average flood damage insurance claim is likely to be between £30,000 and £40,000, according to James Rakow, insurance partner at Deloitte, while estimates for the total cost of cleaning up have hit £1bn.However, that remains below the £3bn the insurance industry is thought to have paid out following the floods that devastated huge swaths of the country in 2007.The Association of British Insurers has also issued an emergency guide to what householders can expect from their home insurer. It warns that victims may be out of their homes for a year or more if they have suffered severe damage.After the floods of summer 2007, around half of those people that had to leave their homes returned within six months, almost three-quarters within nine months and the vast majority were home after 12 months.Most insurance policies will pay out up to 20% of the value of the total sum insured to cover the cost of alternative accommodation for victimes.
