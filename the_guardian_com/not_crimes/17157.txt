Children’s lives are lived to music, from nursery rhymes and lullabies to that first playlist, leaking from illicit headphones in the back row of maths. Which is why, for my heroine Katie Cox in Accidental Superstar, every event deserves its own song, whether it’s a family breakup or buying a new belt.Music and youth are such natural partners, it seems only right that children’s and teen books are filled with songs. And even though we can’t hear the tunes, the best of them have a music that’s all their own. Here are a few of my favourites.1. “Isn’t it Funny?” from Winnie-The-Pooh by AA MilnePooh is always singing. This is his very first song, and such a lovely introduction. It’s simple, charming, and completely unforgettable - just like our favourite bear. Isn’t it funnyHow a bear likes honey?Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!I wonder why he does?2. The Sorting Hat’s Song from Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone by J.K. RowlingIt says a lot for the sheer inventiveness of the Harry Potter books that by the time Harry reaches the Great Hall, a singing hat doesn’t seem even slightly out of the ordinary. It’s such a witty song, too. If I were ever to have dinner with a hat, it would be this one. Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,But don’t judge on what you see,I’ll eat myself if you can findA smarter hat than me.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Sorting Hat, as imagined by Jim Kay!

This one, though, is a bit different from the rest. It’s the shanty the sailors sing to poor Padlock the bear.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Dance for yer supper!You big ugly tungler!Dance for yer sailor pals!An’ the wind she blows high an’ the wind she blows lowWith a wiggle-me-higgleMe-higgle-me ho!I can’t read this, as Padlock shuffles in circles, weighed down by iron chains, without wanting to cry. Who knew that such a funny book could be so sad?4. Toad’s song from The Wind In The Willows by Kenneth GrahameWe’re introduced to Toad’s big number with the words, “It was perhaps the most conceited song that any animal ever composed.” The world has held great Heroes,As history-books have showed;But never a name to go down in fameCompared with that of Toad!It ends with the comment, “These are some of the milder verses.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest We like this weird version of Deep in the Meadow from The Hunger Games movies.5. “Deep in The Meadow” from The Hunger Games by Suzanne CollinsKatniss Everdeen is a character of such steel that it’s easy to forget her gentle side. When young Rue is wounded, she asks Katniss to sing to her, and Katniss chooses this, a lullaby she once used to soothe her little sister, Prim. Of course, Rue is not safe. But at least she is loved. Here it’s safe, here it’s warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where I love you.'Off with their heads!' – the 10 greatest quotes from Alice in Wonderland 6. “The Lobster Quadrille” from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis CarrollThe Mock Turtle sings this song because the Gryphon has forgotten the words. I don’t understand how anyone could forget words like these. Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail. “There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance! They are waiting on the shingle – will you come and join the dance?As the song unfolds, we’re told that seals, turtles and salmon all line up, each with a lobster as a partner, and dance. It’s so strange and so wonderful. Mind you, I can see why Alice is a bit baffled by it all.7. “Seal Lullaby” from The Jungle Book by Rudyard KiplingWhen we think of The Jungle Book we tend to remember the catchy numbers from the film version. In fact, the original text is rather less upbeat, but just as good. Here, a mother seal sings to her baby - and it’s a quiet masterpiece. Where billow meets billow, there soft be thy pillow;Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee,Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas.Top 10 songs in teen novels: the ultimate young adult playlist 8. “Augustus Gloop” from Charlie and The Chocolate Factory by Roald DahlThe Ooompa-Loompas are a race of tiny men who work in Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory, with a sideline in mischievous songs. And as child after child meets their sticky fate, the Oompa-Loompas down tools to sing their explanation of what’s just happened. They’re like a miniature Greek chorus. Augustus Gloop! Augustus Gloop!The great big greedy nincompoop!How long could we allow this beastTo gorge and guzzle, feed and feastOn everything he wanted to?Great Scott! It simply wouldn’t do!

This song was written by Nick for his ex-girlfriend Tris. Not that Tris is particularly impressed by Nick’s efforts, in fact, she passes it around her Latin class, which is how Norah comes to read it. The way you’re singing in your sleepThe way you look before you leapThe strange illusions that you keepYou don’t knowBut I’m noticingNorah says, “I would give body parts to have a guy write something like that for me.” Me too, Norah. Me too.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This video of the Pig Lullaby/If Only in the amazing film version of Louis Sachar’s Holes is really fun!10. “Pig Lullaby” from Holes by Louis SacharThe Pig Lullaby is actually a kind of a curse, a family stain from a broken promise. The song is passed down through Stanley’s family, and with it, terrible misfortune. Stanley remembers his father’s gruff voice, and the sweet sadness of the melody. ‘If only, if only,’ the woodpecker sighs,‘The bark on the tree was just a little bit softer.’While the wolf waits below, hungry and lonely,He cries to the moo-oo-oon,‘If only, if only.’      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Marianne Levy is the author of Accidental Superstar a book about what happens when an ordinary girl’s video goes viral.
