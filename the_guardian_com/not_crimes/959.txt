PARISIf something happened to our present wardrobe; if it was destroyed by fire or water or were it lost on a journey or stolen, how, I wonder, would we set about replacing it from scratch? And on limited amount of money, of course.Let us suppose that we have insurance coverage of, say, £100* and that we plan to keep our wardrobe down to a minimum of basic elements. It’s quite a problem. Where to begin? Exactly how many pieces to plan for? What general colour scheme to adopt? What occasions to bear in mind? What general rules to adopt? Whose taste but your own to conform to? Higher meditations and sheep failing, these are thoughts that offer an excellent way of wooing sleep in the small hours. Try it, with my love, and see... I should like to say right at the beginning that if the necessity did ever arise to build up from scratch I would much rather do my shopping at home than in France. As near as matters prices for ready-made clothes over here are just about a third dearer than in England. As for styling, I have discovered from experience that if you have your eye “in” on fashion and know more or less what you want you can do very well in the shops at home.

Photograph: The GuardianAs our target, I suggest a six-garment wardrobe, beginning with something in the way of a town-tweedy ensemble (whoever it was who brought tweeds to town did women an incalculable service). It could be either on the lines of the Heim suit (left) or a sheath and coat ensemble like the one in the Claude Riviere model in the other (below). Either or both would see you through the best part of the day with elegance and comfort; both are good mixers.If we take the Heim model first and as our number one basic outfit (it would be quite all right without the belt and the fur collar – unless, of course, a length of beaver should have escaped the cataclysm) it could be encouraged to take you from autumn into winter by the addition of a temporary tack-in lining, either quilted or jersey. How much do we allow for this item? My guess is £25: a big bite out of the £100, but a winner every time.The coat next. I should tend to settle for a straight or slightly spindling one with large armholes and in a plain colour that picks up one of the colours of the tweed outfit. It will be roomy enough to go over the jacket even if the latter has its extra lining inside. How much for the coat? I have seen very good looking ones around the £13 mark. An extra skirt matching up to the coat will make an ensemble with it and will tie up with contrasting or matching sweaters and cardigans; or with blouses. I should be inclined, too, to have a middy-type top in the same wool as the skirt to give, on occasions, a slightly dressier two-piece look. How much have we spent up to date? £25 for the suit ensemble, £15 for the coat, £7 for the odd skirt and middy top and, say, £8 worth of jumpers and cardigans. This makes £55, leaving £45 in hand. Not doing too badly. To round off the day-time items I would suggest a one-piece jersey dress of some kind and in some sharply contrasting colour to the rest of the wardrobe, but of course in sympathy with it. For the slim and elegant one of the new coarse-ribbed ones, perhaps; for the plump (and still elegant, we hope) a finer jersey with a hint of draping in the right places. Allowing £10 for the jersey dress we have now arrived at six o’clock in the evening and have still £35 to play with. Six o’clock and cocktail time – what are we going to wear ? This is a matter of considerable interpretation. Some go all gay on the principle that day clothes are of necessity prosaic. Others go all black and fatal. I think the wise line to take is one of non-descript elegance for the basic garment and to go right to town on accessories – hats, crazy as you like, and coquille jewellery, chunky as you will. So I would be inclined to settle for something dark, something plain in either wool or silk ottoman, and cut with as daring a décolleté as you feel you can get away with. With wise choosing this dress will carry a woman through cocktails to dinner in town or will take her dancing or to the theatre. And, as it will last for years and give untold service – including weddings – it needs to be good in the first place. I would put at least £20 into that dress. It might be a good idea, too, to have a cashmere cardigan of exactly the same colour to cover up its nakedness on occasions.So it is £20 for the all-purpose-six-o’clock-onwards dress and £6 for the cashmere cardigan This leaves us with £9 to spend, four hangers occupied, an odd skirt or two in their clips, and a drawerful of woollies. Not a madly exciting wardrobe you may say. But it has the valuable advantage of being compact, up-together, adequate for immediate needs and our times.*Approximately £2,000 in 2016      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Manchester Guardian, 25 November 1957.
