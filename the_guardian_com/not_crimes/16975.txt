I read with interest your article (The future of Gaza: from city under siege to world tourism hub?, 29 July) which paid testimony to the extraordinary resilience of the people of Gaza and the description of the vibrant cultural life that exists there despite the appalling conditions in which they are forced to live. In particular I noted your reference to the music school, part of the Edward Said network of conservatories.Last Wednesday I attended a wonderful and truly inspiring concert at Leeds town hall performed by the very talented Palestine Youth Orchestra. At the beginning it was announced that two members of the orchestra who are from Gaza had been refused permission to travel by the Israeli government. I found this absolutely appalling. What possible security reasons could there be for refusing to allow these two youngsters to participate in an event such as this which contributes so much to cultural understanding?Sarah PerrigoLeeds• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
