Painted for a ceiling in a Venetian palace, it lets your imagination wander in the libertine age of Casanova and Mozart’s Don Giovanni. Tiepolo proves painting does not have to be serious to be great.• National Gallery, London.Image of the week      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Demon with Bowl, by Damien Hirst, on show in Venice. Photograph: Andrea Merola/EPAA truly vast sculpture by Damien Hirst, part of his comeback show Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable. As I said in my five-star review: “It is the biggest statue I have ever beheld. Hirst has created a figure on the scale of ancient monuments like the Colossus of Constantine, whose marble foot survives in Rome’s Capitoline Museum … When did I last see a contemporary artwork that surprised, unsettled and delighted me as much as this? It was probably when I walked into the Saatchi gallery in 1992 and saw a tiger shark apparently swimming towards me, mouth open.”What we learned this weekTate Britain’s exhibition Queer British Art 1861-1967 earned five stars from Adrian SearleEssex is home to radical some architectural gems – we spoke to their ownersHerlinde Koelbl, who has photographed portraits of Angela Merkel for 26 years, discussed the chancellor’s many facesOn Leonora Carrington’s centenary, Marina Warner saluted the uncanny artistAndres Serrano believes his best shot was of a white man with black skin – here’s whyAmerican pop artist James Rosenquist died this week aged 83 – read an obituary hereEllen von Unwerth’s photographs are a riot of fun and sly subversionMarc Quinn and Cerith Wyn Evans’s new works are blunt, blank and compellingEdward Helmore delved into the story of Dana Schutz’s painting Open Casket, which depicts murdered black teenager Emmett Till and which has provoked fierce debateEmine Saner spoke to Sergey Ponomarev about his photos from war-torn SyriaMargaret Hodge’s report on London’s garden bridge suggests it should be scrapped rather than have more public funds spent on itThe gifts given to the Queen during her reign will go on display at Buckingham PalacePrints previously housed in Bradford’s Media Museum will now form a new photography centre at the V&AArt that depicts Britain’s wars with Spain could enlighten sabre-rattling BrexitersTurner’s German masterpiece Ehrenbreitstein is to go to auctionThe National Gallery has acquired Sir Thomas Lawrence’s unfinished Duke of Wellington portrait after a £1.3m fundraising driveMoths are munching their way through the UK’s historic housesYork’s Viking centre is reopening following flood damageA new exhibition brings together Constable’s views of BrightonGet involvedOur A-Z of Readers’ Art series continues – please submit your artworks on the theme of S is for Spray Paint.
