The main character in this book is called Garvie Smith. He was absolutely my favourite character because of his attitude to classes, even though he has the highest IQ ever recorded at his school.Chloe Dow was his ex-girlfriend and the girl whose body is found in the pond and this murder is what the main story is about. Chloe went jogging one evening but never returned home. She was found several days later in Pike Pond. Garvie makes it his duty to figure out who murdered her, even though Singh the policeman and lead investigator tells Garvie he is not to get involved under any circumstances.I LOVED this book! My favourite part is when Garvie starts to put the pieces together ahead of the police and misses his exam to prove he is right.I would recommend this book to people who like mysterious books which are very entertaining to read and I give this 5 stars!Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book youâ€™ve read?
