Calling all regulars and lurkers: please paste your VLM running number in the comments below if if you would like to be cheered on by the Guardian running blog support crew*. If you’d rather not paste here, there’s also the option of putting something on our Strava page. If you are looking for somewhere to cheer on a friend/family member and fancy some company, I’ll be there on the day with my club cheering everyone on. Please get in touch if you would like to join me. For runners, I plan to bring a bag of spare SiS gels for those who might need some. * Fair warning, so far that’s me and astas, and he’s just going to shout to you to ‘run faster!’.
