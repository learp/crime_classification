The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with Save!: Easy Walk & Talk    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest From a new album on Ivan Smagghe’s label, this is spoken word, plangent synths and drones. It’s a cold opener; I love intros to sets rather than mixing into whatever’s playing.The track I’d play to show off my eclectic tastes Ivan Smagghe: A Simple Truth (Is Not That Savage Is edit) I finished an eight-hour set at Panorama Bar with this brilliant edit of Buddy Holly’s Everyday and was very gratified when two women came up to me afterwards to ask about it. As I smiled and waited for a gush of praise they proclaimed it “the worst record they’d ever heard in a club”. It’s good to make an impression.The track that got me out of bed this morning Sadly at the moment it’s usually a terrible reggae version of The Wheels On The Bus to placate the two-year-old. I’ve tried playing her Can’s Future Days – my favourite sunny morning record – but she’s not having it.The track that should have been a crossover hit Morane: Let Me Out (No, There’s Nobody In The Cellar mix)    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This is an obscure Perlon B-side that wouldn’t ever have gone near a chart except in my most fevered imagination but it’s totally magical and a lost classic as far as I‘m concerned. It’s as if Captain Beefheart made a house record: some atonal orchestral jazz and a mournful song with these sudden moments where a skronky chord stops everything.The track that currently gets the most rewinds Sanfuentes: Square Waves Over America Sometimes, all you need is a squiggly banger. Don’t overthink it, Pearson.The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding Dusty Springfield: That’s The Kind Of Love I’ve Got For You    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’m more than happy to stick to the script at a wedding with the likes of Uptown Girl and Do Ya Think I’m Sexy, but I’ve snuck this one in a couple of times. Dusty does disco – produced by Roy Thomas Baker! – from her “down the dumper” period. Goddess.Ewan Pearson plays Celtronic festival, Derry, Sat
