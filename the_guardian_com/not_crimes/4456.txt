Modelling geeks might think of Edie Campbell as the Stella Tennant of this generation – a bit posh but cool, too. She is a tomboy who wears sweaters and jeans very well. As any follower of her Instagram knows, she rides horses in her spare time and competes in dressage events. She also graduated from the Courtauld Institute of Art in 2013 with a first in history of art.

Photograph: Kristy Sparow/Getty ImagesDaughter of architect Sophie Hicks (a regular on the Tatler List), Campbell has the blue-blood looks of someone who grew up between Notting Hill and Northamptonshire: big, round blue eyes, rangy limbs and a kind of great sullen, stompy expression best accessorised by the countryside.

The campaign features Campbell and fellow model Natalie Westling striding forth in the mountains of Northern Spain in some very nice winter clothing, with moss and rocks as a backdrop. When Campbell isn’t walking the runway or aesthetically improving the landscape around the Lago del Valle, she’s a normal twentysomething girl. Here’s what she thinks about some normal twentysomething girl things. What’s your favourite cocktail?A Bloody Mary in winter and an Aperol Spritz in summer.What are the best and worst things about your job?I like the travel, I like the informal atmosphere, I like the intensity of it, I like the people I work with.
