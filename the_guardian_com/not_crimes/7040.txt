Pitch this There’s no better way of getting to know your garden intimately than sleeping in it. And the RSPB’s Big Wild Sleepout this weekend is a perfect opportunity to break out the sleeping bags and set up camp. It’s a chance to spot bats wheeling overhead, set up a moth trap and finally find out what’s been munching on your seedlings.Trap this I bet the answer to the above question is slugs.
