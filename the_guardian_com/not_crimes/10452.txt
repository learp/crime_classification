Back in 2007 in a Guardian supplement I was described as “the sourdough genius Mick Hartley”. That might have been an exaggeration, but you don’t have to be a genius to see that assessing supermarket products that claim to be sourdough is a bit nonsensical (“Just dough it”, G2, 31 March). There is not a single bread called sourdough, and it isn’t sour unless you set out to make it that way. Sourdough is a method of leavening bread using natural yeasts as opposed to the commercially produced stuff and can be used to make any type of bread. Yesterday I baked four for a local chef: an Italian pane pugliese and three Dutch: sauerkraut, fig and coconut, banana with buckwheat and ground peanuts. See any of that down the supermarket?Mick HartleyBethesda, Gwynedd • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
