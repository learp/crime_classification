“You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation”, sang Beyoncé on Formation, as she laid out the signposts for a thousand thinkpieces with a single that referenced Hurricane Katrina, “Jackson 5 nostrils” and keeping a bottle of hot sauce in her handbag. But it was her visual imagery that proved most commanding, from the sight of a slowly sinking police car in her new video, to the Black Panther references of last weekend’s Super Bowl performance. As such, her new stage show is likely where you’ll next see Beyoncé in fully realised form. Tickets are currently available to members of her fanclub, and will go on general release on Tuesday (28 Jun to 9 Jul, tour starts Stadium Of Light, Sunderland) …The lineup for Manchester’s Parklife festival (11 & 12 Jun, Heaton Park) will include Jess Glynne, Stormzy and everyone in between (that being: Wolf Alice, Craig David, the Chemical Brothers, Jamie xx, Ice Cube and Skepta) …Finally, ethereal French singer-songwriter Héloïse Letissier – otherwise known as Christine And The Queens – adds an extra London date to her tour (3 May, Roundhouse, NW1)
