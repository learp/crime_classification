More than six hours after the story was first published (and followed up by almost all major news outlets), the Foreign Office responded to a request for comment, denying there had been any change in policy, insisting the British government would continue to consult foreign experts, and saying the LSE had “misunderstood”. But that only deepened the mystery, because senior figures at the LSE (who, it is safe to say, are not stupid), apparently backed up by their internal emails and memos, stood equally fiercely by their story that they had been told by a senior FCO official that only British passport-holders need apply.So what did the official tell the LSE, exactly? Did they mis-speak, were they misinterpreted – or was this indeed a premature outing of something that was then rapidly withdrawn?Sadly, it’s unlikely we’ll ever know. But for anyone who’s really very interested in the question, there are interesting blog posts to be found here (by lawyer and Brexit blogger David Allen Green) and here (by EU law professor Steve Peers).

"Creepy clowns" retains both alliteration and accuracy. I would describe each clown based on the particular incident, thus only a clown who kills is a killer clown. But some of the clowns, such as the one riding a mobility scooter, have amused me. Whether this was their intent or not I don't know. I tend to enjoy pranks that don't involve weapons but do cause a bit of fright.

I want to talk about the clown thing. We had a style guide edict this week not to refer to “scary clowns” as “killer clowns”, on the grounds that they hadn’t killed anybody yet. The knife attack reported in Sweden on Friday, and this incident described in the Evening Standard suggest that might not hold true for ever though.Professional clowns on the clown craze: ‘They’re in costume but they’re not real clowns’ One presumes that bored teenagers inspired by media and social media stories are the main culprits here. I wondered if you below-the-line have a view on our responsibility in this? Should we be reporting the phenomena, or just ignoring it on the grounds that it will go away? If other people are talking about it – including apparently the police issuing warnings and letters being sent to parents with advice for children – can we avoid reporting it?Still, one very important thing.

AndyPandy1968 14 October 2016 3:26pmBased upon my limited experience of Uber, nobody should use them.After I registered, including giving them my bank details, phone no., email, and address, every time they quoted me, I got a fare quote which was more than the local licensed taxi company, and then I got charged for a fare for a journey I never took.

To their great embarrassment, on Tuesday night Norway joined a select list of nations who have conceded a goal to the San Marino football team in a World Cup qualifier. You’d think that conceding a goal is no big deal – Norway went on to win the game 4-1, after all – but this San Marino: a country with a population the size of Morecambe’s. To put it another way, Norway have hosted more people in their national stadium, the Ullevaal Stadion (which would be one of the smallest in the Premier League) than San Marino have citizens.Hence this reaction from a group of Norwegian pundits who were watching the game. “Down with everything, we’re going home. There is nothing to report here,” they said as they switched off the lights and hung their heads in shame: Norwegian football pundits distraught after shock San Marino goalNeedless to say, the Sammarineses loved it. Their reaction to the goal was probably best summed up by this tweet: San Marino (@soccersanmarino)WE FUCKING SCORED AN AWAY GOAL. STEFANELLI YOU FUCKING LEGEND!October 11, 2016After 26 years of playing competitive matches and never winning any of them, they deserved their moment. These little sparks of job don’t come around very often for a team ranked 201st in Fifa’s list of the 211 teams in world football (which doesn’t say much for the 10 teams below them). The low point for San Marino was possibly their 13-0 defeat to Germany in 2006 or maybe the day they fielded two twin brothers and both of them scored own goals. So they should cherish the good times. Which reminds me, did I mention that they once scored against England? Here’s that old film in all its glory.

Literature's a very local thing, but there is literature good enough that it deserves to be celebrated and brought to a wider audience.Past winners like Kenzaburo Oe, Haldor Laxness, Rabindranath Tagore, etc., sort of exemplify that.My issue with giving it to Dylan is less whether it is deserved or not, and more about what the point of giving it to him is? Dylan was already hugely famous, well-known, and internationally venerated.   Fabul0201 14 October 2016 2:19pmSeems to me the snobbery against Dylan is a bit ridiculous. All "literature" was originally oral. For example The Odyssey, Beowulf and The Mahabharata were sung to illiterate audiences by bards with highly trained memories....writing wasn’t invented until 3000 BC. Dylan's had an impact on contemporary culture at least as great as Homer, I reckon. The effect is most obvious among other songwriters. But he has left an indelible mark on even the highest brow forms of art which is so pervasive that we can't see it clearly any longer. From my own limited reading I would argue Salman Rushdie, Thomas Pynchon, E. Annie Proulx, Martin Amis, David Foster Wallace and Cormac McCarthy all bear his stamp - just as the sponge-like Dylan has received and transmitted things from them. Someone today said imagine a gathering of survivors after McCarty's nuclear holocaust where all paper and electronic devices had gone up in smoke - they suggested people would find it easier to reconstruct Dylan songs from their memories than the output any star of contemporary "literary" London!Updatedat 4.17pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.05pm BST15:05An extract from Mariella Frostrup: put down the porn and explore real sex with erotica!Toby MosesThis week I commissioned an article from UK-based journalist and television presenter Mariella Frostrup on the resurgence of erotic writing. Here’s an extract from her piece: Erotica is so different from pornography, which is almost exclusively designed to cater to men. Any relationship that existed between men and erotica dates back to the Victorian era when it was one of the few ways to access the sexy stuff. Now the tsunami of pornography has all but obliterated any particular interest the majority of men might have had in reading erotica. For women, sex is part of a whole sensory experience and I think that is less true of men. If you look at the pornography that has been designed to appeal to male viewers, particularly in the 21st century, it is very much about the physical act and very little else. That is why it is less satisfying for a lot of women.There’s a huge difference between the perfunctory plots sometimes used in pornography and the experience of immersing yourself in a story, characters and a considered environment – all those elements of the intellectual exchange involved in reading. In pornography, the literal act is simply placed right before your eyes. It is skin deep and, increasingly in the modern world, what you’re watching is the poor, dispossessed and desperate trying to earn a crust in whatever way they can. How many people who participate in porn do so because that’s what they grew up wanting to do? The sex industry as a whole is a bit like the drug industry. It’s an end product that involves an awful lot of misery for an awful lot of people along the way.Put down the porn and explore real sex with erotica | Mariella Frostrup What do you think?

That’s one of the questions that will be answered by an employment tribunal that reconvened this week.A group of Uber drivers are arguing they should be recognised as employees of the company rather than self-employed workers. The outcome could have a huge impact on the employment rights of tens of thousands of self-employed workers in the UK.

CordTrousers 14 October 2016 9:27amI can't eat fish or any kind of seafood. I never could and to be honest I wish I could I know it's very healthy food but the smell of it and the sensation of it in my mouth, makes me want to vomit.It's always been this way and as a child no amount of encouragement or threats of no dinner could persuade me. At my school we didn't get a choice, you got what you were given and I often had to put with bullying dinner ladies. I went home hungry.Is it a genetic thing? I don't know, all I know is I can't be around the aroma of seafood.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
