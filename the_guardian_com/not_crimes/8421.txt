The moors above the traditional market town of High Bentham give a panoramic view of Yorkshire's Three Peaks, and on a whim I decided to go high into the Forest of Bowland. I drove up the steep hill called Thickrash Brow en route to Slaidburn to park in a layby, and then began the stroll across to the Great Stone of Fourstones, the erratic boulder that was left here on an otherwise featureless moor by a glacier many thousands of years ago.There they were, the panoply of Whernside, Ingleborough and Penyghent, with the Howgills and Lake District included too, and what is said to be Lancashire's highest hill, Gragareth, all arrayed before this glorious grandstand, and in the foreground, the big stone like a giant toad perched on high. I was only just in time. It started to pelt with rain, terminating my attempt to climb the staircase that had been cut into the side of the rock. As I beat a retreat down the slippery steps, a mist began to obscure my outlook from this lofty point on BurnÂ Moor.Then reality struck. I had lost my car. Help! The cloud thickened, forcing me to stop. It was only in despair that as I took more strides into the void, and on the verge of panic, I bumped into a bumper. Thanking my guardian angel, I drove over a desolate tarmac strip and down the steep-sided Hodder valley to descend into Slaidburn with its dark-stone buildings, Hark to Bounty pub and YHA run by volunteers. And the sound of brass band music: no, a bandsman said, the music being practised in the village hall was not the march actually called Slaidburn, evocative of lapwings and curlews, composed by William Rimmer in the 1930s and now a staple for all brass bands.
