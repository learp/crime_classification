As a keen amateur chess player, I was very happy to see an editorial about one of my favourite games (Hurrah! Chess is no longer a game between superpowers, 30 November). However, you risk perpetuating the image of the chess player as male, eccentric and socially awkward, in saying that “Carlsen … is personable, good looking (at least compared to the average chess player)”.I played last month with my amateur team, Luxembourg Bonnevoie, at the European Chess Club Championships in Novi Sad (the annual “Champions League” of chess). Most players at this event, both amateurs and professionals, took care over their appearance. As well as the open section, a separate event for women’s teams was held. There the participants were largely young, elegant and very fashion-conscious. What I am trying to say is that chess players nowadays try to look and behave, at least outwardly, like normal people.Gone are the days of impoverished participants, often from eastern Europe, turning up in tatty jeans and wearing the same shirt for the duration of the event.Tim UptonHeisdorf, Luxembourg• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
