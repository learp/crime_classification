Having moved house the weekend before, I used my runs this weekend to explore the countryside surrounding my new home. Running is a great way to get your bearings in a new neighbourhood, but it can also be slightly unnerving running along unknown lanes, unsure of where they might lead. Arriving suddenly in the middle of a farmyard, for example, and startling the farmer and his dogs. That’s not great. Or chancing upon a small village of caravans tucked away down a lane in the woods early in the morning, but with no sign of life anywhere. That was pretty spooky. I found myself speeding through at full pace. Or finding yourself with no option but to run along a main road for a stretch, the drivers all looking at you like you’re a complete idiot.Yes, exploring can be fun, but there’s definitely something to be said about those tried and tested favourite runs. I’ll be glad when I know where I’m going again.What did everyone else get up to this weekend? Were you exploring like me? Did you stumble across anything unexpected? Or were you perhaps racing, resting or recovering from injury? As always, share your experiences below ...
