What is this government trying to do to our country? MPs will get a vote on whether to strip a man of his knighthood who has messed up the lives of a few thousand people (MPs to vote on stripping Sir Philip Green of knighthood, 14 October) yet will not be able to vote on the terms of a deal that will affect the future of millions of us.R Newman TurnerLetchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire• Hurray for Julia Raeside! Give her the Nancy Banks-Smith award, not just for recognising the glorious brilliance of Ripper Street (Stream on, G2, 14 October) but for explaining it in such perfect language, how it finds “that sweet spot between period escapism and visceral nowness”, how its “characters live through the words” and, yes, the fact that maybe it shouldn’t have been given that title – hard to see why else it’s not been getting all those awards that much lesser police procedurals have been loaded with.Alexandra ShepherdAberdeen• The imitation game is as old as branding (West not flattered by China’s soaring imitation game, 15 October). Twenty years ago I bought headphones in Abu Dhabi blazoned with “Panasony”. A couple of streets away, and part of a chain, there was a Burger Queen.John van SomerenLondon• John Crace is right about Leonard Cohen (Digested week, 15 October). The latter’s literary and poetic output far exceeds that of Bob Dylan. Anyone in the audience during his most recent tours who heard him read “A Thousand Kisses Deep” would also attest to the power of the poetry in the spoken word of Leonard Cohen.Ian FergusonPickering, North Yorkshire• The success of charging for plastic bags needs to be followed by charging for bottles (16m plastic bottle a day not recycled, 15 October). If retailers had water dispensers alongside bottles for sale then habits would change to having a bottle for life in your bag for life.Michael MarksLlandrindod Wells, Powys• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
