The wind had abated at last. Only the cawing of rooks and the turmoil of the river Wear, swollen by heavy rainfall in upper Weardale, disturbed the silence of the woodland on the steep bank above the river. We ducked under the trunk of a fallen beech, propped precariously against an alder on the riverbank.Like most of the trees that had been harvested by the wind here, the beech had been dead long before it fell. The evidence was plain enough to see: a trunk riddled with holes made by woodpeckers hunting for beetle grubs. When I lifted bark loosened by invading hyphae of oyster mushroom whose vaulted brackets jutted from its trunk, beetles, woodlice, spiders, millipedes and a host of minute springtails scurried away.At the top of the bank, where woodland and pasture met, long mounds clothed in emerald green moss lay almost in parallel down the slope. They were hedgerow elms killed 30 years ago by Dutch elm disease, sinking further into the humus every year while healthy young suckers, yet to succumb to the fungus, sprouted from their rootstocks.An oak had shed a limb, and with it the polypody fern whose long rhizomes crept under the blanket of moss on the branch. The fern fronds, adapted to an arboreal existence in the leaf canopy, had twisted, as if straining to regain the light, exposing clusters of golden sporangia underneath. They would soon discharge their invisible spores, to be wafted back up into leaf-mould-filled crevices in the canopy overhead.It is hard to avoid a sense of reverence when walking through woodland like this, with its endless cycles of regeneration and complexity, created by trees in every stage of existence, from newly germinated seedlings to fallen trunks in decay. It is a link with the past and a bridge to the future that many generations must have experienced.
