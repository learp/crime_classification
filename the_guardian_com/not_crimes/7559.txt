8.58pm GMT20:58So that’s it! The nation has decided, and we’ll be sending Joe and Jake to Stockholm in May! WOOOOO.In further exciting news, I will also be in Stockholm for the final, providing on-the-spot roving reporter input to Stu Heritage’s Eurovision liveblog. Could be amazing, might be a shambles the size of Russia, but do put 14th May in your diary nonetheless. In the meantime I might start a crowdfunding campaign so I can buy a Swedish beer while I’m there. Thank you all for joining in this evening, and for all your brilliant comments; you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens if you want to say hello, otherwise I’ll see you on May 14th! Cheers, HxFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.57pm GMT20:57Right, time to pick a winner. Who will it be? Loving Mel’s Star Baker gag.And our Eurovision entry for 2016 is…Joe & Jake!Oh. Well, the nation has chosen, and we must unite around this decision *game face*. We’ve got three months to polish it up, it will be fine.Updatedat 9.00pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.49pm GMT20:49Ah, last year’s Eurovision 60th birthday party. What a brilliant show that was, I’m feeling quite nostalgic.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.48pm GMT20:48The voting has closed! Time for some filler for a few minutes while they count the votes. Mel is padding valiantly.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.46pm GMT20:46Daughter has just asked if Terry is “the original Graham Norton”. It saddens me that a whole generation missed out on Terry making Eurovision amazing.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.43pm GMT20:43Time for a Terry Wogan interlude. Relax and enjoy, Eurovision will never see his like again.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.40pm GMT20:40Six minutes left to vote, so it must be time for another montage. If any of you are voting for Dulcima, we’re having words.

Oh well.Let’s enjoy Katrina singing Love Shine A Light instead. These were simpler times, this would get about three points these days.

Oh, it’s the fiddle-boy from Norway 2009.

FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.26pm GMT20:26So who are you voting for? I want Karl, but suspect we’re going to get Bianca (VOTE KARL VOTE KARL). That said, I’m not sure any of them are winning songs, but Karl, Bianca or Jake and Joe could definitely show us what the top half of the leaderboard looks like. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.23pm GMT20:23They’re singing ‘You’re Not Alone’, which is perfectly pleasant and nicely upbeat in a Coldplay-lite kind of way. Tepidplay, if you will. The words go “you’re not alone/we’re in this together/all that you want/I’m right here forever”, which ticks lots of my Eurovision lyrical guff boxes. I suspect this could grow on me.Updatedat 9.05pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.19pm GMT20:19And finally, it’s Joe and Jake, two moppet-haired chaps who were on The Voice, apparently, but not together. They are basically the spawn of Journey South.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.19pm GMT20:19The judges are excited about Bianca, and Katrina has lost the plot. She loves the lyrics because it’s about shining a light. We shone a light in 1997, and it was the last time we won. I hate power ballads, I’m sorry everyone.
