Cat Burglar is a thrilling book about a girl named Scarlet (also known as Scar) who is a schoolgirl by day and a cat burglar by night. Everything is fine until Scar finds an ancient Aztec bracelet with a legend behind it that threatens her whole life. When her dad goes missing Scar is forced to use the Aztec bracelet to her advantage but she is still unsure of its capabilities and strange things are happening. If you were Scar what would you do in a world of magic danger and theft?As I read this book I simply could not stop reading it and within two days I had finished it. It’s just one of those books that always seems to have something happening. As you read this book you will be drawn into Scar’s world and you will be sad when this book finishes. I think that it was the plot and storyline that intrigued me the most. I also love characters like Scar and Ethan who will do anything to make things right.The relationship between Scar and Ethan is a classic. Ethan is one of those boys that every girl likes so when he finds a girl called Scar who is determined to make him go away he is quite surprised. Scar on the other hand thinks that he is just an annoying boy who can’t keep his nose out of other people’s business. But she soon realises that she might need his help.The description is pretty good and there are no parts in the book that don’t make sense. I would recommend this book for ages 10 and up because of the criminal theme but otherwise everything else is fine. If you like a good book with mystery, adventure, transformation and magic then this book is for you.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
