Naturally, security is a growing global concern which should be at the forefront of everything else. However, repeatedly targeting Muslim women’s dress code and publicly humiliating them is not the solution (Armed French police pictured ordering woman to remove burkini on Nice beach, 24 August).Created bearing Muslim women in mind, the burkini is an all-in-one convenient sun- and waterproof swimsuit with the bonus of a swimming hat. Many non-Muslim women who feel uncomfortable wearing other forms of swimwear have worn this.A burkini is neither the swimwear equivalent of a burqa nor an Islamic item of clothing. There are no instructions in the Qur’an or Islamic teachings about it. It’s a modern-day innovation, which complies with health and safety regulations in a swimming pool. It does not replace the loose outer coat and head covering which Muslim women wear on a day-to-day basis.The best way forward to deal with safety and extremism is to educate and work with communities, so that they can become aware of security concerns and cooperate to pave the way for peace and harmony.Navida SayedLondon• The French police ordering a woman to remove her burkini reminds me of German soldiers herding Jews in occupied Poland. Where are the hundreds of French protesters in burkinis? Instead there are only passive, seemingly somewhat curious onlookers in bikinis. Why not remove that item of clothing instead? Wouldn’t that be in keeping with French tradition, which burkinis are said to offend against?Nick JacobsLondon• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
