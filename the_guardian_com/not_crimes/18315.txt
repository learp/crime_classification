Dan Brown’s Harvard “symbologist” Robert Langdon will dust off his tweed jacket and charcoal turtleneck and throw himself into another “earth-shaking” mystery in the bestselling author’s forthcoming novel Origin, his publishers announced on Wednesday.Out on 26 September 2017, Origin follows Brown’s other Langdon thrillers: The Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, The Lost Symbol and Inferno. It will be written, said his publishers, in keeping with Brown’s “trademark style” and sees the author interweaving “codes, science, religion, history, art and architecture”.“Origin thrusts Harvard symbologist Langdon into the dangerous intersection of humankind’s two most enduring questions, and the earth-shaking discovery that will answer them,” said his publishers Doubleday in the US and Transworld in the UK, in a note about the novel’s plot that is as cryptic as some of the mysteries Langdon has solved in the past.According to Brown’s publishers, there are more than 200m copies of his books in print worldwide. The Bookseller said that Brown has sold 16m print books in the UK, with The Da Vinci Code alone racking up sales of 4.5m copies. The most recent Langdon title, 2013’s Inferno, sold more than 1.6m copies in the UK, with combined hardback and paperback sales. A film adaptation of Inferno, starring Tom Hanks as Langdon, is due out shortly.

Nobody does thrills, spills and conspiracy theories like Dan Brown and the reading public’s appetite for Origin will, I’m sure, remain as keen as ever.”
