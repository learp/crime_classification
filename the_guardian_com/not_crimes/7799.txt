Raw eggs are safe for pregnant women to eat, a safety committee has recommended.A report from the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food states there is “very low” risk of salmonella from UK eggs produced under the Lion code.It is now recommending that the Food Standards Agency (FSA) considers amending its advice on eating eggs for those “vulnerable” to infection.The report says: “It was the strong view of the working group that there has been a major reduction in the microbiological risk from salmonella in UK hen shell eggs since the 2001 ACMSF report.“This is especially the case for those eggs produced under the Lion code quality assurance scheme.Should you eat eggs when pregnant? “In practical terms, the group considered that the ‘very low’ risk level means that UK eggs produced under the Lion code, or under demonstrably equivalent comprehensive schemes, can be served raw or lightly cooked to all groups in society, including those that are more vulnerable to infection, in domestic and non-domestic settings, including care homes and hospitals.”The committee adds that the recommendation is not intended to include “severely immunocompromised individuals”, but does include “vulnerable groups in general including pregnant women, the young and the elderly”.Historically the FSA’s advice has always been that “eating raw eggs, eggs with runny yolks or any food that is uncooked or only lightly cooked and contains raw eggs may cause food poisoning”.But it has now launched an eight-week consultation based on the outcome of the report.A statement from the FSA said: “Following committee approval and a UK-wide consultation of the report, the FSA has agreed to examine its advice taking into account the committee’s conclusions and recommendations.”
