What is it? The single best show ever made about being on the outside of the window, looking in, little realising your side of the window totally wins.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Why you’ll love it: Imagine if your school days really were the best days of your life. How low are your expectations that things will pick up in the future if those days of rejection, identity confusion and communal showering were your best bits? Freaks and Geeks is for those of us who wouldn’t go back there if you paid us. If you didn’t fit in, this exquisitely lovely 18-episode portrait of the 1980s American high-school experience will push every button on your Casio scientific calculator. And it will spell 55378008 (BOOBLESS).It was cancelled part-way through its first season, saved only by a vociferous fan campaign that ensured broadcast of the outstanding episodes, which had already been completed. See, even the show itself is the unpopular kid in the stairwell of life, misunderstood by all but a few people and insisting on wearing its cardigan pulled down over its hands.Executive producer Judd Apatow and creator Paul Feig went on to dominate the Hollywood comedy market with films including Knocked Up and Bridesmaids, but nothing they have done since Freaks and Geeks even begins to equal its delicate brilliance.The opening shot of episode one pans down from a jock and his cheerleader girlfriend snogging on the bleachers to the ones we’re really interested in: the unpopulars, skulking underneath the benches, knowing their place in the pecking order. The cast list reads like a roll-call of Before They Were Famous too. Linda Cardellini is Lindsay Weir (you might know her from ER and Mad Men), a good-hearted former mathlete, sullen yet principled, struggling with a burgeoning misfit identity, misunderstood by her wonderfully benign parents.

Lindsay’s equally brainy younger brother, Sam (John Francis Daley), knocks around with a most supreme bunch of geeks including the sublime Samm Levine as Neal Schweiber. Like a neurotic bank manager in kids’ clothes.Priya Elan signs up for class with writer of Freaks And Geeks, Gabe Sachs Every performance perfectly captures a facet of the frustration of youth, and the nicely judged adults are seen through that gauze of youthful exasperation. My favourite character is a straight tie between guidance counselor Jeff Rosso (David Gruber Allen), an ex-hippy treading that difficult line between authority figure and friend, and the majestic Martin Starr as geek czar Bill Haverchuck. It was his thumbnail sketch for the wondrous Gilfoyle, the character he went on to play in HBO’s Silicon Valley. If the geeks worshipped a god, it would have Martin Starr’s face.Above all, it is a show made with purest love and affection for the ones who couldn’t get the hang of high school. It’s not uniquely American or preoccupied with homecomings and proms. It just allows the small, everyday horrors of growing up to play out with minimum intervention and it’s beautiful.Where: UK Netflix.Length: 18 episodesStand-out episode: Every one a shining gem, but The Little Things (ep 17) is a masterclass of understated acting and writing with an intersex subplot and a visit from Vice-President George Bush.If you liked Freaks and Geeks, watch: Undeclared (Amazon Prime), My So Called Life (DVD).
