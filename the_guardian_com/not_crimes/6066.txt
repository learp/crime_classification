From a distance it appears as if a freak blizzard has left a layer of snow on the landward side of the dunes and the edges of the neighbouring fields. But what has been deposited by the wind is actually sand, the fine white sand that makes up the island’s beaches and is a key component of its coastal soils.With the exception of one or two small rocky headlands, South Uist’s western coast consists of almost unbroken beach backed by a line of dunes. These are the machair’s line of protection but they face constant onslaught from the sea and the weather.Marram grass, a plant ideally adapted to this environment, traps airborne particles, helping to begin the formation of new dunes and to stabilise those already established.Country diary: South Uist: Longer days bring more birds to the beach to feed But wild waves can still bite chunks out of their seaward fronts and damage can be caused by the action of high winds alone.A barely perceptible path that climbs to the top of the ridge and then descends steeply to the beach has provided sufficient weakness for the latest gale to exploit.The blast has hurled loose grains into the air, scouring the steeply sloping face until it has eroded a narrow but deep defile that reaches far into the wall of sand. Like an archaeological dig, the newly exposed sides reveal some of this dune’s story. A newly exposed skull shows where the remains of a sheep were buried and fragments of charred wood mark the place a fire once burned.It seems, though, that the damage to the dune was quickly noticed and a rather charming barrier is already in place. At each side of the gap, a fence post has been buried deep in the sand and a couple of weathered planks have been nailed between them. A large branch cast ashore by the sea has been added for further reinforcement and the whole structure given additional support by an oversized fishing float draped in net.Atop one of the posts, an upturned plant pot lends what is likely to be a short-lived touch of whimsy.Follow Country Diary on Twitter
