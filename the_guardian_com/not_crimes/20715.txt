The cover of American Vogue is hallowed fashion ground – trodden by luminaries including Michelle Obama, Cara Delevingne, Beyoncé and … Derek Zoolander, who can finally add Vogue to his portfolio of covers. Only the sixth man – and first male model – to feature in this most sacred space, that’s what happens when you’re so really, really good-looking that you can use Penelope Cruz as an accessory. With Blue Steel – or is that Magnum? Le Tigre? – gazing out of the frame, and a bird-covered Dolce & Gabbana suit, Annie Leibovitz’s job is a breeze. Arguably, Zoolander’s surprise turn on the Valentino catwalk last year has finally been topped.Zoolander continues his stellar work inside the magazine in a shoot that takes us behind the scenes in the life of the world’s most successful male model (note: Hansel’s presence is notably lacking here). Shots feature him in a horse saddle on a bed photographed by Cruz, having his trousers hemmed by a kneeling Alexander Wang, and in hair and makeup with Gigi Hadid, Jourdan Dunn and Joan Smalls. Just don’t mention ambi-turning and he’s absolutely flawless. For serious. Expect more on 12 February when Zoolander 2 is released.
