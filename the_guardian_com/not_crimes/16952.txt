Ranging from the Native American legend of the skinwalkers to the Salem witch trials, JK Rowling is about to release a series of new stories about the magical world to be found across the Atlantic from Hogwarts.Rowling’s website Pottermore will publish the first instalment in the new series, Magic in North America, at 2pm GMT, with three more stories to follow at the same time every day until 11 March. Pottermore promised the new writing from Rowling would “bring to light the history of this previously unexplored corner of the wizarding world”.The stories arrive ahead of the release of the film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them in November. Set in New York, 70 years before the events of the Harry Potter books, the film stars Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, author of the titular textbook which is used at Hogwarts.Last month, Rowling revealed that there were 11 wizarding schools in total, including Hogwarts, with North America’s location named Ilvermorny. “We were able to share with you the name of the North American wizarding school earlier this year, but there’s just so much more to tell you about witches and wizards across the world,” said Pottermore.The first instalment in the new series, called History of Magic in North America, will cover topics ranging from Ilvermorny to the American equivalent of the British magical government the Ministry of Magic: the Magical Congress of the United States of America, according to a video preview released by Entertainment Weekly.It will also cover the legend of skinwalkers, which in Navajo myth can take on the form of an animal, and the Salem witch trials, which took place in 17th-century Massachusetts.
