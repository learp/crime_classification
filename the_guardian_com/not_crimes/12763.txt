A device that can map caves and mines, strategies that have revolutionised orangutan management and a group of primary school children explaining friction have won the Eureka prizes from the Australian Museum.The awards were handed out in the fields of research and innovation, leadership and commercialisation, science communication and journalism, and school science on Wednesday night.Research which contradicted long-held beliefs that dingoes were "vermin" or pests when it came to the environment won the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage Eureka prize for environmental research.University of Tasmania professor Chris Johnson and his colleagues found dingoes could control kangaroo populations as well as suppress foxes and feral cats, and ecosystems with dingoes had vegetation in better condition as well as plenty of small native mammals."Dingoes arouse passionate feelings. This research will change attitudes and help us appreciate their ecological role," Frank Howarth, the director of the Australian Museum, said."The dingo looks like being rehabilitated as a useful member of the Australian environment and the researchers are already putting their work into practice in the management of Evelyn Downs station near Coober Pedy."Dr Kerrie Wilson of the University of Queensland also took out a prize for conservation work as she found targeting spending for the conservation of orangutans and their habitats was much more effective than spreading money across a lot of conservation areas.CSIRO scientist Dr Elliot Duff has invented a handheld laser scanner called a Zebedee which can map caves, mines and forests which were previously too difficult to map. His efforts won him the ANSTO Eureka prize for innovative use of technology.A group of students from Beauty Point primary school in Mosman won the Sydney Sleek Geeks Science Eureka prize for a film they made in which they explained friction with characters such as Professors Static, Slide, Rolling and Fluid.The Defence Science and Technology Organisation Eureka prize for outstanding science in safeguarding Australia was given to a team of scientists and engineers from various universities and agencies who have been working developing different techniques for manufacturing vehicle armour.The chief defence scientist, Dr Alex Zelinsky, congratulated the group, saying they were helping protect Australia's army personnel against "blast and ballistic threats".  "In addition to researching new protective materials, the team is exploring ways to optimise manufacturing techniques to ensure that the Australian defence industry can deliver high-quality products at an internationally competitive price," he said.
