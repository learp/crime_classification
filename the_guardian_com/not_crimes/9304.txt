Do not text and ride. That’s the message from the Dutch government, which is considering banning the country’s millions of cyclists from using their mobile phones while on two wheels. Utrecht's cycling lessons for migrants: 'Riding a bike makes me feel more Dutch' Young people cycling while using their phones is a common sight in this country of 17 million where, according to the cyclists’ union, there are more than 18 million bikes.The transport minister, Melanie Schultz van Haegen, told Dutch broadcaster NOS on Thursday that she was looking into the ban after calls to young people to leave their phones in their pockets while cycling failed to have much effect.She said a ban would be a clear signal to the main culprits that such activity was dangerous and ill-advised. The Dutch government said in 2014 that smartphones played a role in one-in-five bike accidents involving young cyclists.
