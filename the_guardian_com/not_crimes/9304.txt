Prof Tony Dyson, the British inventor who built the original Star Wars R2-D2 droid, has been found dead at his home in Malta.Police on the island of Gozo discovered the 68-year-old’s body on Thursday morning after being called by a concerned neighbour. A police spokesman, Kurt Bugeja Coster, said: “A neighbour realised the front door was open and called the police. Officers entered the apartment and he was found dead. Foul play has been excluded so far. An autopsy will be held to determine cause of death.”Dyson – who also worked on Superman II, Moonraker and Dragonslayer – was nominated for an Emmy award for his film special effects supervision.
