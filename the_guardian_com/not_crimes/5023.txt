From the layby on the pass zigzagging its way up the fell two figures are silhouetted above a crag over which ravens tumble and a buzzard soars. A woebegone Herdwick sheep is stuck below on a tiny ledge, trampled down to soil, and one of the figures – a gangling six-footer – points to this. He then uncoils a rope, to which he and his companion tie on at opposite ends. After the latter gets ready to pay it out round his waist, the rope-uncoiler begins to descend, peering down for available footholds on the wet, mossy face below.Much shouting then ensues to the effect that the climber will try to descend below the sheep, then cut back across in an attempt to scare the stricken animal up to a higher ledge where it will be easier to lasso and extricate. As he finally inches himself across the void, the rope snags on a rock, putting him in a decidedly precarious position and providing no help at all. No longer does it reach him in a straight line, but comes across from the side at 90 degrees to create an L shape. Definitely, this is no place to fall.Suddenly, as a raven swoops by with an ominous croak, the sheep makes a frantic leap for freedom off the crag overhead. Quick as a flash, he grabs it with one hand, only for the lump of heather he has presumably been clutching with the other to snap and precipitate him into freefall. He – with the sheep still in his clutches – goes flying into the ghyll. Only just as they are about to smash into the rocks below the rope miraculously twangs tight, saving them in the nick of time."My new jeans!" he yells, inspecting the damage. Meanwhile, his companion above has been dragged to the crag's brink, and has obviously not been belayed to any anchor. Only then does the rescuer let the sheep go. It trots away bleating.
