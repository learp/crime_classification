When it became apparent that Amazon would be branching out, seriously, into “fashion”, there were mixed feelings. It’s hard to quibble with free shipping, but what did a site dedicated to books and secateurs know about fashion? And with online shopping already pretty standard, who would even buy clothes on Amazon? Still, it took a punt, and this February, it’s the US site quietly rolled out seven new “private labels” for seven different customers.

All familiar-sounding brands which were in fact newly minted by Amazon (it is reported to have hired former head of Marks & Spencer’s womenswear, Frances Russell) and all, it transpired, a little bit naff. Scout + Ro does a nice line in childrenswear, and there are a few nods to the Roland Mouret Galaxy dress in Society New York – but otherwise, the US malls shouldn’t be too nervous just yet. But then perhaps this was the point? As Wired magazine pointed out, Amazon is data-driven. It has worked out where the gaps are, what people want that doesn’t exist, and designed these collections to plug those holes. “When we see gaps, when certain brands have decided for their own reasons not to sell with us, our customer still wants a product like that,” said Jeff Yurcisin, vice president of Amazon Fashion, during a fashion-industry conference last autumn. Even if a black seamless turtleneck dress (snore) isn’t your bag, it’s probably someone else’s.

And as yet, there are no concrete plans to bring these labels to Europe. Things are very much in the ‘trial-and-error phase’ – “we haven’t made any announcements on this topic in UK or Europe” says a spokesperson for the UK site “and we don’t comment on future plans or speculation.” And with the recent announcement of Italian fashion blogger, Chiara Ferragni, aka TheBlondeSalad.com (one of the most influential people on social media), as its European brand ambassador for Spring/Summer 2016, perhaps that will change. As the face (and body) of Amazon’s high street concessions like New Look, Superga and French Connection, Ferragni’s appointment should inject a little personality into the site, which may pave the way for its own fashion labels to take root. As she puts it, to be on trend nowadays “you don’t need to live in a fashion capital of the world, have lots of money, or to be able to shop during certain hours”.

Not least in light of the New York Times expose which revealed the company’s working conditions, the tax stuff, the drone-touting, the frozen food and its seemingly single-minded commitment to killing bookshops (although to be fair, their plans to open bricks-and-mortar versions should be lauded). But if there’s one thing our fractured online shopping habits tell us, we like to buy online and we like to buy cheap, so having a go at fashion seems like the next logical conclusion. Plus, Amazon already has a longstanding, if unfeted, relationship with fashion. In 2012, it sponsored the Met Gala at the Costume Institute. In 2015 it hired Vogue online editor, Caroline Palmer, as director of editorial and social. Last autumn, it collaborated with hip designer Solange Azagury-Partridge to relaunch her famous lip rings. It has twice collaborated with neon pioneers, British designers Meadham Kirchoff (in 2012 and again in 2013) and just signed up Mango, Ghost (the 1990s revival is one of its recent womenswear edits) and Georg Jensen. Big sellers include high-waist Levi jeans and Harrington jackets and it remains a go-to e-site for normcore fanatics (Fruit of the Loom and Adidas are among their go-to labels). There are varying price points, too, presumably because they source the pieces from different sellers in a bid to get the lowest possible price.Amazon already sits on the frontline of quick-to-click consumerism, delivered with the speed of a MiG-25. They once trialled a button in your toilet which you pressed to re-order loo roll. Imagine being droned a pair of shoes within the hour. That aside, none of this changes the fact that Amazon is just better as utility than luxury and that will probably never change.
