It's no Christmas No 1, but AI-generated song brings festive cheer to researchers Most Christmas songs rely on bells and choirs, but what magic ingredient makes a classic?Well, it depends on where you live. Christmas songs don’t travel all that well. All of the 10 most-streamed Christmas songs in north America are by north American artists. In the UK, aside from Mariah Carey and Michael Bublé, the top 10 are all British or Irish. In 2015, the top three Christmas tracks streamed on Spotify in the UK were Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas is You, Wham!’s Last Christmas and Fairytale of New York by the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl. It looks as if it will be the same three this year, too.According to data from Radiomonitor, which tracks 738 radio stations in the UK, these three songs also topped the radio charts. By this measure, the Pogues claimed the No 1 spot. Taken together, these three songs were heard no fewer than 404 million times on the radio over the course of the Christmas period – from the start of November to the middle of January.Radio does not always reflect what listeners pick and choose on Spotify. Slade’s Merry Xmas and East 17’s Stay Another Day, for example, are chosen far more often by radio producers than by Spotify users. On Christmas Day itself, there’s little escape. Of the 200 most-played songs on Spotify on 25 December, 139 were festive numbers. But the mood is short-lived – within four days, only two songs make the list. And that magic ingredient?
