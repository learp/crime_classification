Name: BandanaAKA: Kerchief, hanky.Appearance: Brightly coloured square of cloth, often decorated with a paisley pattern.Age: It’s not easy to say when someone invented square pieces of cloth. Let’s just say old.And as popular as ever, right? I mean, who doesn’t love a square piece of cloth? Well, that depends. Some hijabs are basically big squares of cloth. Not everybody likes hijabs.True. But bandanas are different, right? Well, US gang members often indicate their allegiance with a bandana. They can get quite worked up about it.Sure, but for most people bandanas are just an accessory? Maybe not for much longer. A group of fashion influencers, led by the super-blogger Imran Amed, have launched a campaign for people to wear white bandanas “as a sign to the world that we believe in unity and inclusivity for all humankind”.OK. White bandanas only cost a pound or two online. They suggest you tag pictures of yourself wearing one with #tiedtogether, then donate to the American Civil Liberties Union or the UN Refugee Agency.I see. So this is an anti-Trump, anti-Brexit thing? Heavens, no. “This is not a political statement,” says the campaign page. “It is a positive statement in support of humanity during a time of turmoil and fear in many nations around the world.”But if you support Trump or Brexit, isn’t this a time to be pleased that things are going so well? I suppose they have red baseball caps for that.True. Anyway, you’ll still want to copy the cool kids. Gigi Hadid and other models launched the campaign at the Tommy Hilfiger show in LA. Hadid’s boyfriend, Zayn Malik, also wore one to the Billboard Power 100 Celebration.How did those cool kids, who I have now heard of, style their bandanas? Good fashion question.Thanks. Well, Hadid and Malik tied them to their left wrist, but you could put it round your leg or your neck, or in a pocket, or wear it as a headscarf.Like the Queen? I suppose. Just express yourself, basically.How about I stick one up my nose? Would that be fashion-forward? Um, in a way.Do say: “A white bandana will liven up any outfit, and make a subtle and positive statement .”Don’t say: “Plus it covers up my Livestrong wristband.”
