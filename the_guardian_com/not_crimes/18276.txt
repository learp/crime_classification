John Hiatt and Glyn Johns – Real Fine LoveJohn Hiatt is one of my favourite American singer-songwriters. This is a west coast, feelgood song from the album that the legendary Glyn Johns produced. They put together an all-star band for this record, including Pat Donaldson, Mike Henderson and Ethan Johns on drums. A great song to drive along with.

It’s one of the coolest guitar riffs I’ve heard. Buddy Miller is certainly one of the great players out there. Go Jane Go – Somewhere Beyond the RosesI saw this band when I was in Australia on tour two years ago. It’s a collaboration between the fine songwriting skills of David Francey and Kieren Kane. It’s stripped back to just rolling banjo and vocals. It’s relatively unknown but certainly one of my favourite records. Martin Hayes and Dennis Cahill – Joe’s ReelHayes is such a wonderful, soulful fiddle player. This is a tune that reminds me of my wedding day. A very good friend played us down the aisle to this.

It won Grammy awards and really pushed the boundaries. This is one of my favourite songs from the record. Producer T-Bone Burnett as ever creates such a striking sounding sonic record.
