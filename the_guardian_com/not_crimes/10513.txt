The BBC will attempt this week to reassure independent TV producers fearful that last week’s loss of The Great British Bake Off will lead to a flood of popular shows leaving the corporation.The departure of Bake Off is expected to loom large at a meeting between the BBC and around 300 independents at its central London headquarters on Wednesday, organised before last week’s shock announcement.Channel 4’s poaching of The Great British Bake Off, made by the independent Love Productions, is one of the biggest programme losses for the BBC in recent years and comes only a week before the £3bn independent sector is given the chance to make more of the corporation’s most popular shows.In return, the government will let the BBC commercialise its programme-making arm, BBC Studios. It hopes this will stem the tide of talent leaving for bigger salaries in the independent sector.The corporation will tell the independent producers it plans to open up competition for 40% of the network drama, comedy, entertainment and factual programmes currently made in-house over the next two years.

But losing its highest-rated programme less than a year after it lost the talent show The Voice is a blow for BBC1.Some producers think the balance of power may be shifting away from broadcasters to format owners and the channels may fight back. One programme-maker, who did not wish to be named, said: “If I was the BBC, I would make sure when I did deals that they were for the life of series so they only left when the broadcaster did not want it any more.” He added that the fates of The Voice and now Bake Off have certainly focused minds “on who owns formats”.A BBC source said: “It’s nonsense to say a deal couldn’t be done [for Bake Off]. We made a very strong offer, everyone understands why the production company made the choice they made.”Amanda Ross, co-founder of Cactus TV, which makes hit BBC culinary series Saturday Kitchen, and transferred Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan from ITV to Channel 4 in 2001, thinks Bake Off’s move will “be chronic for independents and anybody who’s a rights owner, because ultimately an idea is worth nothing until it’s been broadcast.“The broadcasters have the complete power. Having the idea is the easy bit, getting it on is the hard bit. Now I think the broadcasters will tie deals down even more firmly at the point of commission, because they realise you can only sell a format internationally if you’ve got a primary broadcaster, so the primary broadcaster is going to go after you harder for your rights.”John McVay, chief executive of the producers’ alliance Pact, warned that there were protections for producers within the terms of trade agreed between broadcasters and producers, and pointed out they were given a clean bill of health by the government in May: “If any broadcaster were to think about introducing [restrictive] clauses on producers who are entitled to the terms of trade, then Pact would take a hard line on that.”
