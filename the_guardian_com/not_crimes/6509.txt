Arriving onstage again for the night‚Äôs big award, she‚Äôs tearful and unprepared. ‚ÄúAs you can see it took an army to make me strong and willing again‚Äù she says as the crew who worked on the album enter the stage with her.She talks about how difficult motherhood is and again talks about the importance of Beyonce. She says that Lemonade is a monumental, soul-bearing album and again drops a swear which gets bleeped out. ‚ÄúThe way you make my black friends feel is empowering‚Äù - she says before thanking her family.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.37am GMT04:37WINNER: Adele, Hello - record of the yearBenjamin Lee  Photograph: Michael Kovac/WireImageCountry‚Äôs power couple Faith Hill and Tim McGraw have just presented the penultimate award to Adele who wins again for her big comeback single.‚ÄúYou cut him off last time!‚Äù she shouts as she gives the microphone to her producer Greg Kurstin.

It‚Äôs also a rather admirably extensive list, highlighting the lesser known figures as well.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.23am GMT04:23Benjamin LeeHilariously, James Corden just pretended Kanye was coming on but, get this, he isn‚Äôt!

Beyonce and Jay Z are both chewing gum while they watch, bored.It‚Äôs a call to Trump essentially for him not to affect any laws that protect musicians and their rights.

There‚Äôs almost too much going on at times but it‚Äôs all good stuff at least. It‚Äôs always worth remembering, with a touch of bitterness perhaps, that Chance the Rapper is just 23 years old.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.09am GMT04:09Benjamin LeePentatonix doing a rather heinous Jackson 5 cover now.

They go into Jungle Love with Morris Day on fine form ‚Äì he‚Äôs demanding everyone gets up and the majority of people comply.They then go into The Bird as Rihanna and Beyonce look on approvingly. They‚Äôve not gone for the big hits here but people are losing it - even the yellow haired Twenty One Pilot is getting down.Bruno Mars is back to perform Let‚Äôs Go Crazy, which ups the glam from The Time but loses on authenticity points. Mars pulls off a decent guitar solo, and then gets intimate with his guitar‚Äôs neck.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.48am GMT03:48A gif that is worth your attentionA Popular Nobody (@ImNyce908)She real RT @theNFLchick: RT @BradySpears: Can we please just appreciate Rihanna for a second üòÇ pic.twitter.com/SWLdkyIPQrFebruary 13, 2017FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.46am GMT03:46A Tribe Called Quest get politicalLanre Bakare  A Tribe Called Quest and Busta Rhymes Photograph: Jared Siskin/Getty ImagesSolange introduces Anderson Paak and A Tribe Called Quest, who dedicate their performance to Phife Dawg and all the people around the world who are holding politicians to account.
