Not to wish the summer away or anything, but it is only a couple of weeks until the September fashion glossies land on newsagents’ shelves, their club sandwich thickness the first reminder that the back-to-school season will soon roll around. It is the one aspect of summer being finite that comes as a relief. An endless summer would be idyllic in pretty much all other ways, except the matter of what to wear.Autumn clothes mark a return to solid ground. Proper shoes instead of sandals with snap-prone straps. The familiar rote layering of a jumper over a shirt, as reassuring as butter on toast. I’ve nothing against kaftans on the beach, but smart-ish daytime, which is a dress code most of us have to adhere to a lot of the time, is difficult in summer. What it boils down to is that when you dress lightweight, you look like a lightweight, and so summer dressing is never as easy as it should be. A shirtdress has that trenchcoat-ish thing of looking appealingly crisp and chic on the hanger or page, but somehow dissolving into a crumpled blob when you put it on.Something unexpected has happened this summer. The kind of celebrities you assume are utterly irrelevant to actual, real, grownup life – Gigi Hadid, the bit-part Kardashians – have come up with a trend that has useful application in the real world of tricky summer dressing. What you do is pick a pale shade – blush, beige, grey – and wear more or less the same colour from top to toe. Including shoes and coat: that part is important. But that’s all there is to it. It’s not rocket science, the world of celebrity fashion.What I wore this week: bright patches | Jess Cartner-Morley It seems a counterintuitive way to dress. I feel like I’m at risk of dissolving into a blur. Surely a navy blazer or a bright white shoe would give the look a sharper edge? But the consistency of colour makes a simple outfit – a skirt, a stretchy top, a light top layer – look considered. Formalises it, somehow. (All white works, too, but only when boxfresh.) The modern way to shade all comers this summer? Stay pale all over.• Jess wears pleated jacket, £39.99, zara.com. Top, £25, missselfridge.com. Skirt, £17.99, mango.com. Shoes, £70, dunelondon.com.
