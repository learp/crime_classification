Drifting from the blaze of gorse flowers warmed by the morning sun comes the heady scent of coconut. Sunlight sparks silvery flashes from the surface of the loch, while a sky of unbroken blue arches overhead from the mountains to the sea. Peaceful though the morning undoubtedly is, it is by no means quiet. A lamb is letting forth a series of plaintive wails, which gradually become more and more frantic until its deeper-voiced mother answers as she appears over the crest of a rise.More musical by far is the unceasing sound of singing skylarks: two can be heard at once, one nearby, the other further away, pouring forth their music as they climb skywards. One finally falls silent, only for another to begin its own song.While some lapwings are already being incubated, others are still displaying and, though they can't compete with the skylarks for musicality, they seem the perfect expression of spring's joyful exuberance with their swooping two-note calls echoing the spectacular diving and tumbling of their aerobatic flight. Almost equally vocal are the redshanks somewhere away on the far side of the loch. They're well known for their alertness to danger and the far-carrying nature of their alarm calls, which has earned them the name "sentinel of the marshes", but this morning there is no alarm, just a series of fluting calls as birds lift off and then settle again a short distance away, wings momentarily aloft.From its perch on top of a mass of gorse flowers, a wren, tail held high, lets loose a song of ringing notes and rattling trills whose volume seems in inverse proportion to the size of the bird. All the way along the track from the fenced pasture, past the loch and over the machair, we are accompanied by the sound of birds, and only as we reach the top of the dunes and scramble down to the beach does the birdsong fade behind us and the song of the sea take over.
