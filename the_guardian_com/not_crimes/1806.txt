Rice makes me nervous. My first job in journalism involved summarising the day’s news into bite-sized chunks, which meant I had to read all the papers at great speed after very little sleep. As time passed, I would remember the stories, but forget where I had read them. You can see the problem: the headline “undercooked rice causes heart attacks” should be taken seriously in the pages of the Guardian, of course, but in the pages of, say, the Daily Mail, less so.Still, years later, the lasting legacy of that first job has been to create a sense of faint unease whenever the subject of rice is brought up in our house. (See also: Wi-Fi routers, tight underwear and contactless cards, though, happily, I don’t have to cook with any of those.)Whenever my partner suggests rice, I tend to retreat to risotto – hard to get wrong. So I came to Delia’s guide to cooking rice from a position of weakness, always a good way to come to Delia.I can’t quite work out if cooking with Delia is closest to dealing with a mafia don or a stern headmistress – woe betide you if you go back on your end of the arrangement.How I 'made a potato really taste like a potato' | The Delia Project Happily, Delia’s first rule for cooking rice is to “memorise three simple little words: leave it alone!”. Distance cooking is an art that comes easily to me, in part because, like most people, I tend to cook at the end of a long day. A decent meal that can be cooked with the minimum of stirring and attention suits me to a T.Benign neglect – so often the enemy of my cooking – will, Delia promises, be the agent of rice that “always stays light and fluffy, with absolutely every grain remaining separate”. No wooden spoon, no stirring, just patience – and the results are all but guaranteed. Provided, that is, that you don’t neglect your timer: timings here are crucial.Rice comes in two colours – brown, which has more flavour, but takes longer to cook, and white, which loses some flavour in processing, but can be prepared in just 15 minutes. After selfless experimentation (or greed, depending on your perspective), in practice, your best bet is just to start the brown stuff before preparing anything else – rice holds its temperature well, so by the time you’ve prepared a chilli or a curry, your brown rice will be ready and warm. The real game-changer is to measure your rice by volume, not by weight. The colour of your rice selected, and Delia being Delia, there are, of course, rules to be followed. The important one – and in terms of the quality of my rice, the real game-changer – is to measure your rice by volume, not by weight.As is becoming standard, I ignore Delia’s instruction to heap salt into the mix – she wants a teaspoon of the stuff for every five ounces (140g) of rice. In my view there will be more than enough salt, flavourwise, in whatever you make to accompany it, although your mileage may vary.Rule 5 is where Delia’s mafioso tendencies come to the fore – she wants money, or in Deliaspeak, “investment” in a 25cm frying pan with a lid. I pay the toll, and the Delia-approved pan works like a charm. I really can’t speak highly enough of mine, which I bought via Delia’s own website. Although I worry that by telling you, I really have sold my soul for a serving of perfect rice.Stephen’s task is to cook his way through Delia’s Complete How To Cook (BBC Books, £40) in a year; @stephenkb.
