Judi Dench has revealed that she has had her first tattoo at 81 – and the new marking on her wrist reads “carpe diem”. She got it as a surprise birthday present from her daughter, and said that the words were her motto in life. But how many others, like Dench, get ink done later in life?According to a YouGov survey, half of people with tattoos in America and Britain got their first by the age of 21. A closer look at the US data shows that 39% got their first tattoo between 15 and 19, and one in four went under the needle after they turned 30. A survey from Remember a Charity also found that 5% got their first tattoo after turning 60.Other older celebrities to have gone under the needle include David Dimbleby, who at the age of 75 and while filming Britain and the Sea for BBC1, got a two-and-a-half inch tattoo of a scorpion. He was apparently inspired by Winston Churchill’s anchor tattoo.Are you someone who got a tattoo later in life? If so, we want to hear about why you did it.
