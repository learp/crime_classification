Photographs of Daniel Day Lewis filming in Whitby have emerged via the website of a local photographer, appearing to confirm speculation that a long-rumoured collaboration between the actor and director Paul Thomas Anderson is under way – the first since Day Lewis’ Oscar-winning turn in 2007’s There Will Be Blood.The most exciting films of 2017: returning auteurs Pictures posted by Whitby-based photographer Glenn Kilpatrick show cast and crew, including Day Lewis, working in the tiny village of Lythe, to the north of Whitby, and Robin Hood’s Bay, to the south. Costumes and props – including a number of period cars – indicate the film is set in the 1950s.This would tie in with reports last year that Anderson and Day Lewis were about to start filming a “50s fashion drama”, with a $35m budget. There is some confusion as to whether the film is set in London or New York – though if, as some have speculated, Day Lewis is playing the real life figure of fashion designer Charles James, it could be both, as James worked in both cities.No official title for the film has yet been revealed, but reports from the set indicate it is going by the title Phantom Thread. A UK company was set up in that name in 2009, with celebrated producer Megan Ellison as the sole named director.
