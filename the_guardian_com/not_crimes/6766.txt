The recipePeel half a medium-sized cucumber, halve lengthways then scrape the seeds and core out with a teaspoon and discard. Cut the cucumber into slices about 1cm thick and place them in a mixing bowl.Cut 8 radishes into quarters then add them to the cucumber. Remove all the skin and white pith from a plump, ripe lemon. Separate the segments from their white skin, then slice each one very finely. Toss the lemon with the radish and cucumber. Add 1 heaped tbsp of chopped fresh dill.Fold 4 tbsp of double cream into the salad ingredients and season with salt and black pepper.Coarsely crush 1 tsp of black peppercorns. Lightly oil, then season 2 tuna steaks, each weighing approximately 200g, with salt and the crushed peppercorns. Either grill or shallow fry the tuna in 2 tbsp of olive oil, whichever you prefer. Divide the cucumber salad between two plates then place the tuna of top of each.The trickThe sharp acid notes of the lemon and cucumber salad work neatly with the oily flesh of the tuna. Taste the salad as you go. If you feel it is too sour, then add a little sugar, pinch by pinch. The salad should retain some sharpness. Avoid making the salad too far in advance, so it stays crisp.The twistUse mackerel, which will substantially cut the cost of the dish. If you donâ€™t fancy fish, then roast a couple of chicken breasts with olive oil, salt, pepper and thyme until their skin is crisp. Slice them into thick pieces then toss them, while still warm, with the cucumber and lemon salad.Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
