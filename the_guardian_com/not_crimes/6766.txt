4.05am BST04:05Madonna's Prince tribute  Prince Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APMadonna starts with an intro of Let’s Go Crazy before she segues into Nothing Compares 2 U while sat on a purple throne (of course). She’s doing well, and the words HOPE and BROTHER splash up on the big screen and a full orchestra play in the background.Pictures of Prince now roll through in a slide show. Now Stevie Wonder is here to perform a duet of Purple Rain, Rihanna does a dap in the front row as they rock back and forth. It feels like the Billboard Awards just went to church. Madonna ends by thanking Prince.And … that’s a wrap. There were some questionable moments but the live performances from Celine Dion, Ariana Grande, Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and Madonna all delivered. Perhaps understandably, it was the lower order – dare I say, filler – performances which really fell flat.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.50am BST03:50"His departure was an earthquake"  Prince Photograph: Chris O'Meara/APQuestlove from the Roots is paying tribute to Prince before Madonna comes on. This is really moving and his voice is cracking: “Everytime we hear a really good guitar solo, we’re going to remember,” he says. Prince is in everything, he argues.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.48am BST03:48WINNER!

She moves away from the props and gets lined up for a dance routine. It’s a pretty staggering difference in sound compared to our opener Britney, who not so long ago was occupying a similar place to Grande. This is fairly sophisticated dance-pop with a subtle dance routine with Grande’s vocals placed front and centre. Best performance of the night so far, I reckon.Updatedat 4.01am BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.36am BST03:36WINNER! - Rihanna (Billboard Chart Achievement Award)  Rihanna Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APRihanna picks up this seemingly meaningless award, which has been doled out so that she doesn’t go home empty handed.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.28am BST03:28ARIANA GRANDE PERFORMS IN 11 MINUTES  Abby Travis, Gina Schock, Belinda Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin, and Charlotte Caffey of music group The Go-Go’s Photograph: David Becker/Getty ImagesThe Go-Gos are getting the Trainor treatment here as Grande steals their thunder.

Seal says it was “exquisite” and that there’s a surprise … Dion’s son is going to give her the award. Great for her, a bit boring for the rest of us. It’s all a bit too much for Dion, who looks genuinely overwhelmed. Her husband and manager René Angélil died in January and she specially thanks him in an emotional acceptance speech which gets a standing ovation.

It’s a pretty unlikely combo and they’ve created an Adele-esque rendition, turning the track into a very sultry number.It’s captivating stuff and the arena is respectfully silent as Kesha slowly ratchets up the volume.
