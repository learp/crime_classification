This may seem an unusual way to cook steak, but a light touch preserves the integrity of the meat and produces the juiciest melt-in-the-mouth steaks you can imagine. The garnishes are very much a reflection of what is around at the moment, so feel free to substitute as you see fit.(Serves 4)For the steak:450g good-quality aged hanger steak, well trimmed5 tbsp salted butter, melted Sea salt and black pepper For the salad:6 tomatoes of different shapes, colours and sizes, wedged and sliced1 medium-sized head of fennel, thinly sliced 4 large bulb spring onions, sliced in half lengthways3 tbsp roasted cashew nuts, chopped 6 tsp extra-virgin olive oil, for dressing For the sauce:½ bunch coriander, leaves picked and stalks discarded½ bunch sorrel ¼ bunch parsley4 spring onion tops, sliced6-7 large, fresh mint leaves½ seeded jalapeño pepper 500ml apple juice Salt, to taste Extra-virgin olive oil, for garnish Season the steak well and bring to room temperature.In a very hot non-stick pan, sear the meat on each side for 30 seconds, then remove from heat. Repeat this procedure six times, allowing the meat to rest in between, and reseason with a little sea salt each time. After the sixth time, let it rest and slice it into long, thin slices – it should be nice and pink, but warm all the way through. Season the steak again and coat with the melted butter.Mix together the tomatoes, fennel and cashews, and season with salt, pepper and olive oil. Sear the spring onions in the steak pan until they brown but retain their crunch.Blend all the sauce ingredients until smooth, then season and blend again.On a large platter, arrange the meat on the sauce with the salad on top. Scatter over the grilled spring onions, drizzle with a little olive oil and serve.
