Emma Watson has said she felt as if she was “meeting her older self” as she embraced the actor who plays Hermione in JK Rowling’s new stage play. Watson portrayed Hermione Granger in eight Harry Potter films and now Noma Dumezweni is starring as an older version of the character in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in London’s West End.Noma Dumezweni on playing Hermione in Harry Potter: 'we all aspire to be her' Watson posted a series of photographs on Facebook of herself with Dumezweni and the crew of the play backstage after watching the show and said the production helped her reconnect with the character.She wrote: “Yesterday I went to see the Cursed Child. I came in with no idea what to expect and it was amazing.“Some things about the play were, I think, possibly even more beautiful than the films. Having seen it, I felt more connected to Hermione and the stories than I have since Deathly Hallows came out, which was such a gift.“Meeting Noma and seeing her on stage was like meeting my older self and have her tell me everything was going to be all right, which as you can imagine was immensely comforting – and emotional!Casting a spell: meet the characters of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child “The cast and crew welcomed me like I was family and Noma was everything I could ever hope she would be. She’s wonderful. The music is beautiful … I could go on …”Watson is currently taking a year off from acting but will soon be seen in Disney’s live-action version of Beauty and the Beast, which is due for release next year.
