When Tottenham Hotspur were on their way to victory against Millwall in the FA Cup recently, fans launched into the traditional adaptation of Doris Day’s 1956 hit Que Sera, Sera about the promise of going to Wemberlee. The Millwall fans responded with “Que sera, sera, whatever will be will be, we’re going to Shrewsbury”. This hit the perfect bathetic note and won them a round of applause. Mark Radcliffe delves into the history of such improvised terrace songs in From Doris to Depeche (16 April, 7.30pm, 5 Live).In The Shock (18 April, 11am, Radio 4) Jude Rogers, whose father died suddenly when she was five, talks to people who have suffered comparable traumas and looks at how we deal with sudden assaults on our certainties. She also spends time with a trauma doctor who frequently has to deal with his own shock alongside that of his patients.Showbusiness has its rituals for dealing with stress, some of which are detailed in The Half: A Countdown to Performance (17 April, 11am, Radio 4). Fiona Lindsay visits an actor preparing to go on in the West End, snooker player Steve Davis as he gets ready to compete, a surgeon about to operate and a rabbi due to conduct a funeral service to learn of the techniques that ensure we can think about our duties without being overwhelmed by them.Andrew Martin is the best exponent of The Essay (Weekdays, 10.45pm, Radio 3). His patient, schoolmasterly delivery works best when exploring social phenomena that are, as the title of this short series suggests, Hanging On. He begins on Monday with the innocent pleasure involved in the sailing of model boats and finds that even here there are rules.Simon Russell Beale plays the composer and Melody Grove his wife in Bach: The Great Passion (15 April, 2.30pm, Radio 4), a dramatisation of the events leading up to the performance of the St Matthew Passion in Leipzig at Easter 1727. Bach’s duties included getting the odd tune out of pupils at the local school. To reflect this the musical sequences were recorded in Edinburgh’s Greyfriars Kirk with the choir and musicians of the Dunedin Consort and the choristers of St Mary’s Music School.I make no apology for the fact I like to hear people talk about work. It’s the acceptable way of talking about life and people. Lucy Kellaway’s columns in the Financial Times lend themselves to podcasts because they usually consist of her giving a brisk ticking off to some CEO or subversively wondering whether we’re really as busy as we pretend we are. The Kellaway world is the world of the FTSE 100. Others may recognise their world in Eat Sleep Work Repeat. This podcast is the side project of Bruce Daisley who works at Twitter. It consists of him talking to experts about what makes us happy at work and why.
