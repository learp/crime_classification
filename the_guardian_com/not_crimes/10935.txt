The Fairphone, the first smartphone to be marketed as being free of “conflict minerals”, has arrived in the UK this week, after the Phone Co-op inked an exclusive distribution deal for the new technology.The Phone Co-op is the UK’s only consumer-owned mobile phone operator, offering a range of services through its Co-operative Mobile, Co-operative Business Telecoms, and Co-operative Phone and Broadband brands.The organisation announced yesterday that it has become the exclusive UK stockist of the Fairphone, which was launched earlier this year following a successful crowd-funding campaign designed to finance the development of a new smartphone built to stringent ethical and environmental standards.“We are delighted that our partnership with Fairphone means we are able to build on our reputation as the leading ethical provider of telecoms, by supplying what must be the most ethical mobile handset on the market,” said Vivian Woodell, chief executive of the Phone Co-op. “Fairphone’s initiative raises awareness of important issues about the supply chain for products we use every day. This partnership brings together two of Europe’s most radical and dynamic social enterprises, organisations with shared values, to make a difference in our industry.”The development of the Fairphone came as a response to concerns that mainstream smartphones are often reliant on minerals sourced from conflict zones and can be manufactured in factories that fail to meet high labour and environmental standards.Phone manufacturers such as Apple and Nokia have launched a host of initiatives in recent years to enhance their environmental credentials, but the team behind the Fairphone maintain there is pent up demand for a smartphone that makes ethical standards its key selling point.Consequently, the tin and tantalum in the Fairphone are sourced through the Conflict Free Tin Initiative and the Solutions for Hope sustainable supply chain initiatives in a bid to ensure the materials are sourced from conflict-free mines.Moreover, the phone is manufactured under an innovative contract that funds a worker-controlled welfare fund for investment in the local community.Meanwhile, the phone makes use of micro-USB charging standards, allows for the battery to be replaced, and includes two SIM slots so people can use the same handset for their work and personal phones, all in a bid to reduce the level of e-waste associated with the phone.The Phone Co-op said the new phone would be available from £22 a month through the Co-operative Mobile and from £21.50 a month, excluding VAT, from the Co-operative Business Telecoms.
