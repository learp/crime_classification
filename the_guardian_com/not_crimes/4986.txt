Michel Roux Jr’s failure to pay chefs the minimum wage at his Mayfair restaurant has been attacked as “simply not acceptable” by an industry body led by rival celebrity chef Raymond Blanc.The revelation that Le Gavroche had paid some chefs as little as £5.50 per hour was “a massive own goal” for an industry struggling to attract and retain quality employees, according to the Sustainable Restaurant Association.Blanc is the president of the SRA, which rates restaurants’ sourcing of ingredients, environmental impact and treatment of staff. Its findings form part of the judging process by the Harden’s restaurant guide which this month declared Le Gavroche London’s “top gastronomic experience”. TV chef Michel Roux Jr paid kitchen staff below minimum wage Following a Guardian investigation this week into pay and hours at his Michelin-starred restaurant, Roux admitted undercutting the legal minimum wage in some cases and announced pay rises and cuts to hours after chefs said they had routinely worked about 65 hours per week for annual salaries of around £19,000.“Hard-working chefs and front-of-house staff are the lifeblood of the restaurant industry and deserve to be paid a wage commensurate with their skills, time and effort,” said a spokesman for the SRA. “For an industry with a huge skills gap desperate to attract and retain quality employees it is a massive own goal for one of its best-known names to be paying below the legal minimum.”The SRA’s members include TV chefs Jamie Oliver, Rick Stein and Thomasina Miers.Blanc’s Oxfordshire restaurant Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons pays staff at least the £8.45 per hour “national living wage”. Both Blanc and Roux have two Michelin stars, ranking theirs among the top 25 restaurants in the country.On Thursday trade union organisers and restaurant industry watchers said the kind of underpayment exposed at Le Gavroche may be endemic. “I would be very surprised if this practice is not more widespread,” said Peter Harden, who publishes the Harden’s restaurant guide. “Restaurants operate on very thin margins and many of the lowest-paid people in the country work in restaurant kitchens. Away from the glamour of the TV studios, the world painted by George Orwell [in Down and Out in Paris and London, a memoir including low-paid kitchen jobs in the 1930s] is still around. The minimum wage is a challenge for the industry.“It is a hugely long-hours culture with lots of poorly paid people. It is very easy for unscrupulous employers, or scrupulous employers who think that because it is the culture they grew up in they sort of think it is fair enough, to not perhaps completely follow the letter of the legislation.”“This is what happens in an industry just 3.6% unionised,” said Dave Turnbull, regional officer for the hospitality sector at the trade union Unite. “Roux gets coverage because he’s famous, but this is endemic.”A short survey of 85 chefs by Unite earlier this year found half started early and finished late for no extra pay, about half were expected to regularly work through their breaks and almost 60% worked over 48 hours per week. Harden’s said it would not downgrade its rating of Le Gavroche because of the minimum wage issue, but said it would take treatment of workers into account where it had been audited by the SRA. However, Le Gavroche is not audited by the SRA as it is not a member. A spokeswoman for the Michelin guide said: “Michelin will not comment on this story as its only role is to assess the quality of the cuisine served in restaurants.”The SRA said that in a 2014 survey it found customers cared more about treatment of staff than issues such as animal welfare and waste of food.A spokeswoman for Le Gavroche said on Thursday that payments had been made to chefs who were underpaid. “Le Gavroche provides a stimulating and organised workplace for all staff – front of house and in the kitchen,” she said. “It’s also a great place to work, and many of our staff have chosen to stay with us for many, many years, enjoying the supportive family-like atmosphere and promotional opportunities.”
