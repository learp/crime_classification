I went to the same progressive boarding school as the film-maker Peter Morley and featured in the first documentary he made, in 1947. The film was dedicated to Anna Essinger, a far-sighted Jewish educationist who fled to Britain with many of her pupils six months after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933. Peter and his siblings fled with their father at much the same time and naturally came to a school, Bunce Court, near Faversham in Kent, where the pupils and most of the staff spoke their native language.Wartime evacuation took them to Shropshire, and I arrived there after my mother had wanted to move me as far from bombing as possible. To this day I have no idea what she knew about the school but I spent most of the war years at Trench Hall, near Wem, speaking German.I was eight years younger than Peter so we never overlapped educationally, but we later became firm friends. His first film, Once Upon a Time, featured the school and was shot on a German 8mm camera which he had “liberated” from the ruins of a Berlin house while he was serving with the occupying British army.It was, of course, silent, so he used captions to spell out the eccentric history of an establishment that had virtually no domestic staff, where the pupils did all the household chores and gardening (we grew much of our own food) and where many of the teachers were eminent Jewish “enemy aliens” who had been released from internment on condition that they stayed in their jobs for the duration of the second world war. I was in the largest class – eight pupils.Setting the pattern that recurred throughout his professional life, the film won Peter his first award, a special commendation from the magazine Amateur Cine World.He had completed his military service as one of the security team guarding the 1945 Potsdam conference. One evening he was summoned by Winston Churchill, who complained about the excessive noise generated by the British sentries’ hobnailed boots. Peter was apologetic but could offer no solution given the state of rubble-strewn Berlin. To his astonishment Churchill growled: “We’ll see about that.” The great war leader then promptly ordered a transport plane to be flown to London to secure rubber-soled boots for each sentry.When Peter was planning his award-winning coverage of Churchill’s funeral in 1965, one of his research staff discovered that south bank dockers intended to dip their cranes in salute as the funeral vessel passed them.Peter swore everyone to deepest secrecy and made sure he had a camera in that position. That footage has been repeatedly seen round the world ever since.
