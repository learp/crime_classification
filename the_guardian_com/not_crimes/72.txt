TOWERING BEASTSThere has been an explosion in the number of video games that are altered and unlocked by toys. This “toys-to-life” concept is simple: place small figurines on a platform connected to a games console, and those characters magically appear in-game.In general, the toys are used only as keys to unlock content. Not so with Fabulous Beasts from Sensible Object, which sees players build a tower from blocks that represent animals, elements and forces, striving not to let it tumble.

Each piece placed in the tower impacts a streamlined, stylised strategy game played on tablet simultaneously, where breeding, evolving and maintaining the beasts carves a route to victory.It’s a fascinating experience, as the forces acting on the real-world animal heap and the strategy of the video game become utterly entwined.AWARD WINNERSThree UK games with indie-built hardware were winners at the recent IndieCade. Fabulous Beasts secured the Technology award, Robin Baumgarten’s Line Wobbler took Game Design, and Alistair Aitcheson’s Codex Bash was the Media Choice.
