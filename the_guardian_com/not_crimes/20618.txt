Dutch officials have unveiled what they called “the largest Mondrian painting in the world” to celebrate the Netherlands’ best-known abstract artist, who helped found an influential art movement a century ago.The replica “painting” made from thin stick-on plastic sheets features Piet Mondrian’s famous design of straight black lines and striking red, yellow and blue blocks and has been displayed on the sides of the city hall in The Hague. “The Hague’s city council decided to honour the world-renowned artist as part of a year of celebrating the theme ‘Mondrian to Dutch Design’,” said city spokesman Herbert Brinkman.

The painting returned to the Netherlands in 1998 after it was bought from a private American collection for $40m. It now hangs in The Hague’s Gemeentemuseum, which houses about 300 other Mondrian works, making it the world’s largest collection.Brinkman said the city planned to adorn other buildings with similar Mondrian-inspired works, including floating cubical pontoons on the Hofvijver, the small lake in front of the centuries-old Dutch parliament.After his death, Mondrian continued to be a source of inspiration for many, including Yves Saint Laurent, who designed a 1965 cocktail dress, which sold in 2011 for £30,000.
