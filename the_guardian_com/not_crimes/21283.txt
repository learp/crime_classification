EditorialFielding is often described as “the Father of the English Novel,” but the claim seems to leave out of account Defoe’s immense and significant capacity as a storyteller. One of the many good points about last night’s address to the Royal Society of Arts by Professor F.T. Blanchard (a distinguished visitor from the University of California) was its insistence on the importance of Defoe and his “method of minuteness for verisimilitude.” Professor Blanchard was lecturing on The art of the novel, and in the history of that art among English writers Defoe is surely the father of realism. He was so profoundly and instinctively factual that many readers have missed the tremendous imagination that created the facts which he presented so smoothly and with such ease and unforced fidelity.As a character Moll Flanders is as real as Robinson Crusoe, and both of them are as large as life and quite often more convincing than the man next door; Defoe himself cannot have been more than five years old at the time when the Great Plague struck London, but his Journal of the Plague Year has over and over again been read as the straightforward narrative of a London citizen who was eye-witness of the scourge and its progress. And either Defoe’s genius and method left indelible marks on the English novel or else other writers, such as the Richardson whom Professor Blanchard cited last night, discovered for themselves that “probability is minuteness?’ Far later and beyond the scope of Professor Blanchard’s survey (which ended with “the resplendent, romantic promontory of Stevenson”) George Moore may have set himself to play the sedulous ape to the painstaking Flaubert and the French realists, but the same seed was already there in English soil, and that great novel Esther Waters is of the same soberly imaginative tradition as Moll Flanders.
