I have a succession of flowers in my garden, but there’s a gap between the forget-me-nots and Japanese anemones. What could fill in from June to August and cope with shade and clay soil under a magnolia?Clay will soak up water like a sponge, then crack when dry, which is hard work for delicate roots. But there are plenty of things that will cope, especially if you add organic matter to improve moisture and drainage.Dusky cranesbill (Geranium phaeum) is the best for dry shade. It flowers in early spring, but if cut back will flower again. ‘Album’ is a very handsome pure white form. Geranium × cantabrigiense ‘St Ola’ is another white cranesbill that will flower all summer, for low ground cover. The spotted deadnettle Lamium maculatum ‘White Nancy’ will run around, but has lovely silver leaves and white flowers. Ask Alys: what flowering Mediterranean plant will cope under an olive tree? Throw in some baltic parlsey (Cenolophium denudatum) and a few ferns, such as hart’s tongue (Asplenium scolopendrium). Lady’s mantle (Alchemilla mollis) is happy in dry conditions and will put up with a lack of sun. For later in the summer when your anemones are up, add the white wood aster (Aster divaricatus), whose pale flowers on dark stems will go on till autumn.• Got a question for Alys Fowler?
