A small army of bulb planters is being mobilised for the battle to save some of the England’s best-loved flowers, native daffodils and bluebells, from the threat of foreign invasion.English Heritage gardeners and volunteers will be planting 25,000 spring flowering bulbs this week at properties up and down the country from Northumberland to the Isle of Wight – including Charles Darwin’s garden in Kent, which inspired much of his work, Eltham Palace in London, where Henry VIII was brought up, and Queen Victoria’s beloved Osborne – in an attempt to block the relentless march of Spanish bluebells and alien daffodils. Horticultural experts have been warning for years that in many places Spanish and hybrid bluebells have completely replaced the native variety. The paler smaller wild daffodils, which entranced Dorothy Wordsworth and inspired her brother William’s famous poem, are also under threat from larger and brighter, cultivated varieties.John Watkins, English Heritage’s head of gardens and landscapes, said the native varieties were part of England’s gardening and cultural heritage.“Our native species and historic cultivars are increasingly under threat from cross-polination with non-native species and hybrids that flower at the same time. The resulting offspring will be hybrids and likely to outperform and out-compete the native species.”Historic gardens such as those in his care were often the last refuge for the native species, he said.“Our major spring bulb planting campaign – across some of the most important historic gardens in England – will help arrest that national decline and ensure that the daffodil celebrated by Wordsworth over 200 years ago can still be enjoyed by visitors today and in the future.”Visitors to the gardens will also be able to collect a free bulb to continue the campaign in their own back gardens.
