ITV is to make a new celebrity dancing show on Saturday night - but it will not go head to head with BBC1’s Strictly Come Dancing.The new show, called Dance Dance Dance, will recreate famous dance routines from music videos, movies and theatre, and promises to use “the most up to date technology on a truly epic scale”.The six-part series will air next year but is not expected to be scheduled against Strictly Come Dancing, which traditionally airs from September to the end of the year, regularly winning the ratings battle against ITV’s The X Factor.Dance Dance Dance is based around a format developed by The Voice makers, Talpa Media, a Dutch production company bought by ITV last year.Which is the worst TV dance show ever? “It will have a very different feel to any other dance show out there,” said a programme insider. “It will use state of the art technology and augmented reality to put celebrities into classic dance routines of the past, from Thriller to Singing in the Rain.”Each week, one celebrity and their partner will be voted out following a critique from a judging panel.Dance Dance Dance drew impressive ratings when it premiered in Holland last year.ITV will be hoping the show enjoys more success than its recent dancing talent contest Stepping Out, hosted by Davina McCall, which lasted only one series in 2013.The broadcaster has enjoyed more talent show success with Simon Cowell’s The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent. It will also be home to the new series of The Voice, after it outbid the BBC for the new series.
