Saturday marked 10 years to the day since hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans. Eighty percent of the city was flooded as the storm devastated the Gulf Coast in August 2005.What Katrina left behind: New Orleans' uneven recovery and unending divisions A slate of events was planned, including a morning wreath-laying ceremony with Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal and Mayor Mitch Landrieu to honor the more than 1,800 people who died.“We must recommit ourselves to the notion that no American should ever be left behind,” Landrieu said at the ceremony. “We can only move forward together.”The wreath-laying took place at the Hurricane Katrina Memorial, where 83 unclaimed or unidentified victims of the storm are interred.“Though unnamed, they are not unclaimed because we remember them,” Landrieu said. His office has also orchestrated a citywide day of service, to dispatch 10,000 volunteers to seven areas where recovery efforts continue to take place.Community members gathered in the Lower Ninth Ward, the area hardest hit by the storm, which has not been fully restored in the decade following Katrina. People laid memorials, and signs bearing the names of victims were erected at the spot where one of the levees was breached.

In the lead-up to the anniversary, urban planners, politicians and community leaders spoke at panels to discuss the storm, its aftermath and how it will impact the future of the city. On Thursday, Barack Obama spoke at a Lower Ninth Ward community center. The president acknowledged the federal government’s slow response to the storm.He said Katrina was a natural disaster that “became a manmade one – a failure of government to look out for its own citizens”.Obama also mentioned that cities need to prepare infrastructure for climate change and the more extreme weather events it is expected to bring. Governor Jindal, a Republican presidential hopeful, had written a letter to Obama ahead of the event asking him to not mention climate change in his remarks. “A lecture on climate change would do nothing to improve upon what we are already doing,” Jindal said in the letter.Richard Campanella (@nolacampanella)10 years ago right now, everything you see here was a 14-foot-deep block of high-velocity seawater. pic.twitter.com/j7L3ec1k53August 29, 2015George W Bush visits New Orleans 10 years after storm stained his reputation George W Bush, who faced intense criticism over his response to the storm as president in 2005, visited the city on Friday. He spoke at Warren Easton charter school, which was damaged in the storm and rebuilt with funds from a foundation started by his wife, Laura.A third president, Bill Clinton, was scheduled to speak later on Saturday at an event called the Power of Community, meant to commemorate the city’s resilience.In spite of the dozens of events planned for the weekend, local newspaper the Times-Picayune said that just after 11am, the most read story on its website was: “Things to do in New Orleans Saturday that have nothing to do with Katrina.”Church bells also rang out on Saturday morning across Mississippi, where the storm ravaged the coast.Former governor Haley Barbour, who was in office when Katrina struck, spoke at a prayer service in Gulfport. The Republican said that at least 954,000 people volunteered in Mississippi during the first five years after the storm. Many, he said, “thought it was God’s command to try to help people in need”. Earlier in the day, Barbour and current governor Phil Bryant spoke at a commemoration in Biloxi.
