A design of translucent marble and glass was unveiled yesterday for a long-stalled performing arts venue at the World Trade Center. Singer Barbra Streisand is to serve as the chair of the board of the Ronald O Perelman Performing Arts Center, which will be dedicated to new works. The cube-shaped building would aim to commemorate the 9/11 tragedy and reflect the vitality of the city, board members said.Made from translucent, veined marble and glass, the building will look like a “mystery box”, according to its architect, Joshua Prince-Ramus. During the day, it will have a dull sheen, but at night, the three-level building will light up like a paper lantern. The 99,000 sq ft (9,197 sq metres) building will include three auditoriums and a rehearsal room. Because artistic directors need flexibility with new productions, the rooms and halls will feature movable walls to create up to 11 configurations, Prince-Ramus said. The largest configuration would hold as many as 1,200 people for events such as rock concerts. New York's Oculus transit hub soars, but it's a phoenix with a price tag Maggie Boepple, the president and director of the centre, said the space would be both a “birthplace” for new shows and a community centre, with amenities such as a cafe and yoga classes. The centre also will be the home of the Tribeca film festival.The cost of the centre has been put at $250m (£180m). The billionaire Ronald Perelman has donated $75m, but a further $75m in donations is required before the project opens in early 2020.
