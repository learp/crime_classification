Contrary to the advice of our nearest record shop, which assured customers it was available only as a download, the single You Can’t Always Get What You Want, released to honour the memory of Jo Cox, is available as a CD from pledgemusic.com. It may be too late for the day itself but their prompt delivery service should ensure that it can still make a timely contribution to the season of goodwill.Austen LynchGarstang, Lancashire• Enough of lozzucker (Letters, 24 December). Many years ago I worked in a small sweet and tobacconist shop in Uxbridge. Every day Mrs Dean would buy her ciggies. We always had a bit of banter with her, and as she was leaving, she always said, “And I don’t want any more of your larrup!” We thought it meant “none of your cheek”. But we now believe it means a beating. Anyway, larrup is a lovely word.Vera KoenigHeadcorn, Kent• It’s obvious how Murray Hedgcock the Brexiteer (Letters, 23 December) should behave to his “liberal elite” (ie remainer) family members over Christmas. He should apologise for his appalling misjudgment and maintain a low profile.John BattsBanbury, Oxfordshire• Like Murray Hedgcock, I’m a Guardian-reading Brexiteer. But his trust in the Guardian presenting a balanced view is misplaced. Our esteemed organ has clearly nailed its colours to the metrocentric remoan cause.Chris HughesLeicester• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
