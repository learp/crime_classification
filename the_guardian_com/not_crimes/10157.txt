Hmmm, are you going to the gym tonight? Take a look at Beyoncé in a leotard. I bet you’re going to the gym tonight now.Bey just officially launched her long-awaited Ivy Park athleisure line, which goes on sale in two weeks. The first official shot shows her in a black leotard with the Ivy Park logo, and white piped edges.From this photo we learn several things. First, damn, she slays in a leotard. Although to be fair we knew that already: Bey has had custom-made stagewear leotards with fishnet/sequins/leather/corsetting made for her by everyone from Tom Ford and Herve Leger to Alexander Wang. Second, Ivy Park is actual sportswear, not stagewear: there is not a sequin or fishnet to be seen here. Third, the Ivy Park look is a Bey-take on Americana: the swimsuit and blond-tipped hair are a little bit Pamela Anderson, and the Ivy Park logo is a bit Ivy League college. (See also: the Kale sweatshirt Bey made famous, back in the day.)“When I’m working and rehearsing I live in my work out clothes but I didn’t feel there was an athletic brand that spoke to me,” Beyoncé says. “My goal is to push the boundaries of athletic wear and support and inspire women who understand that beauty is more than your physical appearance.”Ivy Park goes on sale April 14, at Selfridges, JD Sports, Topshop and Net-a-Porter. Form an orderly queue. (Or rather, get in Formation.)
