Remedy this If your pot-grown blueberries are disappointing, think: when did you last repot them? They need upsizing every other year using peat-free ericaceous compost. Pollination is maximised by growing three varieties, so invest in a new plant; try the late-fruiting ‘Bluedrop’ with its teardrop-shaped berries, from Lubera (lubera.co.uk).Sow this There’s an army of mice waiting to munch on your newly planted peas. Sow seeds into a length of guttering filled with seed compost and suspend it from your greenhouse roof – it will stop rodent attacks and is a good way to get ahead while soil is too cold to sow. If you don’t have room for guttering, a plastic takeaway tray on a sunny windowsill will do just as well.Plant this If you are looking for a reliable, floriferous climber for sun or partial shade, you can’t go wrong with Clematis ‘Jackmanii’. It yields rich, purple single flowers with white centres in abundance from mid- to late summer. Height and spread: 3m x 1m. Buy one three-litre potted plant for £14.99, or two for £24.99 (plus £4.95 p&p per order). Call 0330 333 6790, quoting ref GU493. Or go to shop.theguardian.com. Dispatched within four to six weeks.
