When is a news story just a news story? And when does it become a “debate”? It’s a difficult question to answer, particularly for harried researchers and editors on tight budgets, and tighter deadlines. But the answer matters, because it dictates how any given topic is framed for an audience and, consequently, the way in which the public engages with it.When I first heard Donald Trump’s taped comments that surfaced last week, I was most struck by the complacency with which he boasted about being able to commit sexual assault because of his status as a powerful, famous man. It was a hierarchy with which many women are familiar. So, too, are we horribly accustomed to the “harmless talk” excuse he tried to use in the aftermath of the tapes’ release. But, this time, the excuses didn’t seem to be working. Even men famous for their own misogyny, men who had turned a blind eye while Trump made sexist, racist and Islamophobic comments in the past, seemed to have decided that his words were indefensible. So it was something of a surprise to be asked to take part in a conversation on Radio 4’s Today programme that ended up responding to the tapes by asking whether men need space to discuss women in sexual terms, and whether certain types of “compliments” are acceptable. Those are valid questions in their own right. But to frame a discussion of Trump’s remarks in those terms risks downplaying and mitigating the very serious nature of what he said, playing right into the hands of his own “locker room” banter excuse. Indeed, it even required the presenter to ask at one point that we set aside the most serious element of Trump’s words in order to focus on the rest:“If you put that on one side though, the specific part of what he was taped saying that was obviously to you about assault, and you take the rest of it, is the rest of it acceptable?” I asked the presenter which bits he meant by “the rest of it” – perhaps Trump’s description of a woman as a bitch, or his graphic and misogynistic description of her breasts? He responded: “So it’s all the same, any description that objectifies a woman is an assault?”Later he said: “The serious issue … is whether or not in 2016 it’s acceptable for men together to talk about women in a sexual manner without feeling guilty about it.” It boiled down to the question: calling a woman sexy – acceptable or not? I would argue that perhaps that wasn’t, in fact, the serious issue at hand.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Laura Bates on the Today programme on Tuesday.

And, in a country where sexual violence is enormously underreported and victim-blaming is rife, the framing of debates such as these not only sends a strong message to survivors about how their experiences are viewed, but also risks inadvertently validating those who hold views like Trump’s. Broadcasters have a power over public opinion, and presenting something as “up for debate” leads listeners to believe there are two equally valid sides to the story. Sometimes there aren’t.This is not to suggest that debate isn’t healthy, or that difficult topics shouldn’t be openly tackled. Of course they should. But this can be done in a way that doesn’t imply equal validation of those inciting and opposing something like sexual assault. There are certain serious events and issues simply reported as news stories, or condemned in the media without the need for a “devil’s advocate” argument. The question is, who decides what is “beyond debate”? It often feels as if issues around sexism and sexual violence are presented as even, two-sided questions even when what is discussed is extreme. And sometimes “debate” is artificially manufactured for the sake of creating a more controversial news item.In August, the Trades Union Congress and the Everyday Sexism Project released a piece of research revealing that more than half of all women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. About one in eight women reported unwanted sexual touching or attempts to kiss them – which could be defined as sexual assault under UK law.But the day the research came out, I was repeatedly asked to go on radio or television shows to “debate” whether women were making a fuss about nothing, or whether the harassment and assault the report described was just “office banter”. These discussions had little to do with the facts of the report, and risked undermining its message, giving audiences an inaccurate impression of the news story. Usually, I refuse these invitations and try to explain why I think it is problematic to frame the conversation in this way, but that invariably results in the “debate” going ahead anyway while I listen in frustration at home, so this time I raised the issue when it arose on the programme instead.Such misinformation is similarly perpetuated by news outlets that frame issues such as “Is it OK to grab a woman on the street?” as questions, when the law already tells us the answer. This isn’t a problem restricted to any one programme or media outlet – and it is complicated by the real need for balanced reporting. But there are many ways to achieve balance, such as debating the different ways to tackle a problem, which don’t have to involve undermining the problem itself. And there are times when, at victims’ expense, it feels as if “balance” is a thinly veiled euphemism for controversy, clickbait or catfight.
