  Good to meet you … Jeremy GoringI was introduced to the Guardian by my mother, whose radical political and religious views, like those of the paper's founders, were rooted in Lancashire unitarianism. In the 1950s, when it was still being printed in Manchester, it didn't reach our Sussex village until about 10am. During Suez, among two pages of letters, the editor squeezed in a pompous telegram from me: "Southern hearts uplifted by wisdom's northern voice." In the 1960s I sent in so many letters I was once asked if I was planning to publish an anthology. In the 1970s, when I taught history at Goldsmiths and nearly every common room conversation began with "Did you see in today's Times…?", I switched. But in the 1980s, after Murdoch's takeover, I returned to the Guardian and have read it ever since. As an enthusiast for renewable energy and a campaigner against unnecessary road-building, I like your stance on the environment. I enjoy George Monbiot, except when he goes on about nuclear power, and Simon Jenkins, except when he is tilting at wind turbines. As for news coverage, I would like more on the so-called "developing world". I belong to a relatively new spiritual movement based in Nigeria and am aware of exciting developments in Africa that never get reported in the Guardian – or indeed in any other British paper.
