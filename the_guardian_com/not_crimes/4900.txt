It is the season for stuffed vegetables. Aubergines with cinnamon-spiced onions; courgettes with crumbs and parmesan; tomatoes with soft, garlicky orzo and, of course, the sweet bell pepper â€“ this last lending itself to anything from minced lamb with cumin and garlic to a jumble of tomatoes, olives and feta.The recipe Halve 4 large, ripe peppers and remove and discard any stalks, cores or seeds. Set the peppers, cut side up, in a roasting tin.Halve 350g of cherry tomatoes and put them in a mixing bowl. Crumble 200g of feta into large pieces and add to the tomatoes. Stone 16 olives, adding them to the bowl with a grinding of black pepper (no salt).Stir in 8 tsp of basil pesto then spoon it into the halved peppers. Pour enough olive oil into each to come up to the top. Bake for about 25 minutes at 180/gas mark 4, until the top is lightly brown.The trick This is one of those dishes that seems more appropriate warm than hot, so leave the peppers to settle for 20 minutes before eating. While they are in the oven you may want to cover the dish with foil to stop the pesto from darkening.The twistFist-sized beefsteak tomatoes are a good vehicle for filling. Hollow out the cores and seeds and stuff them with the feta, pesto, olives and small, golden tomatoes. A splash of red wine vinegar is a good trick, sprinkled over the dish just before it goes in the oven, to sharpen its edges.Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
