More than 50 environmental, charitable and farmers organisations have written an open letter to the government urging it to adopt a zero carbon emissions target by 2050.The letter, signed by groups such as Greenpeace, WWF, Oxfam and Save the Children as well as agricultural organisations and unions, stressed the economic benefits of moving towards renewables.“Australia and Australian people stand to lose so much from the impacts of climate change; it is in our national interest to be amongst the leading nations to ensure the world limits warming to well below two degrees,” the letter said.“A zero carbon pollution future is possible, and it is all of our responsibility to make that future a reality for our children, and their children.”The groups are capitalising on the international pressure already mounting ahead of the Paris conference on climate change later this year. Several world leaders have called on Australia to build on its its 2020 emissions targets.“It’s critically important that Australia go very strong at the Paris agreement at the end of the year,” Marc Purcell from the Australian Council of International Development said.He is optimistic about the strengthening of the targets, saying public concern for climate change is making parliamentarians “wake up” to the issue.The head of the Australian Council of Social Services, Cassandra Goldie, said the poorest were the hardest hit by climate change, due to disaster management and food source uncertainty.She believes cutting emissions is a matter of fairness and equity.“If we don’t do this we will become a deeply divided globe with people who are left behind and those who have the resources to buy their way out,” Goldie said.The chief executive of the Climate Institute, John Connor, met the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and the environment minister, Greg Hunt, when the government held roundtable consultations on its carbon target.He put forward the group’s goals – a 40% reduction in emissions by 2020 and a target of net zero emissions by 2050.Connor said targets were only as good as their outcomes. “It’s very important that these targets ... are backed by strong policies,” he said.
