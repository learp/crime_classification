Miranda Hart will make her West End theatre debut in her “dream role” of Miss Hannigan in a new production of Annie.The Call the Midwife actor said taking the part of the orphanage manager had put a spring in her step.The role was made famous by Carol Burnett in the 1982 film version of the Broadway musical, which also starred Albert Finney as as wealthy industrialist Daddy Warbucks, the benefactor of orphan Annie.Hart said: “Miss Hannigan is a dream role, and certainly has been for me, but I never thought it would be a reality. But here we are and I have a newly found musical theatre-esque spring in my step!Musicals we love: Annie “I hope people will leave the theatre feeling life is a little better and dreamier and jollier after watching it, as much as we feel that performing it.“Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some legwarmers to put on...”The musical is set in 1930s New York during the Great Depression, and tells the story of 11-year-old Annie, who wants to escape from her life of misery at the orphanage to find her parents. The score includes songs such as It’s the Hard Knock Life, Tomorrow and Easy Street.Previews of Annie, directed by Nikolai Foster and produced by Michael Harrison and David Ian, will begin at the Piccadilly Theatre on 23 May ahead of opening night on 5 June.Hart will play Miss Hannigan until 17 September. Public booking opens on 27 February and the production will run until 6 January 2018.
