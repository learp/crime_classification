DJ ShadowAre we in the midst of a sampladelic revival? You’d be forgiven for thinking so with the return of both the Avalanches and this Californian cratedigger. It’s two decades since he released his influential Endtroducing album but new one The Mountain Will Fall still has things to say, and he’ll be saying them at these dates.Bluedot, Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre, Macclesfield, Sat; Electric Brixton, SW2, WedIndietracks  All festivals would be at least 63% better if they incorporated a stream train angle, yet only Indietracks seems to be capitalising on this fact. Now celebrating its 10th birthday, the festival at the Midlands Railway Centre features free steam rides, workshops and indie discos. And, of course, there’s live music from Saint Etienne, Comet Gain and Haiku Salut.Midland Railway Centre, Ripley, Fri to 31 Jul Jean-Michel JarreThe synth luminary has been following his own singular path for more than four decades, one that recently involved a techno collaboration with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

Live, they dial up their chaotic side, meaning this appearance on Sunday afternoon at Sheffield’s multi-venue Tramlines festival should not be missed.Tramlines, Sheffield, Sun
