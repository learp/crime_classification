Readers interested in Oscar Wilde need not wait until late September or travel to Paris to view rare and unique items associated with him (Paris exhibition to celebrate life and work of Oscar Wilde, theguardian.com, 24 August). Until 31 October, they can also visit the Hornby Library at Liverpool’s Central Library and see (for no charge) an exhibition titled “Richard Le Gallienne: Liverpool’s Wild(e) Poet”, celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of an English writer who was one of Wilde’s friends and disciples. Among the objects on display are an original photograph of Wilde by Napoleon Sarony; the manuscript of an unpublished book review by Wilde that he sent to Le Gallienne; a copy of Poems inscribed to Le Gallienne, in which Wilde hails him as “poet and lover”; and a letter by Le Gallienne that describes the first night of Lady Windermere’s Fan and Wilde’s famous curtain speech, congratulating the audience.Margaret Stetz and Mark Samuels LasnerCurators of the exhibition Richard Le Gallienne: Liverpool’s Wild(e) Poet • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
