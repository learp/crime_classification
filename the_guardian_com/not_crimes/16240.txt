Rumours that Lady Gaga would be blocked from speaking out about politics or Donald Trump during her forthcoming Super Bowl half-time show have been denied by the NFL. On Tuesday, it was reported that the NFL told the pop star she could not “say anything or bring anything up about the election, or mention Donald Trump”.National Football League’s Natalie Ravitz has since claimed this story is “false”, with representatives for Lady Gaga confirming the statement.“This is unsourced nonsense from people trying to stir up controversy where there is none. The Super Bowl is a time when people really come together,” Ravitz told CNN. “Lady Gaga is focused on putting together an amazing show for fans and we love working with her on it; we aren’t going to be distracted by this.”The 51st Super Bowl game will take place in Houston on Sunday 5 February, televised around the world; the finalists will be decided by championship games on 22 January.

A public supporter of Hillary Clinton, she spoke at her final election rally, and, in the wake of Trump’s win, tweeted: “Say a prayer America.” Gaga also joined a protest on election night outside Trump Tower in New York with a sign that read: “Love trumps hate.”Last year, Beyoncé used her performance to make a political statement about race, with her dancers wearing Black Panther-style berets and posing with raised fists in a homage to the protest by athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos at 1968 Olympics.
