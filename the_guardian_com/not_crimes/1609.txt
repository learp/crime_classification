I look like I have a bowl on my head if I wash my hair too often. I wash it twice a week, with whatever’s in the bathroom I share with my 12-year-old sister. I like long showers but when it comes to grooming, I am very basic: toothbrush, razor, deodorant and soap. I’m allergic to certain sulphates so I use a lot of Lush products like Ocean Salt Scrub. One time, I was so exhausted after a 14-day promotional tour, I fell asleep in the shower. When I woke up, it was morning and the water had been running all night. The water was still hot.I carry about three different deodorants. There are secret compartments in my bag so I forget where I’ve put them. I’ll be like, “I smell horrible, I need deodorant now,” and go to the pharmacy to buy another one. I like changing it up and wearing women’s deodorant. If you use the same deodorant every day, your body becomes used to it and it stops absorbing odour.Katy Brand: ‘I can’t remember the Single Ladies dance I did for Sport Relief’ I have more clothes than most women, and two stylists whom I’m always going shopping with. I will pretty much wear anything: suits from Zara or Moods of Norway, 1800s iron worker boots, cool riding jackets and pea coats. My favourite pair of jeans are Carpenters with long pockets and when I’m at home I’ll wear baggy cotton shorts from a thrift store. I have five or six leather jackets, one that’s been worn over the years by various rock stars, like Bon Jovi, and has burns in the fabric. Some people have strict dos and don’ts of style, but I’m always changing my mind. I travel with a decent-sized suitcase – everything from swimming to climbing attire.• RJ Mitte will be reporting on the Paralympics from Rio in September for Channel 4.
