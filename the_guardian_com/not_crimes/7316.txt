A first time novelist who wrote in NHS car parks in her lunch breaks has secured a television dramatisation deal for her first book and a £300,000 contract for her second novel.The Trouble With Goats and Sheep, partly inspired by the patients of hospital psychiatrist Joanna Cannon, and praised in a Guardian review as “a novel to be savoured rather than hurried through”, has become a bestseller since it was published in January.It has now been optioned as a television drama by On the Corner, the production company that made Amy, the admired documentary about the late singer Amy Winehouse.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Trouble with Goats and Sheep by Joanna Cannon.The book was published by The Borough Press, part of the HarperCollins group, after a bidding auction in which Cannon read a short section of the manuscript at the Writers’ Workshop Festival of Writing which takes place annually in York.Cannon left school with one GCSE and did a variety of jobs including kennel maid and pizza deliverer, before passing her A-levels and going to university in her 30s. She qualified despite being so short of money, she wrote, “that I often had to choose between a packet of crisps and a cup of tea, because I couldn’t afford both”.Her blog about her work and writing, which she began while working in palliative care, attracted attention and she was encouraged to tackle a novel by Joanne Harris, the bestselling author of Chocolat. In a Twitter exchange last week with the Harry Potter creator, JK Rowling, about being rebuffed by publishers, Harris claimed that she received so many rejection letters for Chocolat, she built a sculpture out of them.Cannon described in the blog how she found the time to write the novel “at four o’clock in the morning before I went to work, in a wide variety of NHS car parks during my lunch break, and occasionally on a night shift (on the very – very – rare occasion when all my patients were asleep at the same time). It was always a battle between hours and words, but the story was so important to me”.“I also found writing was therapeutic after witnessing depressing things in hospitals,” she told the Sunday Times. Her stories, of the secrets often hidden in the lives of ordinary people, was inspired not just by the people she worked with, Cannon said, but by the story of Christopher Jefferies, the retired teacher and landlord who was falsely implicated in the murder of Joanna Yeates in Bristol in 2010, and later won libel damages for he way he was portrayed in some newspapers.Cannon’s long-term partner, she revealed, is not one of her devoted readers. “He had no idea about my writing. He does now, obviously, though he hasn’t read my book,” she said.• This article was amended on 30 March 2016 because an earlier version said Joanna Cannon read a short section of the manuscript at the York festival of writing. This has been corrected to say the Writers’ Workshop Festival of Writing.
