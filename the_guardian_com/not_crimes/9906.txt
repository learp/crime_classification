The change in seasons is near. It’s magical when summer and autumn collide for a few short weeks – it’s my favourite time of year for food. Squashes and mushrooms are just around the corner, while we are still enjoying the last of the papery husked corn, courgettes and patty pans in all their colours and misshapes. And the fruit. We’re still savouring the end of summer’s treasures: the hedgerows are full of blackberries and the trees heavy with figs, apples and stone fruits. Now is the time to make jams.If you are not a jam maker, then buying your jam from a small producer is a game-changer – there are a few great makers I’ve come across in the UK and US. Melbourne-born Lillie O’Brien runs the London Borough of Jam and makes the sort of small batch jams I like: easy on the sugar and big on fruit, with unexpected riffs from spices, teas, garden herbs and botanicals. The care she puts into her craft reminds me of great jam-makers in the US, such as Sqirl in LA where they create jams from unusual fruits like Olallieberry (a special blackberry) and aprium (a plum and apricot hybrid), or June Taylor who has been making incredible jams, fruit butters, syrups and marmalades in northern California for years. Her meyer lemon marmalade makes use of a fruit that’s a cross between a lemon and a tangerine and is only grown along the west coast of America. Jam is such a clever way of creating a little time capsule in a jar.These great producers have inspired me, but when I make jam I want it to be easy and quick. I never have enough time to get out jam pans and thermometers and boil pots for hours making batches and batches of jams. So these recipes are simple, using my most-awaited fruits of the season: plums, damsons and figs.A lot of people are put off making jam because they think it will be a lot of bother, but if you choose the right recipe, that couldn’t be further from the truth. The way to go is in small batches, so you don’t need a massive pan and you needn’t boil the fruit for hours. One of the things that does seem like a bore is sterilising the jars. But it couldn’t be simpler. Rather than boiling jars to sterilise them, I warm them in the oven while I am working. Preheat the oven to 140C/275F/gas mark 1. The jars should be in there for 10 minutes minimum, but can stay in longer. When your jam is ready and still hot, protecting your hands with an oven glove, carefully ladle it into the hot jars. This process will be sufficient to seal the jars safely. The hottest cycle on your dishwasher will do the trick too, just make sure you fill the jars while they are still hot. Finally, for a bit more on easy, fuss-free jam-making a great little book called Do Preserve came my way recently and it makes my kind of jams and pickles without too much fuss. It will be my guide to preserving through this and many autumns to come.Easy roasted plum/damson jamThe easiest recipe I know. Roasting the fruit is such a foolproof way of making jam. It doesn’t require any kit apart from a roasting tray; it imparts an incredible sticky caramel character, while the fruit stones bring an almondy flavour and help the set. I’ve included a kind of choose-your-own adventure for the flavouring options, as jam is a very personal thing: some like it simple, I like it with interesting and unusual flavours (my favourite is the fennel pollen).Makes 4 small jars2kg small plums or damsons 300g golden caster sugarJuice of 1 lemon Flavour options A few twists of black pepperA vanilla pod, split in half1 tsp fennel pollen or fennel seedsA couple of bay leaves A handful of lemon verbenaA handful of rose geranium1 Stone your damsons or plums: if they are ripe, you will be able to squeeze the stone out in your hands; if they are too firm to do that, you’ll need to cut them open and scoop out the stone with a small spoon.2 Lay the fruit and stones out evenly on two large baking trays, then scatter over the sugar and lemon juice. Now’s the time to add your flavourings – if you are using rose geranium, lemon verbena or bay to flavour, thoroughly mix it in with your hands, then leave overnight to infuse.3 Roast the fruit in the centre of an oven preheated to 200C/400F/gas mark 6 for 45 minutes, or until sticky and caramelised.4 Once cooked, remove whatever flavourings you’ve used (unless you have used pepper or fennel, as these will be small enough to eat) and the stones. Spoon the jam into sterilised jars and seal immediately.5 Store in a cool, dark place. This will keep for up to a year. Once open, refrigerate and eat within 3 months for the best flavour.Fig, vanilla and orange blossom jamThis quick and easy fig jam has a very low sugar-to-fruit ratio, allowing the character of the figs to burst through. Personally I love orange blossom, but if it’s a bit too perfumed for you, leave it out or add a tea bag of earl grey or, even better, half a teaspoon of loose leaves tied up in a little bit of muslin (remove before you jar it up).Makes 2 small jars 1kg black figsZest and juice of 1 lemon1 vanilla pod, split200g sugar2 tsp orange blossom water1 Trim any hard stalks from the figs and cut into quarters. Put the figs, lemon zest and vanilla pod into a large saucepan. Before you put it on the heat, stir vigorously with a wooden spoon to mash up the figs a little.2 Add the sugar. Put the pan on a high heat – stir continuously to ensure the sugar dissolves evenly. Bring to the boil (this should take 5-10 minutes) then turn the heat down and let it bubble away for 20 minutes, or until you have a thick, glossy jam.3 Take the pan off the heat, add the orange blossom water and the lemon juice, mix, then spoon into your sterilised jars. Store in a cool, dark place. This will keep for up to a year. Once open, refrigerate and eat within 3 months for the best flavour.Anna Jones is a chef, writer and author of A Modern Way to Eat and A Modern Way to Cook.
