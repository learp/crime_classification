George Osborne used a trip to China last week to berate Britain for losing its entrepreneurial confidence and allowing a local nuclear industry to wither. Yet his own decision to subsidise state-owned Chinese and French companies to build and operate Hinkley Point C shows a huge lack of belief in UK competence, and arguably its private sector too.If the chancellor believes that offering a generating strike price at double the current cost of wholesale energy is a good deal all round then why not invest himself? Why did he not use a properly constituted new Green Investment Bank rooted in Britain and our publicly owned bailed-out banks to raise funds for new nuclear?The British state masterminded the building and operation of a highly successful Olympics. What better legacy than starting to secure something as vital nationally as our energy infrastructure? After all, the UK government presided over the birth of the atomic civil power programme with the opening of Calder Hall in Cumbria almost 57 years ago to the day.But a succession of ministers lost their faith in nuclear and presided over the privatisation – and largely sale abroad – of assets belonging to British Energy, British Nuclear Fuels and the atomic engineering group Westinghouse. The industry was not allowed to wither so much as flogged off while ministers dithered over whether to resurrect nuclear in an attempt to boost low-carbon power as well as energy security.The answer to why Osborne has not invested himself, of course, is that he believes with fervour that the state should not be involved – or not the British state anyway. The reality is that most nuclear players in the world are directly or indirectly state-backed.EDF, 85% owned by the French government, and the Chinese (100% answerable to the Beijing politburo) are prepared to build in Britain as a high-profile European shop window for their wares as well as to turn a nice buck. And they will want to do so by using as much of their own technology and supply chain as they can.Ed Davey, the secretary of state for energy, says Britain will provide 57% of the value at Hinkley Point. Yet EDF itself has admitted to being sceptical, saying: "There are a lot of critical components where quite frankly the UK has lost its capability."It has been the same in the offshore wind business where the foreign investors and operators of schemes such as the London Array windfarm put 90% of the contracts abroad.Centrica, the owner of British Gas, was there on the ground floor of the deal with EDF to build Hinkley Point C but backed away. The company then spent £500m instead buying back its own shares before raising its power prices by 10% last week.The private sector is primarily beholden to investors and not the public good, as the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welbeck, should know. A former energy industrialist himself, he suggested at the weekend that power companies should show some "social conscience".RWE, another of the big six energy companies, raised its household bills on Monday by roughly the same amount, to considerable outrage.Yet the public will be rightly confused about energy prices given the EDF deal shows the government is convinced that electricity prices are going to double in future.That being so, there needs to be thought about how those and other future rises will be met. The burden cannot all fall on the head of energy users at a time of rising fuel poverty. Some of it needs to be born directly by the taxpayer and by the state. VAT, for instance, could be lifted immediately.No one can predict for certain where power prices will go but the subsidy – which still needs to be given the green light by Brussels – ensures that EDF and the Chinese will get their 10% return on capital regardless. The consumers, who are meant to pay for all this, will only know if they have been sold a bad deal later down the track.And there is a lot of detail in the EDF deal that is undisclosed, not least references to the strike price being shifted around under certain circumstances.Another interesting feature is that the developers have promised only to have the new Somerset reactors operating from 2023. That gives them enormous leeway for time overruns of the kind seen on the Flamanville plant being built by EDF in France. But what happens if EDF builds it earlier than expected? What is the impact on the strike price then?For all of these questions and concerns – and there others over safety – one can at least welcome the fact that ministers have finally taken a decision to move forward on an energy project of great national significance. It will certainly embolden other potential UK nuclear investors, as Hitachi of Japan made clear. But where is Osborne's boost to British self-belief?
