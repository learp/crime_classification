If I know I am going out in the evening, I’ll save my shower till I am about to get ready, so I’m pristine. I’m not one for moisturisers and toners; the furthest I go is shampoo and conditioner, and a bit of hair gel. At the moment I am sporting a beard, so I’ll trim it all to the same length.I pay attention to my nails. I have had this particular German nail kit for years, and I take it everywhere. If I don’t trim and file my nails, they turn into talons. I cook a lot, too, and I don’t like to see bits of food stuck under them. I’ve always thought it doesn’t matter how spectacular people might look in a bespoke suit, if they have dirty fingernails it makes me wonder what’s in their pants.If I am planning to wear a suit, I’ll shower and then, standing in my pants, I’ll iron my shirt and put everything on at the last minute. I don’t even like sitting in a taxi or on the tube when I’ve got a nicely ironed shirt on – I can feel the creases starting. I was taught to iron in the children’s home I lived in – along with mopping, sweeping and washing up. If you iron a shirt in order – collar, cuffs, yoke, sleeves and then body – it comes out all neat and gorgeous.How I get ready: Gabby Logan I have never been a major fashionista, but I love a suit, and I did have one made for me by the tailor Stephen Williams. The great thing about a bespoke suit is that it covers up my pot belly. When I buy a suit I’ll pick shoes, belt, tie, shirt and socks, and that will be what I always wear with it. When I go to Crystal Palace games I wear my petrol blue Paul Smith suit, with a white shirt, and maroon tie and socks; although not quite the right shades of red and blue, they do represent my team’s colours.• Neil Morrissey appears in The Night Manager, starting on Sunday 21 February at 9pm on BBC1.
