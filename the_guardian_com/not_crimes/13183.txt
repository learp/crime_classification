Environmental authorities in Rio de Janeiro have launched a huge clean-up operation after an estimated 65 tonnes of dead fish filled up the 2016 Olympic rowing lake.The Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon in Rio became deoxygenated after storms washed "a large amount of organic matter" into the lake, leading to the deaths of thousands of shad, authorities told local media.A photograph from Terra.com.br showed rowers being forced to steer through a floating blanket of rotting fish, with the clean-up still going on.A similiar incident in 2009 led to the removal of an estimated 100 tonnes of fish.
