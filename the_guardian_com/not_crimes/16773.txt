Yes, Gertrude Bell was “extraordinary” in terms of her interests and impact but this isn’t the total picture (Gertrude of Arabia, G2, 9 August). She also had friends in high places in the military and political spheres; and was not averse to using these contacts for less than benign purposes. During the first world war she suggested that the recently formed Royal Flying Corps use Iraq to refine its bombing technique on the country’s small, isolated villages as this might prove to be an ideal training ground away from inquisitive eyes. She made a similar suggestion to the military elite with regard to practising the battlefield use of chemical gas which had been difficult to control on the western front. These facts need to be placed alongside other features of her life.On a more positive note, Red Barnes, her childhood home, could certainly become a memorial but one exists already in the small estate village church of East Rounton where the Bells had an impressive country mansion (since demolished, like most of Iraq).Gus PenningtonStokesley, North Yorkshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
