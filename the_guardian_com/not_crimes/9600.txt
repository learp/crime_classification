Now that the clocks have leapt forward, staff at public gardens across the country are bracing themselves for an influx of visitors, ready to be captivated by spring, be that a crowd of daffodils nodding in the breeze, the wafting scent of an azalea or a carpet of bluebells.Much of the hard work has already been done: hour after hour of bulb planting, pruning with freezing fingers and backbreaking mulching through autumn and winter, all to put the gardens in good heart for the spring rush. And it is a rush: daffodils and tulips thrust up through the warming soil, buds burst, hungry pollinators forage among the pollen; on and on it goes.For Sarah Wain, supervisor at West Dean Gardens near Chichester, West Sussex, the best bit about spring is the unfurling of new growth. “All that potential from a sticky, woody silhouette, and then – kaboom – out it comes,” she says. “I love that transition.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Nectarine ‘Humboldt’ blossom at West Dean in West Sussex.What’s her highlight? Wain could have chosen the white and purple snake’s-head fritillaries that dot the wildflower lawn, or the purple wash of the early crocus, Crocus tommasinianus, like a watercolour painting; instead, it’s a display of salad leaves and herbs growing in pots under glass. “The whole thing just looks like a smorgasbord‚” she says.Farther north, at the RHS garden Harlow Carr, the cooler, damper climes of Harrogate, Yorkshire, mean curator Paul Cook can eke out spring colour from tulips right through into June. This year, there will be a trail of more than 100 varieties in traditional beds and borders, and in containers – and not just your average terracotta pots, but handbags, wellies, wheelbarrows and even a boat on the lake. The climate also makes an agreeable home for the garden’s signature sky-blue Himalayan poppies (meconopsis) in late May and June.

For now, though, it’s all about Furnace Hill, 20 acres that are open to the public for the first time. Rippon promises incredible views from this vantage point. “It’s like an impressionist painting full of highlights of pink, mauve, red and white rhododendrons. There’s also a lot of scent, from the azaleas,” he says. “Many of the rhododendrons are more than 100 years old. They’ve got amazing bark and look like iced gems in the landscape.”Eleven great spring gardensRydal Mount, CumbriaHighlights Want to see daffodils?
