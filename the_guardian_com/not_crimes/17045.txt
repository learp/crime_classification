The funniest book I’ve ever readI, Partridge: We Need To Talk About Alan. Nomad is also pretty incredible. I listened to the audiobook on a beach in Mexico recently and, during the bit about Sherlock Holmes, people were looking at me like I was insane.The funniest person I knowMy mum. Her mind should be donated to science. She did the eulogy at my nan’s funeral recently and it was so hilarious and warm it left the room in tears, both happy and sad. She is an incredible woman.The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had I brushed my hair to the side last year in America; in my mind I was going for the Ryan Gosling look. As two very giggly ladies I met in a lift pointed out, I actually looked more like Ellen DeGeneres.The funniest heckle I’ve ever hadI’ve seen a comic urinated on. I’ve been punched for having an affair with a man’s wife; I was 18 and had never met her. I’ve seen a woman hand a noose to a man at a festival in Bristol. But the weirdest thing was when a woman threw her sex toy at me. It begs the question: how little faith do you have in the evening to bring a dildo in your handbag?The funniest dream I’ve ever hadI was a cat working in a travel agent and we were having a really busy day. I booked a couple a lovely weekend break in Barcelona and they thanked me by letting me lick some cream from a bowl.The funniest film I’ve ever seenI love The Grand Budapest Hotel. The humour is so deft and Ralph Fiennes is fantastic.The funniest meal I’ve ever eatenI ate at Dans Le Noir with my mum. It’s an amazing restaurant where you eat in the dark. It was fantastic, before we went in my mum looked at me in fear and went: “What if I forget where my mouth is?”The funniest wordWangle, oscillate or manky. I can’t decide.Russell Howard does warm-ups at Hexagon Theatre, Reading, Wednesday 25 Jan and De Montfort Hall, Leicester, Thursday 26 Jan; Russell Howard: Round The World is touring Wednesday 22 Feb to Sunday 9 Apr
