Stuart Paterson is used to being stopped at customs. When asked what’s in his van, his stock response is: “Just a bunch of knackered antiques the French don’t want.” Foxed mercury mirrors, rusty garden tables, patched fabrics and stacks of battered white tableware can all be found in his possession. “I’m searching for the jolie laide, the pretty-ugly,” he says. “It’s an aesthetic that has a certain frisson that stops a piece being too elegant, beautiful, or expected. I don’t do important antiques: I do antiques with character.”During brocantes, or antiques market, season, Paterson drives to France in his clapped-out van at least once a month to source antiques. Mostly, his stock is sold to the trade; they draw up a shopping list and Paterson does the hard graft. “That’s the bit I love: the thrill of the chase.” But the public can buy his wares, too, either at his south London workshop, by appointment, or at a monthly market stall.He has bought from all over the world, but France remains his favourite hunting ground. “I love the localism of the country: neighbouring departments won’t produce the same cheese, and it’s the same with furniture. Each region has its own style and material.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Stuart Paterson.

Every Sunday there will be a market or car-boot sale, usually in the centre of towns or villages. Paterson explains: “If you’re driving past a roundabout in France, what you’re looking for is a neon-bright, hand-written sign advertising a ‘brocantes/vide-grenier’: the richest pickings will be had at a sale that is a combination of the two.”The website brocabrac.fr lists all the sales taking place by region and will usually give you an idea of the scale of the event. “If there are 25 exhibitors, I won’t get out of bed. But if there are 250, I’ll sleep in the van to be first through the door,” Paterson says. The French magazine Aladin also lists events. You can pick up a copy at Calais and plan your route from there.Paterson’s top tip is to be quick. “If you love something just buy it,” he says. “You don’t get second chances. If you walk away, it means you don’t love it enough.” And don’t be greedy: “If I can’t agree on a price, I say ‘On est trop loin’ – which means, ‘we’re too far away from each other’, and leave it at that.”Tastes fluctuate along with stock levels. The Lampe Gras – an adjustable office lamp and a 20th-century French design classic – is a case in point. Until recently, Paterson would see these lamps for sale for €50, but the production of reissues has pushed the prices of originals up to €600 to €700. “As a result, British Anglepoise lamps are starting to appear in French markets.” Perhaps it’s time for Paterson to start filling his van before he leaves the UK.

Stock often finds its way from the studio into Paterson’s own home. Above his fireplace is a lump of weathered, silver wood that sits in a metal container. Elsewhere is an 18th-century glass lamb feeder. His advice for displaying your own finds is to organise objects according to texture or colour, and to keep moving things around – don’t let your possessions become stale.It’s important to Paterson that things aren’t over-venerated. “If you find something beautiful, use it.” And if you break it, repair it – you’ll only be adding to its value •Paterson’s best marketsArdingly Antiques and Collectors Fair, West Sussex Held four times a year; it’s worth paying the £20 entrance fee for the first day, and returning for bargains at the end of the second.Sunbury Antiques Fair, Kempton Park Racecourse, Sunbury-on- Thames Well-known, busy fair with more than 700 stalls, held every second and last Tuesday of the month.
