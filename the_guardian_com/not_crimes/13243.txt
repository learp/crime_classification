If you are near Henstridge on a Saturday morning, and go down Marsh Lane, or Oak Vale Lane, beyond Quiet Corner farm, you are likely to see a few people on foot in twos and threes, maybe with small children, toddling or in pushchairs, and perhaps also a cyclist or two, all heading for a point where they will turn in beside a copse and eventually meet each other at a place where coffee is being served and other folk, mostly well known to each other, are chatting.Leeks, cabbages, cauliflower, onions, garlic and beetroot are for sale on the tables, and there are bottles of fresh apple juice from the orchard at the farm. This gathering results from the efforts of a couple who have worked a smallholding here for some 20 years, with the straightforward aim of making good, fresh food available to local people close to their homes and providing a chance for a get-together. They have a small flock of sheep and one pig, as well as the vegetables.To balance this picture of the good life in a rural community came news of the flock of Greyface Dartmoor sheep a few miles north, in our own village. The man who was caring for them told me of the morning when he went out early and found one dead, its throat ripped out, evidently in one bite, and another traumatised beside it. The prints in the soft mud and the nature of the wound told him that it had been the work of a large dog. Two more ewe lambs had been killed in the same way, one a potential prizewinner. Another victim was an old, retired ewe, a former champion, kept as a pet. I was reminded of a day long ago when, in the Lake District, I learned that a dog that was a much loved domestic pet, safe with children, could, given the chance, go after sheep with a hunter's instinct.
