Did David Cameron spend his last night in No 10 crying into his pilau? After the turmoil of the last few weeks, it appears that the soon-to-be former prime minister let off steam by feasting on a hot curry as he prepared to leave office.Kennington Tandoori, the curry house of choice for MPs, tweeted on Tuesday evening that it had delivered the prime minister’s “last supper”.Kennington Tandoori (@TheKTLondon)Last supper delivered to #10downingstreet by #theKTLondon.

Indeed, the restaurant was at pains to stress that the delivery was for “Number 10”, rather than the prime minister personally.Cameron has previously spoken of his love of curries, telling the Hindustan Times before a 2013 trade trip to Mumbai that he likes them “pretty hot”. He has been a guest at the British Curry awards and patronised various restaurants during his time in office.In 2005, in an interview with publications representing various BAME communities, he said: “You cannot beat a curry at the Khas Tandoori in Chamberlayne Road, Kensal Green.” He is also known to frequent the Shaan restaurant in Witney, Oxfordshire, although it hit the headlines for the wrong reasons when raided by border officials in 2013.Kennington Tandoori’s popularity with MPs was highlighted last year when it became probably the first curry house to be mentioned during prime minister’s questions. The Speaker, John Bercow, admonished his rowdy colleagues with the words: “When you’re eating curry in the Kennington Tandoori, you don’t yell across the table.”The restaurant will hope this is not the end of its relationship with Downing Street, given that Cameron’s successor is also a fan of spicy food. However, it might be wary of “Theresa May’s curry curse”, as proclaimed by the Mail when two of her favourite restaurants were also raided by border officials on suspicion of employing illegal workers.
