6.08pm BST18:08My verdictThe UK should have the ability to feed itself. Nothing is inherently wrong with the NFU’s calls for action to assist farmers, especially the emphasis on research. But the self-sufficiency measure is a dangerous one when used out of context to create the impression of a crisis. One that can be conveniently fixed by boosting production from its members. The creation of a sustainable, prosperous agriculture sector requires a nuanced approach based on subtle data.The NFU president’s claim that a declining self-sufficiency rating is an “alarming notion” was met with contempt by many commentators today. The confected news hook (the day when our food supply would dry up) reveals the union’s interest in conflating self-sufficiency with food security. Self-sufficiency is a simplistic metric that can be increased by boosting production, which is good for NFU members.Food security is far more complex and relies on revising many of the UK’s agricultural policies. Some of these are related to production. The UK has failed to invest enough in agricultural research over the past few decades, meaning homegrown techniques and technologies to sustainably increase production have not been developed. But increased production can also conflict with a healthy environment or the survival of small farms. These “externalities” must be addressed in order to provide long term food security and are more important than the raw amount of food grown.Updatedat 6.12pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.58pm BST16:58Your commentsBrilliant discussions in the comments today. Reader Michael Hamblett says:  “This has made me angry. Both you and Damian know the amount of land used to grow fodder for export meat market. We will not have sufficiency with free market profiteering and the utter ruthlessness of supermarkets. Sufficiency is EASY, but will not happen until there is a real crisis. The current situation of ‘snouts in the trough’ remains.”   voix 07 August 2014 1:22pmYes, Britain should be able to feed itself with essentials, but not in the current situation. People appear to want everything at all times of the year, and large-scale farming units sucking up most of the subsidies does not help one jot.Government have got to look beyond vested interests and encourage a truly diverse farming community that can produce the main food stuffs (bearing in mind the climate of this country) for everybody; also, supermarkets have got to stop their negative approach to the food farmers produce (rejecting good quality food that does not meet their ideal standards).   HeinzTree 07 August 2014 2:37pmUK farmers' naked self interest, barely covered by a spurious veneer of eco/sustainability/localist/food security nonsense.   epidavros 07 August 2014 2:53pmThis one is easy. We should not even attempt to be food self sufficient. It does not matter. We live on a cold island in a northern climate and we could not come close to growing ingredients for a varied, healthy, interesting and balanced diet, at least not without the expense of masses of oil to heat and light it. We are not food self sufficient because we cannot grow oranges, lemons, bananas, pineapples, chillies, spices...and on and on. We cannot produce wine in quantity. We would have poor nutrition without imports, as we did for centuries and as we did when imports failed in the war years - at least for the majority. OUr non-self sufficiency in food is one of our greatest success stories - we have probably the widest range of food available on common supermarket shelves that I have seen anywhere in Europe, North America or Oceania - only Australia comes anywhere near close, and lack easy access to many roots.France may well be food self sufficient, but they wouldn't know a good curry if it hid down an alley, jumped out and mugged them.   Lailoken 07 August 2014 11:40amNFU economist Philip Bicknell writes "Over 90 per cent of farming businesses are family businesses, sole traders or family partnerships – it’s in their interest to hand down a successful thriving farming business to the next generation.”This is the usual strategy of economists picking whatever numbers suit them.According the UKagriculture web site, "Some 41,000 farms (~14% of the total) are larger than 100 hectares and account for over 65% of the agricultural area."A proportion of that is going to be upland sheep farms. A proportion certainly isn't.   JasonP 07 August 2014 11:50amFood security is improved by global trade, not reduced.

[The report rejected] the narrative that food security is best addressed through maximising food production in the UK and that ‘amount of food produced’ is an adequate proxy for food security.”The emphasis on supply, it claims, also forces smaller, more sustainable producers out of the market. This has negative social and environmental impacts. “Input costs are rising at a rapid rate whilst prices paid to farmers for their produce are showing little increase at best, stagnating, or even decreasing. A quarter of Britain’s farmers are living in poverty and pressure on prices means that low pay, insecurity – such as zero hours contracts – and dangerous working conditions are widespread in the industry,”FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.07pm BST16:07Self-sufficiency is a poor measure of key agricultural policies, says Charles Godfray, the director of the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food. He says the UK’s optimal level of self-sufficiency will only be known when rural economies are properly supported and the UK’s food supply is secure. Self-sufficiency is a metric that, of itself, cannot tell us much about these two aims.“The level of self-sufficiency is not a sensible policy goal,” he says. “It will emerge as a product of doing the right thing and we should be quite relaxed about it.” He questions the relevance of the NFU’s observation that self-sufficiency has declined since the 1980s. Thirty years ago, the European common agriculture policy (CAP) was supporting huge production across the continent. Since then, self-sufficiency has declined, but the numbers are still comparably high compared to much of the last century.“Clearly the NFU are supporting their members,” says Godfray. “But it’s worth thinking about why we care about self-sufficiency. We are a very rich country. If the global food market seized up we could feed ourselves. We want our rural economies to be vibrant, but that’s a separate issue to food security.”Aside from the interpretation of self-sufficiency, Godfray agrees with the NFU that a global food crisis would expose the UK’s farming sector. He notes three major market failures that would make it hard for UK to respond to a surge in demand. A failure in research funding for agriculture. “We have taken our eye off the agriculture research ball. The production increases of the seventies and eighties have declined.”The ability of the industry to change because of the ageing infrastructure and demographic of farmers. “I suspect we are not as agile as we used to be.”Environmental damage of increased production is the largest externality, says Godfrey. “The sustainability of a supply side response is a real critical thing.”FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.36pm BST14:36The Daily Mail’s Ben Spencer makes the point that other nations are operating a more favourable trade balance for their local farmers.Ben Spencer (@Ben_Spencer)@KarlMathiesen Worth comparing to other countries.

The research found “food prices in the UK fall below the world average and those of developing regions but they are slightly above those of the developed regions of the world”.Professor Tim Lang, on of the authors, said the UK’s low self-sufficiency makes it vulnerable to global food price fluctuations. “The recent stabilisation of food prices should not be taken as evidence that the crisis is over... Food prices have been volatile internationally and gradually risen here in the UK, adding to economic uncertainties. Indeed, because UK food production has slowly been declining and it produces relatively little of its own food, it is sensitive to world food prices and thus volatility in financial markets”FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.59pm BST12:59Green groups reaction“The UK can and is feeding itself from a diverse range of sources,” says Paul Wilkinson head of living landscape at the Wildlife Trusts. Self-sufficiency is not a measurement of the UK’s ability to last in a hypothetical situation in which it is cut off from the rest of the world. Rather it is the ratio of food exports and imports, it measures how much of the food we eat is produced in country.“It has very little to do with our food security,” says Wilkinson. “It’s more a measure of competitiveness.” Which is why the NFU are so keen to advocate against its decline. But Wilkinson says a figure of around 60% is historically average. He says the last time the UK was 100% self-sufficient was in the mid-1700s. During the 1930s, the country was at around 30%-40%. Figures from Defra date back to 1956 and show that the year 1984 that the NFU have chosen as their baseline was the absolute peak of self-sufficiency during the past half century.Wilkinson says an increase in the self-sufficiency ratio could be increased by exporting more food while keeping imports constant, thus the NFU’s attempt to link the situation to food security is “non-sensical”. “We would be much more vulnerable if we were to become 100% self-sufficient.”He says the focus on increased production “disguises the fact that we’ve already done quite a lot of intensification in the past few decades”. A process that has impacted on the UK’s soil, water and wildlife.Peter Melchett, Soil Association policy director says sustainable food production can be increased by shifting the focus away from energy, biofuel and meat production toward fruit and vegetables. He echoes the NFU in their calls for more research in the sector and an emphasis on buying locally produced food.  “We could do a great deal to increase more environmentally sustainable food production in the UK. First, and most obviously, we could stop allocating ever increasing areas of farmland to growing maize for anaerobic digestion plants and oil seed rape for fuel. Second, we could increase our production of fruit and vegetables, where relatively small areas of land produce big quantities of food which we currently often import unnecessarily, like apples. Third, we should invest in research, neglected for 70 years, that will help us increase production from farming systems which do not rely on environmentally unsustainable inputs like manufactured Nitrogen fertiliser, imported mined phosphate and pesticides. Fourth, we should increase demand for food produced in the UK.”FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.49am BST11:49There is no doubt that food self-sufficiency would be advantageous to British farmers and that is not a bad thing. It would tip the balance of trade in favour of the UK and would mean farmers were not being outcompeted by cheaper imports subject to less stringent environmental and food safety standards. It might also bring about environmental advantages. There is certainly strong green advocacy for locally grown produce.But the NFU has framed the debate by suggesting that Britain would run out of food without imports, creating the perception of a crisis. Does that crisis exist? Not according to these statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO). Britons not only eat a third more than they need, the price of food is fairly constant. This suggests consumers are not currently suffering.Karl Mathiesen (@KarlMathiesen)Two reasons why the UK's food supply may not be a problem. 1) We are oversupplied...

Source: Farmers Guardian pic.twitter.com/9aoh3HImFTAugust 7, 2014Harvests for this year are looking better, however the long term trend is clear. The NFU has called for political and social action to halt the decline.In a Q&A on the NFU website, chief economist Philip Bicknell usefully clarifies self-sufficiency as an economic measurement of the balance of trade. “Self-sufficiency isn’t about trying to get to 100 per cent and then stopping there or about eating food that is only produced in the UK. It’s a yardstick for measuring how competitive we are and how much we produce. In fact, it is good news that we export £12.8billion worth of food and drink products every year. Food exports have been one of the key successes in our agri-food sector in the last 10 years and the UK has doubled the amount of exports food and drink exports since 2002.”Bicknell claims production can be increased without causing environmental harm. “Decisions to increase production and care for the environment go hand in hand – they have to. Farmers know they need to look after the natural resources around them in order to farm successfully. Over 90 per cent of farming businesses are family businesses, sole traders or family partnerships – it’s in their interest to hand down a successful thriving farming business to the next generation.” Bicknell argues that the UK should “play its part” in increasing production to feed both the UK and the global population. But this is at odds with the largely accepted view that the world produces enough food and the problem is in distribution.The GRID-Arendal Centre, a partner of the United Nations Environment Programme, says a substantial share of the increasing food demand could be met by increasing efficiency in the supply chain. Only an estimated 43% of the cereal produced is available for human consumption, as a result of harvest and post-harvest distribution losses and use of cereal for animal feed. Furthermore, the 30 million tonnes of fish needed to sustain the growth in aquaculture correspond to the amount of fish discarded at sea today.Updatedat 11.30am BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose10.03am BST10:03Welcome to today's eco auditToday is the day when Britain, should it be cut off from the rest of the world, would run out of food, say the National Farmers Union.My colleague Damian Carrington writes today: “Despite the prospect of a decent harvest this year, Britain’s ability to feed itself is in long-term decline, with self-sufficiency falling from 78% to 60% in the last 30 years.“The National Farmers Union calculates that this Thursday would be the day that the year’s food supply would run out without imports. “An alarming notion,” says Meurig Raymond, president of the NFU. “But looking back seeing the downward slope in self-sufficiency says to me: this needs to change.””Today I’m exploring how self-sufficiency would be achieved?
