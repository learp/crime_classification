• We are a long way from David Cameron's pronouncement that this would be the greenest government ever. Promises made mid-seduction rarely come to anything. So it has proved. And for those keen to know what drives environment ministers these days, there was a non-too subtle hint yesterday as activists discussed the fate of the government's green adaptation programme and its website Climate Ready. It has closed down, tweeted one. No, I think it has moved, said another. Into the fray jumped the environment agency. "DECC still run the programme," an official tweeted, providing a link. And those who followed that official advice were directed to a delivery service for magic mushrooms. This may have been a mistake; it may have been a critique. But suddenly a lot makes sense.• Like a befuddled fighter emerging from the jungle, unaware that the war has been fought and lost, the talisman of the Tory right Dr Liam Fox continues to rail against the public spiritedness of Edward Snowden. Presumably the first thing he heard on stumbling into daylight was that the Guardian had won a Pulitzer prize to sit nicely alongside the domestic prize of Newspaper of the Year for helping Snowden bring his concerns to public attention. This may well have befuddled Fox further, as may the realisation that even the US president and much of the British establishment now see issues of pressing concern arising from the revelations. Snowden is a bad man, Fox told the America Enterprise Institute. "Let us not imbue his cowardice with higher motives. Let us say what we mean. Let us call treason by its name." Reports say Fox called the whistleblower a "self publicising narcissist". Self awareness never was the doctor's forte.• Adding grist to the mill of those who say it's not what you know but who, a happy development for the residents of in North Yorkshire. "Jeremy Hunt has told the NHS Independent Reconfiguration Panel to review a plan to change consultant-led units at the Friarage Hospital, Northallerton," the Northern Echo reports. "Following warnings by Richmond MP William Hague and South Tees NHS Trust that the services were becoming increasingly fragile due to staffing issues, Mr Hunt has asked the panel to complete its initial assessment by Thursday, May 15." That's Jeremy. Door always open. Ever the good listener.• What about Ed Miliband? Will he listen to well-wishers imploring him to be more brave. No one doubts he has schemes and wheezes with which to win the election. They merely fret he will forget to share them with the voters. Even the party's national executive committee worries that the whole thing is being constructed under cloak of darkness. Nothing is likely to see light of day before the national policy forum in July, the last meeting was told. "Too late for the consultation and amendment process: instead everything will be 'knitted together' during the summer," reports NEC member Ann Black. Jon Cruddas, "assured the NEC that the papers were awash with ideas," she said. "But it would be nice to know what they are."• Understandable consternation greets the decision to close Britain's last remaining cigarette factory – 500 jobs may go. The move by Imperial Tobacco will also affect the company's French plant where the legendary Gauloises brand has been made for the past 40 years. Production will relocate to Poland. "So now THE French cigarette is not only owned by the English, it'll be made by the Poles," complained one worker. "The only French thing about it will be the name. And you wonder why globalisation is a dirty word here." We own their fags, they'll own our nuclear plants? Who has the best of that deal?• Finally, we referred on Tuesday to the political strategist John McTernan and his USP. He repeatedly advises those who might win elections, whether here or in Scotland or Australia, to display more "swagger". No sign as yet that Ed Miliband has been listening. As for McTernan, he seems unworried by the disclosure of trade secrets. "Been swaggering a lot since you revealed my 'secret sauce' in @guardian Diary," he tweeted yesterday. But could the sultan of swagger say anything else?Twitter: @hugh_muir
