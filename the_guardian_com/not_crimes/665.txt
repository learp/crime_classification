San Francisco’s citizens have narrowly voted against controversial proposals to restrict short-term home and apartment rentals, handing a victory to companies such as Airbnb.The failure of “Proposition F” is a victory for the company which has been targeted by affordable housing advocates and tenants’ rights attorneys, though it won by a tighter margin than expected with 55% of votes.Airbnb, which is currently worth at least $25bn, spent more than $8m defeating the measure, canvassing neighborhoods with volunteers and populating billboards in a campaign orchestrated by Washington political operative Chris Lehane.Sparking protests and intense debates over the last few months, Prop F was the most contentious in an election that many say will shape San Francisco’s future.The proposal would have limited the number of days owners could rent their units to 75 days a year, instead of the current 90-day limit. It also proposed banning rentals of “in-law” units - often basements or annexes, required hosts and marketplaces like Airbnb to provide data on visits and revenues, and given neighbors greater power to sue rental property owners if they believe they are violating the law.The No on F Campaign raised more than $8m to fight the initiative with 95% of the funding coming from Airbnb. Up to voting day on November 3, records show the campaign had used almost $7m of that funding on a large volume of television ads, door to door campaigners and a social media team to spread the word online.

Many long-time community organizations and tenants rights groups, including the Housing Rights Committee, Affordable Housing Alliance, Causa Justa/Just Cause supported the measure. While Proposition F was the most publicized public vote, Tuesday’s ballot included several initiatives that illustrated how the San Francisco is struggling to navigate the challenges of a tech-enabled future, while still preserving the city’s history as a haven for a diverse community of artists and social activists.San Francisco’s mayor Ed Lee, who stands a strong chance of reelection in another of today’s votes, has long been a vocal supporter of the tech industry. Lee’s administration has used tax breaks to incentivise companies including Twitter, Zoosk and Zendesk to base their businesses in the city’s downtown area.Protesters occupy Airbnb HQ ahead of housing affordability vote Another proposal, Proposition I, sought to enforce an 18-month moratorium on market-rate housing in the Mission District, one of the neighborhoods at the center of the city’s gentrification debate. Backed by several local businesses, Proposition J Legacy would create a pool of money that would have been granted to businesses who have been in the community for over 20 years.And Proposition I would require all public meetings to be livestreamed online. Supporters, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have maintained that the move would increase government transparency.
