Lord Sugar predicts that The Great British Bake Off will be a “total disaster” when it moves to Channel 4 – and has pledged his future to the BBC.The Apprentice star believes that Channel 4 will not be able to copy the BBC’s recipe for success.Judge Mary Berry and presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins have stuck to stay with the corporation, while Paul Hollywood has opted to move with the show to Channel 4.Channel 4 still pursuing 2017 Great British Bake Off launch “I think it’s going to be a total disaster,” said Sugar in an interview with the Radio Times. “Think about their personal credibility as the production company, if this thing bombs on Channel 4. I mean, the difference between 15 million viewers, right, which Bake Off got, to possibly settling down to about 3 million on Channel 4, surely that’s got to mean something to them, hasn’t it?”Sugar, back with a new series of The Apprentice next week, said that he would not follow the show if it was snapped up by a rival broadcaster.“My loyalty is with the BBC,” he said. “The rights owner would need to run it past me, because they’d need to sound out whether I’d go with it, and then would be told no.”Sugar also said that he felt the BBC was increasingly getting a “raw deal” as shows it builds into hits are poached by deeper-pocketed rivals.“I think they [the BBC] are getting a raw deal these days,” he said. “I mean, because they make something successful like Bake Off or The Voice [which is moving to ITV], then suddenly a commercial channel comes along and just goes and buys it off them, and greedy production companies sell it to them. I don’t find that morally correct.”Channel 4 has reportedly paid as much as £75m for a three-year deal to air The Great British Bake Off from 2018.The broadcaster is trying to get the BBC to drop a contractual clause it has with the show’s maker Love Productions to allow it to air a series next year. The BBC is working on a new rival format involving Berry, Giedroyc and Perkins which it hopes to start filming next year.Any new format is likely to be scrutinised by Love’s legal team for any rights issues.The Bake Off producers have previously threatened court proceedings against the BBC for a show involving a search for the nation’s leading hair stylist, called Hair, claiming the deployment of several rounds and a technical challenge made it too similar to Bake Off.
