Keep your files secureIf you have computer files that you want to keep secure, store them under encryption. Most modern computer operating systems have options to encrypt all documents on the computer — for example BitLocker for Windows and FileVault for Mac. Turn them on. For really sensitive files, use PGP encryption or on-the-fly encryption software such as VeraCrypt. Store the encrypted files on a removable storage device such as a USB stick or external hard disk, and keep that hidden or locked away.For all forms of encryption, use long passwords that would be difficult to hack, and don’t use the same password for more than one purpose. Decide what computer to useIf you’re worried about confidentiality, we recommend that you don’t contact us from a work computer. It’s a safe bet that your employer can see the activity on its networks and equipment.Contacting us from home can also be problematic. If you’re not using Tor (see below), it’s possible communications could be traced back to you via your home IP address. And if you’re already under suspicion, your home network could itself be targeted. If you do choose to use your own computer, make sure the operating system and software is up to date. Is your computer running anti-malware software with the latest definitions? If it has built-in firewall software, turn it on. To conceal your identity from prying eyes it may be safer to use a computer in an internet cafe or on a public wifi network. Computers in internet cafes may not have the software you need, and public networks can be less secure (technically speaking) than a home or work connection, but their mass use may help conceal who you are. Think about whether you could you be on CCTV, or if the time and place that you get online could provide a clue to your identity.Whatever computer you use, remember that your online activity reveals your IP address to the internet, and that email and browser software normally records a history of what you’ve been doing. Use the private browsing or incognito option to deactivate this record. Better still, use Tor.Hide who you are online with TorThe Tor network bounces your internet activity through a series of relays to hide the source location. This obfuscates your IP address, making it very difficult to ascertain where a message or webpage visit came from. Tor browsers can also be configured to discard your browsing history and to reduce the amount of information you reveal about yourself while online. The Guardian’s SecureDrop service can only be reached through Tor.To access the Tor network you may need to install Tor software. It’s free and works on Windows, Macs, and Linux-style operating systems. Use it much like you would a normal browser such as Firefox.Tor helps to hide you from snoopers on the internet, but if your actual computer is itself being monitored, Tor can’t protect you from that. Furthermore, under some circumstances — such as at work — the very use of Tor software could attract attention. Go somewhere you won’t be monitored, or protect yourself against being hacked at source by using a secure operating system such as Tails. For maximum security, use TailsTails, which is short for The Amnesiac and Incognito Live System, is a computer operating system designed to preserve security. It connects to the internet using the Tor network; it helps guard against local monitoring; and when you log out, it wipes any unencrypted content, leaving no evidence of what you’ve been up to. It is far more secure than using a normal computer or phone.You don’t need a separate computer to run Tails. You can download it and install it onto a USB stick, and then force a regular computer to start up using the USB stick instead of its internal hard drive.Getting set up on Tails requires some technical aptitude.
