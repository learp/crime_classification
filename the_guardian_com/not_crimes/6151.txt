Tory MP Philip Davies has faced widespread criticism after it emerged he told a conference hosted by an anti-feminist group that Britain’s justice system was skewed in favour of women.Davies, the MP for Shipley, delivered a 45-minute speech at the International Conference on Men’s Issues, which was organised by the Justice for Men and Boys party (J4MB), claiming “feminist zealots really do want women to have their cake and eat it”.The comments, disclosed by the Guardian, provoked outrage across the political spectrum including calls from the Labour leader that Davies should have his membership of the Conservative party suspended by the prime minister. Davies, who sits on the Commons justice committee, had told the event at the ExCel centre in London that women benefitted from an “equality but only when it suits agenda”.Critics questioned his decision to share a platform with J4MB, which issues awards for “lying feminist of the month”, “toxic feminist of the month” and “whiny feminist of the month”, and promotes inflammatory articles on its website including a piece titled 13 reasons women lie about being raped.Jeremy Corbyn said the “deeply sexist” comments revealed Davies had “utter contempt for women”, before calling on Theresa May to withdraw the Conservative whip.Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn)Comments made by Philip Davies are deeply sexist and show utter contempt for women.

She said: “Theresa May should withdraw the Tory whip from Mr Davies … while an investigation is carried out. He has open contempt for women. His views are so out-dated they are prehistoric. “He legitimises the inflammatory and toxic rhetoric of groups who are misogynistic to their core. He should have no place in Theresa May’s Tory party.”The Fawcett Society, a charity campaigning for gender equality and women’s rights, said he was “increasingly … at odds with many in his own party”, and suggested he might work for Donald Trump’s campaign.Davies, a pro-Brexit campaigner who backed Andrea Leadsom for the Tory leadership, appeared alongside anti-feminist bloggers, incluing Herbert Purdy – who likened the activist Malala Yousafzai to Osama bin Laden and has written posts such as: “The exquisite beauty of patriarchy”.He told the Guardian he did not believe his appearance at an event hosted by J4MB meant he subscribed to what the party stood for, adding: “I don’t think any of my colleagues will ever feel threatened by the political party concerned.”Justice for Men and Boys’ hatred of feminism eclipses its remit to help men | Catherine Bennett J4MB states on its website that it intends to target the 20 most marginal Conservative constituencies in the next general election and has the income to fund its candidates’ £500 deposits.The party is led and was founded by Mike Buchanan, a former business consultant who retired at 52 and launched campaigns such as the Anti-Feminism League and the Campaign for Merit in Business – which actively fights against initiatives to improve gender diversity in the boardroom.J4MB pushes for a greater number of male teachers in schools because they claim female teachers habitually award lower grades to boys than to girls.Its 80-page 2015 election manifesto suggested women should stop being appointed as senior company directors, that the Equality Act 2010 should be scrapped and that men should claim their pensions before women because they work harder and die younger.After thanking Buchanan at the conference, Davies delivered a speech on “the justice gender gap”, arguing that the British justice system favoured women and discriminated against men. “In this day and age the feminist zealots really do want women to have their cake and eat it,” he told the conference. “They fight for their version of equality on all the things that suit women – but are very quick to point out that women need special protections and treatment on other things.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Angela Rayner, shadow equalities secretary, said Davies’s views ‘are so out-dated they are prehistoric’.

Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: “Philip Davies comments are astonishing. The need for feminism is self-evident.”Jenny Earle, director of Prison Reform Trust’s programme for reducing women’s imprisonment, said: “The evidence is not that women are treated more leniently. In fact they are twice as likely as men to receive a custodial sentence for a first offence, and the main offence for which women are imprisoned is theft and shoplifting.”Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, , said: “Philip Davies is a man with form on these issues. Tragically, in 2016 he sounds increasingly anachronistic and at odds with many in his own party, including the prime minister herself. Perhaps he should lend his support to Trump’s presidential campaign?“Those who champion gender equality and women’s rights want to create a fairer, stronger society and a more productive economy. We want to grow the cake that Mr Davies refers to, then we can all eat a bigger slice of it. Perhaps we’ll even be generous enough to save a slice for him.”In one section of his speech, which was delivered in July and appeared on Buchanan’s YouTube page two weeks ago, he suggested women were treated more favourably in the family courts, which often deal with child custody.He said: “Many women use their children as a stick to beat the father with, either because they’re bitter about the failed relationship, for financial reasons, or because they’ve moved on and it’s easier for them if their new partner takes on the role of father to their children.”Davies told the conference: “I don’t believe there’s an issue between men and women. The problem is being stirred up by those who can be described as militant feminists and the politically correct males who pander to this nonsense.“It seems to me that this has led to an ‘equality but only when it suits’ agenda that applies to women. The drive for women to have so-called equality on all the things that suit the politically correct agenda but not other things that don’t is of increasing concern to me.“For example, we hear plenty about increasing the numbers of women on company boards and female representation in parliament; however, there’s a deafening silence when it comes to increasing the number of men who have custody of their children or who have careers as midwives. In fact, generally there seems to be a deafening silence on all the benefits women have compared to men.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Fawcett Society chief executive Sam Smethers suggested Davies lent his support to Donald Trump’s campaign. Photograph: Graham Turner for the GuardianDavies raises the issue of prison uniforms being compulsory for men but not for women, a policy he has raised in parliament in the past. “Men and women are different, it’s a fact,” he said. “Yet this is not allowed to be a reason to prevent equality in the fields where men are better on the whole – for example, when it comes to jobs that require great strength. Ah no, that would be sexist.“A woman must have equality and do whatever she wants, except when it comes to wearing a prison uniform, obviously.”Janet Bloomfield, a supporter of Women Against Feminism – a social media campaign featuring photos of women with pieces of paper listing reasons for rejecting feminism – also addressed the conference.She has called single mothers “bona fide idiots” who do not care about their children’s wellbeing, and writes blogposts with titles such as “Why don’t we have a dumb fucking whore registry? Now that would be justice”. She has dismissed the concept of “rape culture” as “a giant rape fantasy”.Davies told the Guardian: “I don’t accept the premise that the only place people can speak on anything is a place where they agree with everything that organisation stands for.“I don’t agree with everything the Conservative party does but I’m still a Conservative MP. I don’t follow the logic that if you speak at something, it follows you therefore agree with everything it does. I’m not sure anybody subscribes to that in their life.”Asked about specific pledges in the J4MB manifesto, Davies said: “If you’ve got any points about what they stand for, my point is take them up with them.”Asked about J4MB’s plans to target Tory seats, he said: “I don’t think any of my colleagues will ever feel threatened by the political party concerned.”Davies said he had not been paid for the appearance.
