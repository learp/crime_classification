Alex has recently moved to secondary school and has created a foolproof way to stay out of trouble: don’t react.He has seen what happened to David, one of the boys in his class, who reacted to a bit of teasing and now suffers from constant abuse. Alex is surviving school thanks to his strategy until he receives a feather with an anonymous letter, which says ‘Coming soon. A boy is going to fly’.As Alex realises the whole class has received the same notes, more letters come and he becomes more intrigued by the mystery. Will a boy really fly?This book is a fascinating and thought-provoking read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The characters in the book will make you laugh, cry and smile and I am sure many children will be able to relate to them. With this book, the author reminds us how difficult secondary school can be, especially if you’re being bullied, and this is what makes it such a thought-provoking and powerful read. I would recommend this book to children aged 10-12 because the language is not difficult, but some of the themes are difficult for younger children to understand. I really enjoyed this book and I think it will change a lot of people’s opinions about bullying.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
