My kitchen is … so small, it’s like a galley on a little boat. I don’t have enough cupboard space, so even the surfaces on top of the cupboards are full. Last year I made an 11-tiered wedding cake , and I look at my kitchen now and wonder how on Earth I managed. There was cake everywhere, even in my laundry room. I would like a bigger space, but there’s nowhere to expand, so I just use the dining-room table – it’s the only surface that’s big enough to roll out large sheets of fondant and not get any dents in the cakes as I’m covering them. I sit facing my garden when I’m working – the wildlife and the flowers are inspiring.My favourite kitchen tool is … a clear plastic scraper I got in Australia. They use it for ganached cakes, and I use it to get nice straight edges on my fondant or my buttercream. It’s also really helpful to scrape excess cornflour off my work surface, rather than clogging up a brillo pad. I use it all the time.My storecupboard staple is … golden, or unrefined, caster sugar. It gives an extra dimension of flavour to my cakes. I make a lot of different flavours: a trad fruit cake, a vanilla sponge with strawberry, a chocolate sponge and a rich chocolate with ganache, a salted caramel sponge, a gooseberry and elderflower sponge … When I’m not baking, rice is my staple – my kids don’t like sandwiches, so I make them rice-based packed lunches. And I love rice pudding for dessert in the evening.  Tiers before bedtime … Natasha Collins decorating her 11-tiered wedding cake. Photograph: Natasha Collins/InstagramWhen I’m starving I … eat cake! I always have so much around. I always have samples in my freezer for clients to taste. While I was working on my new book, The Homemade Wedding Cake, for four months I had about 100 portions of cake in my house every day. They were wedding cake recipes. I couldn’t just scale down the quantities – I had to test the whole recipe each time. I was doing the school run with carrier bags full of cake, like some crazy drug lord, trying to get rid of it all.My culinary inspiration is … my parents. My dad makes a chocolate cake and he’s always making pie. My mum is Irish and Scottish, so she makes lots of scones and cakes too. They both come from homes where mums and grandmothers all baked. And that’s how I grew up – we never had a cup of tea without a slice of cake or a biscuit, and it was never anything shop-bought.My best-kept kitchen secret is … to always add coffee extract, or a little espresso, when making a chocolate cake. It makes it taste more chocolatey.When I’m invited to dinner I always take … cake. No one ever asks me to do the starter. It’s always the pudding.Everything tastes better with … family.When I go shopping I … try to be organised, but I never have enough time to plan a week’s menus. Most days I have to pop into the supermarket quickly before school pickup. And I never buy enough butter and eggs, so I’ll always get to the last cake tier and have to pop out to the shops.For dinner tonight … I’m doing macaroni cheese for the girls, and for me and my husband, something light – penne arrabiata, I think. My eight-year-old made a lemon drizzle cake, so we can have that for dessert, or some of the gooseberry and elderflower or the apple and blackberry cakes I have left over from the book launch.
