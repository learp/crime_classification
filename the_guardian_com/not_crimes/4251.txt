I’m 55 and, like the people in your article (‘I have more fun now than I did when I was 20’, 17 December), I too have a positive outlook on life. I work full-time and every week I swim, go to the gym, do pilates, cycle, go for long walks, do voluntary work and have my granddaughter to stay over for a night. I’m also studying for two qualifications.

Bring some hygge to work • My father, a Cheshire man, used the dialect word “lozzerk” for the English version of the now fashionable hygge (Bring some hygge to work, theguardian.com, 16 December). For example, we would lozzerk on the sofa on a Sunday evening to watch the classic serial on TV. Lozzerking involved the whole family, with absence not really allowed, so that as a teenager in my bedroom I would hear him ask where I was, not at ease to lozzerk without the family circle being complete.Rosie IrvineCanterbury• Jimmy Hibbert (Letters, 17 December) attributes the speculation regarding the appearance of WH Auden’s scrotum to Noël Coward. It has also been attributed to David Hockney, supposedly following a meeting between the playwright and the painter. Since Hockney is still with us, and given the importance of getting the historical record straight, perhaps he should be consulted.Bernard BesserglikPantin, France• After someone said Mick Jagger’s rugged physiognomy was probably mostly comprised of laughter lines, George Melly replied: “Nothing is that funny.”Tony MoonHove, East Sussex• Is there any chance that the Kremlin may have fixed the voting in the Strictly Come Dancing final? They’re big fans of anything with Len in.Will PageExeter• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
