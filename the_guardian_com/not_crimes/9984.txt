I had already heard of Quentin Crisp when I moved from Scotland to New York in 1992. He was one of those great eccentric Englishmen. He came out so young, at a time when you could be prosecuted for being gay, and then worked for decades as a model at art schools. John Hurt had played him in The Naked Civil Servant, the film based on his autobiography, but he was still listed in the New York phonebook.I called him and he answered in this plummy accent: “Oh yeeees?” I didn’t know what to say. “Er, hi. I just moved here. Could we go for a coffee?” “Absolutely. Charmed to do so.” All he wanted was to be bought a meal, and he would entertain you. “I sing for my supper,” he said. We talked about how he disliked England, and how New York was the perfect place for someone like him: a more open society with more at one’s fingertips. He would name-drop, though not in an arrogant way. It was as if they were your friends too. He went on about this “Andy” guy and I realised it was Warhol. He told me Sting wrote An Englishman in New York about him. ‘He forewarned me: “I deplore house cleaning. It’s the biggest waste of time.” I thought: “Wow, he wasn’t joking”’ He was such a dandy, wearing a hat, a velvet jacket, a purple scarf, and mother-of-pearl rinse in his hair. Everybody would stop and talk to him. Drivers would honk their horns, cabbies would wave and homeless dudes would shout: “Hey, Quentin!” A huge truck went past and blew his hat off, revealing the longest comb-over I’d ever seen. “We can’t have that, can we?” he said, and just swept it back across before plopping his hat back on.The next time we met, I asked if I could come back to his apartment and take a photograph. “Of course,” he said, “but I have to tell you, I absolutely deplore house cleaning. I think it’s the biggest waste of time.” People often say that and then their apartments are fine. But when I saw his, I thought: “Wow, he wasn’t joking.” Given the way he looked and talked, I thought he would live in grandeur, but his apartment was by a Hell’s Angels club on Third Street, just a room and a bathroom. He had no kitchen, just a bed, chair, books, papers and plates that had never been used. When his phone rang, he would give the same greeting: “Oh yeeees?” He answered it a couple of times, then fell asleep. I didn’t want a picture of him sleeping, so I just sat down and waited. Luckily the phone went again and he jolted up: “Oh yeeees?”It was a weird time in New York – gentrification was beginning, but the murder rate was still really high. You’d see Jim Jarmusch or Patti Smith in the street. It was everything I wanted it to be. I worked in galleries to learn more about photography. Being privy to people’s practices, and how they talked about their work, really opened my eyes.But I went from being a working photographer to disappearing off the radar – and living in housing projects as a full-blown heroin addict. I went from partying to dependency to addiction to hopelessness. I was eventually arrested for possession and got sent to Rikers Island, where I very painfully cold-turkeyed in a cell. And then they tried to deport me. But I talked my way into rehab and that changed my life. It was painful and tearful but the more I proved myself, the more people came back into my life. I took photos during those years, at first of other drug takers, but it seemed awkward and insincere. So I turned the camera on myself and eventually got that body of work published in New York magazine. What I lost financially in those years, I gained spiritually 10 times over – though I wouldn’t recommend it as a path to spiritual awakening.
