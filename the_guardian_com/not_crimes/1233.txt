Taming kinks and waves is mainly about managing frizz. Curlies know that even the most diligent application of heat and oil will fail to suppress those last few stubborn coils. The good news is that natural-looking curls are back – and they’re almost effortless to achieve with the new generation of organic and largely chemical-free conditioners, texturisers and serums on the market.
