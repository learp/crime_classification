What became of the Guvnors of the Seven Sisters Road (below) and without photography would your life have followed a similar path?  The Guvnors in their Sunday Suits, Finsbury Park, London, 1958. Photograph: Don McCullin  Guardian contributor DonMcCullin 17 May 2016 2:22pmWell I had to choices when I grew up in Finsbury Park. Either I ran with the pack, which I've photographed in the Observer, or I tried to stay on the straight and narrow and eventually escape what was a really violent ghetto at the time. It was by the fortune of this one sunny day that I took my camera and photographed the boys in this derelict building at the end of my street. I took this photo to the Observer newspaper, the editor asked: Did you take this? I said: yes. And they published it. And gave me £50 and it was a king's ransom, the turning point of my whole life. It offered me a life away from the bigotry and ignorance and violence of Finsbury Park. And since then I've managed to publish 30 books, numerous exhibitions. But the final footnote is that I failed my photography test to becomes a RAF photographer. I taught myself everything about photography and darkroom work. It was all based on the foundations of a terrible beginning in my life. I've managed to turn it all around and be where I am.Victoria Anderson asks:Being a photographer who has experienced multiple scenarios out of your control and potentially fatal – how do you deal with what you have seen and the effects on your mental health? I’m just curious to know how you deal with the mental side of the photography you do?  Guardian contributor DonMcCullin 17 May 2016 2:16pmWhat I do is I thin down the hard part by putting all my energy into the trying part of processing the film, making beautiful prints. I don't disassociate, I always retain the memory of what I've seen because the memory becomes my white stick, it guides me into the next stage, into the darkroom and releasing my emotions into the print. It might be darker, more sinister. A lot of fear went into my work, I saw dead children, men with their jaws blown away, holes in their throat. This had to be got rid of or I would have post-traumatic stress. Which I don't. But I do have bad dreams. I took my soul and my stress into the darkroom. I belong to this system I've developed. It has been a marriage for me, one of the longest lasting of my life.Updatedat 2.43pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.17pm BST14:17Ongley says:How much of yourself do you feel is ever appropriate or required to give away in order to get close enough to a subject? And thank you for your outstanding work.  Guardian contributor DonMcCullin 17 May 2016 2:13pm100% really. Once I make up my mind, I think of little else. And once I make the statement that I commit myself to such a subject there is no turning back.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.15pm BST14:15Stanley_Park asks:Regarding the Beatles’ 1968 photoshoot, how structured was the day, was it totally spontaneous in terms of location choice? Were any locations vetoed? Any chance of you retracing your steps for the 50th anniversary of the shoot with McCartney?  Guardian contributor DonMcCullin 17 May 2016 2:12pmOne day I received a phone call from the Apple company, who were tired of requests from endless photographers to do more shoots of the Beatles. They said to me if we offered you £200 would you consider spending a day with the Beatles . I would have given them £200. However, I agree to it. and we chose the location of the East End of London and I spent a very interesting day which ended up in Paul McCartney's house in St John's Wood having tea at the end of his garden in what looked like a golf ball but was his summerhouse. I loved being with them but photographically looking back I found this possibly the most unrewarding thing in my photo collection because other people did a much better job.Updatedat 2.15pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.12pm BST14:12Luke Dray says:Have you any advice for young photojournalists starting out in the industry?  Guardian contributor DonMcCullin 17 May 2016 2:09pmYes don't do it. My concerns are that we are seeing less and less photojournalism and I would think twice before investing your life in thinking this would eventually find you some reward. My main comments relate to possibly the vanishing future of newspapers.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.08pm BST14:08HenleyRegatta says:If you could guarantee your safety would you go to Syria to document life there under IS?  Guardian contributor DonMcCullin 17 May 2016 2:07pmYes I would actually. It would have be one of the most difficult situation of my life. There is an English captive there, John Cantlie, and we are in contact. But I don't think my wife would allow it. She was angry when I was in Damascus last week. I went to photograph Palmyra because I did a book called Southern Frontiers and Palmyra featured big in it in the book and particularly the temple which Isis blew up. I wanted to show the tragedy of the devastation. I found a hole in a wall and managed to shoot one frame before a Russian solider appear out of nowhere and told me to get going. So you could say my trip was a semi-failure... But I wound up in Aleppo and Homs.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.07pm BST14:07MsMariaGoldstein asks:Your new exhibition is at Photo London, probably the largest gathering of photography Britain has ever seen. Why do you think there has been this groundswell of interest in photography in Britain? Will London ever overtake Paris as the world capital of photography?  Guardian contributor DonMcCullin 17 May 2016 2:02pmWell it's not you see. New York is the world capital, France next and England third. There's more visual, better designed magazines and media outlets. Unfortunately we have far too much emphasis on fashion, accessories, advertising, and now we have the iPhone. This is all part of it. The value of photography has gone up enormously too. Photographic prints have changed hands for hundreds and thousands of dollars in the market. Unfortunately, I fear the contamination of the art world and photography will steal integrity and commitment from some photographers.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.04pm BST14:04'Photography is about the chemistry of your own emotion. You release the button on this hopefully everlasting image of people who are in unfortunate situations'BaldricksBrother says:Robert Capa, one of Magnum’s founders, said “if your pictures aren’t good enough, you’re not close enough.” Do you think you got too close?It would be trite to say that during your lifetime the world has changed but it has, arguably becoming a more dangerous and murderous place. Photography has played its part; for the good or the bad?  Guardian contributor DonMcCullin 17 May 2016 1:59pmDid I get too close? The answer is yes, and I'm glad I did. I always use the wide angle lens so it was necessary for me to get even closer. My main purpose in saying this I wanted to bring you, the viewer, as close as I was standing so that you could almost smell the despair and the pain and the suffering I was witnessing. Photography isn't about cameras, film, chemistry. It's the chemistry of your own emotion. You release the button on this hopefully everlasting image of people who are in such unfortunate situations.I have a moral feeling that however close I've been to my subject and however it's played out by the viewer in their minds, I sincerely believe that all their imagery we've seen in the last 30, 40 years, hasn't really brought about an understanding that we could see the end of further wars. The conflicts now have become far worse than they were when I first started out. Nothing could be more despicable than the imagery of ISIS beheading prisoners in the desert. Just when you think you've seen the worse, another load of worse comes along.Updatedat 2.05pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.56pm BST13:56'When I came back from wars and revolution, I threw my cameras in a cupboard. I thought it was unnecessary to start persecuting my own family with the camera'stuckinazoo says:When it comes to home and family life, have you always adopted the photographer role and documented the lives of your loved ones? Or were you opposed to this approach, instead leaving the camera in the hands of others? Or a happy compromise?  Guardian contributor DonMcCullin 17 May 2016 1:53pmMy problem was that when I came back from these areas of conflict, when I came back to England, I would naturally find our own family in the security of our simple home with a caring and loving mother who would have assumed the role of father in my absence. It was very hard to pick up the thread of what my responsibility was. I though it was unnecessary to start persecuting my own family with the camera. And I have to say that when I came back from wars, and revolution, I put my cameras in a bag and threw them into the cupboard turned my back on them. There is very little documentation of the families I had in my life. Very little. Almost non existent. Some people's idea might be considered to be harmful. It was purely based on my exhaustion, my mental and physical exhaustion. Having seen terrible things. But I was a good father. I loved my children. And still do.Updatedat 1.58pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.50pm BST13:50'Newspapers promote this narcissistic imagery of celebrities and the rich because it sells newspapers. I don't that information, I call it a waste of great space'Christopher Nunn asks:The banality of life today is summed up for me by the navel-gazing “selfie” on the one hand, and the coverage given to shoals of “celebrities” on the other. What happened to looking at our world as it really is, too shameful to recognise?  Guardian contributor DonMcCullin 17 May 2016 1:47pmThis is a very good question. Thank you. My concerns are that celebrities - the wealthy and the celebrities have taken over from the most important images we need to be aware of - the suffering, the side of humanity that isn't in the privileged position in the first place and it's normally these unfortunate people during wars, revolutions and famines that are the last to be told of the dangers that are coming toward them. I know that newspapers are under threat of survival and I can't help feeling in some quarters that they are encouraged to promote this narcissistic imagery of celebrities and rich footballers and rich financiers because it sells newspapers. And sadly I don't call this information, it call it a waste of great space. I also feel that we are denying ourselves the chance to be educated on the tragedies and the political horrors that are going on out there and that we should be contributing to try and stop.Updatedat 1.54pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
