This book represents two young people’s quests to discover the ‘art of being normal’. David Piper is, according to the local school bully, a ‘freak show’. A loner who keeps himself to himself, with only two friends – who most people think are pretty weird. Life at school is hard, and he doesn’t want it to get any harder. The problem is, there is something David has known ever since he was eight years old, something that, in his school, will ensure he can never live a life free from bullying: he wants to be a girl.Mysterious Leo Denton also has a secret behind his swirling ‘crazy’ eyes. He’s just moved school, but won’t tell anyone why. His only aim is not to be noticed, whatever the cost.Of course, since this is fiction, Leo is soon noticed in the worst possible way, summoned to the headmaster’s office after defending David in a fight. In the most traditional of ways begins a most untraditional friendship, bridging both class and gender divides. Soon the two are inseparable, bound by the knowledge of each other’s secrets. Perhaps a little corny (and if you read the book you’ll see why I might say it’s a little contrived) but making what is, by the end at least, a great example of feel-good teenage fiction. The good ends happily, and the bad unhappily. Or at least, something along those lines, as I don’t want to give too much away!However, I don’t want to give the impression that it’s something you read once and then throw away into the dark, dusty depths of your bookshelf. It has a deeper message too, exploring the real meaning of ‘normal’. Reading this, you’ll end up pondering on whether ‘normal’ even exists – and if it does, who would even want to be it. I feel that this is particularly well summed up in the quotation towards the end of the book (I shan’t say from whom):  “Here lies so-and-so. They were completely normal.” Of course, nobody would/should want that on their gravestone!Despite being very different to anyone I know, I felt I could really identify and empathise with both David and Leo. Their characterisation is something Williamson did particularly well, and I think that that’s important. It makes the reader feel that they are just like anyone you or I might know, removing the element of stigma that often exists in society. This sense of reality pervades the entire novel: when we finally discover what forced Leo to move schools, it’s nowhere near as dramatic as events in some teen fiction, but because it is so real it seems far more upsetting and terrible. What should I do if I think I might be transgender? Reading the bio at the back, I discovered that the author has worked in the NHS Gender Identity Development Service, listening to young peoples’ stories, which is perhaps where the sense of realism comes from. The dialogue is perhaps occasionally a little forced, where it tries to drive a message across, but this was hardly noticeable.It’s not the kind of book I’d normally pick up and choose, but I’m glad I did. I feel like it is both an important and enjoyable story, although certainly not always easy to read. Even if you don’t think you’ll enjoy it, it’s well worth giving it a try.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
