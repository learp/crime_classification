The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with The Source ft Candi Staton: You Got The Love   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I always like to open with an unexpected classic that will make you go: “Wow I remember this”. I go for this purely for the intro.The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor Jay Z: Big Pimpin’   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This will never fail. A feel-good classic that people know all the lyrics to.The track that currently gets the most rewinds Rebound X: Rhythm ‘N’ Gash (Instrumental)   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This instantly gets a reload each and every time.The track I wish I’d signed to my label 808INK ft Daniel OG: Driving Cut   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest A real fave with a UK vibe.

When the vocals drop, you instantly get a bumped-up vibe, especially with this remix by a favourite DJ and producer of mine.The track that should have been a crossover hit Giggs: Whippin Excursion   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This should have been supported by the mainstream.
