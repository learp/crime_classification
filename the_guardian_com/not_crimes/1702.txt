After the open horizons of Bulbeck Common, the steep lane leading down to the valley bottom seemed to swaddle us in tall vegetation. The broad verges that flanked the tractor-width of tarmac were filled with wild flowers.As we approached a thicket of wild raspberries the drowsy hum of insects grew louder, mostly from carder bees, ginger-brown bundles of vibrating energy clasping pendant flowers whose stamens dusted them with pollen. The task of the larger bumblebees visiting spires of foxgloves was more challenging; level flight made entry into the steeply angled flowers a constant struggle. Their technique was always the same, grasping the speckled flower lip and hauling themselves up the slippery slope. Their exit was equally inelegant, shuffling backwards then free-falling out of the flower, but not before its stamens had smeared white pollen on their thorax. Some bees, apparently exhausted, had settled on wood cranesbill and hogweed flowers, not to feed but to cool overheating flight muscles. Others bore battle scars: tattered wing tips, frayed by their addiction to foraging within the foxglove's narrow corolla tubes.Further down the hill a great swag of fragrant dog roses hung over the verge. Their bee visitors, a broader constituency of honeybees, bumblebees and mining bees, adopted an easier technique, scrabbling around between petals and a whorl of stamens, buzzing to dislodge a shower of pollen. Nearby, bumblebees used their bulk to force down keel petals of yellow broom and so reach the nectaries, tripping spring-loaded stamens, which released a pollen explosion on to their undersides.So much energy expended, on a warm summer afternoon, which invited lethargy. We'd walked two miles across open moorland in half an hour, but this final quarter-mile stretch took twice as long; every step inviting us to stand and stare. This was that rarity among road verges â€“ one that had escaped the attentions of the obsessive mower.Twitter: @seymourdaily
