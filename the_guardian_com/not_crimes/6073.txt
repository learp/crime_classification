The apple tree must be 15 years old now, barely taller than its owner, its branches laden with the palest green and rose pink fruits. One of the first trees I planted in this garden, it has paid for itself 10 times over. Discovery, the snowiest white flesh flashed with pink, is not a cooking apple, but I often treat it as such. The fruit puffs up proudly in the oven without turning to froth and the flavour stays true to itself.Little apples, no bigger than a tennis ball, will bake in about half an hour. I stuff them with sweet cake crumbs and apricot jam; raisins and honey or golden sultanas, and sweet fruit pastes of quince or damson. The small apples tend to hold their shape when cooked and I often place them in thick segments, peel intact, round the Sunday roast, or toss them in a pan with shredded, crinkle-leaved cabbage, and cooked and drained pearl barley. This week I hid slices of Ashmead’s Kernel, its russet skin as rough as a pan scrubber, under a pot-roasting pork chop, where they soaked up all the porky goodness. Membrillo, the sharp and citrussy quince paste, is exceptional with apples Sweet apples make a fine sauce, too, and unlike one made with cooking apples, will sit in undulating mounds on the plate rather than forming a puddle. I peel them, then simmer them with no more than a couple of tablespoons of water or apple juice, a couple of cloves, a few lightly crushed coriander seeds and a squeeze of lemon juice.It’s a good sauce for serving cold on a roast pork and watercress sandwich. Even more so if you crush some crackling to a coarse powder with a pestle and mortar and scatter the savoury dust over the sauce before you lower the second piece of bread in place. But first, we have dinner to eat.Pot roast pork chops with apples and artichokesA spare rib chop, with or without the bone, pot roasts sweetly with a glass or two of apple juice, and some autumnal root vegetables. Don’t be tied to my suggestion of vegetables. If you are troubled by Jerusalem artichokes, then use small, yellow-fleshed potatoes or peeled and roughly chopped swedes, which are always happy with pork and apples. Serves 2butter 40golive oil 3 tbspspare rib chops 2 pieces, total weight 600gJerusalem artichokes 400glemon juice a littleapples 500ggarlic 3 clovescider vinegar 3 tbspapple juice 100mlWarm the butter and olive oil in a large casserole to which you have a lid, season the chops with salt and black pepper then brown them lightly on both sides in the hot oil. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.Peel the Jerusalem artichokes and rub them with lemon juice to stop them discolouring. Transfer the nicely golden chops to a plate and set aside. Put the artichokes into the pan and colour them lightly all over. Cut the apples into quarters, remove their cores, then cut into thick segments.Add the apples to the pan and allow to turn golden on both sides, taking care not to overcook them. Peel the garlic and add it, whole, to the pan. Pour in the vinegar and let it sizzle, scraping at any crusted deposits on the pan with a wooden spoon. Pour in the apple juice, then place the pork on top of the artichokes and apples and cover with a lid.Bake for an hour until the pork and artichokes are tender. Serve the chops with the artichokes and apples, checking the liquor for seasoning and spooning it over the chops.

Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the ObserverBaked apples, quince paste and vine fruitsQuince paste, often sold under its Spanish name of membrillo, has a sharp, almost citrus character that is exceptionally good with apples. You may find damson and plum varieties in the shops, too, which would be just as suitable. I use small, dessert apples for this, so each person can have two on their plate. Larger apples, such as bramleys, are suitable, though the cooking time will be longer. Allow 50 minutes or so for a big fat cooking apple. Serves 4golden sultanas 100graisins 100gcandied orange peel 100gquince paste 125gground cinnamon ½ tspnutmeg 1, halvedapples 8, small and sweetapple juice 150mldouble cream to serveSet the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Put the sultanas and raisins into a mixing bowl. Place the candied peel on a chopping board, cut it into small dice then combine it with the sultanas and raisins. Stuff the apples with sweet cake crumbs and apricot jam; raisins and honey Warm the quince paste over a moderate heat then, as soon as it has melted, scrape it into the fruits. Stir in the ground cinnamon and a very fine grating of nutmeg – just 3 or 4 rubs on the grater should be enough.Core the apples using an apple corer or a small knife. Run a knife around the middle of each apple, scoring a line that goes just below the skin, and taking care not to cut right through to the hollow.Place the apples snugly in a roasting tin. Fill each apple with some of the fruited quince paste. Spoon any leftover mixture around the apples, and then pour the apple juice into the tin.Bake in the preheated oven for about 40 minutes until the apples are puffed and risen, and their insides have become soft and frothy.Serve the apples with the sticky baked fruits from the baking tin and, if you wish, a jug of pure, fridge-cold, double cream.Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
