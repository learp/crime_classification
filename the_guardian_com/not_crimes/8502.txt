Guardian contributor ffordejasper 03 May 2016 2:19pmGood question. Always a problem, I think, and not least in JE the regrettable 'Mad woman in the attic' episode which does cast a few problems with Ed and Jane's romance, especially as Jane seems to forgive him this one small indiscretion once Bertha is well, burnt. It doesn't read too well right now, really, but as a narrative twist of ages past, I guess it must have been a zinger.By rights, we should be shouting: WATCH OUT JANE!I think the best thing to do is to read, consider, build, think and then do the best one can for oneself and one's immediate sphere. Feminism and Jane Eyre. I'm sure much has been written about this, and by better writers than I.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.16pm BST14:16'Thursday is based on pioneering women aviators.'ID1821678 asks:Thursday Next is a wonderful heroine. Is there any one or number of women that inspired you when writing her? And if so, who?  Guardian contributor ffordejasper 03 May 2016 2:11pmThis was a hard one, as much of writing is intuitive and it may take years to figure out why you did some thing. I think Thursday is based on pioneering women aviators of the golden years of aviation - people like Bessie Colman, Beryl Markham, Amy Johnson. Women who didn't think for one moment that this was unusual or difficult - just went and did it because they had a burning desire to do so. Amy Johnson flew to Australia alone, in the twenties, with about ninety hours of flying experience in a 2nd hand aircraft and guided by what was essentially a school atlas. When she crash landed in India she repaired the aircraft with men's shirts sewn together and got a painter to make her some cellulose dope by smelling the wing and mixing up something similar.  The equivalent today would be a young lady passing her driving test on the friday, buying a Nissan Micra on Saturday and announcing she was going to Pluto on the Monday.Extraordinary women.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.06pm BST14:06snarlish says:My question regarding The Eyre Affair is: why 1985?  Guardian contributor ffordejasper 03 May 2016 2:04pm1985 was ten years before the year I first started writing it: 1995. The reason I did that was there was more of a 'now it can be told' aspect to The Eyre Affair, sort of like Thursday relating her story as a very old woman: 'I remember a time before the cheese wars, when the Gravitube was still running, and when Jane Eyre had a different ending..' I think I'd just seen The Name of the Rose and liked the way it started. As it turned out that aspect has gone, but a sense of this happened a few years back still hung on. That's why. It also meant, fortuitously, that I could plausibly include President for life George Formby.And when I use the word 'plausibly' I am talking in relative terms, naturally.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.00pm BST14:00MrsIsraelDavis asks:What do you think are some ideal cheese/beverage/book pairings?

Is it just a case of having a thick skin or did you learn to adapt to rejection? If so, how?  Guardian contributor ffordejasper 03 May 2016 1:53pmThey were rejection slips, but not really rejection, and that's how to view them. I was very conscious that I was learning my craft and these were notes telling me that my books were not (yet) of merchantable quality. Perseverance pays off, but only if you have a certain degree of pigheadedness, too. I always had a suspicion that The Three Bears were a suitable topic for a police procedural, and I built on that. It just took a while.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.50pm BST13:50Julie-Anne Richards asks:What made you make the protagonist of the Thursday Next books a woman? I’m happy about it, but curious.  Guardian contributor ffordejasper 03 May 2016 1:48pmThursday was a woman quite simply because I'd written two books with a male protagonist (The two Nursery Crime books, which although published last, were written first) and I thought, I like Jack Spratt but his female co-stars were much more interesting to write. She was third person for a while, but then I though I wasn't getting inside her head enough, so switched the book to first person.I've written Thursdayish characters ever since, even if they aren't truly the protagonist.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm BST13:49'Dark Reading Matter will be the next Thursday Next adventure.'Vikas Vijayovich Datta wants to know:When will the next Thursday Next adventure come out?  Guardian contributor ffordejasper 03 May 2016 1:45pm'Dark Reading Matter' will be the next, and we're building up to it. I love the idea of dark reading matter. That the 'observable bookworld' is calculated to consist of only 10% of all the stories there have ever been. This illusive and undetectable range of stories, the 'Dark Reading Matter' is made up of plots that writers had in their heads when they died, deleted manuscripts and people's memories. Quite simply: 'All those moments .. lost, like tears in the rain.'And Thursday has to get in there - or Goliath will. ooooh, I want to write it now.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.42pm BST13:42Jericho999 has a question about mapping plots:When I read The Eyre Affair I really enjoyed all the twists and turns - but the idea of having to plan it all seemed overwhelming. Do you use any kinds of visual aids/plans? or just have it all in your head?  Guardian contributor ffordejasper 03 May 2016 1:40pmAll in my head. (See thread above somewhere) I once did a plan and spent two weeks doing it, then started writing - within a week I had gone off on a tangent. The trouble is that there are these things called 'better ideas' and they lurk at the door, taunting me until I tell them to come in and use them. And those better ideas only chance along when I am writing. The worst and best thing that can happen for me is a better idea at the 11th hour. Bad because I have to rework everything, and best because they are, well, better ideas. The 'changing the ending of Jane Eyre' idea is a case in point - arrived when the book was finished. Had to go in. Pulled the book apart and then plastered over the cracks. The book is better for it.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.39pm BST13:39dhjones has a request:You promised us a new ‘Nursery crimes’ novel 6(?) years ago at a book launch in Foyles, London... what’s taking so long?

However, it’s my favourite all time book and everyone I’ve ever recommended it to has absolutely loved it and put it in their top books. Why do you think it wasn’t a commercial success?  Guardian contributor ffordejasper 03 May 2016 1:35pmI've no idea why it didn't sell - it's my favourite, too - along with Fourth Bear. What's not to love about talking bears and the 'Right to arm bears' controversy. Perhaps it's becasue as odd as my books were up until that point, SofG was an oddstep too far. Absurd heavy, rather than absurd light. It's an odd mix, too - whereas the Thursday Next series was 'high lit V low comedy' then SofG was 'slapstick V social issues' and that's a tricky one to do and read. Perhaps it's time is not yet here. 'Perhaps," as my editor says, 'we need to do the next in the series.' I think so too, although given the absurdity of the series, Eddie Russet may find himself bogged down in the rhododendron issue.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.32pm BST13:32'Plotting, hah! I make it up as I go along.'Michealmack says:My question is a mundane grey one, possibly one that authors dread and probably already has been asked by someone else but can you tell us how on earth you plot your books and keep your bearings/marbles?! I am also a fan of toast. Many thanks for hours of happy reading.  Guardian contributor ffordejasper 03 May 2016 1:29pmPlotting, hah! I make it up as I go along. If you're reading my books and have no idea of where it might end up, then you're in good company - neither do I.I tend to just start with one or two 'narrative dares' (Jane Eyre is kidnapped from Jane Eyre/Humpty Dumpty is murdered/why was the porridge at different temperatures when poured at the same time/invent a social order run entirely on visual colour) and then just riffing over what comes into my head. While writing The Eyre Affair I was reading a book on the Charge of the Light Brigade. 'Egad,' me thinks, 'I've got to get myself some of that!' But then I think: 'How is that possible? My book is set in 1985!' Then I think: 'Wait a moment, I'm the author - I can do what I want. What if the 1854 Crimean war is still on?' There is sometimes a little bit of narrative contortions, but that's essentially how I write.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.25pm BST13:25'Even readers who don't know Swindon understand what Swindon is all about.'Edgeley asks:What would you do to the real Swindon to make it less Swindonish?  Guardian contributor ffordejasper 03 May 2016 1:21pmAh, Swindon. Even readers who don't know Swindon understand what Swindon is all about, and when you ask an overseas reader to name their own country's Swindon, they instantly know somewhere. What's unfair is that Swindon is actually a very decent place. I lived near there for almost ten years and both my sons were born there. The choice to use Swindon was an obvious one. When writing I use 'Choose the less well trodden path' as a central tenent. Where do I set a book? Well trodden path: London, Edinburgh, Bristol. Less well trodden path: Swindon, Reading, Hereford.How do I treat that location:Well trodden path: As a cheap shot for a joke. Less well trodden path: A place that is a vibrant, exciting, and there's little that can't happen. Glassy towers, 50,000 seat croquet stadium, Travelhub - 'The Jewel on the M4'The less well trodden path works with characters, too - the obvious thing to do with Thursday's romantic life is to have a procession of unsuitable boyfriends move through her life. The less well trodden path is for her to be a one-guy-gal, and her husband a one-girl-guy.

Jack Sprat and Mary Mary have been gone far too long!  Guardian contributor ffordejasper 03 May 2016 1:10pmYes indeed. See elsewhere in the threads. I went off the boil as a lot of movies came out which retold nursery rhymes in amusing ways, but then I thought: 'Well heck, I did write this in 1992, so if not perhaps the first, one of them.' So I will. The Easter Bunny was introduced in The Fourth Bear and it seems like she and Jack have some history together that goes back a few years. She's a femme fatale gang boss who cleverly disguises her intentions by being very very cute on one day of the year. She's modelled on Jessica Rabbit and that rabbit with the west country accent who used to advertise Cadbury's Caramel bars. It'll be fun.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
