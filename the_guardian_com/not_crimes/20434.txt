It was also a hit at the weekend’s Critics’ Choice awards, where it took home nine trophies, including best director for Miller.Andrew Haigh’s acclaimed marital drama 45 Years was also one of the night’s success stories, with awards for stars Tom Courtenay and Charlotte Rampling, who won actor and actress of the year respectively. It was also named British/Irish film of the year.Courtenay beat Oscar favourite Leonardo DiCaprio for the prize, but his Titanic co-star Kate Winslet, who was named best supporting actress on Sunday night for her role as Joanna Hoffman in Steve Jobs, believes he will be a big winner at the Academy Awards on 28 February.“I think you can sort of feel it and I think everyone wants it for him,” Winslet said. “It would be amazing. It’s difficult for me too, because Michael Fassbender is also nominated and I was his right-hand woman for three months making Steve Jobs. I saw how hard he worked and I thought his performance was extraordinary. But you can feel the temperature and it’s probably going to be Leo’s year.”Oscars 2016: The Revenant deserves to own awards season – less so Mad Max and The Martian | Peter Bradshaw Other winners on the night included Mark Rylance for best supporting actor on Bridge of Spies, Asif Kapadia’s Amy for best documentary and The Look of Silence, which won the prize for best foreign-language film.The full list of winners:Film of the year: Mad Max: Fury RoadBritish/Irish film of the year: 45 YearsForeign-language film of the year: The Look of SilenceDocumentary of the year: AmyActor of the year: Tom Courtenay – 45 YearsActress of the year: Charlotte Rampling – 45 YearsSupporting actor of the year: Mark Rylance – Bridge of SpiesSupporting actress of the year: Kate Winslet – Steve JobsDirector of the year: George Miller – Mad Max: Fury RoadScreenwriter of the year: Josh Singer and Tom McCarthy – SpotlightBritish/Irish actor of the year: Tom Hardy – Legend, London Road, Mad Max: Fury Road, The RevenantBritish/Irish actress of the year: Saoirse Ronan – Brooklyn, Lost RiverYoung British/Irish performer of the year: Maisie Williams – The FallingPhilip French award for breakthrough British/Irish film-maker: John Maclean – Slow WestBritish/Irish short film of the year: Stutterer – Benjamin ClearyTechnical achievement award: Ed Lachman, cinematography – CarolDilys Powell award for excellence in film: Kenneth Branagh
