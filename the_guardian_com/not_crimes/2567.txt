Tesco has admitted to finding horsemeat in its own-brand value meatloaf, making it the fourth product the company has sold that contains horse DNA.The 600g Simply Roast meatloaf, supplied by the British manufacturer Eurostock, has now been removed from shelves after tests found it contained up to 5% horsemeat.It joins a list, which includes Tesco's own-brand hamburgers, bolognese and lasagne, found to contain up to 100% horse.Tim Smith, Tesco's technical director, said: "Tests on 15 other lines from the same manufacturing site were clear of horsemeat."Our investigation to thoroughly understand the source of the contamination has started and we will complete our investigation before deciding whether to continue using the supplier."The meatloaf was manufactured in Eurostock's Craigavon factory in Northern Ireland between last October and January this year.Last week Tesco vowed to improve its supply chain following the scandal as bosses try to repair any damage to its reputation. Further revelations are expected in the next few weeks as the Food Standards Agency said last Friday that seven recent samples, representing six products, came back positive for more than 1% horse DNA.Asda was forced to withdraw its spaghetti, meatballs and beef cannelloni at the weekend after they tested positive for pig DNA.
