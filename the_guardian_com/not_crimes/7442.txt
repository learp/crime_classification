I suppose I should thank Martin Harper for pointing out that the RSPB has been neutral on the ethics of shooting “for well over 100 years” (“RSPB backs pheasant shoots and says they’re good for countryside”, News). I did not know this and I feel both naive and misled that a senior representative of the organisation I have supported for over 30 years should offer even qualified support for pheasant shoots.I simply do not and will not accept that a well-organised pheasant shoot is an ethically acceptable method for managing hedgerows and woodland. Can we not find efficient and effective ways to manage our land without offering support and validation to an industry that exists to satisfy an unnecessary and uncivilised blood lust? It is laughable to refer to sport and conservation when discussing the shooting of birds for “pleasure”.As naive as I feel, I do not feel as naive as Martin Harper, who has handed invaluable ammunition to the already powerful and influential hunting and shooting lobby. Harper’s words will now be used to further the interests of those who seek to kill wild and farm-reared birds and animals for (and let’s be honest about this) nothing other than bloodthirsty pleasure and money. Whatever happened to “for birds, for people, for ever”? The fact that to the RSPB some birds seem less important than others is why I will be cancelling my membership straight after sending this email.Robert SchofieldDorsetPinning the blame on just gamekeepers is not the answer; we are all at fault for the decline in some bird and animal numbers.Farming practices have intensified as the demand for perfect produce escalates; hedges have been systematically dug up; ponds filled in to make larger, more manageable fields – fields that are basically a mono habitat; roads and houses are being built.We force wildlife into smaller and smaller areas; hedges are cut back in the autumn, stripping them of valuable food and much needed winter cover; pesticides surely must be having a huge effect and not just on the wildlife; cars and other vehicles must account for untold casualties as roads become more and more congested; that’s not even counting the amount of insects, especially bees, that must get splattered on our windscreens in the summer. All this must be having a negative effect on wildlife numbers, but we still choose to blame anyone other than ourselves.Yes, some keepers have been responsible for the decline of some species, but to blame them all would be like saying that every football supporter is a thug looking for a fight. There are many keepers, farmers and land owners who are seriously into wildlife conservation, and their combined knowledge of the countryside could be invaluable to help save all our native species, so instead of alienating them, we need to get them on board and work together for a better future for all.David Harperposted onlineThe politics of shooting are complex and prone to ideological distortion by all sides. Thus, on first reading, the recent contribution to evidence-based dialogue by the RSPB is to be welcomed. Regrettably, the society now appears to have got itself into a Janus-like position: it pledges “to discourage the wanton destruction of birds” and to be “all about the conservation of [native] species”. Furthermore, the society claims not to “have a mandate for the conservation of non-native species”.With these statements in mind, the society perhaps needs to give more thought to its position regarding the swamping of our native grey partridge by the red leg partridge (introduced explicitly for shooting). A more egregious case is the virtual elimination of the hen harrier from driven grouse moors in my part of the country.Talking with the shooting lobby is good, but does it listen and is there any action thereafter, particularly with respect to our birds of prey?Gus PenningtonStokesleyNorth Yorkshire
