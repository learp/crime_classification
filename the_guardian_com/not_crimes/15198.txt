This story is one of three stories, which were all in one book. This book is about a boy, called Robinson Crusoe, who was born in York in 1632. One day, at Hull, Crusoe saw one of his companions board a ship bound for London. Robinson Crusoe did the same as his companion and boarded the ship. At sea, the waves were so high they made him feel sick inside! One of the men on board said they had a leak! As the ship sank, they managed to ride ashore where people were trying to aid them.After that, he carried on sailing for eight more years. On one expedition, their ship ran aground on a sand bank. Then a wave came and killed everyone except Crusoe. He managed to survive for many years. He also found some natives and made one of them his slave. With his slave Crusoe makes a boat. Then some Spaniards come and start shooting the natives. The next morning an English ship arrives in the bay. Crusoe rows his boat to the ship, but will he get rescued?!!!!!!I enjoyed this book because you didn’t know what was going to happen. The way the words are put into the story gives it a more thrilling feel, but the words used also made the story slow because parts were in old english. The author, Daniel Defoe, is very descriptive, for example: ‘By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed’. Some of the characters are believable as the illustrations bring them to life, but they probably wouldn’t exist today due to the setting of this book in the sixteenth century. They certainly don’t remind me of anyone I know today. I would recommend the book for 9 year-olds upwards.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
