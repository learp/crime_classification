Thurston Moore and Bernie Sanders have collaborated on a new track called Feel It in Your Guts. The track, which will be released by Joyful Noise Recordings, has been described by the label as “a 12-string acoustic composition mixed in with snippets of Sanders’ speeches”.The single will be realised as a limited edition run of 1,000 hand-numbered white flexi-disc vinyl records as well as a digital download. The single will be available for free to anyone who makes a direct contribution to the Sanders campaign, with the label suggesting fans donate $27 (£19). The speech snippets are reported to touch on topics such as economic inequality, social justice and human rights. In a statement, Joyful Noise said: “We at the label were inspired to support the Sanders campaign, and we thought it would be best to use our curatorial talents to this end. Being a weird-o indie rock record label, we are fortunate to work with a variety of incredible musicians; including, on occasion, the great Thurston Moore. So we decided to ask him. And we were delighted that in a matter of minutes after posing the idea, Thurston excitedly agreed.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Indie-rock’s newest darling, Bernie Sanders, speaking during a campaign rally on June 1.

Fortunately, one of our employees was already friends with the good folks of the Bernie campaign, so we reached out. Amazingly, the Bernie campaign responded, and within a week or so, we heard that Bernie himself was into the idea. The amazing folks at the Bernie campaign have worked closely with us to make this crazy collaboration a reality.”Elsewhere, dance acts Bassnectar, Z-Trip, Cobra Starship and others have come together to contribute music to a new #RaveForBernie compilation.
