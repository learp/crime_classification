Mackerel is transformed by this curing technique – a method the Portuguese used to transport fish during long travels – and by serving with cherries marinated in soy and sherry vinegar. It’s so simple but also so delicious.(serves 4)1 whole fresh mackerel, gutted, filleted and pin-boned 60g caster sugar20g fine sea salt250g fresh cherries, stoned and halved2 tbsp sherry vinegar1 tbsp soy sauce1 tbsp grapeseed oil 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oilBunch of sorrel (wild, if possible)In a bowl, mix the salt and sugar and spread half of the mix in a small, shallow tray. Place the mackerel fillets on the tray skinside down and cover the flesh side with the rest of mix. Let it sit at room temperature for 45 minutes to cure, then remove the fillets, wash them under cold running water and pat them dry.Trim the fish, separate each fillet into two long pieces and refrigerate.Toss the cherries with the vinegar and soy sauce and set aside, so the fruit juices are released into the marinade.After at least 20 minutes, brush the fillets with the grapeseed oil, and grill in a hot pan skinside up for 30 seconds.Remove and transfer to a serving plate with the cherries and juices. Spoon a generous amount of the olive oil and scatter with the sorrel as you serve.
