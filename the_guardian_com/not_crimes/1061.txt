This spring was a record breaker for wildlife, with the warm weather leading to trees leafing and flowering and birds and insects appearing unusually early, data has shown.The latest results from Nature's Calendar, run by the Woodland Trust, in which members of the public record the timing of natural events, suggest spring was the earliest this century.A host of events occurred much earlier than normal, with holly blue butterflies emerging 26 days early, compared to data from 2001 when the weather was closest to the long-term average, and ash and beech trees leafing two and a half weeks early.The orange tip butterfly emerged at the earliest date it has done in records going back a century, while horse chestnuts, purple lilac and dog rose were all seen flowering earlier than ever.Migrant turtle doves, swallows and willow warblers all returned at the earliest date recorded since 2000.Sian Atkinson, conservation adviser for the Woodland Trust, said that the season was the "earliest of the early" in the context of a series of springs which have seen natural events shift forward in the year over the past decade or so.She said the early spring was down to high temperatures."We had such a lovely spell at Easter - it was really warm like summer holiday weather at Easter - and even before that it was fairly mild earlier in the spring."The warm spring weather has brought everything on."According to the Woodland Trust, the UK had an average temperature of 9.1C during March, April and May, some 1.8C above the 1971-2000 average, with a record-breaking warm and sunny April.Prof Tim Sparks, founder of Nature's Calendar, said: "We had a cold winter but this was followed by a particularly warm and dry spring, which included the warmest April on record."This warmth is undoubtedly the main factor which led to many events occurring earlier than usual."He added: "It will be interesting to see what impact the early leafing and dry summer had on autumnal events, which is why we need the public to continue to send us their recordings in the coming months."
