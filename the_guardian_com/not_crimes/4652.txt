Leave campaigners have pulled the plug on a Brexit pop festival that struggled to secure performers. Bpoplive has been “shut down” by the “spiteful” Electoral Commission, the Leave.EU campaign has claimed.A number of artists due to appear at the event dropped out after discovering it was being staged to cheer on the campaign for Britain to sever ties with Europe. Tickets for the Last Night of the Brexit Proms concert in Birmingham had been reduced from £23 to £5.Leave.Eu’s Andy Wigmore, a coordinator of the event, said: “This promised to be a truly unique event, with a live orchestra, a little tongue-in-cheek entertainment and speeches from Nigel Farage and other leading lights of the Leave campaign.“It was intended as a huge and well-deserved thank you to all of our supporters; a celebration of their extraordinary efforts in this referendum.Leave Aid: Grassroots Out’s anti-EU festival is the hottest music event of the year “But the Electoral Commission, which has been pursuing a spiteful vendetta against us since we reported their crooked activities during the Leave campaign designation process to the Treasury select committee, has decided to shut us down.“After insisting we tick all sorts of superfluous boxes and fill in various time-wasting forms in triplicate,” said Wigmore, the elections watchdog had issued a “final demand for more information”.He said: “Despite our best efforts, the constant pressure and repeated threats have finally killed off what should have been a great event for our dedicated and hard-working supporters.”Sister Sledge, East 17, the 90s boy band 5ive, the Britain’s Got Talent judge Alesha Dixon and the drum’n’bass act Sigma were among the acts who had already pulled out of the festival.The Elvis impersonator Gordon Hendricks and Cheryl Baker, Jay Aston and Mike Nolan, who made up three quarters of Bucks Fizz but can no longer use the name, were set to play the gig at the 15,000-seat Genting Arena in Birmingham.Leave.EU’s campaign chief, Arron Banks, said 8,000 ticket holders would be offered a refund or allowed to attend the postponed concert in September, which will be staged in aid of his Love Saves the Day foundation. Banks made various allegations about the Electoral Commission, including a claim that it had a “long record of general incompetence”.Banks said: “After June 23rd we will be taking aggressive action to ensure the wider public comes to share that opinion. They are not fit for purpose, utterly incompetent and have overseen the transformation of the Britain’s electoral process into a circus worthy of a corrupt banana republic.”Robert Oxley, the head of media for the official Brexit campaign Vote Leave, said: “Bpoplive has been cancelled. The ticket holder will be gutted. We wish them well.”
