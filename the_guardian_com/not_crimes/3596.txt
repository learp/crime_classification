Once upon a time, going out in your nightie was a sign that something was wrong. But one of fashion’s jobs is to turn a quirk that used to prompt a #uokhun text into the trait of a high-functioning alpha woman with Instagram followers in their millions.

If, once, pyjamas were strictly for a) bed, b) the outside of a fashion show or c) the school gates, now you’re no longer laughing stock if you wear them beyond those niche occasions. Time for fashion to move on, then. Kim Kardashian, Amal Clooney and Mariah Carey have rummaged through their drawers and been spotted in their nighties. Or, not really – at least not the ones we’re used to. Instead of bobbly oversized T-shirts emblazoned with the words “pillow fight”, these are the lacy, satin, clingy – and sexy – nighties that are more at home in the wardrobe of a 1930s starlet. If simple slip dresses are the entry level to bedroom dressing, these are the upgrade.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Victoria Beckham at Wimbledon in 2013, wearing nightie chic.

She wore a short, black lacy nightie (yours for $60 or £45) with a Pablo jacket from her husband Kanye West’s merch stall this weekend, while Clooney wore a Dolce & Gabbana satin ’n’ lace dress (very Carole Lombard) to get the river taxi home. (That’s what you do when you live on Lake Como, OK?) Carey wore her ivory one with an equally super-rich backdrop, on board a yacht in an Italian bay. Other notable nightie wearers include Victoria Beckham at Wimbledon in 2013 and Kardashian, again, at the Givenchy show last September.

They’re far more interested in the rebellion associated with wearing something more conventionally seen as a behind-closed-doors kind of thing – a rebel yell that dates back, of course, to the 90s and Courtney Love’s Kinderwhore.

Givenchy was a lace-fest – but the nightie dresses looked best when mixed with gelled back hair and fierce shoes, with wonky hems or a square-cut tailored jacket. Or there’s Céline – better known for really nice jumpers than come-hither sexy dresses. Nightie dresses here were worn with flat boots and severe, Sade-influenced slicked hair.

Alexa Chung, a fashion pro in the process of setting up her own brand, showed her credentials this April. Wearing a bright-pink slipdress, she teamed her nightwear not with marabou slippers but with Converse. One glance at this picture makes wearing your nightie out of the house suddenly seem like a very good idea indeed.
