Amy Schumer has reportedly cut a scene from her new film in the wake of the Orlando terror attack.The Trainwreck star is currently filming an untitled action comedy with Goldie Hawn and has decided to remove a sequence involving a character shooting a gun at people, according to E! News. The film, directed by 50/50’s Jonathan Levine, centres on a mother and daughter who encounter trouble while on holiday in Hawaii.Schumer has been a public advocate of gun control, working with her cousin, senator Chuck Schumer, to call for higher restrictions on sales. She also introduced the hashtag #aimingforchange to highlight loopholes in legislation that can allow violent criminals and people with severe mental illness to buy guns. Last summer, two people were shot dead during a screening of her film Trainwreck.“When I heard about this news, I was completely devastated … then I was angry,” Schumer said last year. “My heart goes out to [the victims] Jillian and Mayci, to the survivors, to the families and everyone who is tied to the tragic, senseless and horrifying actions of this man who shouldn’t have been able to put his hands on a gun in the first place.”After the mass shooting at an Orlando gay club on Sunday, Schumer tweeted that she found the news “sickening” and has since shared a number of tweets reinforcing her position on gun control.
