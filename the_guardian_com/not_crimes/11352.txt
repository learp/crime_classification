Unbecoming is a book that is totally unique to YA. There were so many different elements of the book that would appeal to all generations, as the book focusses on a daughter and a mother, Katie and Caroline. But there is also a focus on Katie’s grandmother, Mary, as she battles with dementia.Katie kissed her best friend (Esme), so becomes very worried that the whole school will find out about her sexuality, and that her strict mother will also find out. Caroline is also fighting her own troubles, as her husband left her for a younger woman, and Katie’s brother (Chris) is taking it hard. She is trying to hold all of the family together and not let it shatter into pieces.  Photograph: PRFamily was at the forefront of the novel, which is quite unusual in YA, so that was very refreshing to see, especially as nothing was sugar coated, allowing anyone of any age to relate to the novel in some aspects. Daughters, mums and grandmothers could all read this novel, it isn’t strictly tailored to a young adult audience. The whole plot was very enlightening, as it allows teenage readers especially to see what it was like growing up at different times: they could see what other people their age might go through, and possibly empathise with them in some way. Downham is definitely a writer who shows what real life is like: her characters are flawed, which everyone is, and it makes her plot more realistic, forcing readers to grip on and not let go until the end.Unbecoming is a perfect coming of age novel, which captures the essence of all of the difficulties that you may encounter whatever age you are. It covered a variety of issues: I loved the fact that they covered dementia, which I haven’t read before in YA. A 4/5 for me: as it took me a while to get into. but once you do, you will become so attached to everything in this novel, instantly.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
