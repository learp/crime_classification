A survey of 2,000 people has shown that most of them think jeans should not be worn by anyone over the age of 53. Jeans, the survey concludes, are a younger person’s game and don’t look suitable on the older man or woman.I can’t – as someone over the age of 53 – help but agree. The main reason is that, as we age, the skin on our faces and hands start to sag and get wrinkly. Our bodies lose their shape. Jeans, too, often after only a few months, tend to get saggy, wrinkly and faded, and can lose their shape very quickly – and do we really want, as we age, to wear clothes that reflect the general decrepitude of our bodies? We may be collapsing physically, but surely most of us would want to look as if our standards, at least, remain intact?The older we get, the more important it is, if we want to look good, to wear clothes that are crisp and fresh. An egg-stain on a 20-year-old’s shirt looks casually messy but not disgusting. On an elderly person, the same egg stain can looks like a glaring pointer to general decomposition. So it’s important that, for jeans to be successful on an older person, they can only be worn if they are brand new, unfaded, crisp and spotless – in other words, for the first five minutes after purchase. (People such as Gardeners’ World host Carol Klein, now in her early 70s, can get away with it because she is a gardener; jeans are suitable at any age if they are worn by cowboys or purely for physical work.)For some, one of the joys of getting older is the ability to let themselves go: nothing matters any more, hair can go grey, tummies can go to pot, they are just glad to be out of the lookist rat-race. But not all of us feel the inner self-confidence to go down that route. And as one whose self-esteem is still on the lower half of the scale, I would be wary of jeans.And, to be honest, I’ve always been wary of them. I’ve only possessed one pair of jeans in my life.
