I’m a bit sick of people droning on about how governments and elites have failed to grasp the reasons for popular discontent. I suspect that they’ve known the reasons all along. They knew the discontent was coming, but they didn’t care – because they planned it.Who but the elites decided that robots should take over human jobs wherever possible? They must have known that it would be like a gargantuan game of musical chairs: keep taking away the chairs and the people end up on the floor. And God forbid that a foreigner should end up with the last chair – the people would be outraged.But that’s all part of the plan: provide a poor education for the people so that they can’t think very well for themselves, don’t build enough houses, then tell the indigenous residents that foreigners are to blame for stealing their work and homes, are terrorists, or health tourists, or lazy and peculiar, and they’ll believe you, even if you tell them huge porkies, because they’re exhausted, frazzled and need someone to blame – and you, as rulers, are meant to know what you’re talking about.And, by the time the truth comes out, limping along behind, the lies will have done their work and it will be win-win for you lot in charge, because now that you’ve got so many people hating foreigners, you can more easily turn away refugees who try to escape from appalling wars (which you probably helped to cause) because you’ve now got fear and xenophobia well established. Then you can say: “The public want their country back,” as if it’s everyone else’s fault and you can only do what your constituents ask you to do.Best of all for you elites, the people will be so befuddled by lies and so busy squabbling among themselves that they won’t even mind if you rule them from a castle, ivory tower or golden baroque-rococo palace. But I hope, with all my heart, that very soon your cover will be blown and we will have happier years in the future.
