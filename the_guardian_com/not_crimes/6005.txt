Mel Gibson’s Hacksaw Ridge has already taken out four categories of Australia’s largest screen awards, the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (Aacta) awards.An “industry luncheon” was held on Monday ahead of the main ceremony on Wednesday, which will be broadcast on Channel Seven.More than 30 category winners were announced at Sydney’s Star Casino on Monday. The luncheon focuses largely on behind-the-scenes craft including cinematography, sound, production design and editing, saving the top prizes and celebrity power for the Wednesday night event.Gibson’s much anticipated return to directing, Hacksaw Ridge, is an Australian/US co-production that tells the true story of second world war pacifist combat medic, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield). The most nominated film at the Aactas, it’s up for 13 awards in total. Seven of Hacksaw Ridge’s categories will be announced on Wednesday, including best film, best director, best lead actor, and best lead actress.On Monday, it took home best editing, best production design, best cinematography and best sound.

He needs to be with the actors.”“Even on set we were hearing these stories of how he would run into battle and show the actors how he wanted them to perform. So when we were in the ADR [automated dialogue replacement] studio, he would be right there with the actor, and go through with them how he wanted them to perform.” In some cases, Gibson would even perform the lines himself first.'So complex, so real': why Rake is one of the best shows on Australian TV Also winning in multiple categories was ABC series Rake, which stars Richard Roxburgh and won best sound and best direction in television. Rake is nominated in seven categories, three more of which will be announced on Wednesday. “Rake is a project of great passion, certainly for Richard [Roxburgh] and myself,” said director Peter Duncan, who confirmed they had plans a fifth season. “One of the guiding lights of the show has been saying, ‘This will be the last season’ every year – because we’re kind of reverse-engineering it, tricking the show into continuing.”Anna Broinowski – who won best documentary director for Pauline Hanson: Please Explain! – collected her award from the president of Aacta, Geoffrey Rush.She told media afterwards that the success of the documentary – which tracks the second coming of the One Nation leader – came down to lucky timing, and the participation of big names including John Howard, Alan Jones, Linda Burney, David Oldfield and Hanson herself.

No one knew that she was going to get in, she was under the radar … it was like what was happening with Trump. Hanson got in because she was a TV celebrity. Everyone was watching her on TV – but not the tastemakers, the opinion makers, the media.” Broinowski said that while she did not expect to become best friends with Hanson, the politician was likeable in person – and agreed to go for a drink with the director after watching the show. (“If that happens, you know you’ve behaved ethically,” Broinowski said.)Pauline Hanson: Please Explain! – a hard-hitting exposé of history repeated “She’s present. She’s self-deprecating. She cooks a great Thai chicken curry. She mixes a fantastic drink called the ginger bitch, which is her favourite cocktail – rum and ginger beer. She’s a great host,” she said.“I did develop a desire to look after her, because she’s trusting you with her stuff. But when you talk politics, something different comes out. And no. There was no chance Pauline Hanson and I were going to become best buddies.” This was the inaugural year for a hair and makeup category, which was won by ABC series Cleverman – a new superhero fantasy series based on Indigenous Dreamtime stories, with an 80% Indigenous cast.

Speaking after accepting the award, senior makeup artist Troy Follington explained that his biggest challenge was styling the women.“Put too much hair on a girl and it’s not good,” he said. “And girls don’t like that whole thing too much. So that was one of our biggest challenges – to make the girls hairy people but still looking feminine and gorgeous, and like, you’d like to go there.”We need more Aboriginal superheroes, so I created Cleverman for my son A season six episode of Game of Thrones, Battle of the Bastards, won two Australians – Glenn Melenhorst and Ineke Majoor – an award for best visual effects. The battle itself involved hundreds of digital horses, and “thousands upon thousands” of digital extras. Melenhorst said it was “the hardest, most difficult work we’ve ever done”.The second challenge: keeping the plot secret. “When they gave us the first information on the series, we saw Jon Snow in it, and we knew he was alive – we were among the only people in the world who knew that, for about a year. I’ve never held onto a secret so tightly,” Melenhorst said.

AllHitting Home – Sarah Ferguson’s ABC documentary series on domestic violence in Australia – won the documentary award at the annual Walkley journalism awards on Friday. It also took the Aacta for best documentary TV program. ABC's Sarah Ferguson on Hitting Home: 'All domestic violence begins with control' Producer Ivan O’Mahoney said the series was hugely complex, revolving around a variety of legal, journalistic, psychological, political and safety issues. “We spent about a year drafting a duty of care statement – not just our promise to those who agreed to participate, but also as a note to ourselves as to how to behave; the dos and don’ts when you’re operating in this field,” he said. “You owe a duty of care to all your subjects when you’re making a documentary, but especially when they’re as vulnerable as the women who decided to speak out in our series.”Other notable prizes included best supporting actor in a televised drama, for Damon Herriman of Secret City; best performance in a TV comedy, for Patrick Brammall of No Activity; and best supporting actress in a televised drama, for Celia Pacquola of The Beautiful Lie – an ABC miniseries reimagining Anna Karenina, starring Sarah Snook.Best known for her comedy career, Pacquola said she was “still surprised” that she got the part of Dolly Faraday.

I’ve always wanted to try a drama, but not at all did I think I’d get a chance.”“It really gave me an opportunity to see what my life would be like if I hadn’t pursued comedy. I would have been in a very unhappy marriage,” she joked. Now in their sixth year, the Aacta awards grew out of the Australian Film Industry (AFI) awards, which widened to encompass TV categories in 1986. The luncheon hosts, comedians Kitty Flanagan and Tom Gleeson, cheekily shrugged off the Monday event as the “B awards” in their opening remarks: “We’re off air, it really doesn’t matter,” Flanagan laughed.The major ceremony will be broadcast at 8.30pm on Wednesday.Aacta luncheon – full winners listBest editing in a documentaryWinner: In the Shadow of the Hill – Steven Robinson, Dan JacksonHitting HomeRemembering the ManSnow MonkeyBest editing in televisionWinner: Wentworth (episode three) – Ben Joss, Foxtel/SoHo Janet KingRakeThe Beautiful LieBest editingWinner: Hacksaw Ridge – John Gilbert Girl AsleepGoldstoneThe DaughterBest original music score in a documentaryWinner: Monsieur Mayonnaise – Cezary SkubiszewskiIn the Shadow of the HillMichelle’s StoryThe Diplomat, the Artist and the SuitBest original music score in televisionWinner: The Kettering Incident (episode one) – Matteo Zingales, Max Lyandvert, Foxtel/ShowcaseThe DivorceDeep WaterThe DeepBest original music scoreWinner: Tanna – Antony PartosGods Of EgyptBoys in the TreesTeenage KicksBest production design in televisionWinner: Mary: The Making of a Princess – Sam Rickard, Channel TenA Place To Call HomeMollyThe Beautiful LieBest production designWinner: Hacksaw Ridge – Barry RobisonGirl AsleepGoldstoneThe DaughterBest visual effects or animationWinner: Game of Thrones, Battle of the Bastards – Glenn Melenhorst, Ineke Majoor, Foxtel/ShowcaseGame Of Thrones, Sept Wildfire DestructionGods Of EgyptX-Men: Apocalypse, Quicksilver ExtractionBest costume design in televisionWinner: Molly, part one – Edie Kurzer, Channel SevenA Place To Call HomeMary: The Making of a PrincessThe Beautiful LieBest costume designWinner: Girl Asleep – Jonathon OxladeGods Of EgyptHacksaw RidgeSpearBest hair and makeupWinner: Cleverman – Kath Brown, Simon Joseph, Troy FollingtonA Place To Call HomeHacksaw RidgeGods Of EgyptBest short animationWinner: Oscar Wilde’s The Nightingale and the Rose – Angie Fielder, Brendan Fletcher and Del Kathryn BartonFemme EnfantThe AlbatrossThe CrossingBest short fiction filmWinner: Dream Baby – Lucy Gaffy, Kiki DillonHomebodiesNathan Loves Ricky MartinBlueyBest documentary television programWinner: Hitting Home – Nial Fulton, Sarah Ferguson, Ivan O’Mahoney#BlackLivesMatterChanging Minds: The Inside StoryMatilda and MeBest children’s television seriesWinner: Beat Bugs – Josh Wakely, Jennifer Twiner McCarron, 7TwoBottersnikes & GumblesPlay SchoolThe DeepBest adapted screenplayWinner: The Daughter – Simon StoneGirl AsleepBest cinematography in a documentaryWinner: In the Shadow of the Hill – Dan JacksonAnother CountryChanging Minds: The Inside StoryDNA NationBest cinematography in televisionWinner: Wolf Creek, episode three – Geoffrey Hall, StanThe Beautiful LieThe Kettering IncidentA Place To Call HomeBest cinematographyWinner: Hacksaw Ridge – Simon DugganTannaGirl AsleepSpearBest sound in a documentaryWinner: Highly Strung – James CurryAnother CountryChasing AsylumIn the Shadow of the HillBest sound in televisionWinner: Rake – Guntis Sics, Michol Marsh, Peter Hall, Olivia Monteith, ABCDeep WaterRocKwizThe Beautiful LieBest sound in a feature filmWinner: Hacksaw Ridge – Andrew Wright, Robert Mackenzie, Kevin O’Connell, Mario Vaccaro, Tara Webb, Peter Grace Gods Of EgyptTannaThe DaughterBest performance in a television comedyWinner: No Activity – Patrick BrammallABC Comedy ShowroomThe Family LawBlack ComedyBest direction in a documentaryWinner: Hanson: Please Explain – Anna Broinowski, SBSChanging Minds: The Inside StoryChasing AsylumPutuparri and the RainmakersBest direction in a television drama or comedyWinner: Rake, episode eight – Peter Duncan, ABCWentworthThe CodeThe Kettering IncidentBest direction in a television light entertainment or reality seriesWinner: The Recruit, episode two – Michael VenablesLuke Warm SexMasterChef AustraliaMeet the MavericksBest live event production (subscription TV)Winner: 2015/16 Hyundai A-League Adelaide United v Western Sydney WanderersSky News 2016 election coverage6th Annual CMC music awardsThe Helpmann Awards 2015Best female presenter (subscription TV)Winner: Maggie Beer, Great Australian Bake OffDonna Hay, Basics to BrillianceShaynna Blaze, Selling Houses AustraliaMargaret Pomeranz, Stage & ScreenBest male presenter (subscription TV)Winner: Stan Grant (Crimes That Shook Australia)Morgan Evans (6th Annual CMC music awards)Charlie Albone (Charlie’s Chelsea Garden 2015)David Speers (PM Agenda & Speers Tonight)Best new talent (subscription TV)Winner: James Rochford (Not the NRL News)Zac & Jordan Stenmark (Australian’s Next Top Model)Matilda Brown (Let’s Talk About)George H.
