She told the Dame Dash Radio Show: “We actually are in development with a hologram, but I don’t necessarily know to what extent I’m gonna perform with it. But I want to debut it in the first video for the album, and maybe use it a little bit performing live.”The singer, who featured on I’ll Be Missing You by Puff Daddy – a tribute to her husband that topped the charts shortly after his death in 1997 – is currently working on The King and I, a posthumous duets album with the rapper. She said: “Today, if he was alive, I know, ultimately, we would’ve done something like this. But the way the stuff has come together, and the way I’m using his vocals, it’s giving the stuff new life, it’s totally different.”This development would make Biggie the latest in a line of holographic musical performers that includes Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and Biggie’s west-coast rival Tupac Shakur. A spokeperson for the company Hologram USA, which produced the Tupac and Whitney holograms, told Entertainment Weekly that it was currently unable to announce any plans, but confirmed that they had been in talks with the rapper’s estate.
