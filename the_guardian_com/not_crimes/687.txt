 Jonathan Pie, the fictional television reporter who is regularly pushed to the edge of sanity and beyond by British politics, has now made a political stand of his own in preparation for his first national tour and an appearance on the Edinburgh festival fringe.Pie, the foul-mouthed creation of actor Tom Walker, has become an internet sensation since the success of his short comic films in which his television journalist melts down on screen once he is “off air”. Pie rails against hypocrisy in politics and in television newsrooms and is disillusioned with both his job and the ethics of Westminster.But Walker told the Observer he is to cut ties with his controversial television network, RT, formerly Russia Today. The news channel is owned by the Russian state and is often criticised for operating as a propaganda tool for Vladimir Putin. Walker said that, while he was grateful for the platform RT had given Jonathan Pie, he was now ready to move on.“When I started out I had various offers and, funnily enough, RT were the ones that offered me total artistic control, which I really wanted,” Walker said. “I was perhaps a little naive, as I did not know about RT before, but it was important to me that I would not be controlled, although I had more lucrative offers.”Walker argues that other outspoken comic acts have appeared on television channels that are identified with political views they do not agree with: Steve Coogan works with Sky despite its association with Rupert Murdoch, one of the targets of the actor’s Hacked Off media campaigning; and in America Seth MacFarlane, creator and voice of cartoons Family Guy and American Dad, is broadcast by the right-leaning Fox TV.“This is no problem for them, because they are left alone creatively,” explained Walker. “The difficulty for me is that my character is a journalist, so people ask me about it, even though I don’t see it that way. So it has got to the point that what I hate to call the ‘Pie brand’ can’t move on while I am associated with RT, although it has helped me. The main issue for me was that I could not answer people’s questions about it while I was still on RT. So I resigned. Now I can defend it without being accused of being contractually obliged to be nice.”Walker, 38, who grew up in Taunton, Somerset, has been taken aback by the fast-growing fan base for his frustrated media creation, Pie. Arriving at the Latitude festival in Suffolk, he was surprised by the size of the crowd gathered to watch the first preview of his Edinburgh show. “I was expecting a smaller gig, but the literature tent turns out to house an audience of 800. It was a real baptism of fire rather than a tryout. I have tried my act out live before, to see how it translated on to the stage, but this is my Edinburgh show, which is selling brilliantly, I am pleased to say.”When he wears Pie’s customary suit and tie, he is often recognised: “People call out to me all the time and some think I am really a journalist. But no reporter loses it every week.”The connection with RT is not the only thing Walker has ditched this month. Several scripts have been sacrificed as the rapid pace of change at Westminster has made political satire a breathless game of catch-up. “In the runup to the referendum, I joked that I would have to change my whole Edinburgh show if we voted out. Then on the night, watching the numbers roll in on television around 2.30am, I started to think it didn’t look right,” said Walker, who trained as an actor at Manchester Metropolitan University.“I had to tear up about a third of the show then and there. The story – because the show is a play rather than a comedy set – revolved around Cameron and Osborne, and particularly Osborne, as the villain. I thought, ‘How can I make it dramatic now he has totally gone?’”After some quick rewrites, Walker worked out what Pie would think of Theresa May’s government.“My idea is that it will just be more of the same. It is the same manifesto, given May is not calling a general election. But there are a new set of people in charge and it takes time for those characters to embed. It is like a cast change.”Jonathan Pie: Live, Pleasance theatre, Edinburgh, 3-28 August
