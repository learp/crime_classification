What? The Garlic Twister (£10, NexTrend) is a multipurpose mincing tool, fitted with cross-cutting teeth. Grinds garlic and other foods to paste.Why? Nothing gets me down like washing up.Well?Which kitchen aid is the most ball-aching to clean? The sponge-shredding grater, perhaps? There is a sieve in my flat that invariably gets used as a colander, clogging the mesh in starchy nuisance, while dealing with a disarticulated food processor makes me yearn for the sweet release of death.But the award must go to the garlic press: a levered plate pushing a smelly ingredient stickily through a thousand pinholes. I hate cleaning the garlic press almost as much as I love cooking with garlic: a cruel ratio. I have resorted to sticking a wooden skewer through the holes. (I used to use a nailbrush, but went off the technique after accidentally flicking little plugs of wet garlic into my eyes and mouth. It’s not exactly tea at the Ritz.) A gizmo by the annoyingly named NexTrend promises to eliminate this and other problems. “Chopping garlic with a knife leaves fingers smelly, and is dangerous! The Garlic Twister is fast and fun,” a divorced-looking man assures me on its website. His thresholds for danger and fun are way too low, but I check one out. The enormous Perspex cogwheel opens to resemble a ring box with teeth. The row above interlocks with one below, and twisting the device swirls them through one another like propellers on a biplane. Any garlic inside gets smushed, hard.Kitchen gadgets review: the Garlic Zoom – a leprechaun’s Perspex stagecoach While the initial grind is fine, I keep mincing to achieve a finer paste – and the results stick entirely between the teeth. To get garlic into my wok I have to tediously scrape each plastic fang with a knife; but the stir-fry waits for no man. I also like a plump clove, and struggled to squash an organic fatty one into the chamber. A shame, -because the device excels in other areas. Its paperweight heft is good for crushing cloves and, washing-up-wise, it’s unbeatable – a quick burst from the tap rinsing the chamber clean. But the Garlic Twister only moves the -intractable problem of the garlic press back a stage. It’s striking and innovative. The twist is, it doesn’t work.Any downsideThe design seems so closely modelled on a hash grinder that I got paranoid just peeling the garlic skins.Counter, drawer, back of the cupboard?Drawer. Does make handling garlic a bit less sticky-icky. 3/5
