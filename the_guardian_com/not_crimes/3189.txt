Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich has been longlisted for the UK’s most prestigious award for nonfiction writing for her collage of voices from the collapsing USSR, Second-Hand Time.Svetlana Alexievich: ‘Ten to 15 of my childhood friends from Minsk died of cancer. Chernobyl kills’ Alexievich won the Nobel prize for literature in 2015 for her “polyphonic writings”, praised as a “monument to suffering and courage in our time” by the Swedish Academy. She is one of 10 writers, chosen from more than 180 submissions, to make the longlist for the £30,000 Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction.Formerly known as the Samuel Johnson prize, the award is open to books published in English by writers of any nationality, and has been won in the past by books covering a wide variety of subjects, from Helen Macdonald’s memoir about grief and falconry, H Is for Hawk, to Steve Silberman’s study of autism, Neurotribes.Published by small independent press Fitzcarraldo Editions, the Belarusian journalist’s Second-Hand Time collects Alexievich’s interviews conducted between 1991 and 2012, documenting the collapse of the USSR in what the Swedish Academy called “a new kind of literary genre”.“I don’t ask people about socialism, I ask about love, jealousy, childhood, old age. Music, dances, hairstyles. The myriad sundry details of a vanished way of life. This is the only way to chase the catastrophe into the framework of the mundane and attempt to tell a story. Try to figure things out,” Alexievich writes, in Bela Shayevich’s translation.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Charles Foster, author of Being a Beast.

I am not looking forward to having to choose between them,” said Flanders, who was joined on the judging panel by the writers Philip Ball and Sophie Ratcliffe, the Financial Times’s Jonathan Derbyshire and Rohan Silva, co-founder of the social enterprise Second Home. The panel will announce their shortlist on 17 October, with the winner unveiled on 15 November.
