Masterpiece of the week      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Titian’s The Aldobrandini Madonna, about 1532. Photograph: National GalleryTitian, The Aldobrandini Madonna, about 1532The incredible flare of setting a bright yellow dress against the Virgin Mary’s blue gown reveals Titian’s command of colour at its most sizzling in this warm, intimate study of devotion and motherhood. The woman in that lemon zinger of a dress is thought by art historians to be St Catherine, but that is not certain. In fact, she seems to be simply a Venetian woman posing for Titian, in a painting that breaks the barrier between religious art and real life, and shows why Titian is the most human of Renaissance artists. • National Gallery, London.
