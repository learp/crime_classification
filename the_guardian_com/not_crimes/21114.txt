Islamic State has used clips from Oliver Reed’s 1981 movie Lion of the Desert as part of a new video to threaten Europe.Lion of the Desert roars for Libya's rebels The film centres on Libyan hero Omar Mukhtar, played by Anthony Quinn, who helped fend off an Italian invasion in 1929 until he was captured and hanged two years later. Reed stars as General Rodolfo Graziani, who headed up the Italian troops. The film was directed by the Syrian-American producer of Halloween Moustapha Akkad.Scenes from the film have been used in a new video, part of a series to threaten countries in Europe. “The crusaders divided [the region] up, France took the largest part, then gave the rest to Italy and Spain,” the translated text reads. “Jihadi movements fought against the crusaders until martyrdom. The crusaders tried to divide us with democracy and personal freedom, however, the crusader strategy is not working because the Islamic State is here to stay.”Isis’s use of the film is aimed at Italy, threatening that the regime will spread across Europe until their “banner flutters” over Rome. “The leaders, they’ve achieved what they wanted, and what they demanded,” the text reads. “They didn’t break in the service of the crusaders. We must continue to fight the spread of ignorance.”Lion of the Desert was banned in Italy in 1982 because prime minister Giulio Andreotti claimed it was “damaging to the honour of the army”. It was eventually shown on TV in 2009. It was funded by Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who spent $35m on the film, yet it took just $1.5m at the box office.
