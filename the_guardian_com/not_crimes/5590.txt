I have a north-facing riverside terrace. In winter, it is cold, damp and prone to wind; in summer, the sun is strong and relentless for most of the day. I’d love some year-round green for my tubs and troughs. What can you suggest?Escallonia has suffered in the past from being seen as rather common, but it is made for your spot. It doesn’t mind wind, damp or the sun beating down, though like anything grown in a container it will need watering daily in summer. It grows into a large shrub several metres high, so plant it in large containers.Ask Alys Fowler: should I make space for my strawberry tree? Escallonia has lovely flowers in pink, white or red, that appear in late spring to early summer, so prune it back in June after the flowers are gone. Most but not all escallonias (including the varieties mentioned here) are evergreen. E. ‘Red Elf’ is a more compact variety; ‘Slieve Donard’ is also compact with pinky-white flowers. ‘Apple Blossom’ is usually easy to get hold of.Mexican orange blossom (Choisya ternata) may do well, too. It’s tough as old boots and if it does get a bit frosted, just prune it back hard. ‘Royal Lace’ is a dwarf form (up to 75cm tall) that’s suitable for pots.• Got a question for Alys?
