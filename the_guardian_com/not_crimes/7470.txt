The Toad Knew King’s theatre, Edinburgh James Thiérrée’s show did things that I have never seen on stage before – and may never see again. I was seduced into a world that I didn’t truly understand but never wanted to leave. Two of the most astonishing hours of my life. Sandy ThinThe Damned United West Yorkshire Playhouse, LeedsI took my son, who understood the football, while I marvelled at the storytelling and the movement of the performers. By the end, I was hooked by the football story and he was hooked by the drama. Helen CadburyThe Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil Citizens theatre, GlasgowPoignant, powerful, thought-provoking. This play sent me home through the dark, rainy streets of Glasgow feeling utterly hopeless and despondent at the state of things, but with enough of a defiant spark (and one that grew the more I thought back on the play) that the next day I felt like we could be the audience to change the world. This play inspired the activist in me, and reminded me that a great play can jump right off the stage and plant itself into your life in a way that changes how you see everything.

Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the GuardianThe Grinning ManBristol Old VicStunning music, great design and outstanding performances in a highly original, stimulating and entertaining piece of work. It had a slight whiff of Weimar, Weill and even Richard Peaslee (who did the music for Peter Brook’s Marat Sade and A Midsummer Night’s Dream) yet thrillingly it was very much its own strange blackly comic beast. Brilliant to see such bold new work originating from the Bristol Old Vic. Daisy TuckerThe Intelligent Homosexual’s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism … Hampstead theatre, LondonA huge exploration of humanity. At over three hours long, Tony Kushner’s iHo – masterfully directed by Michael Boyd – demonstrated that we need big plays more than ever and that the special ability of theatre to entertain and inform must be supported.

I run a community theatre company who devise theatre and it was exciting to see how the professionals do it. The cast really drew the audience in and it felt really collaborative. Clare FryBlackthorn West Yorkshire Playhouse, LeedsBlackthorn was a meticulously composed two-performer show by a young Yorkshire playwright named Charley Miles. The story was simple; a tale of a boy and girl growing up together, falling in love, becoming almost incompatible adults yet still feeling the pull towards home and each other. The dialogue was pointedly regional, genuine and very witty. It was a rare example of romantic, rural writing and, although the story was a simple tale of young love, it resonated beautifully with anyone who has ever known Yorkshire, a small village, or a childhood sweetheart. A cracking good story and dialogue to make your heart ache. Evelyn O’Neill      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   An actor for the ages … Aoife Duffin in A Girl is a Half-formed Thing.A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing Young Vic, LondonA wrenching, transformative story played with immense force and commitment by the magnificent Aoife Duffin. No set, no flash distractions, just taut writing, effective direction and lighting, and brilliant acting. This wasn’t just the best theatre of 2016, it was the best theatre of the last 25 years, and Duffin is an actor for the ages. Chris LillyThe FlickNational Theatre, LondonI miss this play. Each time I saw it I wanted to give the three characters a hug and tell them everything would be OK. Tarquin Grossman Don Quixote The Swan, Stratford-upon-AvonGreat adaptation of an impossibly extensive book, brilliantly staged with humour, but above all heart and featuring a surprisingly moving Sancho (Rufus Hound), a fine foil for David Threlfall’s Lear-esque performance as Don Quixote. Bette AshleyThon Man Molière Lyceum Theatre, EdinburghIt was brilliantly written by Liz Lochhead and performed masterfully by a small cast. It brought Molière and his company to wonderfully funny and poignant life. S Moir  ImogenShakespeare’s Globe, LondonOnce-in-a-generation Shakespeare. It reimagined the text (Cymbeline) and the space, transforming the Globe from a dry historical experiment into a living, throbbing theatrical reality. Utterly breathtaking; shockingly immediate; vibrantly real. It terrified the living daylights out of those who believe that Shakespeare should speak at rather than to or with us, and who want to deny the breathing reality of his texts to anyone but a self-selecting elite. The diversity of the cast and the boldness of the theatrical vision were a triumphant shout about what theatre can do and be.

Photograph: Charlie Gray/PAHarry Potter and the Cursed ChildPalace theatre, LondonThe dynamic choreography brought the magic to life, and it had just the right balance of comic and tragic. I’m the generation that grew up with Harry and seeing him grown, now that I am also an adult, was always going to be an experience. The themes of the play felt as relevant to my current stage of life (worries about career and family) as the books did when I was younger. Elizabeth Pearson IrisLive theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne A great full-scale professional debut play for an up-and-coming writer who deserves national prominence. Alison Carr has a distinct, quirky and engaging voice that she developed working on the Edinburgh fringe. Her whimsical take on the bitter relationship between two sisters in the aftermath of their mother’s funeral is at once darkly humorous and bitterly emotional. Harold Pinter meets Jeremy Kyle. Christopher Goulding      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Bitterly emotional … Katy Cavanagh and Sam Neale in Iris at Live theatre, NewcastleThe Man in the Woman’s ShoesTricycle, LondonMikel Murfi is special, very special. Whenever he comes to town it’s to show us something extraordinary and beautiful about ourselves. The Man in the Woman’s Shoes is as simple and as complex as it gets. A wonderful story full of humanity and with the most delicious of performances. A master at work. Jonathan ShieldsThis is Living Trafalgar Studios, London A startlingly honest two-hander exploring love and grief without recourse to cynicism or sentimentality. As funny as it was heartbreaking. Michael Socha and Tamla Kari were utterly extraordinary in their energy, truthfulness and depth. I’d seen Kari excel on stage before, but Socha was a revelation. A truly unforgettable experience.

Susannah JeffriesMiss Nightingale: The MusicalTheatre Royal, MargateA touching tale, beautifully and originally told. Being a musical not based on a book or a film, or a film of a book, made it even more captivating. Philip BrayYermaYoung Vic, LondonIt’s the only play that has made me openly sob. Blake Harrison
