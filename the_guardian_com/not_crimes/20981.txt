7.59pm GMT19:59So that’s IT for Blackpool Week! It’s been emotional, but I’ll be glad to get back to studio normality next week. Also it’s the last week before the move to two dances each week, so it’s a super-short show, which my fingers are always thankful for. Many thanks for joining in and being amazing as usual, do feel free to come and say hello on Twitter @heidistephens if you’re passing. Otherwise I’ll see you next week!

Bit dusty in here.They dance their final dance to Bye Bye Love by The Everly Brothers. BLUB.   Bye bye to Greg and Natalie.

Craig votes to save Claudia and AJ for being “close to perfection” (EH?), and Darcey saves them too. Bruno does likewise, and Len would have done the same.Oh Greg, I’m gutted for you. I really wanted to see you in the final, you’ve been amazing.

He’s definitely less bouncy, but the hand jiving bit goes a bit awry. The leap at the end is loads better, however. Have they done enough? I really hope so.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.50pm GMT19:50It’s Claudia and AJ’s Jive up first - I thought this was a bit of a mess last night, but the judges loved it. I’ll watch more closely this time, see if I missed something.Nope, this is still a mess, and it looks like Claudia is struggling in too-high heels. Better than last night, though.

But I actually enjoyed Greg and Natalie’s dance FAR more, and feel like he’s made much bigger improvements than Claudia.

Hello?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.44pm GMT19:44It’s time for more music! This time from 80s pop puppet Rick Astley. He has a new single out, which I heard on Radio 2 the other day and decided was a bit Christian rock for my liking. But I’m guessing some people like that kind of thing, otherwise how would you explain the popularity of Cliff Richard?  It’s Rick Astley!

Louise and Kevin are safe (SO much guyliner and lace), along with Judge Rinder and Oksana and ED AND KATYA (YAAAAAAAAAS)Which means GREG AND NATALIE in tonight’s dance off! Ed has the face of a man who would really like to go home now please.That’s a real shame for Greg. I’m guessing doing a Quickstep to Jive music probably didn’t help.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.35pm GMT19:35OMG CRAIG HAS MONOGRAMMED SHOES.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.33pm GMT19:33Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of 80s purveyors of misery-rock, Simple Minds, singing a karaoke version of Don’t You Forget About Me.

Danny and Oti are safe (obv), along with Ore and Joanne. First couple in tonight’s Dance Off – CLAUDIA AND AJ! Yup, that was always on the cards.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.26pm GMT19:26Last night on Strictly: a bumper Blackpool bonanza, with boozy Bingo to boot. I apologise if any of you have a sore head. Highlights: Ore and Joanne’s Viennese (with endless fleckerl), Rinder calling out the show for tenuous VT fodder, Katya’s piano boobs, Oti’s Charleston (I believe Danny might also have been involved). Lowlights: overmarking, superfluous human props, Ed’s Jive (much as it pains me).I love this picture of Judge Rinder’s bootylicious Salsa. So much technicolour madness.
