Disenchanted, a belated sequel to Disney’s 2007 hit, Enchanted, is set to start shooting next summer. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Hairspray director Adam Shankman is in talks to direct the follow-up, which featured Amy Adams as an animated princess accidentally transported to contemporary Manhattan. James Marsden co-starred as her prince charming, who follows her down the wormhole, while Patrick Dempsey played a New Yorker who falls for Adams despite being engaged to Idina Menzel. Susan Sarandon was an evil queen. A sequel to the film, which took more than $340m worldwide, has been in development since 2010. This iteration of the script is said to focus of Adam’s character questioning her happily-ever-after life and accidentally triggering events that upend everyone’s lives.Adams is shortly to be seen in Tom Ford’s mordant thriller, Nocturnal Animals, and in Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi about aliens on earth, Arrival.
