There is no doubt that friendships change over time, but is there also a point when they start to fade?This is something scientists have looked at in a study that shows both men and women continue to make lots of friends until the age of 25. After this, it’s claimed that friendships begin to fall away rapidly, with the decline continuing for the rest of our lives.The report recognises that it’s hard to define a friend. Scientists measured how many people subjects contacted via phone, with their results consistent with previous studies that have measured face-to-face interactions. It’s a topical subject, and last week our very own Google answers series explored why some people don’t have any friends, prompting fierce debate in the comments.So what do you think? Was there a certain point in your life when friendships seemed to decline? Have you gained or lost friends over time? How can we maintain close relationships? Is this something that varies between sexes? Share your stories below.
