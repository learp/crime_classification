In February, the world’s biggest-selling artist released his 32nd studio album, Wonderful Crazy Night. A joyous record, it is full of his classic pop sensibility, Americana and mid-paced ballads co-penned with lyricist Bernie Taupin. “I have no fucking idea how our relationship works,” John told the Guardian of his longtime writing partner. “It’s 49 years this year. I’ve never had an argument with him in my life, not about work, not about personal things, nothing. And we’re totally different people. I mean, he’s a fucking cowboy who likes guns and I collect tablecloths and porcelain. It’s very odd.”One of its standout tracks is In the Name of You, which paints a picture of the golden age of 1970s USA, while its video, premiered below, is a hazy collage of Super 8 camera footage of road trips, rollercoasters, motels and diners. Take a look at the video below.
