Veronica Roth had cleverly crafted an intricate world of choice and decision in her previous two books, and then threw it away on a whim in Allegiant.Part of the charm and startling quality of Divergent and its successor Insurgent was the worrying world in which Tris and her chums/enemies lived, so when we move from this magical world something is lost. By revealing her truth about the set-up, Roth weaves a tale akin to the ‘and I woke up and it was all a dream’ prose that was banned by all year 6 teachers - as though she had gone to such an effort to make a wonderful story and setting, to lessen its impact somewhat.Brutally horrific ending aside, I feel this book lost its way down a long rambling compared to its predecessors. It didn’t have a true direction, more like trying to tie a hundred loose ends all together in an unsatisfactory bow, with an unnecessary death to top it all off.  AllegiantIn one word: disappointing.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
