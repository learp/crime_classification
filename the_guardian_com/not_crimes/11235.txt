It’s gained legendary status as one of Britain’s best known nightclubs, but now Fabric will close its doors for good after having its licence revoked following two tragic drug-related deaths.The local council decided that searches by security staff at the London venue had been “inadequate and in breach of the licence”. This comes despite the fact a Change.org petition to halt the closure of the club had reached almost 150,000 signatures. We want to hear your memories of the club. What was your best or worst visit?
