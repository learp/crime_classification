However, reports later said he was yet to make a decision on his future as Bond.Despite that, it is widely believed Craig wants to move on after four outings as 007.Hiddleston, who played spy Jonathan Pine in the Night Manager, has played down speculation that he would take on the role, recently telling the BBC’s Graham Norton Show: “The position isn’t vacant as far as I’m aware. No one has talked to me about it.“I think the rumours have come about because in the Night Manager I play a spy and people have made the link.”Meanwhile Elba, who starred in Luther, has spoken of being weary of the constant speculation. “I’m probably the most famous Bond actor in the world, and I’ve not even played the role,” he said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph in 2015. “Enough is enough. I can’t talk about it any more.”
