It's high time the big six energy companies faced up to the anger people feel towards them (Public has lost trust in energy companies, admits EDF, 16 September). Their record profits coincide with unmanageable consumer price rises. Instead of investing in the UK's energy supply, they've made enormous payments to shareholders, leaving bill payers and taxpayers to pick up the tab. Ofgem has launched a legal investigation into their charging practices, having found them guilty of ripping us off to the tune of Â£250m earlier in the year.Our energy system is broken. Six giant companies make massive profits by keeping us hooked on expensive and insecure fossil fuels. Securing energy we can all afford in the long term requires bold leadership by the government. Ministers must help us cut the energy that is wasted in our homes while ensuring a broader base of power suppliers. As a first step, this means guaranteeing an ambitious feed-in tariff scheme that rewards households, communities and businesses for generating clean energy and helps free us all from the shackles of the big six.Donna HumeFriends of the Earth
