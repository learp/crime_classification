A brand of frozen minced beef pie imported from Latvia has been withdrawn from shops after it was found to contain more than 1% horse DNA.The recall is the first in Britain linked to the horsemeat scandal since March.Supplies of the Galdin Klajies 200g meat pies have been withdrawn from small shops, many specialising in eastern European foods.They were distributed by German-owned company Monolith UK, which reported the test result to the Food Standards Agency (FSA).The agency has advised people who have the pies stored in their freezers to return them to where they bought them. The affected batch has a best-before date of 22 January 2014.Details of the incident came days after a House of Commons committee criticised UK and Irish authorities for not acknowledging the extent of international fraud involved in passing off horsemeat as beef or prosecuting any companies involved in the Europe-wide scandal, which first broke in January.In Britain, about 25,000 tests have been conducted for horse DNA since January, mainly by the food industry. Of the 24,480 industry tests, 47 have revealed horse DNA.The FSA has asked Monolith to test the pie for bute, the veterinary drug used on horses and which is banned from food although said to be of "very low risk" to human consumers.Only one product – an Asda Smart Price Corned Beef – has tested positive for bute, at a very low level. It had already been withdrawn before the result was announced in April.
