Use an all-over dry oil or radiance balm for skin that gleams.Get the lookElizabeth Arden Miracle Oil £29 elizabetharden.co.ukClarins After Sun Shimmer Oil £32 boots.comRoger & Gallet Crème Sublime £15 my-dermacenter.comCharlotte Tilbury Supermodel Body £45 charlottetilbury.comBobbi Brown Beach Body Oil £25 bobbibrown.co.ukOmorovicza Gold Shimmer Oil £52 omorovicza.comTom Ford Shimmering Body Oil £70 johnlewis.comMelvita L’Or Bio Extraordinary Oil £25 feelunique.com
