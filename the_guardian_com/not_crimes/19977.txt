All three key Oscar contenders have been named in the five-strong shortlist for this year’s Directors Guild of America awards. The DGAs have diverged from the Academy Awards’ top prize only seven times since 1948, meaning the victor this year will be cemented as the Oscars frontrunner. La La Land, Moonlight and Manchester By the Sea up for PGA awards Damien Chazelle is up for La La Land, alongside Barry Jenkins for Moonlight, Kenneth Lonergan for Manchester By the Sea, Denis Villeneuve for Arrival and Garth Davis for Lion – with the first two being the most heavily tipped to win.Davis is also named in the debut directors list, alongside Tim Miller for Deadpool, Kelly Fremon Craig for The Edge of Seventeen, Dan Trachtenberg for 10 Cloverfield Lane and Nate Parker for The Birth of a Nation.Parker’s inclusion has raised some eyebrows: the writer/director/star of The Birth of a Nation had been predicted to progress to major awards glory, until the resurfacing of rape allegations last summer was thought to have all but kiboshed his chances. Notable snubs were Martin Scorsese and Clint Eastwood (who were both also overlooked by the Globes and Baftas), as well as Denzel Washington for Fences and Mel Gibson for Hacksaw Ridge. Last year’s DGA award went to Alejandro González Iñárritu for The Revenant; Iñárritu went on to win the best director Oscar, but The Revenant was pipped at the post for best picture by Tom McCarthy’s Spotlight. The 2016 best debut director award went to Alex Garland for Ex Machina.The winners will be announced on 4 February.
