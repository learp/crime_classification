One summer 15 years ago, I went on a book binge of unprecedented gluttony: I had discovered serialised fiction. A family friend had dug out a huge box of tatty, mouldy Trixie Belden detective novels that I gorged upon at a rate of two a day. When the back catalogue of Belden was exhausted, I returned to Enid Blyton and gobbled down Famous Five, Secret Seven, the Adventure series, then started on the Hardy Boys. My parents viewed this wild bender with happy bemusement and silently thanked the powers above for libraries.Then I was given Nancy Drew: and I hated her. In my first foray (The Clue of the Leaning Chimney), Nancy was pleasant and inoffensive; offensively so. She was a mashup of ideals that made her feel very fake; a Mary Sue who was popular, pretty, athletic, artistic, all the while loved by everyone who met her. She had none of Trixie’s grump or boisterous clumsiness or the Famous Five’s British charm: Nancy was so devoid of flaws that she was devoid of personality. As a podgy Australian 10-year-old, all this perfection was very jarring; after 12 or so Nancy Drews, I tossed her out and read something else.Nancy is also very noticeably white. She lives in a place called River Heights sometime between the 1930s and the 1980s; her Wasp status makes her so privileged that the Great Depression and second world war are only ever alluded to, and she knows people who have black servants (Beulah the African American servant is changed to Anna, a “plump smiling housekeeper” in a later rewrite). She never has a job, drives a fancy roadster, her handsome lawyer dad and motherly housekeeper dote on her, and she and her friends date lovely varsity boys called variants of Buck, Burt and Ned. After Nancy is described as the “attractive Titian blonde” with “baby blue eyes” for the umpteenth time, you start getting she might be white (and probably hot).But she won’t be so white for much longer: this week it was announced that Nancy Drew is going to be adapted for the screen for the umpteenth time – and she won’t be Caucasian. President of CBS Entertainment Glenn Geller told the Hollywood Reporter: “She is diverse, that is the way she is written. [She will] not [be] Caucasian. I’d be open to any ethnicity.”This transformation of crime’s most vanilla gumshoe follows a run of more diverse casting of book characters: a black Hermione on stage in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Idris Elba possibly signed to play Stephen King’s Roland in the Dark Tower TV show. Lucy Liu plays John (Joan) Watson in Elementary, Michael B Jordan was Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four. Why the hell not? It may offend people with no sense of priority or inherited privilege, but these castings are small acknowledgments of the decades-long lack of representation of BAME characters in mainstream media and literature.The Nancy Drew books were written in the 1930s and revised in the 50s and 60s in an effort to remove hints of racism – which usually meant taking out any non-white characters. The Mystery at Lilac Inn (1930) was completely rewritten because the storyline sat so uncomfortably three decades later: at one point, Nancy identifies a girl as a thief because she is black and in a posh shop (“Surely a girl in her circumstances cannot afford to buy dresses at such a place as this,” Nancy ponders, in a very of-her-time way.) River Heights has its own Chinatown, but only to provide Nancy with a stream of “Oriental” baddies and the occasional victim. Even in the sexed-up titles written in the 70s and 80s, when Nancy has a perm and shirtless hunks replace clues on the covers, she remained the same inside: upper-class, conservative and charmingly unchallenging.Nancy is perfectly summed up as “an expression of wish fulfilment”. For her time (war, Depression, women’s lib) she was what was needed: an aspirational pretty blonde, with an all-’Murican tenacity coupled with a streak of feminine daintiness. Now, she can be something else. Personally, I hope she’s driven (being a detective means she has an actual job now), funny (a few jokes please!) and flawed (maybe her jokes are bad). And good looking too (it’s TV, there is only so much we can ask for); just no more blandly, boringly beige Nancy.If we get a black Nancy or an Asian Nancy or a Arab Nancy, that’s great; I think this new flexibility in casting is exciting and meaningful, in a wider discussion about race and representation. Let’s not stop at skin colour – make her poorer, angrier, funnier. If they incorporate an inkling of the aggression shown on social media toward this casting news, Nancy’s new race might give her a determination born of something honest. Give the girl a damn challenge to overcome that isn’t about antique heirlooms and she might develop a personality.
