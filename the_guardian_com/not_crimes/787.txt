The first step to acknowledging addiction is to, well, acknowledge the addiction – and get help. So I am here in the backstreets of Bondi, ringing on the buzzer of a double-storey terrace. It’s the first time I’ve attended a support group and I’m nervous.I’m at the home of Matt Ringrose – and tonight in Sydney he is holding a meeting for mobile device addicts. Of which I am one.I pause before I ring the buzzer again – and check Twitter.Upstairs there are a dozen of us, tea brewing in a pot in the middle of a circle.Strange things happen in other people’s homes. With Airbnb it's all part of the service | Brigid Delaney We sit around, a bit awkwardly. What to do with our phones? Switch them off? Conspicuously place them away from ourselves – out of reach – in the way that parents remove sharp objects from toddlers?Matt encourages us to introduce ourselves as addicts and tell the group about our relationship to our devices. “Sar” (all names have been changed) a woman in her 20s who, I notice, has not put her phone away but has it still on, and resting on top of her bag, kicks off: “I’m Sar and I am addicted to my mobile phone. I have a love-hate relationship with technology and it’s consuming me. I take my phone to the toilet.”We all nod and make “me too” murmurs, although I wonder, does she take her phone to the toilet to check it or to actually make calls? There’s a difference. Only the week before I had been in a toilet cubicle next to someone who was making ACTUAL restaurant reservations while on the toilet, which is really gross.Next up is Becky. “The boredom is a big part of it. I’m an addict because I sit on it day and night. At night, in bed, I just scroll through. I don’t know what I’m looking for.” The next step is to slip our sim cards into a phone that last rocked the high street in the 1990s We all nod again. Who hasn’t done that – the mindless midnight scroll – that can be both numbing and aggravating all at once?“Hi, I’m Steve and I’m a mobile addict. I deleted the Facebook app for the third time. Trump winning the election helped with that. But it’s so easy just to reinstall the app. And sometimes I feel like if I don’t have it, I’m missing out.”“How else do people invite you to parties if you don’t have Facebook?” I wonder aloud.Matt Ringrose, who has overcome his addiction by swapping his iPhone for an old-fashioned flip phone, says we should keep Facebook if we need it but just have it on a desk top – so it’s not constantly accessible via our devices.Mandy jumps in and tells us: “I have implemented some helpful strategies. When I feel down or low, I watch myself get on it, and then I watch my reaction after being on it. My smartphone makes me feel small.”Matt, who also teaches meditation, nods. Later he says: “Smartphones do make us feel small. We lose our conscious connection with the world and get sucked into that small-minded part of ourselves which is only interested in status and comparison.”In the group, Facebook comes under particular fire for the vapour trail of misery, envy and Fomo inflicted after a lengthy scroll.A German woman speaks next. “I’m addicted to my phone. I went off social media for all of September. I deleted Instagram and Facebook and I didn’t want to have to prove that I was having a great time in Sydney. But then I went back on it. Now if I’m having lunch or a break from work, I just scroll through my phone. I can’t be alone. Also when you post something you want to check how it’s going.”The next man, a Brit, talks about how terrified he gets when his phone is low of charge and he has no way of charging it. “That feeling is not right,” he says.Matt nods at all of this. “The reason we become addicted to the phone is not for the data but because we’re wanting to avoid feeling something. It’s a resistance to and a rejection of life. It’s an uncomfortable body sensation. The phone is our anaesthetiser. On the phone we feel like we have more control. The outer world we live in is mainly out of our control. On social media we get agreement and approval constantly. It’s a safer world.”It’s a safer world until you realise that world is becoming more real to you than the real world. Until you realise that you are cutting into time with people right there in front of you in favour of your virtual interactions. Who are you in the real world if you are spending less and less time there?My head bows more than 60 times a day to this digital deity – checking and refreshing and tapping out little messages. I’m an addict, I tell the group. I want to do a hard reset of my life – and experience more as a corporeal being rather than a virtual one.“In order to heal, we need to feel,” Matt says. “We need to learn to get more in touch with our feelings and learn how to get in touch with them as they arise. Going to your phone is like going to a casino and winning – there’s a big dopamine hit. It sinks its hooks into your motivating centres. And it’s completely authorised, if not encouraged, by our society.”Matt calls mobile device addiction a mental health epidemic. It feeds off our craving for connection – yet simultaneously disconnects us from our deeper feelings. “It appeals to an ego-based personality – like a two-year-old child.”Brigid Delaney's diary | Defy the 'wellness' industry: here are some simple ways to feel better in 2017 To ween himself off his phone, Matt started pretending he didn’t have it on him when he went out. “Every time I didn’t go to it, a feeling of peace descended on me.”He then wondered whether he could survive without his mobile device and just use an old flip phone instead.He wrote a list of reasons he did and didn’t need it. “Emancipate yourself from mental slavery,” he says, quoting Bob Marley and firing all us sad phone addicts up. “The opportunity to experience life in the fullest really excited me.”The support group aims to transfer we addicts from our smartphones over to dumb flip phones. We can still access the internet via laptops and desktops – but the idea is to limit the time we spend in the virtual world.Before we switch over, he advises we take it slowly – for example, moving to a slower model phone – such as the iPhone 4, turning off notifications, turning off wifi and having phone-free periods, and limiting social media checking to twice a day. Matt asks us to assess whether we can manage with calls and texts only. “Do I win more than I lose?”The next step is to slip our sim cards into a phone that last rocked the high street in the 1990s.After the meeting, I made some important changes. Last week I broke my biggest addiction, Twitter. It is just some apps – like Uber – that I can’t imagine living without.It’s baby steps to enter this brave old world.Never glad confident morning again Has there been a new term invented yet for Trump-centred anxiety? I’m sure I’m not the only one who has been waking every night at 3am (every night since the inauguration) terrified that across the other side of the world, something catastrophic has occurred. Did he start world war three while I was sleeping? Or unleash nuclear weapons? Anything in these strange days seems possible.
