This is the second book in Ally Carter’s thrilling Embassy Row series and it continues exactly where book one ended. Grace is still living in the embassy where her Grandfather is the American Ambassador to the fictional land of Adria.The main story starts when Grace’s older brother Jamie comes home on leave from his army training at West Point and brings his friend Spence with him, because his grandmother was from Adria. This leads to an international incident concerning Spence. The rest of the story revolves around this plot point.Grace’s friends Noah, Lila, Megan and Rosie are again featured in this book and help her uncover the mystery of what happened and why.I thought that Grace’s character throughout the book was believable because she is still coming to terms with the revelation, revealed at the end of book one, about her mother’s death.Telling the story through Grace’s voice makes it very entertaining as she still gets herself into scrapes due to her awkward personality. The relationship between her and her brother is portrayed very realistically, especially the way Jamie looks out for Grace.I would highly recommend this book for anyone aged 9 – 13 who enjoys engaging action/adventure stories and I am certainly looking forward to the third book in this series being published.
