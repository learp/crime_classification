Though Serena Williams was smiling, when she raised her fist after beating Germany’s Angelique Kerber to win Wimbledon for the seventh time, it was a move reminiscent of John Carlos’s black power salute at the 1968 Olympics. Black Twitter swooned. Here was a woman who had just equalled Steffi Graf’s open era record of major titles using her platform, albeit in a small way, to show her support to the black community in one of the most tragic weeks in its recent history.The man who raised a black power salute at the 1968 Olympic Games As well as being a source of pride for the black community as a whole, I’ve always looked at Williams as a particular role model for young black women. Her visibility is incredibly important a time when we are taking to the streets of London, Bristol, Manchester and Nottingham in support of Black Lives Matter – and raising awareness of the fact that establishment brutality against black people extends beyond America, and includes women as well as men. (Think Sarah Reed and the 1,558 deaths in police custody. More than 500 deaths in prison and police custody have been people of colour.)Williams has been a vocal supporter of Black Lives Matter, and an articulate feminist who has supported the Women’s Tennis Association’s campaign for equal pay and, of course, she made a twerking cameo in Beyoncé’s 2016 visual album and unashamed exploration of black womanhood, Lemonade. In support, Bey was in Williams’s box on Saturday – taking Vogue editor Anna Wintour’s spot.

As a teenager I still hated the size of my thighs and the way my arms gained muscle in a flash, but Williams’s defiance of the nasty spray of comments that littered social media – the cries of “man”, “steroid-freak” or “hooker” every time she played a game of tennis – helped to erode my own worries about my body, and turn me into the reasonably body-confident person I am today.And I know for many of my female friends who are dark-skinned, Williams’s successes are also symbolic in the fight against colourism - the discrimination against individuals with a dark skin tone.In an interview with Good Morning America in 2015, she said: “I’ve been like this my whole life, and I embrace me and I love how I look. I love that I am a full woman, and I’m strong and I’m powerful and I’m beautiful at the same time. And there’s nothing wrong with that.” She’s also had the support of such eminent people as JK Rowling, who tweeted the following after seeing a slur directed at the tennis star on her timeline: “.@diegtristan8 ‘she is built like a man’. Yeah, my husband looks just like this in a dress. You’re an idiot.”Serena Williams: ​'​Not everyone’s going to like the way I look​'​ And then, of course, there’s her tennis - the dedication that she’s shown the physically and mentally demanding sport since she was a young girl. On a 1992 episode of the TV programme Trans World Sport, we see her and sister Venus as children; with big, matching smiles and braids bobbing with beads. “If you were a tennis player, who would you want to be like?” the interviewer asks 11-year-old Serena, “Well, I’d like other people to be like me,” she responds. Their father, and erstwhile coach – predicting the future it seems – says that while Venus has the qualities of a champion, Serena “plays angles better than any woman, or any man I’ve seen play tennis”, and “will probably be a better player than Venus”. His faith clearly unleashed an innate and beautiful confidence in her. In the past few years, Williams says she’s been trying to instil that confidence in all young women.Last year I was a witness as she lived up to this aim, when playing against the then 23-year-old British player Heather Watson. Williams won the game 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, but admitted afterwards that it was one of her toughest ever matches on Centre Court, saying that the younger woman had “every chance to reach the top 20 in the world and beyond”. On Sunday Watson – who has said she sees Williams as an idol – won this year’s mixed doubles at Wimbledon. I would argue that Williams’s reaction to her near defeat of 2015 is intrinsically tied to Watson’s success in 2016. Just like her, we all have a lot to learn from “Slayrena” Williams.
