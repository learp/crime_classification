The Name of this Book is Secret by Pseudonymous BoschReview by GraceThis book is amazing! It’s a bit of a Sherlock Holmes book for kids and it’s fun! The story follows two main characters, Cass and Max-Ernest, who investigate the mysterious death of a local magician and lots of exciting things happen throughout this investigation. The author cleverly doesn’t give away any of his secrets which will keep any reader in suspense! RATING: 10/10 Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Old School by Jeff KinneyReview by LaurynThis book is hilarious because Greg gets into lots of adventures again! Greg is my favourite character because it’s his diary and he is funny. The plot is that Greg’s mum is trying to get the town to switch off all the electronic devices to make it like “the good old days!” It’s laugh-out-loud funny and you’ll laugh so hard! RATING: 10/10Wonder by R.J. PalicioReview by TabithaThis is a book about a boy called August, who has a facial abnormality, and how he copes with life in 5th grade. He had never been to school before. Summer was my favourite character because she was kind and didn’t judge August, and my favourite part was when the two of them made friends and created their own club. It was heart warming.
