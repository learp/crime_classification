I am a woman in her late 20s and have been in a stable relationship with my boyfriend for around six years. I love him dearly but our sex life is dwindling. I avoid sex and make excuses. Recently, completely out of the blue, I had sex with a good female friend. We were both really drunk, and are both straight, but it was the most sexual I have been in months and I loved every second of it. What does this mean?It simply means that you were drawn to – or perhaps needed – the erotic inspiration of something taboo. Heightened sexual experiences are often achieved when people enter what they consider to be “forbidden” realms. Classic examples would be having sex with an “inappropriate” partner, engaging in risky or taboo sexual practices, or experimenting with partners of a different gender. I could understand if this experience served to underscore the lack of excitement in your relationship with your boyfriend, however it is not something that necessarily threatens your primary relationship. You may be tempted to use it as an escape route from boredom, but it might be a mistake to act hastily. Take some time to consider all your feelings – sexual and otherwise – and talk with your friend about how she feels. This is an opportunity to learn something very important about yourself. Relationship triangles can be complicated and painful, so tread very carefully.• Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders• If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).
