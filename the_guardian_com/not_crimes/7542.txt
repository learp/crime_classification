The career of a genius is all high points, like an angry porcupine. Since I can no longer get any further from my Cambridge house than Addenbrooke’s hospital, I won’t be getting to London to see Barry Humphries starring in his show about the Weimar era. But I can tell already that he’s in command of every detail. Without doubt he has chosen his venue, the Cadogan theatre, with Oscar Wilde in mind. Wilde had a lot of physical energy and no limit to his social range: he could bring the house down giving a lecture in an American mining camp. Humphries is like that. Far and away he is the most learned man I ever met, but he can make immediate contact with anyone except the dull. I’d love to see the show but I would be too often reminded that the man up there zooming around the stage is 10 years older than I am. So I think I’ll just lie here quietly.Though Humphries is a swooping, soaring and demonically chortling reminder that a career can last for ever, it’s usually wiser for an ordinary artist to remember that there are limits, and to pick someone out of the near future to carry your flag. Visitors to this column will know that I have faith in Taylor Swift, despite her cruel handicaps of unfeasible glamour and a budget bigger than the US Navy; and in Lauren Mayberry, despite the waif-like fragility with which she had to drag, through the mud of Glastonbury, a pair of work boots each bigger than she is. Gad, these frail creatures: what they suffer for their art.But just when I thought my reserves of admiration and pity for these ethereal young women could stretch no further, my colleague Pete Atkin gave me the name of Rachael Price, queen-pin of an outfit called Lake Street Dive. On YouTube you can watch and hear her singing What I’m Doing Here, and you’ll realise in the first minute what she’s doing here: giving the breath of life to the future of her industry, that’s what. Pete Atkin was in a bad accident recently and I wondered how he came back from the dead so quickly. Now I know.Clive James: ‘It's Boris Johnson's personality that makes him look as if he's been rolled on by a horse’ He was listening to Rachael Price. She won’t be having the same effect on me: I’ve run out of comebacks. But it’s good to know that somebody so gifted can still grow up dedicated. That last part is the hard part: there are so many distractions. But the only way you can protect your precious child from all of them is to lock her in her room, where eventually she will turn into either a mushroom or a punk with a gun. The distractions are the stuff of life.
