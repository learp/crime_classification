Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and Cersei Lannister are all still watching the throne in the latest teaser trailer for the seventh and penultimate season of Game of Thrones.Game of Thrones season seven trailer and premiere date revealed In a promo called Long Walk, the trio are seen strolling towards different grand chairs as a cover version of James’s 90s hit Sit Down plays in the background.Snow is seen walking through the halls of Winterfell, Cersei strolls through King’s Landing, while Daenerys Targaryen is apparently in her ancestral home of Dragonstone.The trailer is the second brief peek into the world of Westeros following another teaser, which suggested dark times were ahead for the different clans. As in that trailer, amid the dark predictions about the great war and talk of revenge, the blue eye of what appears to be the Night King, the leader of the White Walkers, slowly appears in the background, alluding to the conflict that has been referenced since the very first season. With only two seasons left, the show-runner David Benioff said earlier this year that the show is “definitely heading into the endgame now”.Few details have been revealed about the new season, which will premiere in the US on 16 July, but two guest stars have been confirmed. The Oscar winner Jim Broadbent will join the cast as an “archmaester”, as will the chart-dominating pop star Ed Sheeran, who will make a cameo in the fantasy drama.
