Photograph: The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts/Artists Rights SocietyDead coolModern icons were the lifeblood of Warhol’s work – from Marilyn Monroe to soup cans. With a jolt of bleak humour, he seems to suggest his electric chair as a dark mirror to these images.The hot seatIt began as this 1964 screenprint, with the chair looking lost in a deathly vacuum of silver and shadows. In later prints Warhol went for bright colours and a closeup of the main attraction.OverkillThe original work was part of his Death and Disaster series, where grisly shots of riots, suicides and car crashes were screenprinted, over and over, mirroring the numbing effect of the media.Fatal attractionLike Warhol’s movie stars, the electric chair image is thrilling but, thanks to its repetition and thus normalisation, oddly robbed of impact. Where was the woman behind Marilyn’s trademark bouffant and pout? Death, served as a treacly kick in the tabloids, is similarly unfathomable – but leads to a shrug rather than any soul-searching.
