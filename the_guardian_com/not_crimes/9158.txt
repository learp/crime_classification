The big six energy companies received more than 5.5m complaints last year, prompting a new call for the power sector to be radically reformed.Npower had the worst record, 1.4m complaints in 2013, with EDF and British Gas not far behind. The data, compiled by the consumer group Which?, came with calls for a full competition inquiry plus the separation of the big six supply and generation businesses.Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, said the figures underlined why his department was working so hard to reform the retail market and open it up to new independent firms.There are about 27m households in Britain, so if the 5.5m complaints were all from different customers – and that remains unknown – then one in five energy users lodged a complaint last year. "Millions of people are unhappy with the service they receive from the suppliers which, combined with low levels of trust, is yet more evidence that more must be done to fix the broken energy market," said Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?"Next month we want the regulators to refer the energy market to the Competition and Markets Authority and launch a full-scale inquiry. This is the first and most important step towards a more radical reform of the energy market, giving hard-pressed consumers the confidence that they are paying a fair price," he added.Which? said it compiled the statistics from data supplied by the big six themselves and the figures showed the most complaints came in the final quarter of 2013, when there were big price rises. The complaints cover bills, metering and customer service.Npower, owned by Germany's RWE and at the centre of a recent row over low tax payments, had 440,000 complaints in the last three months of 2013 – 80 for every 1,000 accounts held by the company. EDF had 42 for every 1,000 and British Gas 24.Npower said last night it was aware it had let many customers down but blamed a new billing system. "Since we issued a public apology to our customers at the end of last year, we have been reporting to [energy regulator] Ofgem. We are making good progress and will soon be able to give an update on where we have got to. Looking at Which?'s proposals, there are many elements that we support and several that we are already doing."Davey, giving a speech at the Institute for Public Policy Research in London before seeing the Which? numbers, said that if true they would reinforce his determination to shake up the market."I have been very critical of those companies that are not performing on customer service. We have seen reports from Which? and others which have identified pretty poor customer service. And if you look at the charts the worst performers are the big six, so my response is that fact we are getting more independents to challenge the big six can only in the long term help drive up customer service."
