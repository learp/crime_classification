Trials of monthly bin collections in the UK are “an obvious next step” to tackle the UK’s stalling recycling rates, waste management experts have told the Guardian. Fife council have begun trialling once-a-month collections for landfill bins, with recycling bins and food waste taken more often.The nine-month trial in Fife is a UK first, reports the BBC, although other councils have already tried three- and four-week collections. “It’s an obvious next step – as long as nappy and food waste are collected more frequently,” Margaret Bates, professor of sustainable wastes management at the University of Northampton told the Guardian. “If you’re going to keep reducing local authority budgets, either you try and do things that, although people don’t want them, they make sense – like reducing waste collections so people think more about the waste they are generating and act on it – or you start cutting back on services,” she said.Fife council has said they are responding to demand for the change from residents, although many have objected, claiming less frequent collections are unsustainable and will attract vermin. They will provide bigger bins for households that generate more rubbish for specific reasons, such as from nappies or medical waste.Councils are under pressure to meet an EU target of 50% recycling by 2020 at the same time as experiencing huge cutbacks in their budgets. But figures published last year showed that recycling rates in the UK have slowed to 44.2%, an increase of only 0.1% on the previous year. In 2012 Eric Pickles, then communities secretary, called local authorities “bin-o-crats” and the “town hall Talibin” for moving to fortnightly collections. Calling weekly collections “a basic right” he launched a multimillion pound fund to tempt them to reverse the changes. Stoke-on-Trent, the only council to take up the offer, has since abandoned the scheme because it is too costly and ignores European directives.Pickles said: “I firmly believe that it is the right of every English man and woman that their chicken tikka masala, the nation’s favourite dish, the remnants can be put in the bin without the worry that a fortnight later it is rotting and making life unpleasant.”Ian Williams, professor of applied environmental science at the university of Southampton told the Guardian he had got into “a spat” with Pickles because “there isn’t a single shred of evidence” to back claims that less frequent bin collections encouraged vermin and threaten public health.A 2012 study by Williams that compared fortnightly with weekly collections showed that it led to increased rates of recycling, with no negative impacts on the local environment, household waste or public health. However, he said that little research has been done on monthly collections.Bates said that the only alternative approach to boost recycling rates was to start charging for waste, a measure that has been introduced with success in Germany. Monthly collections were implemented across much of Austria some years ago, with areas in Germany, Switzerland and Scandinavia following suit, he said. “We’re well behind the curve in looking at new ways of doing waste management collections. People need to start thinking about their impact in the same way as they do with energy use. Waste is the only service that we don’t pay for proportional to our use of it. With the rise of water meters, the more water you use, the more you pay – the same with electricity, gas and other services,” said Bates.Less frequent collections can have significant cost savings for local authorities. Councils in Wales, where recycling rates stand at 54.3%, have already introduced three-weekly collections. Bury council reported an 8% rise in recycling rates with Gwynedd attributing annual savings of £350,000 to the change. Banbridge district council near Belfast started collecting landfill bins every four weeks in January 2014, with recycling taken on a weekly basis. The trial was stopped in April when the council merged into a much larger one. Jeff Byers, a spokesperson for the new Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council said it had been “absolutely a success from the council’s point of view”. “The diversion from landfill was huge and the recycling rates went through the roof,” in spite of a lack of enthusiasm from local residents, he told the Guardian.This article was amended on 25 September to state that Banbridge is near, not in, Belfast. It was amended on 28th September to clarify that Jeff Byers is a spokesperson for the council.
