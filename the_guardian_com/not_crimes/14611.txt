The former Greens leader Bob Brown has shrugged off the impact of a split in the Tasmanian Greens that will lead to a breakaway faction contesting the state election.“I hope they win every dark green vote in Tasmania – they’ll go straight across to the Greens in preferences,” he said.According to reports, the former University of Tasmania academic Geoff Holloway plans to re-form the United Tasmania Group and contest the next state election. “We don’t feel that the present state Greens appreciate the wilderness and national parks aspects of Tasmania that many of us fought [for], even decades, to preserve,” Holloway said.Bob Brown launches challenge to law targeting 'disruptive' protesters The United Tasmania Group was formed in 1972 in response to the flooding of Lake Pedder, before morphing into the Greens by the late 70s.Brown told Guardian Australia that Holloway had contacted him about the plan a month ago, and that he responded: “I wouldn’t be part of it in any shape or form.”“[Holloway’s] been around since the 1970s, but he has never been involved in the politics of the Greens much either as an office holder or a candidate,” he said. “I wish him well, I think if he gets registered for the federal or state election – he won’t for the federal election, it’s too late – he will feed more preferences to the Greens. I’ve always said the more the merrier with political parties.”Brown said the Tasmanian Greens still represented environmental groups and their ethos strongly, despite Holloway’s apparent intention to run against their record.One concern cited by Holloway in reports was that the Tasmanian Greens had offered “tacit support” for a proposed tourist walking track at Lake Geeves in the state’s south. “If they’re going to expand and aspire to government then obviously they’ve got to broaden their base but at the same time they should never forget their roots,” he said.World heritage forests burn as global tragedy unfolds in Tasmania The Tasmanian Greens leader, Cassy O’Connor, defended her party’s record, pointing to the extra 170,000 hectares added to the world heritage area and 9,500 energy efficiency upgrades delivered while the Greens were part of minority government.Brown said the Liberal Hodgman government had undertaken multiple assaults on the Tasmanian environment, including allowing mining and logging in the Tarkine wilderness. “[Those causes] do require a strong presence in parliament, a strong environment movement and a vigorous public campaign,” he said. “If Geoff wants to add to any of those – and he hasn’t been prominent in them so far – good on him. It’s a sign of the success of the Greens, that smaller parties want to emulate it on either side of the political spectrum.”
