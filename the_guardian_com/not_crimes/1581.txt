The TV presenter Richard Hammond has reportedly been injured after falling off a motorbike while filming in Mozambique.The crash happened in a remote part of the east African country during the shooting of Amazon Prime’s The Grand Tour.Responding to reports of the accident, which happened in the last fortnight, Hammond posted on DriveTribe, a digital platform for car-lovers that he was fine. He wrote: “Yes I fell off but yes, I’m fine. Sorry … Thanks for enquiries re my slight shunt whilst filming for GT.“I can confirm that yes, I fell off a. bike, many times, in fact and yes, I banged my head and everything else. But life goes on.” His co-presenter Jeremy Clarkson had told the Sun newspaper: “He really did hurt himself quite badly.” After the crash, Hammond reportedly lay unconscious on the road. When asked if he had been taken to hospital, Clarkson said: “We don’t do hospitals.” The Grand Tour finale: here's what the series got right – and very wrong Hammond has since made a full recovery.Hammond sustained life-threatening head injuries and brain damage 11 years ago after being involved in a 288mph crash as he filmed a stunt for BBC’s Top Gear. The presenter was in a coma for a fortnight, but left hospital after five weeks and eventually made a full recovery.Clarkson and fellow presenter James May were present at the time of the recent crash and were said to have been “shaken” as Hammond’s previous crash was “fresh in their minds”.The trio were signed up by Amazon for the new motoring show after Clarkson was fired by the BBC following a “fracas” with a producer.
