Funnily enough I got this hilarious, heart-warming book from my own auntie (who is not awful at all!). Having read David Walliams’s previous books, I was very surprised to see that unlike his other books, this story was set a long time ago.Awful Auntie follows a little girl called Stella Saxby who lives with her parents in a huge stately home. One morning she wakes to find her parents gone and her horrendous auntie tells her that her parents died in a terrible car accident. Could it be true? Stella discovers the awful deeds her auntie has committed, revealing shocking but hilarious results.In this spell-binding novel, Walliams incorporates the perfect mix of roaring jokes that will have you in stitches and a great, exciting plot that will have you wanting to know where the story will turn next.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel and I think anyone who likes a good laugh, an action packed adventure and an all round brilliant book will love Awful Auntie from start to finish!Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
