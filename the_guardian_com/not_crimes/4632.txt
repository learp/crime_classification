Guardian contributor Pr0fessorGreen 29 November 2016 2:11pmBuy my autobiography, Lucky, which I wrote myself, and then tell me what you think! Peace.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.23pm GMT14:23CatchFazed asks:Is there anyone you haven’t worked with that you’d like to? Can I also just say, love both new singles. Raw and funny in equal measure.  Guardian contributor Pr0fessorGreen 29 November 2016 2:10pmThank you for your kind comments. I'd like to work with Emeli again... I quite like Charli XCX. There's a "I don't give a fuck" about her, an attitude. I think also Bibi Bourelly. She wrote Bitch Better Have My Money for Rihanna - she has a lot of "I don't give a fuck" about her, proper.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.22pm GMT14:22Grime = punkID405034 asks:What will blow up bigger in 2017: political punk or Donald Trump’s policies?  Guardian contributor Pr0fessorGreen 29 November 2016 2:07pmI would hope political punk. Though I feel like punk for 2017 is probably grime, and not punk in the traditional sense. I think grime is the closest thing we have to what punk was.Updatedat 2.22pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.21pm GMT14:21lunch101 asks:Why are you more prominent in the public psyche than English rappers that are actually good, like Jehst for example? Is it convinient links with music insiders? Lyrics that are so in line with constructed public consensus so that sites like the guardian are willing to champion you and places like Radio 1 give you air time?  Guardian contributor Pr0fessorGreen 29 November 2016 2:07pmIt's all subjective - the fact that you don't like my music. Thank God your opinion of my music has no bearing over where I'm placed in the public psyche.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.20pm GMT14:20KungLao  asks:What in particular offended you about Honey G’s act on X Factor?  Guardian contributor Pr0fessorGreen 29 November 2016 2:05pmThe fact that it felt like more of a spoof. That it was more of a mockery, like something you'd see in a spoof movie. I could quite imagine her in Scary Movie.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.19pm GMT14:19Ben Grafton asks:Hi! I interviewed you several years ago for a French teen magazine in Paris and you told me the only French you knew was the word for ‘eraser’. Have you learnt any more since? Also: it’s my birthday today so can you say Happy Birthday? Glad to see your career has gone from strength to strength.  Guardian contributor Pr0fessorGreen 29 November 2016 2:04pmNope. Eraser is gomme, though.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.18pm GMT14:18EriuAndTheGaels asks:Would you do anything differently with your career if you could start again from the beginning?  Guardian contributor Pr0fessorGreen 29 November 2016 2:04pmNo. It's really easy to speak hypothetically, and say that I'd change loads of things - you could do it with life, not just career. But you have no idea what the knock on effect of those changes might be.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.17pm GMT14:17BookLoverTreeSaver asks:What has been your biggest life lesson so far?  Guardian contributor Pr0fessorGreen 29 November 2016 2:03pmThis sounds negative at first, but actually is quite positive. It's really that there's no such thing as permanence. Everything is temporary. The good to be taken from that is to not worry about the two things that don't actually exist that everyone spends time worrying about: the past and the future. Maybe we should just focus on being present. Without wanting to sound like something out of a self help book...FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.15pm GMT14:15hannahbond37 asks:Being a famous person is there a temptation to constantly respond to false stories about yourself or do you develop a thick skin about it? I can’t imagine ever not wanting to be really defensive and respond to everything written about me.  Guardian contributor Pr0fessorGreen 29 November 2016 2:01pmIf I responded to everything written about me, I would have no time to do anything else. More frustrating than things being written, is people being fooled into believing that most of what's written is true.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.15pm GMT14:15bryfox asks:I know you only as the guy who married Millie.
