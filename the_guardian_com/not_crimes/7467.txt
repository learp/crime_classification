British director Andrea Arnold explores American terrain for the first time in her fourth feature, American Honey, which opens this autumn, having premiered at Cannes in May. Although it lost out to Ken Loach’s I, Daniel Blake for the festival’s top honour, the Palme d’Or, American Honey made Arnold a three-times winner of the event’s jury award – having previously won for her feature debut Red Road, as well as Fish Tank.American Honey review: Andrea Arnold mislays map on sweet, indelible roadtrip Like all of her output, American Honey is defiantly experimental: shot in her confining ratio of choice, 4:3, it uses its 152 minutes to immerse you in the whirlwind life of Star (newcomer Sasha Lane), a teenage girl who runs away from a troubled home to join a traveling sales crew driving across the American midwest. Shia LaBeouf appears as a hot-headed love interest who works alongside her, selling magazine subscriptions door-to-door. Riley Keough also stars, playing the group’s selfish boss.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Arnold described the gang as “a small potted version of the American dream,” while discussing the film at Cannes. “They’re working hard at selling themselves, which is what capitalism is all about.”The film’s formal audacity makes it a long-shot for the major awards, but that hasn’t stopped specialty distributor A24 from securing an autumn release date for the picture.The company found great success in 2012 with Harmony Korine’s neon-coloured teen satire Spring Breakers – a film many reviews have compared American Honey to. The first trailer released for the film teases a similarly rebellious spirit.American Honey will be in UK cinemas from 14 October with a US date to follow
