Milk chocolate digestivesMcVitie’sMilk Chocolate Digestives300g, £1.50, ocado.comA slight caramelised sugar flavour. You can taste the grain. The best chocolate coating of the bunch. A classic.★★★Fortnum & MasonPiccadilly Clotted Cream Digestive200g, £7.25, fortnumandmason.comWeird. A chocolate-dipped cookie with not much chocolate flavour. Disappointing.★Tower GateMilk Chocolate Digestives400g, 59p, lidl.co.ukYou instantly get that familiar digestive taste. It’s not very sweet at all. A crisp biscuit. The chocolate isn’t good quality and it’s a bit stingy.★Essential WaitroseMilk Chocolate Digestive Biscuits400g, £1.15, waitrose.comIt just tastes like fat, sugar and preservatives, but there’s a familiar wholesome flavour. Nothing to the chocolate coating.★Shortbread      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/ReutersTesco FinestShortbread Fingers165g, £1.29, tesco.comGood crumble. A buttery taste that is more genuine - like real butter. It feels more rustic and homemade. Melt in the mouth.★★★Lottie Shaw’sSeriously Good All Butter Shortbread Biscuits375g, £3.95, ocado.comReally buttery. Could be thicker. A bit more ‘stick in your teeth’ than it should be.★★Taste the DifferenceHighland Shortbread Fingers200g, £1.75, sainsburys.co.ukNice crunch. Tastes a bit like cookie dough or something, it hasn’t got a particularly rich buttery shortbread flavour. It doesn’t stand out.★BettysYorkshire Shortbread Box220g, £4.25, bettys.co.ukI don’t like the look of this at all, it looks a bit cheap. There’s nothing really good to say about it. It’s fine, it’s short.★Triple chocolate cookiesMarks & SpencerTriple Belgian Chocolate Chunk Cookies225g, £2, marksandspencer.comLooks appealing. Not too sweet, crumbly and buttery. Quite generous with chocolate chunks.★★★PrewettsRich Triple Chocolate Cookies150g, £2.29, ocado.comA really soft texture, but not in an American cookie kind of way. It has a richer flavour, you can definitely taste all three chocolates.★★★HarrodsAll Butter Triple Chocolate Biscuits250g, £9.95, harrods.comReally short, a crumbly cookie. Not very chocolatey. There’s a slight gingery flavour? It could just be the brown sugar.★★WaitroseSeriously Chocolatey Triple Chocolate Biscuits125g, £2.29, waitrose.comThe taste is of cheap milk chocolate from the dip and then there’s this pretty boring flavourless cookie.★Ginger biscuits      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Kent & FraserSpicy Ginger Crunchy Cookies125g, £2.39, ocado.comA really good ginger nut. Super gingery, almost spicy. Crisp and crunchy. Innocuous, very elegant - you can tell it’s going to be good.★★★★The East India CompanyGinger Nut Sweet Biscuits150g, £5.99, selfridges.comSlight molasses flavour, not very gingery. A bit more like the German lebkuchen - without all the spices, but with the same kind of warmth.★★BelmontGinger Nuts300g, 25p, aldi.co.ukA buttery, crunchy cookie. There’s a tiny bit of ginger at the very end but not much. Really simple, dead sweet. Good for a kid.★Fox’sCrinkle Crunch Ginger200g, 99p, tesco.comThere’s a ginger flavour that lingers, a little hot. A throwaway snack cookie - nothing special. Not particularly enticing, and it’s very thin.★Oaty biscuits      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Taste the DifferenceOat & Treacle Cookies200g, £1.75, sainsburys.co.ukDelicious. A buttery, caramelised brown sugar flavour. Quite porridgey - it has that soaked oat flavour and texture, but it’s still crunchy.★★★McVitie’sHobnobs300g, £1.19, ocado.comThe English standard. It tastes a bit wholesome, good oaty flavour. A tiny bit of salt - an essential part of a good biscuit.★★HarrodsHeritage Oat Biscuit Tin200g, £8.50, harrods.comDefinitely the oatiest. Looks homemade, very pale. There’s a nice oaty taste but it comes after a lot of sugar and fat.★★Selfridges SelectionHoney & Oat Biscuits190g, £3.99, selfridges.comThe strong flavour is of fat - grease and butter. Quite thin. Not particularly oaty or flavourful, just overwhelmingly buttery.★Dark chocolate florentines      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Fortnum & MasonDark Chocolate Piccoli Florentine150g, £7.25, fortnumandmason.comA long chew. Quite cloying and sweet, but the nuts and dark chocolate balance it out. Decadent, you might have one in the evening.★★★BettysFlorentines200g, £11.95, bettys.co.ukSimple. I like that it’s not so sugary. Not much of a chocolate flavour, it tastes like candied fruits.★★★Fudge’sDecadent Dark Chocolate FlorentinesApprox 120g, £2.55, ocado.comNot so sophisticated. The overwhelming flavour is of Christmassy fruitcake, which I kind of like.★★PrestatArtisan Chocolate Florentines225g, £9.95, prestat.co.ukA very buttery Florentine. More like a biscuit, not so chewy and rich. Much stingier on the nuts - they’re sliced really thin.★★lilyvanilli.com
