From the highs of sunshine in Portugal to the lows of a windy day in a grey London. Having run 90 miles in the seven days I was at the 2:09 training camp, it’s perhaps not all that surprising that my legs were apparently staging a bit of a protest yesterday. I’m more than used to the last few miles of an untapered long run feeling hideous, but when you can’t believe how long the mile three seems, something is definitely wrong. The fact that my circular route seemed, against all logic, to be entirely into a brutal headwind did not help. 21 miles progressive became 17 just-about-eeked-out, with a few stops for bouts of self-pity. It’s not ideal five weeks before London, but there’s time next weekend for another, rather pacier, 20+ run, so I’ll have to shrug it off and move on.Anyway, yesterday’s PB hero was my five year old - who broke her PB by nearly 30 seconds at junior parkrun and beat her sister (three years older) into the bargain. Fantastic for her, if not quite so fantastic for sibling harmony ... So over to you. How do you pick yourself up after a bad long run in marathon training? Does it dwell on your mind or are you good at moving, at a quicker pace, onwards? As always, share your top tips, your triumphs and your woes below the line.
