Felicity Lawrence suggests people should reduce meat consumption in favour of soya and meat substitutes but notes this has never been a popular idea (A never-ending love affair?, 10 September). Although she touches on price, sustainability and health, she misses one important point about why people eat and will continue to eat meat – it tastes great. Meat is a delicious and integral part of a varied diet which should also include fish, fruit and vegetables. The NFU wants people to eat more fruit and vegetables – we support the five-a-day campaign – but we also want people to understand the merits of eating a well-balanced diet.The article also looks at intensive farming but fails to acknowledge that some British agricultural land is unsuitable for arable or vegetable crops. This grazing land can only be productively managed with livestock. We are a grass-producing nation so livestock will always have an important role in allowing our pastures to produce healthy, tasty and sought-after products which remain very good value for money.Peter GarbuttChief livestock adviser, NFU• In the hills of Northumberland, and in hillier, wetter areas of the UK, the crop that grows best is grass. People can't eat grass, so we rear animals which can, and then eat them. Many of these sheep and cattle are reared outdoors, for all or much of their lives, and this system of farming helps to maintain the countryside as we know it. Local farmers are starting to turn back to traditional British beef shorthorn cattle, which can be finished off on grass and don't need to be fed indoors on expensive cereal-based fodder for the last few months of their lives. Animals reared humanely, and eaten locally, are important. By all means eat meat in sensible quantities, but better still pay more for the best product, keep farmers farming, and keep the animals in our fields.Bridget GubbinsMorpeth, Northumberland
