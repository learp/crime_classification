A surprise trailer for a sequel to Cloverfield has launched, causing frenzied speculation online.Our pick of 2016's most exciting sci-fi, superhero and fantasy films 10 Cloverfield Lane, directed by Dan Trachtenberg, was previously known as both Valencia and The Cellar and thought to be a short film. But to the surprise of audiences, a trailer revealed on 14 January – attached to prints of Michael Bay’s 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi – was shown to be linked to the 2008 monster movie Cloverfield.“The idea came up a long time ago during production,” producer JJ Abrams said in a statement. “We wanted to make it a blood relative of Cloverfield. The idea was developed over time. We wanted to hold back the title for as long as possible.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The film stars John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and the trailer shows that the found-footage style of Cloverfield has been dropped. An imminent US release date of 11 March has been announced.Before the film was linked to Cloverfield, the plot had been described beginning with a woman waking up in a cellar, to be told that it isn’t safe to leave.“Me and John Goodman were stuck in a bunker together for two months,” Winstead told IGN last year. “It was awesome! He was such an incredible actor to get to act opposite and he’s so perfect for the part because throughout the whole movie you’re wondering if he’s telling the truth, is he trustworthy, is he a nice guy, is he not a nice guy? And it really goes on a rollercoaster of thinking he’s definitely a horrible guy and then no, he’s just misunderstood.”She added: “You’re really just on the ride with my character, in terms of who she can trust in the scenario and if she’s safer with him or safer escaping and battling whatever war is happening or not happening outside. So it’s a pretty interesting one.”10 Cloverfield Lane opens in the US on 11 March and in the UK on 8 April.
