The recipe Peel and thinly slice 2 cloves of garlic. Peel a 40g knob of ginger and cut it into matchsticks. Finely chop 1 medium hot red chilli. Warm 2 tbsp of groundnut oil in a saucepan, add the garlic, ginger and chilli and fry for 2 or 3 minutes over a moderate heat, until the garlic is pale gold.Stir in 2 tsp of yellow mustard seeds. Let them cook for a couple of minutes then stir in 400g of canned, chopped tomatoes and leave to cook for 15 minutes, giving it the occasional stir.Peel 2 medium-sized onions, halve them then cut into thick segments. Cook the onions in 2 tbsp of olive oil until soft then add 1 tsp of cumin seeds and 50g of whole cashew nuts. Fry till the onions are soft and deep gold in colour.Drain and rinse a can of chickpeas and stir into the tomato sauce. Season carefully, then, when piping hot, divide between 2 bowls. Spoon the onion and cashews on top and serve, if you wish, with a little chopped coriander stirred through at the last minute. Enough for 2.The trickWhen cooking the onions, give them enough time to soften and sweeten. They take much longer to take on a deep, caramelised stickiness than most people suggest.The twistChickpeas are cheap and easy to store which is why I use them so often, but other pulses will work here, too. Try butter beans or cannellini, or one of the less usual black-eyed beans instead. Get some greens into the recipe by folding in lightly cooked spinach leaves, squeezed dry and stirred through the sauce at the last moment.Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
