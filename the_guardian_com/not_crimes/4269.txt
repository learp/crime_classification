As the editor of a world literature journal who’s read submissions across all genres for more than six years now, I’m always on the look-out for a certain cosmic echo when one piece of writing rhymes with another from a different continent, confirming our shared humanity. Last week’s poem by Portuguese poet Ana Luísa Amaral, addressed from mother to daughter, is perfectly answered by these elegiac verses by Korean counterpart Moon Taejun, mourning a departed mother and capturing a magnificent stillness.—Lee Yew Leong, Editor-in-Chief, AsymptoteMy Mother’s Prayer BeadsOne day my mother sat blankly as she fingered her cold prayer beads.My mother lowered her head as though mending some frayed clothes. She mustered the flowers, thunders, grasshoppers, and snowstorms; she also called upon my dead granny, me who was ailing, and my maternal uncle who lived afar. Silently, she bound up small scraps of cloth. Then she called upon the terrifying darkness, the valley fog, the roaring fire, and the stars on high. A faint, lengthy song arose from my mother’s bosom like it did when she used to sing me to sleep. She hummed the simplest song that all – the stag beetle, the puny bird, the eight-year-old child, the ninety-year-old granny, the parched verdure, the flock of sheep and its meadow, and creatures with menacing teeth – would know. The song my mother sang was fettered by her cold prayer beads while the things that she called upon spiralled in orderly circles and soared into the glistening winter sky.A Faraway PlaceToday the air teems with words of goodbye.A handful, a handful at a time, I breathe the words of goodbye.A faraway place comes forth.As it pushes me little by little, a faraway place comes forth.I would bring with me the first newly sprouted leaf, her lips, her crimson cheeks, and her beaming eyes that make me shy.The air raises my heart, like a fragile piece of ice, and passes me by.The barren tree sheds and sheds its leaves and the rock governs the dim light of the stone’s shadow.The bench sits at the same spot all day long with a frame on which nobody is seated even now.Hands quivered, eyes damped, and at a loss for words.When everybody speaks of farewells,a faraway place comes forth,somewhere we can hardly fathom.Translated from Korean by Hannah Pang.*****Moon Taejun (b. 1970) began his literary career in 1994.
