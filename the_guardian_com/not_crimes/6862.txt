John Cleese has delivered a damning assessment of James Packer to a packed house at the Sydney Opera House, ahead of the world premiere of Fawlty Towers Live at Sydney’s Roslyn Packer Theatre – a venue named for the Packer family matriarch after a $15m gift from James Packer’s Crown Resorts Foundation.In conversation with radio presenter James Valentine, the veteran comic and performer struck out at moguls who he claimed abused their positions of power, including Rupert Murdoch, Fox News executive Roger Ailes and conservative commentator Piers Morgan.“I’ve come to the conclusion,” he said, “that things are hopeless. And that there’s no way we can ever turn the planet into a sensible, rational, kind affair.”But he reserved particular ire for James Packer.“It makes me almost want to weep when one of the Packers, who inherits this huge amount of money – and what does he do with it? He builds casinos,” Cleese began, to rising applause.“I think that’s preying on people’s weaknesses. Look, if you go to a casino, the odds are you’re going to fucking well lose, aren’t you?Australian billionaire James Packer steps down from Crown Resorts board “I mean, casino owners did not get rich by being successful in the other one’s casino … They’re taking advantage of the fact that people are a little bit stupid and a little bit compulsive – or perhaps addictive – and I think that’s a horrible way to make money.”Asked by Valentine if he wanted to put his thoughts into a satirical film – “there’s 10 minutes of material right there,” Valentine observed – Cleese agreed it could find a place in a stage show or a television series (“hopefully a very funny one”).“If you can use humour to make a serious point, then, by laughing [the audience] acknowledges the validity of the point.” Fawlty Towers Live, written by Cleese and his former wife Connie Booth, has been adapted for the stage from the BBC TV series they co-wrote and starred in, with Blazey Best and Stephen Hall in their former roles as Sybil and Basil Fawlty. The show will tour Australia and New Zealand after its premiere.
