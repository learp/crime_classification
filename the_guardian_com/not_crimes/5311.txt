Miguel has used his Wireless appearance to address the police violence currently plaguing the United States. Speaking at the festival in Finsbury Park, London, the singer broke down in tears as he said: “We can’t let shit just blow over and not take action anymore. Look, our children will inherit this earth when we’re gone. What are we leaving for them? What are we doing for them now, not tomorrow? Now! Now! Now!”Miguel review – intimate electro-funk with a sincerity that connects After wiping tears from his eyes, he added: “I couldn’t sleep last night. And I will not rest. I cannot rest. We cannot rest anymore. We gotta do something. Gotta say something. I’m sorry if I’m preaching to you. But it’s true.”His comments came after a week of violence in the US. On 5 and 6 July, two black men, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, were shot dead by police officers. One day later, during a protest against the killings in Dallas, five white police officers were shot dead by a black sniper Micah Johnson, who was later killed by police.Before his Wireless performance, Miguel had shared the song How Many, which is dedicated to the Black Lives Matter movement.
