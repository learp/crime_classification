1 Young ChekhovDescribed by some critics as a revelatory insight into Chekhov’s early work, there is still time to catch one, two or all three of the plays in this triple offering. All are new versions by David Hare, with typically stylish direction by Jonathan Kent, but if you can only catch one then The Seagull with Olivia Vinall as a heart-breaking Nina, the would-be actor destroyed by the artist she admires, is your best bet. However, there are unexpected pleasures to be found in the other two plays, Platonov and Ivanov, as well.National Theatre: Olivier, SE1, to 8 Oct2 This HouseJames Graham has become the chronicler of UK political life with plays ranging from Monster Raving Loony to this one, which looks back to 1974. At that time, the UK faced economic crisis and parliament had to cope while more in thrall to 19th-century traditions than the needs of a 21st-century country. The play was widely admired on its debut, and this winter, it gets the West End transfer (Garrick Theatre, WC2, 19 Nov to 25 Feb) it missed out on the first time around.Festival Theatre: Minerva, to 29 Oct3 A Gambler’s Guide To DyingOne of the hits of the 2015 Edinburgh fringe, Gary McNair’s monologue is a wonderfully likable and low-key show about what we make of our lives. It tells the story of one boy’s granddad who wins a fortune by betting on the 1966 World Cup and who many years later makes another momentous wager: that he will live to see the year 2000.Lancaster, Sat; Oxford, Wed; Brighton, Thu & Fri4 The EmperorThe Young Vic keeps reminding us why it is London’s most essential theatre with productions that make us look afresh at old stories. It currently has the sellout Yerma with Billie Piper in the main house, but demonstrates its versatility with this Home co-production of Colin Teevan’s stage version of the Ryszard Kapuściński book on the downfall of Haile Selassie. It’s not the first time it has been brought to the stage, but this has the good fortune to boast the remarkable Kathryn Hunter in the lead.Young Vic, SE1, Sat; Home, Manchester, Wed to 8 Oct5 Plastic FigurinesThe New Diorama may not be as familiar as bigger London venues, but it has an essential place in the theatre ecology, particularly in the way it supports theatre-makers at the beginning of their careers. Ella Carmen Greenhill’s play has toured in the north, but might never have found a London berth were it not for this theatre hosting it.The New Diorama Theatre, NW1, Tue to 22 Oct
