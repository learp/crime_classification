Does it do any good signing petitions against various horrors, retweeting and reposting them, donating to them, until you are blue in the face? Sometimes, temporarily swamped and defeated by the volume of horror – wars, famines, refugees, heartless government decisions, dying bees, polluted seas, tortured this that and the other, and mass extinctions – I give up on them in despair, and delete them without looking properly.
