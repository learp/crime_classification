When BBC commentator Christine Still described Simone Biles has “having pretty much everything,” style was one of her primary attributes. If Still was talking about her gymnastic prowess, she has actual style too.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Biles’ trademark ribbons and helix earring.

If she’s so good at gymnastics that she’s patented her own move, her mix of striped ribbons in a ponytail could also be dubbed The Biles. Then there is the helix piercing, something that reveals she is also an American teenager with a crush on Zac Efron as well as a young woman able to win an Olympic gold by a margin of over two points.

But, really, it’s all about that leotard - an item that has new fashion relevance, as worn by Rihanna, Beyonce and Lady Gaga. Biles wears it better than all of them - accessorised with legs so powerful that they help her bounce all over the floor as if made of elastic. The sequinned sleeves - quite Mariah at Vegas - are a nice touch, as are the bright blues and red of the American flag. In fact, it comes with so many crystals that when Biles moves quickly - as she is wont to do - she turns into a something like a comet moving across the galaxy. Even Beyoncé, a superhuman as we all know, can’t do that.
