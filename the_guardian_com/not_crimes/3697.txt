The winner: DisneyThe Jungle Book review – spectacular revival of Disney's family favourite There may have been some nervous times at Disney when it was developing its Jungle Book film in a race with a rival project from Warner Bros, but it’s all smiles now that the numbers are pouring in. Very much in line with the stonking US opening of $103m, Jon Favreau’s live-action/CGI remake of the 1967 animated classic has debuted in the UK with a muscular £9.9m – particularly impressive since the film has not benefited from coinciding with a school holiday. Disney allocated the Easter break to its own Zootropolis, where it shared some of the spoils with DreamWorks Animation’s Kung Fu Panda 3, and it has Alice Through the Looking Glass set for the June half-term. That left no holiday available for The Jungle Book – which Disney is in any case positioning as a “four quadrant”, or all-audience, picture.Disney announced its Jungle Book film was in development in July 2013, with Favreau confirmed as director in November that year. Warner Bros, meanwhile, had announced its own version back in April 2012, although after a couple of false starts attaching a director, it wasn’t until March 2014 that Andy Serkis was announced. The Jungle Book: Origins was originally set for October 2016 release, before being pushed back to October 2017 and then October 2018. Meanwhile, to add to Warner’s woes, Disney has just announced a sequel to its own hit film.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Apt comparison titles for The Jungle Book are not particularly obvious, but Disney’s live-action Cinderella began in March 2015 with £3.8m. Alice in Wonderland debuted in March 2010 with £10.56m.Rapid burnouts for both Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and The Huntsman: Winter’s War mean that Disney also occupies the runner-up spot with its animated hit Zootropolis. The film has reached £20.7m after four weeks of play, matching the lifetime of last year’s Big Hero 6 and edging past Tangled’s final total of £20.5m. Wreck-It Ralph, likewise from Disney Animation, reached £23.8m in the UK. Commercial hopes are likewise high for Disney’s next offering, this time from its Marvel stable: Captain America: Civil War.The crossover hit: Eye in the Sky   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Helen Mirren on Eye in the Sky: ‘You can’t dismiss it as a macho movie about war’ - video interviewWhen Bleecker Street released Eye in the Sky in the US in March, it opted for a platform release, expanding in early April to a modestly wide 1,029 theatres, and achieving $13m so far. The film straddles the space between thriller and adult drama, as military personnel and politicians debate whether to order a drone strike on a terror target in Nairobi that will likely incur loss of civilian life. The morally serious screenplay is by Guy Hibbert (Paul Greengrass’s Omagh) and direction comes from Tsotsi’s Gavin Hood.Eye in the Sky review – warfare drama that thrills without droning on Here in the UK, distributor eOne has tried not to tip the positioning too far in one direction, offering a poster showcasing a critical summary: “A tense, morally complex, extremely prescient thriller.” The danger with this approach is that a film can fall through the gap between two audiences, but this has not happened on this occasion, given a robust £1.11m opening from 428 cinemas. Evidently the combination of the premise’s moral quandary and talent elements including Helen Mirren, Alan Rickman, Aaron Paul and Barkhad Abdi has struck a chord in the UK.By rule of thumb, based on a final projected US box-office total of around $15m, you’d expect a UK gross of £1.5m for Eye in the Sky. Clearly, eOne is going to sail past that total here. It’s a much better outcome than has just been achieved by the same distributor with Jeff Nichols’s Midnight Special – a film walking a tricky line between US indie and genre hybrid, with kidnap, chase thriller and sci-fi elements. That one opened with £497,000 including £31,000 in previews, then dropped a troubling 67% in its second frame, for a 10-day total of £945,000.The Polish hitPolish films released in the UK tend to fall into one of two categories. There are traditional arthouse films playing to the audience that reveres auteur classics such as Krzysztof Kieslowski’s Three Colours trilogy and Pawel Pawlikowski’s Oscar-winning Ida; those ones tend to play in independent cinemas. And then there are the mainstream comedies and action films exclusively targeting the UK’s large Polish population – which are programmed in selected multiplex cinemas.The latest Polish hit – Pitbull: Nowe Porzadki – falls into the latter category. Patryk Vega’s sequel to his 2005 hit Pitbull, Nowe Porzadki (Public Order) is an 18-rated violent thriller that sees two Warsaw police departments forced to work together to target a powerful criminal organisation. Nowe Porzadki has debuted in the UK with a very impressive £146,000 from 32 cinemas, yielding a strong £4,562 average. Past hits targeting the UK’s Polish population include Sztos 2 (Scum 2, but released here as Polish Roulette), which achieved £225,000 in total, and You Are God, which reached £278,000. Nowe Porzadki’s screen average is eclipsed by Tamil actioner Theri (The Spark), which debuts with a very strong £210,000 from 46 cinemas, with previews of £71,000 taking the opening number to £281,000. Theri star Vijay previously was seen in UK cinemas in Kaththi, which debuted with £223,000 including previews of £80,000 back in October 2014.The event: Secret Cinema Presents 28 Days Later   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest 28 Days Later at Secret Cinema: a bloodthirsty attack on the wallet Making it a busy year so far for Secret Cinema, the organisation follows its Tell No One presentation of Doctor Strangelove and its one-off showing of Victoria with its latest offering: Secret Cinema Presents 28 Days Later. The zombie-themed London event has kicked off with £160,000 for its first four days. That gross looks a little down on the Doctor Strangelove run, which averaged £54,000 per day over its first 15 days, and just under £50,000 per day throughout the course of its run (grossing £1.24m in total).The brand extension: The Sweeney: Paris   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The Sweeney: Paris film trailerThe rebranding of Jean Reno French cop thriller Anti Gang as The Sweeney: Paris does not seem to have engaged UK cinemagoers, given its alarmingly tiny theatrical debut of just £60 from six sites, according to official data collector comScore. A happier fate presumably awaits this title on VOD and DVD.The future   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Thanks to the arrival of The Jungle Book, takings are a nifty 41% up on the previous frame, and a very impressive 103% up on the equivalent weekend from 2015, when Fast & Furious 7 remained at the top spot again, and The Child was the biggest new opener. Captain America: Civil War arrives on 29 April, which means that the market is pausing for breath this week, with a number of medium-sized titles jostling for position. Arriving on 20 April is zeitgeist horror Friend Request; then on 22 April, Paris-set actioner Bastille Day (starring Idris Elba and Richard Madden) faces off against Miles Davis biopic Miles Ahead (with Don Cheadle) and western Jane Got a Gun (Natalie Portman, Joel Edgerton, Ewan McGregor). Arthouse alternatives include Louder Than Bombs, plus documentaries Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures and The Divide.
