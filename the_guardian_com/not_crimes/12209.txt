Woodland will be sprayed with insecticide from a helicopter for a second time to wipe out a caterpillar that is destroying the UK's oak trees, despite the government regulator saying in private that such an approach is unlikely to work and could have "serious" effects on other wildlife.Officials were so concerned by the spread of the oak processionary moth – whose caterpillars can cause itchy rashes and sore throats in humans – that last May they undertook aerial spraying to eradicate it from woods near Pangbourne, Berkshire, the only infested site outside London. The moth was first found in England in 2006 and has taken hold in the south-west of the capital.Subsequent Berkshire surveys found no nests but five adult male moths, leading Forestry Commission officials to order another round of aerial spraying of two sites at Sulham woods near Tilehurst in Berkshire that will take place later this month. The caterpillars defoliate oak trees.But documents released under freedom of information rules and seen by the Guardian show that the regulator Natural England does not believe the aerial spraying approach will work and repeated annual spraying would have a serious impact on butterflies in the area.Last year's sites, Herridge's and Broom copses, are home to the silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), white admiral (Limenitis camilla) and scarlet tiger moth (Callimorpha dominula), and Sulham woods is inhabited by priority conservation species including the white-letter hairstreak (Satyrium w-album) and rare moths. And their caterpillars are food sources for birds and other wildlife.Natural England, in a document dated February 2013, said it was concerned the first bout of spraying would set a "dangerous precedent". It warned: "Presumably FC [the Forestry Commission] would be requesting several follow-up spraying events, in an attempt to ensure eradication. This would have a far more serious impact on the Lepidoptera [butterfly] fauna of the wood."The regulator also said it did not believe the aerial spraying would work because it would only hit the tree canopy and not kill any oak processionary moth larvae on leaves further down. "Not all OPM larvae will be feeding in the canopy – oak trees are three-dimensional and leaves will be emerging on branches that are well below the canopy and out of reach of the aerial spray. It seems virtually certain that any larvae feeding below the canopy will therefore be missed by such aerial application of [pesticide] over such a larger area," it said.The pesticide used is a widely used toxin produced by a bacteria that occurs naturally in soil called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)."Our main concern is that we do not think that this approach will succeed in eliminating OPM from this woodland," says the document, which is signed by one of Natural England's senior insect specialists.Ecologists said the Forestry Commission should rethink its plan to spray the woods for a second time.Dr Martin Warren, chief executive of Butterfly Conservation, said: “Aerial spraying is a crude method of control that will cause a huge amount of damage to other wildlife and could harm several threatened butterfly species. We urge the Forestry Commission to rethink their strategy.”The BugLife campaigns officer Vanessa Amaral-Rogers told the BBC: "If oak processionary moths are not present in Sulham woods, other species of native moths such as green tortix will be wiped out in that area for no reason."Efforts to control the caterpillar in London, including spraying Bt at ground level, appear to have been making headway according to the Forestry Commission figures, with the total number of nests down from a peak of 10,163 in 2012 to 4,756 in 2013. Minutes from the oak processionary moth advisory board in February 2014, however, show fears that the spraying could be affecting other caterpillars that are an important food source for blue tits. Experts at the meeting also said efforts should be made to have pharmacists educate the public over the health risks from the caterpillar, in addition to previous work with GPs.The Berkshire aerial spraying will take place later in May, though it is unlikely to be during the week commencing 5 May, a Forestry Commission spokesman said.
