Hilary Mantel has revealed how her childhood was marked by a reluctance to speak, in a provocative essay in which she urges writers that “if you don’t mean your words to breed consequences, don’t write at all”.Writing in the new issue of Index on Censorship’s magazine, Mantel, who has won the Man Booker prize twice for her historical novels set around the life of Thomas Cromwell, says her muteness was “prolonged … to the point of enquiry: ‘Doesn’t she talk, what’s wrong with her?’”, and that “throughout childhood I felt the attraction of sliding back into muteness”. “I could flatter myself by claiming I waited to speak till I had something to say,” she continues. “But I guess our first words are stupid ones … If they asked a silly question at school – what I thought was a silly question – I just didn’t answer. I kept up this recalcitrance till I was 11.”Mantel goes on in the essay to explore censorship, the importance of words, and of standing by what you write. The latter is something she is familiar with, after hitting back when attacked over her lecture about the media portrayal of Kate Middleton three years ago, and during the controversy that followed the broadcast of her short story The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher in 2014.“If you don’t mean your words to breed consequences, don’t write at all; the only tip you can give to a prospective writer is ‘Try to mean what you say’,” writes the novelist in her essay Blot, Erase, Delete, illustrated by Molly Crabapple. “Erasure seems simple – blink and it’s gone, overwrite the line. But nothing ever really goes away. The internet keeps regurgitating you. You can’t bury or burn your traces. They won’t be nibbled by rats, who used to love vellum, or munched by tropical ants, or consumed in the small fires that afflicted archives every few years, leaving scorched and partial truths for historians to frown over.”Mantel also speaks of her time in Saudi Arabia during the 1980s, where censorship was rife, and where efforts were made to eradicate the word “pork” from food packets, “so removing from the world the very idea of pig … The existence of women was tackled by placing them under black curtains. The existence of Israel was tackled by simply leaving it off the maps.”She was reminded of “this army of erasers”, she says, during the EU referendum, when the “urban legend” spread that votes for leave might be rubbed out, if they were made in pencil. “How we laughed! But then as soon as the result was in, millions signed a petition to rub it out and do it again. The bienpensant suggested the result was not binding, but advisory – an opinion they would hardly have offered had the vote gone the other way,” writes Mantel.She also speaks in the piece of how she found it odd that referendum campaigning was suspended, following the murder of the MP Jo Cox. “She was a politician – and so they stopped politics? If a poet died, would you say, ‘Out of respect, ease off the verse?’ If a historian died, would you try to stop events?” writes Mantel in the autumn issue of Index on Censorship magazine. The novelist, whose bestsellers Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies follow the life of Henry VIII’s executed queen Anne Boleyn, goes on to consider censorship and oppression, in the past and today. “When a victim of Henry VIII faced the headsman, the standard scaffold speech praised the king: his justice, his mercy. You didn’t mean this, but you had to think about the people left behind: some flattery might help them. Oppressors don’t just want to do their deed, they want to take a bow: they want their victims to sing their praises,” she writes. “This doesn’t change, and it seems there are no new thoughts, no new struggles with censorship and self-censorship, only the old struggles repeating.”Index on Censorship magazine editor Rachael Jolley said she felt that Mantel’s piece “really nails some important ideas about writing and speaking”.Jolley added: “It reminded me that we don’t always have to speak, that thinking and listening are just as valid. And sometimes people forget that. We have turned into a society that is incessantly talking/emailing/WhatsApping, but are we actually listening to each other? In societies that value freedom of expression, we should also value hearing the thoughts of others. Silence is not offensive, it can be contemplative, and very useful. And she also states that words don’t go away, that the internet keeps regurgitating you. This is something that Europe’s right-to-be-forgotten rules are trying their hardest to work against, when they go back into the archives of a newspaper and insist on eliminating accurate details from our history.”
