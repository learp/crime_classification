      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  LEGO key ring lights, £7.99argos.co.uk and other major retailersAdult: “These are good actually – I’d have one on my keyring so I can see the front door lock at night. Robust, and I like that they have a timed ‘off’ function so you don’t drain the battery instantly. For scale, they are quite a lot bigger than the mini figures.”Child: “Guess which bit lights up! Guess! Do you think it will be the eyes or the legs? Can I put this on my school bag? Can I read under the covers with it tonight?”Adult: “As long as you do it quietly ...”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Joker’s Notorious Lowrider, £54.95shop.lego.comAdult: “This is obviously a more pricey set – good for a birthday. My eight-year-old built it completely by herself, no problem. In fact, I wasn’t allowed to help at all, which was a bit gutting. It looked like fun. Do you think she’d notice if I broke it up and rebuilt it?”Child: “This is a really good set. It took me quite a long time to build. I really like the big books of instructions. It’s got three minifigures. The car is really solid and when it’s done you can properly play with it, it’s not going to break apart.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Minifigures, £2.99argos.co.uk and other major retailersAdult: “Lego minifigures are always a popular pocket-money toy in our house and these are definitely no exception – the kids are really excited to have a full new set to collect from the film. There’s something about these ‘blind bags’ that gets them ridiculously excited.”Child: “How much pocket money do I have left? Can I get another one at the weekend? I really really really wantBatman on holiday!”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Scarecrow Special Delivery, £19.99shop.lego.comChild: “My favourite bit is the pizza sign, which you spin around and it shows the secret compartment. That’s brilliant! I love pizza. The stickers were a bit tricky to put on, but I got help from a grownup. They are quite useful sometimes. It’s got three minifigures including Batman. It says from age seven, but I’m nine and I love it.”Adult: “Good value set, seemed fairly straightforward to build. We had a good 10-minute conversation about what kind of pizza Batman would like best. I’m saying sourdough. He could fly to Naples and pick one up.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Batgirl Batjet Chase, £19.99shop.lego.comChild: “I love this set best of all my Lego. I really love Batgirl; she should have her own film. It took me about 20 minutes to build and I’m not letting my little sister play with it, not even if she cries, OK?”Adult: “She really loves this, she went to sleep with it under her bed last night. It’s actually from the DC Super Hero Girls range – there’s no lack of Lego love from my girls anyway, but it’s good to see them showcasing female figures. And, of course, kids don’t care what range something is from – if it’s a good toy, it’s a good toy.”
