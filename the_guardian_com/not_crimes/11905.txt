What are your current long-term projects?  Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:58pmI will be doing a book about the UK - I've taken a lot of pictures in the last ten years and I'm working towards a big statement about my relationship to Great Britain. But now I am going for a cup of tea. So thank you for your questions.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.02pm GMT14:02slimpanatella asks:Which project do you consider your best work? And which do you consider your weakest?  Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:56pmI'd still say The Last Resort is my best project but I always hope the next one will be equally as memorable. The truth is, that probably ain't going to happen.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.01pm GMT14:01myrtle1 asks:If you had to save one photo book in your collection, which would it be?  Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:55pmI would still take Robert Franks' The Americans - it's the first photo book I bought in 1972 in a bookshop in Manchester and as a compendium of images it's almost impossible to beat.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.00pm GMT14:00Ruudawakening asks:What do all great photographs have in common?

Do you think there’s any sense in this?  Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:54pmI'd say street photography has been street photography for many years. Get out there while you can because sooner or later I'm sure the authorities will stop the ability for you take any photo and do what you like with it – to publish and show it without any recourse – as is the case in many other European countries – such as France and Germany.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.58pm GMT13:58I'm a big "in" person – I love being part of EuropeLiam Cleary asks:EU: in or out?

Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:48pmI was very happy to sign the Guardian and Times letter when the issue of moving the photographic collection from Bradford to London was quite rightly aired and criticised. Hopefully now with the huge response that has been generated, they may reconsider the whole position of the National Media Museum.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.56pm GMT13:56katiemongoose asks:What do you think is the difference between seeing an exhibition and reading the exhibition catalogue? Which do you prefer?  Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:46pmDespite my great love of photo books, there's nothing quite like seeing a good exhibition when it's well hung with a strong narrative. And although the catalogue will act as a souvenir it doesn't have the same impact as seeing the show.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.55pm GMT13:55It's true: I am obsessed with Soviet space dogs. I have a soft spot for Laikakatiemongoose asks:I heard you collect Soviet space dog memorabilia. What’s your favourite item, and which is your favourite dog?  Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:45pmYes, indeed. I am obsessed with spacedog ephemera. And the three dogs you see most of all are Laika, Belka and Strelka – but I have a soft spot for Leica because the poor dog perished and yet still became a national hero in the space race against America. The others came back down! Did you know that the Spacedogs were all stray dogs found in the streets of Moscow because they were thought to be more independent and streetwise. This would apply well to a space capsule - they could also be trained easier.Updatedat 1.55pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.53pm GMT13:53Film or digital? There's no looking backwaltjabsco asks:Someone will ask so I may as well: film or digital?  Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:42pmI wasn't the quickest to change form film to digital - I did so in around 2008 when digital cameras made a huge leap forward with the introduction of the full-frame DSLR and now there's no looking back because the quality is so good. Also I cannot now say that I miss a good photo because I was changing film as now the chip will have space for 500 images.Updatedat 1.56pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.51pm GMT13:51ian healy asks:Do you want your work to be considered documentary, or more in the realm of conceptual visual arts? i mean more like what might be considered “art”  Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:39pmHi Ian. So at heart I have a documentary responsibility to fulfil, but occasionally you can get a photograph that almost transcends that and becomes a memorable image in its own right.Updatedat 1.52pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm GMT13:49Silly Billy asks:How have you gotten away with it?

To me it seems that so many galleries barely pay even token service in this country to the works of some of our greats.  Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:36pmHi SwordofJustice,This is a very good question and you've touched on what I think is an important point – I think things are improving here in the UK, especially now that the Tate has started to embrace photography. But it's still very difficult to get photography reviewed with the same ease that is in the say a country like France. Adrian Searle, for example, has never reviewed a show of mine in the UK. And the Guardian are meant to embrace photography!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.47pm GMT13:47dogsart68 asks:How much does depth of field matter to you? I love using low F-stops, the lower the better. Your work is always so vibrantly coloured. How do you achieve this?  Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:34pmI don't really consider FStops that much. But When I use my macro lens with a ringflash, it's usually in the range of F5.6 – the colour palette was originally thought about with a combination of flash and colour negative film and with the introduction of digital the colours are now less saturated and I'm quite happy about that.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.45pm GMT13:45TopographicalError asks:First of all congrats on The Rhubarb Triangle series – really evocative of the labour that goes into producing the stuff. Do you think The Non-Conformists series would’ve worked as well in colour as they do in black and white?  Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:33pmThe Non-Conformists was done at a time when serious photography was always done in black and white. Colour didn't really take off in the UK until the 80s. So I am happy they were done in black and white and cannot imagine this series being in colour.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.44pm GMT13:44Many people accuse me of being cruel and exploitative … but I'm not interested in doing a PR exercise.coffeebody asks:What do you make of Stuart Freedman’s criticism that “some of [Parr’s work] can come across sometimes as rather cruel”? Is that fair? Do you feel cruel in the work that you do?  Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:32pmMany people accuse me of being cruel and exploitative. I don't see it like that. I get on with people and enjoy their company but I'm not interested in doing a PR exercise. I'm trying to show the world as I find it. So often there is a sense of mischief in that work which other people can see in a different light.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.41pm GMT13:41irapho asks:In the Sooke interview, you also said: “Whether I take a ‘great’ photo is down to luck.” The Rhubarb Triangle is a great oddball “English” story. However, the images are comparatively weak, despite the 100-1 shoot ratio. Was this because “luck” wasn’t with you, or simply that your technique appears to have been absent on this occasion?  Guardian contributor MartinParr1 14 March 2016 1:31pmI'm not particularly engaging with my critics, I'm just telling the truth as I find it.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
