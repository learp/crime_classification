The BeyHive did not take kindly to Trump surrogate Betsy McCaughey calling Hillary Clinton a hypocrite for criticizing Donald Trump’s sexist remarks despite also being a fan of Beyoncé. “Hillary Clinton expresses that she finds the language on that bus horrific,” said McCaughey on CNN on Monday, noting that she herself did not like “rap music”. “But in fact she likes language like this: ‘I came to slay bitch, when he fuck me good, I take his ass to Red Lobster,’” quoting Beyoncé’s song Formation. Rudy Giuliani: I've 'saved more black lives' than Beyoncé “That happens to be a line from Beyoncé, her favorite performer, whom she says she idolizes and would like to imitate,” McCaughey continued. “There’s a lot of hypocrisy of Hillary Clinton expressing such horror.”The former New York lieutenant governor was attempting to defend Trump’s 11-year-old remarks that surfaced in a leaked recording on Friday. In the 2005 Access Hollywood clip, Trump can be heard inside a bus having a lewd conversation with host Billy Bush in which he brags about having sex with married women, claiming they let him do whatever he wants because he’s a celebrity, going so far as being able to “grab them by the pussy”.The video has sparked national outrage and led a number of Republican politicians to withdraw their support from the candidate, while Clinton has gained in the polls.
