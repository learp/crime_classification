The director Kevin Smith has paid tribute to the actor Alan Rickman, who Smith called “one of my favourite people who ever lived”.Smith directed Rickman as the voice of God in his 1999 film, Dogma, and in a Facebook post recounted how Rickman was “the first non-friend who signed up to the flick, but he became a great friend in record time”.

You were never Snape to me as much as you were the adult Harry Potter himself: a bonafide wizard who could conjure absolute magic using merely words. “He was a HUGE cauldron of win, this man. I’ll miss him forever. Rest in Peace, Voice of God. Back to Heaven, where you came from …”On Thursday, Smith shared another behind-the-scenes photo on Twitter to mark the actor’s passing.
