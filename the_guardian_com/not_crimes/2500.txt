If all goes according to others’ plans, Marie will be made redundant at the end of this school term. Then she’ll be invited to reapply for her job – with a pay cut of 23%. That’s a life-changing drop: the kind that might mean missing mortgage payments, or losing her house. What sort of meaningless work does she do to warrant such disregard? She helps schoolchildren to learn.Marie is a teaching assistant, one of 2,700 TAs across County Durham in line for the chop and drop. I met her and three colleagues (none wanted their real names used) last week, at Marie’s house. In one small room there was about 70 years of classroom experience.These are women who teach algebra and French, who look after the coach trips and the school play. The difficult kids spit, swear, even kick them. One morning a mum asked the school if Marie could come round. She was about to kill herself and there was only one woman she wanted to see.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Teaching assistants in County Durham pack out another protest – videoFor all this, these women are paid about £20,000 a year – well below the average British salary. They routinely work early mornings, evenings and weekends – without ever claiming overtime. And at the end of the week they may have to take home memories of kids with cigarette burns inflicted by their parents, or reports of sexual abuse.“You’re a teacher, a social worker, a nurse,” said Marie. “You’re a policewoman. You can be a cook, a cleaner, a friend, a playmate, you can be an ear, you can be a bloody joiner, a decorator.” A couple of months back, a dyslexic boy read in class the words “I, Me, Mine”. Then he turned to her. “I never liked reading before, but I’ve just done reading, haven’t I? I’ve done good for you, haven’t I?”When it comes to TAs or nurses or carers, the British have an iron-clad rule: the people who look after the people we love the most can be treated like dirt. The week Marie celebrated the 25th year of working at the same school, she and her colleagues received the letter explaining how all their living standards were to be ripped to shreds.Some of the TAs stand to lose nearly £5,000 a year. Some are considering other jobs, swapping the education of children for call centres. Jan told me how her daughter, also a teaching assistant, would no longer be able to afford her mortgage, so “in a panic” had sold her starter home.Then Marie said she might have to do the same, while I avoided her eye and studied the family photos. Durham county council’s biggest concession is that it will cut pay by only 10% for any assistant who can work more hours. Such largesse isn’t worth much to Marie, who is wondering how she’ll send her daughter off to university.This is the same council that only three years ago was ridiculed by David Cameron for paying senior councillors thousands in a special clothing allowance. The same council has been slammed for renting unaffordably flash office blocks; and its plan for growth was last year dismissed as “unrealistic” and “excessively optimistic” by planning inspectors.The mining villages and factory towns of County Durham have faced four decades of being either impoverished or ignored by Westminster. Now it’s the suits at the local county hall attacking their own. Their claim is that the swingeing cuts are simply the result of rejigging the contracts of school support staff to bring them in line with other council employees. This follows on from the last restructuring in 2012, which left many TAs worse off.What would you cut? Durham council asks residents to find £100m savings Observers I’ve spoken to reckon the TAs of County Durham already rank among the lowest paid in Britain. If a restructuring is essential, neither they nor I can see any reason why Marie and her colleagues shouldn’t have their jobs regraded and their pay preserved. And I can’t help but wonder if the council would have been so cavalier with a workforce that wasn’t predominantly female.Sold out by a Labour council, the TAs have also been badly let down by their union. The officials of Unison have been painfully slow to organise serious action. In all the months since the pay cut was announced last winter, they have failed so far even to ballot for any kind of industrial action. They now promise to hold one this month – which might yield a strike in October, just two months before the members are all laid off.Aghast at such spinelessness, some councillors have shown the TAs correspondence from paid union representatives. One email suggests a one-off compensation payment that, it promises, would “gain overwhelming support” from the membership. That pledge was made without either the knowledge or the agreement of the TAs I’ve spoken to.At the very point when Unison bureaucrats should have been digging in for the fight of their lives, they have instead spent months drawing up the terms of defeat. Marie’s dad was a union steward for decades, and “he can’t understand it”.The TAs have been forced to fight for themselves. While they may not be militant, they do of course have decades of experience in organising and making something out of nothing. So they hold meetings, at which outside sympathisers expect a few handfuls to turn up. The women pack the halls full.

Photograph: Graham Wood/Getty ImagesThey mount demos outside the council offices, and what should be dull, sparsely attended affairs turn into something more like a sports day, with hundreds of women dancing about. They post songs on YouTube, produce merchandise, collect testimonies from members, and email assistants across the county. In short, they are doing what their union should be doing.This is ingenuity – and huge sacrifice. The women I met last week had been slogging away all summer. They’d been warned repeatedly, both at school and in meetings with the union, to watch themselves – hence the worry about being named in this article. And after spending 40 hours a week organising, Jane had her partner walk out: “He said, ‘You don’t even speak to me any more. You wouldn’t notice if I was here.’ So off he went.”All this reminds me of a famous strike that happened 40 years ago, at Grunwick, north-west London. Back then it was Asian women at a photo-processing plant, who were thought too lowly to treat well and too meek to protest. First six workers walked out, then it was 137. Over two years, under the leadership of Jayaben Desai, they mustered 20,000 supporters – and changed the face of trade unionism in this country.Although she always worried about her English, Desai gave her boss one of the all-time great parting shots: “What you are running here is not a factory, it is a zoo. But in a zoo there are many types of animals. Some are monkeys who can dance on your fingertips, others are lions who can bite your head off. We are those lions, Mr Manager.” Forty years on, here are those lions again.• Contributions to the strike fund can be made here
