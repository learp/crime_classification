I can’t stand Donald Trump but I can stand hypocrisy even less. Are we seriously pretending that the way Trump spoke about women (Apology for sex ‘banter’, 8 October) is some sort of aberration that you’d never find in other powerful, entitled men, whatever their politics? When I was at university I walked out of a dinner party full of public schoolboys who had spent the entire evening discussing the breasts of our fellow undergraduates. The other girls didn’t seem to mind, but I did and I still do. Women – walk out. Men – grow up.Helen CluttonDorchester, Dorset• Could we please have an end to the endless pictures of models with very grim looks on their faces (Vuitton twists a classic to blend fashion with a slice of commerce, 6 October)? The models and clothes would look so much more appealing with a pleasant face, or even a smile, instead of the sour zombie glares.Ann FarringtonLazonby, Cumbria• I have just read the Sport section of Saturday’s Guardian. I cannot find one word – NOT ONE WORD – about women’s sport or any woman playing sport. Really? I guess we are all staying in bed or on our couches for the weekend!Alison ShipwrightDevoran, Cornwall• Steven Woolfe must be grateful for reciprocal EU health agreements (Ukip MEP collapses after ‘confrontation’, 7 October).Toby WoodPeterborough, Cambridgeshire
