Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Abra – Come 4 Me I really love Abra’s voice and her production, and I’ve had the new Princess EP relentlessly on repeat for the last couple of weeks.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Anohni – Watch MeI was lucky enough to go to Anohni’s show at the Barbican in London recently and it was unlike anything I’ve ever seen. I love her music as much for the topics she chooses to cover as for her incredible, haunting vocals.AK Paul – Landcruisin’This evocative and futuristic track marked the beginning of The Paul Institute, which I hope will see the brilliant AK Paul and his brother Jai release loads more music (and soon please!).Anderson Paak – The BirdPaak’s album Malibu has soundtracked a lot of our year so far and this, its opening number, is simply pretty great.
