I love the funny characters Louis Sachar has created – even the trouble-maker Bradley Chalkers. If you’re looking for a book with a misbehaving kid, this is the book for you.Once you’ve finished this book you will begin to want every Louis Sachar book ever written. I would rate this book 10 out of 10!My favourite character in this book is Bradley Chalkers, the most trouble-making, misbehaving fabricator of all time. He never does his homework, he picks fights with girls and never listens to his counsellor. He also lies and sneaks into the girls’ bathroom and scares them witless. You need to keep your eyes on this book.If you enjoy this book this book then you should definitely try another book named Holes, about a boy who was accused of a crime and sent to a prison in another country to dig holes for 18 months or you might like book called The Boy Who Lost His Face.This book would be enjoyed by 7-15 year olds.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
