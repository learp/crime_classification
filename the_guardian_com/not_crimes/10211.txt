Opponents of the government's proposed high-speed rail link from London to the north claim it is a white elephant being pursued on grounds of vanity when proper alternatives have not been considered (Report, 19 July). But we spent the best part of 15 years attempting to transform our busiest railway, the west coast mainline, from Victorian relic to 21st-century marvel. The route modernisation was a disaster, forensically described by your newspaper (The £10bn rail crash, 1 April 2004) as a "saga of incompetence, greed and delusion". Originally predicated on the use of utterly untried signalling technology, the cost soared from £2bn in 1998 to £8.9bn by the time of the project's conclusion in 2009. A brand-new railway could almost certainly have been built for the same money.Opponents of HS2 continue to insist that incremental upgrades are a better option, yet it is hard to conceive of any outcome of that strategy except a continued deterioration in service quality. The supposed £9bn "upgrading" actually gave dozens of stations on the line a worse service than they had previously enjoyed and necessitated the permanent closure of some stations in Staffordshire.Even now, only two years after the project's official completion, the line's principal train operator, Virgin Trains, is bottom of the national punctuality league table, with infrastructure unreliability the overwhelming cause of delay. Rather than dismissing HS2 as a vanity project, the Institute of Economic Affairs and its ilk might do better to wrestle with the thornier question of why Britain is paying such a premium for high-speed rail, a globally proven and increasingly standardised technology.Nick KingsleyIndustry editor, Railway Gazette International• With all of the concerns over HS2, it's time to compare these plans with the decision to not proceed with a third runway at Heathrow. I believe the government has reconfigured its case for HS2 working backwards from a starting point of its rejection of a third runway.Many of the arguments put forward in support of HS2 (national economic growth, environmental concerns, realignment of the north-south divide) are just as easily met by the construction of a third runway, which generates £5bn a year of national economic benefits, is vital for the future success of the UK economy, enables transport links from some UK regions to Heathrow's global network to be restored, provides Britain with the global connectivity it needs to compete with major European countries and would be done in an environmentally sustainable way. Most importantly, it would be financed entirely by the aviation industry, with no taxpayer funding at all.George JeffreyChesham Bois, Buckinghamshire
