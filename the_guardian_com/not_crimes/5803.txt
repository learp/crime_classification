What is it? If you’re looking for a late-flowering evergreen for a shady spot, this could be the one: mahonia (aka Oregon grape) is a family of shrubs that sport sunny yellow flowers loved by pollinators, followed by blue-black berries that the birds will enjoy.Any good varieties? Mahonia × media ‘Charity’ and M. × media ‘Winter Sun’ make a stately 5m x 4m shrub with lily of the valley-scented flowers from November to March. M. ‘Soft Caress’,  a new introduction, flowers from August to October, with spineless leaves and a compact growing style (120cm x 120cm). Looking for something similarly compact, but spring-flowering? Mahonia aquifolium ‘Apollo’ is great for low-maintenance groundcover in smaller gardens.Plant of the week: golden clematis Plant it with? Other winter performers, such as sweet box (sarcococca), hellebores and witch hazel; try planting a ring of crocuses or snowdrops around their feet, too.And where? Mahonias do best in partial or full shade, although I’ve often seen them growing in full sun. They will grow in most soil types, but these woodlanders will appreciate a mulch in early spring.Any drawbacks? Mahonias do have a bit of a reputation as “car park plants”, what with their prickly, litter-snagging foliage.What else can it do? The holly-like leaves are impervious to most pests.
