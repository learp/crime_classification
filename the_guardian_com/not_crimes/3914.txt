Quote of the week comes from Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs, who has formally broken her silence on the deathless Oscars Best Picture cock-up.“What I thought was so important,” declares Cheryl hopefully, “was how, in a matter of minutes, you saw a humanity and a respect and a graciousness from the La La Land film-makers and the Moonlight film-makers, in a way that I thought was very special and very different and showed a Hollywood that we know, that – for all of our challenges in this very complicated business – there is a lot of that. It all came together on a beautiful note and a beautiful ending.”Of all the things you could say about the hilarious conclusion to the Oscars, it’d probably be a while before you alighted on “it all came together on a beautiful note and a beautiful ending”.Still, if Cheryl really hasn’t worked out what happens to her in the next reel, we must wish her luck staying this positive in the months ahead.
