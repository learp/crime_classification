At a recent wet evening in the city of London, there was an interesting meeting of the British branch of the International Women’s Forum. Here were women of any and every age – and, among their number, there were plenty of successful businesswomen, too. The subject under discussion was that well-worn but far-from-resolved question of how to manage motherhood at the same time as enjoying the highly successful businesses and careers which many of those present already had. 50% of babies born in 2017 are expected to live to an impressive 103 I had expected sessions to be all about nannies and boarding school and all the other ways in which women do two things at once. I thought they might also be about how to make fathers do more coping with the kids and, generally speaking, consider the ways in which to work and rear children at the same time. But, to my surprise, none of that was discussed. The focal point was more about how to enjoy both – but not necessarily at the same time.Particularly riveting was a speaker who told us how things are now: that in 2017 people are expected to live longer than ever. And that there are growing numbers of entrepreneurs starting new businesses in their 70s – once their children have well and truly flown the nest. All the predictions say that this is a trend set to continue – 50% of babies born in 2017 are expected to live to an impressive 103 and so it may well be normal for them to start businesses in their 60s or 70s.Men have always done this, of course, but there was speculation that growing numbers of women would become ever more successful – precisely because having learned to cope with children earlier in their lives, they can easily cope with a great deal else.What do you think?
