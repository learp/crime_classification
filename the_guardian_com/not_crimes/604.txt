As an impoverished artist, Vincent van Gogh would probably have made good use of Airbnb in his time, to supplement his meagre income (and pay back his brother Theo …) or even to find a place to stay when hopping around European cities.Now, more than a century after his death, the Dutch master has been reimagined as exactly that, an Airbnb host, by the Art Institute of Chicago, which has created a 3D replica of his Bedroom in Arles painting and posted it on the holiday rentals site.

The room, part of a larger apartment in the River North neighbourhood of Chicago, is big enough to sleep two – and bookings have been swift.
