As a hideaway for those who robbed fat cats to feed the poor, it is perhaps no surprise that a 1,000-year-old oak in Sherwood Forest has won the popular vote for England’s tree of the year.With a girth of ten metres concealing hollow hideaways in its trunk, the mighty Major Oak is reputed to be a bolt-hole of Robin Hood and his gang when fleeing the tyrannical Sheriff of Nottingham.Almost as many stories cling to this ancient tree as acorns (150,000) and persuaded the public to vote it their favourite in a competition organised by the Woodland Trust. For Izi Banton, site manager of Sherwood Forest Country Park, where the oak has slowly grown for nearly 1,000 years, the best story is when she approached it fearing the worst following a huge snowfall.

It was like this tree is special, it had been protected. It felt a bit mystical.”Snow did fall on the tree during the winter of 2010 when a spookily perfect image of Friar Tuck appeared etched in snow on the trunk.The secret of the oak’s longevity is rather less magical: it had the good fortune to grow up alone, without other trees for competition, in a spacious pasture in Sherwood Forest. It also took things steadily, growing very slowly in poor, very acidic soil.In recent decades, the biggest threat was that it would be “killed by kindness,” according to Banton. In 1904, metal chains were attached to its branches, which have now been grown around. At one stage the tree was filled with concrete to support it, while limbs were clad with lead and then fibre-glass. Now, apart from some metal props, “we’re letting it go its slow, graceful way,” said Banton.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Major oak is 1,000 years old and has a 10-metre girth.

All three trees will compete in the European tree of the year contest, which takes place in February next year.
