From the moment Erskine Childers created the British spy novel, in 1903’s The Riddle of the Sands, spying in fiction has been almost the sole preserve of the upper and middle classes. That novel’s hero, Carruthers, is a Foreign Office man who goes off to investigate German naval operations, in his spare time, for a bit of a jolly. And the pattern continues.Richard Hannay in John Buchan’s 1915 The Thirty-Nine Steps is sitting on a comfy mining fortune before getting caught up in the dastardly plans of the Germans. Eric Ambler’s protagonist in 1939’s The Mask of Dimitrios, Charles Latimer, is a novelist – hardly working-class hero material. W Somerset Maugham’s suave Ashenden (1928) is a playwright who swans about hotels in Switzerland, picking up gossip while millions die on the western front. None of these gentleman heroes needed to be spies.With the cold war came a new professionalism and a harder edge – but even then the two dominant fictional spies were James Bond (educated at Eton and Fettes) and George Smiley, who is introduced to us in John le Carré’s Call for the Dead (1961) as having attended an “unimpressive” public school and an “unimpressive” Oxford college. “Unimpressive” just drips with disdain. Poor Smiley, slumming it with the oiks. It shouldn’t be this way – in books or in life, for even MI6 now recognise that they are struggling to recruit from the working class (unsurprising given the lack of role models). We need more working-class spies in books: spies who aren’t old schoolfriends with their colleagues, characters who can undermine any complacency born from the public school upbringing. We need spies who lack the ingrained self-assurance and polish of a wealthy background, who are at home in the deepest, darkest alleyways of society. And most of all, we need spies who are at loggerheads with themselves, whose loyalties are tested beyond the personal and the patriotic, and into the political. Fiction at its best speaks to us about our own society, and not just a society that is defined by its conflict with others. We need to see and feel our own internal divisions. It’s time to bring the working class spy in from the cold.For there are some exceptions. Rudyard Kipling’s Kim (1901) was the most adept of spies – and a rough-sleeping orphan. Like Wiggins (the leader of Sherlock Holmes’s child spy ring, the Baker Street Irregulars), Kim could go everywhere, see everything and not be seen in return – the best of all spies.Yet this baton has rarely been taken up by subsequent espionage writers. Len Deighton’s anonymous spy in 1962’s The Ipcress File – later named Harry Palmer when played by Michael Caine on screen – came from humble beginnings: lacking a “classical education”, living south of the Thames and with “only one” establishment tie. Callan, James Mitchell’s secret service assassin enjoyed some success in the late 60s and early 70s – but Smiley and his “unimpressive” education had by then regained ascendancy on the page and small screen. Little has changed since.When I came up with the idea of taking Conan Doyle’s character Wiggins and placing him at the creation of the real-life secret service in my book The Irregular, it was in large part because I wanted to read a spy novel with a working-class hero. And who would know London better than a one-time street urchin, who could be more in tune with the darker side of the city, and who could be more conflicted when it comes to working for the establishment?It’s not that working-class spies would necessarily be disloyal – rather, their loyalties would be tested. Yes, Le Carré brilliantly mines the moral ambiguities and equivalences of espionage – but his heroes are epitomes of the systems they fight for. Think of the extra moral dimension facing a protagonist who is semi-detached from that system.Some argue that the predominance of upper class types in spy fiction is just a reflection of the real MI6. But whether or not this is true, it misses the point. Spy fiction has the habit of influencing the real practice, as when Le Carré’s nomenclature (“tradecraft”, “mole”) seeped into MI6 parlance. The secret service itself was established in 1909 as a direct response to a “spy fever” – in large part born from the lurid fiction by the likes of Erskine Childers and William Le Queux.Remarkably, less than 10 years after Childers wrote The Riddle of the Sands, two amateur British yachtsmen sponsored by the nascent MI6 were caught off the German coast, spying – in a mission inspired by the book. Which just goes to show how much spy fiction matters. But it’s time to open it up to everyone. It might even make for better spies. It would certainly make for better novels.• HB Lyle’s The Irregular: A Different Class of Spy is published by Hodder & Stoughton on 18 May, £17.99.
