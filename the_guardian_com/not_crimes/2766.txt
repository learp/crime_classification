Once more, dear hipsters, to the Brexit concert – or Bpoplive as it is catchily entitled. This is the event scheduled for 8 May at Birmingham’s 16,000-capacity NEC, which the Grassroots Out campaign promised would intersperse Brexit-pushing speakers with some of “Britain’s hottest artists”.Last week, we detailed the personnel issues facing the organisers, as various acts pulled out once they discovered the nature of the event. Alas, I am afraid there is now more bad news for the six political journalists, five sketchwriters, and two recent head trauma victims who are thus far assumed to have bought tickets for it. In short, the concert is no longer taking place on 8 May. Furthermore, the nice lady at the NEC is unable to tell me when it will take place. Bpoplive seems to have gone down over the showbiz Bermuda Triangle. It is unknown whether Phats and Small managed to eject in time.Of course, it’s too early to call off the search entirely. The possibility of the entire event being rescheduled at this notice for another night at the NEC – or indeed another venue, such as a small pub – must not be discounted. Even so, those keen to listen to 90s one-hit wonders with a side order of George Galloway or Mike Read are warned to prepare for disappointment. The minute Lost in Showbiz knows more, so will you.
