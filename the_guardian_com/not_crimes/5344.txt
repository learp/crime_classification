I remember being scared of the garden when I was a toddler, because it was so vast. Back then, my grandfather used the garden to practise his ideals of working with the land and nature, organic growing and raw foodism. It defined everything he was.When my parents took it over in the 70s, they set up one of the first vegetarian B&Bs in the UK. The guesthouse thrived, and I grew up in a really interesting, buzzing place. My father would bring in magnificent organic vegetables from the garden every day. We went to the market for citrus fruit, but everything else came from the garden.The short period of spare time my parents had each afternoon was for gardening, and they became plant collectors. When I returned home 20 years ago, I wanted to add structure to the garden, so I rented a JCB. My parents were excited about my vision, but it was a challenge.The clash continues today: I might want to landscape an area to make it flow better, but I can’t because prize-winning snowdrops are there. The creation of these plant collections involves so much time and effort, you want to make sure they are not lost. I understand how important it is to conserve them – in fact, it’s part of my need to leave a legacy.The inspiration for my sculpture is the Wye Valley. I missed this place every single minute I was away, and coming back was coming home in every sense – I didn’t want to be anywhere else. I did a lot of landscaping in other people’s gardens, and when I was in those places I was passionate about them, but I was never at peace the way I am here. What I try to express in my art is that sense of connection.Tom Hart Dyke, plant hunter and world gardener, Lullingstone Castle, Kent I love working in the garden at this time of year, when there is a touch of warmth in the sun. I have many trees, so I work with what I have. Once I’ve found my piece of wood, I think about how it is going to perform, or split. The first cuts with the chainsaw are quite easy, but the longer I work on a piece, the more terrifying it becomes, especially if it happens to be a big, old piece of wood I’ve been loving for ages.My favourite spotFrom the summerhouse, you get a fantastic view across the valley. I love it on a grey day when I am not feeling so inspired about the garden itself – I glance over and become captivated by the beautiful Gorillas In The Mist effect.• How does your garden grow?
