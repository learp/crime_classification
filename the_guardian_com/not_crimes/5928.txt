Consumers can expect to see more plaice, cod, haddock and sole on sale in shops and restaurants following recoveries in fish populations around the UK coast and more relaxed catch fish limits as a result of overnight negotiations between EU ministers. From next year, fishermen will be allowed to catch twice as many plaice in the Channel, 15% more cod and 47% more haddock in the North Sea;15% more sole in the western Channel and 20% more Celtic Sea hake.Restrictions on plaice were relaxed after the fish showed a dramatic recovery of around 300% in a decade, attributed to the success of previous quotas. But conservationists warned that lifting limits now could impact negatively on many fragile fish populations still recovering from years of overfishing.“Some quotas continue to allow severe overfishing, threatening the sustainability of the stock and the industry that relies on it,” said Liane Veitch, a scientist for the green legal group ClientEarth.Reaction from the thinktank the Pew Trusts was more guarded, pending disclosure of the scientific evidence on which the decisions were based.“The good news is that ministers adopted many fishing limits in line with the scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES),” said Andrew Clayton, the trust’s fisheries’ project director. “For other stocks, however, ministers exceeded the ICES advice. This makes implementing the CFP [common fisheries policy] more difficult, so it is important that ministers make public the justification for these decisions.”Quotas for fish species such as herring, anchovies and langoustines were tightened by ministers though, in line with the EU’s reformed CFP, which requires all species to be sustainably fished by 2020 at the latest.The news was welcomed by the fishing industry. Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, said: “These quota rises for some of our most important stocks is good news for the industry and underlines the sustainable fishing practices of the Scottish fleet. “Haddock is particularly important for the Scottish industry and this quota increase, along with those for North Sea cod and a number of other species, provides a welcome boost for our fishermen.”The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs credited the substantial quota increases to “tough UK-driven decisions” which it said would improve fish stocks and industry profitability.“By fighting for the fishing industry, and making a clear case for the need for more sustainable fishing, we have got a good deal and shown we can get what we need in Europe,” said George Eustice, the fisheries minister. “That’s just what we’re also doing in this European renegotiation [over EU membership], fighting hard for the UK.”An EU proposal for a total six-month ban on the fishing of severely depleted sea bass populations was whittled down in negotiations to a two-month closure, with exemptions for inshore fisheries during the other four months. Monthly limits will apply for commercial fishing, and there will be a one-a-day rule for recreational anglers.The phasing-in of an embargo on fish discards will also be extended to some species of haddock, whiting and sole from January.

However, there remains a high degree of intransigence between those given the task of planning the way ahead and fishers’ bodies, such as the advisory councils, that should be seen as a natural asset when creating sensible policy. “There remains a real risk that perfectly viable businesses will go under because measures designed to end the practice of dumping fish at sea take no account of the reality on the grounds.”Fish to eatCod Only eat if the stock comes from thenorth-east Arctic or Iceland. Other areas are classed as overfished and unsustainable.Dab Often discarded by fishermen because of its relatively low value, this flatfish is considered relatively abundant.Herring A resilient species. But don’t buy stock from west of Scotland and west of Ireland caught in large nets that ensnare a lot of bycatch (pelagic trawl).Mackerel Returned to the fish-to-eat list in 2013 after signs stocks were recovering. Best when caught with traditional methods including handlines, ringnets and drift nets.Rainbow trout Largely sourced from fish farms in the UK. For wild-caught rainbow trout, ask if the fishery is certified.Fish to avoid Sea bass A tasty white fish, the exact status of stocks is unknown and slow growth and late maturity make the species particularly vulnerable to overexploitation.Whitebait A catch-all term for small fish. Harvesting fish when they are small and young affects the overall growth of the population. These fish are also important prey for other marine species. Atlantic halibut This delicacy has been heavily overfished and is listed as an endangered species. Plaice North Sea stocks are considered sustainable but this flatfish suffers from high discard rates elsewhere.Whiting Mainly a bycatch species that suffers from high discard rates. Ask for and eat fish from trawlers using approved methods to improve selectivity.Source: Marine Conservation Society / fishonline.org
