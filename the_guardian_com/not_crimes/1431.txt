The bossesEric Baker is Viagogo’s charismatic but reclusive founder and chief executive. Born to a wealthy business dynasty in Los Angeles, he was educated at Harvard and Stanford, going on to co-found ticket resale business StubHub with classmate Jeff Fluhr.Fluhr, who owned more shares than his partner, parted company with Baker after the pair fell out, but both became multimillionaires when the company was sold to eBay for $307m (£246m) in 2007.Baker founded Viagogo as a European version of StubHub and moved to London, working out of an expensive apartment in Knightsbridge.One former employee, who worked with him closely, remembers a larger-than-life character: “He’s a very forceful American who says, ‘Let’s go make a billion dollars.’ He sees himself as a consumer champion.”Viagogo's shady reputation grows as it shuns critics In a series of videos on YouTube, the brash but funny entrepreneur can be seen recounting his success in business and advising students on how to follow suit.He owns the Viagogo network through a company called Pugnacious Endeavors, based in Delaware, the US state that is synonymous with financial secrecy.Bakeris rarely seen in public any more, especially since Viagogo started receiving heavy criticism for its practices. His right-hand man in the UK is Ed Parkinson. Far less is known about Parkinson, but he did make a series of television appearances in 2011 and 2012. In one interview with BBC London he was asked if self-regulation in the ticketing industry works. “Absolutely,” he replied.The investorsViagogo’s rapid growth has also attracted some well-known investors, among them the golden couple of tennis, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf. The pair invested in 2009, taking part in a fund-raising that valued the business at $300m. It is likely to be worth much more than that today, meaning investors are sitting on huge gains. AgassiGraf Holdings, which houses the couple’s business and philanthropic interests, did not return requests for comment.Another major investor is Lord Jacob Rothschild, the Eton-educated member of the famous banking dynasty. He too declined a request for comment.Another major investor who did not want to discuss Viagogo is billionaire Bernard Arnault, chief executive of Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, the luxury brands company based in France.Venture capital group Index Ventures ploughed money into Viagogo, under the direction of investment guru Danny Rimer. Index did not return requests for comment. The team of investors is completed by Herbert Kloiber, chairman of German media group Tele Muenchen.
