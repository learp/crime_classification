If only Phil Clapp’s picture of the health of UK cinema exhibition (Netflix is no mortal threat to cinemas, Letters, 27 March) reflected reality. The rising number of screens – mainly at multiplexes – conceals a decline in the number of independent venues, and therefore in choice: only 7% of screens show non-mainstream content. Rising box office receipts are due principally to increased ticket prices, and mask a decline in attendance – thought by market research company IHS to average 18%.The model of cinema that the 20th century left us survives because the major producers need it to promote digital distribution and to be eligible for awards. But empty screens with poor choice, worse food and no social dimension serve no one.It doesn’t have to be like this. If mainstream cinemas were able to respond to their communities’ interests, they might recover the social value that is cinema’s defining characteristic, and fill up again. Community cinemas know this well, of course. This century may be theirs.Christoph WarrackChief executive, Open Cinema• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
