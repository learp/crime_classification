A film based on the Panama Papers is being shopped around Hollywood.The forthcoming book Secrecy World, by Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Jake Bernstein, is set to be adapted into a drama. “For the first time we have an opportunity to see the secrecy world from deep inside,” said Bernstein in a statement about the book. “Just as powerfully, the Panama Papers heralds a new dawn of collaborative journalism whose impact is only beginning.”The book won’t be published until the latter half of 2017, but producers and studios are already being approached about film rights.What are the Panama Papers? A guide to history's biggest data leak Secrecy World will be an account of the story behind the leak of documents that has implicated public figures from David Cameron to Jackie Chan in their use of offshore tax regimes.The project follows the success of Spotlight, the drama based on journalists who uncovered a conspiracy surrounding the Catholic church’s cover-up of paedophile priests in Boston. The film, which starred Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo, won the Oscar for best picture.One movie being tilted to repeat such success this season is Oliver Stone’s Snowden, which stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the former CIA employee and NSA whistleblower.Panama Papers: inside the Guardian’s investigation into offshore secrets
