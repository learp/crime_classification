It’s that time of year again when avid music fans set their Saturday alarms, brave the beardy queues, and fight their way through the racks to get hold of a prized copy of … Aqua’s Barbie Girl. That’s what you’re all most excited about at this year’s Record Store Day, isn’t it? After all, it comes on special bubblegum pink vinyl and everything.And even if you’re not particularly excited by Aqua, there are some treasures to be found at this year’s event – and we’re not just talking about Toto’s Africa being reissued on a disc in the shape of the continent. We mean things such as Johnny Marr rejoining his former band the The to release a new seven-inch single called You Can’t Stop What’s Coming; David Bowie fans being able to pick up a live album or a picture-disc vinyl of his collaboration with Placebo, Without You I’m Nothing; a live album capturing Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band’s 1975 show at Hammersmith Odeon, the band’s first show outside the US; Vangelis’s original futuristic Blade Runner soundtrack; and Iggy Pop putting out a live triple album of his Post Pop Depression show at the Royal Albert Hall, London. Elsewhere, there are goodies to be found by the Cure, Slaves, Johnny Cash, Kate Tempest and even Sting, whose moving Live at the Bataclan show, the first gig at the venue following the Paris attacks in November 2015, is available. But maybe you’re thinking more blue-sky than this? Maybe your tastes are so far outside the box, so wildly ahead of the curve, that you are mocking these obvious choices and planning on out-obscuring everyone. Let us know what’s on your shopping list and why you’re hoping to secure it – we’ll hopefully feature the best choices and stories on Monday.
