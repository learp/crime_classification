You’ll remember Dave’s Epic Strut, even if you’ve tried your damnedest to blank it out. There he went, twerking down the street, shaking his massive prosthetic booty while neatly sidestepping vague accusations of racism before finally swaggering out of the confines of the ad itself and into the This Morning studio, where he allowed Amanda Holden to grope his swollen rump. What was he even selling? Butt implants for men? Oh yes, it was a price-comparison website. Because obviously saving a few quid on your car insurance is a moment of arse-waggling exultation akin to scoring a winning goal at the Nou Camp.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest So how do you follow an advertising phenomenon like Dave? With a builder called Colin on a wrecking ball, but you’ve probably forgotten about him already. So now here’s Gary, a humble bodyguard who can’t resist celebrating his own meagre MoneySuperMarket saving by busting out some breakdance moves at a political rally. Gary is actually played by original Bronx B-boy Mr Wave, whose appearance in the 1984 film Beat Street caused a mass outbreak of dislocated elbows in playgrounds around the world.Now 50, but still as impossibly supple, it’s cheering to see Mr Wave on our screens again. There can’t have been much work around for a professional breakdancer recently and his signature wibbly-wobbly move still makes you grin uncontrollably. But there’s nothing here that’s likely to hit “epic strut” levels of shareability. MoneySupermarket hasn’t created a new meme this time, it’s merely bought up an old one. And that’s not epic, it’s just lazy.
