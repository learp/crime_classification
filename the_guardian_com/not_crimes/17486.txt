Akram Khan: Kaash, LondonIt was back in 2002 that dancer and choreographer Akram Khan presented his first full-length work, Kaash, with designs by Anish Kapoor and a score by Nitin Sawhney. Fourteen years on, Khan has risen to international eminence, his stylistic fusion of contemporary and kathak dance, philosophical instincts and theatrical flair developed through works as varied as Sacred Monsters and Desh. Now, Kaash (the title is Hindi for “if only”) returns to the stage with a superb cast of dancers revisiting Khan’s choreography, which meditates on ideas of creation and destruction, Hindu gods and the physics of black holes.Sadler’s Wells, EC1, Thu to 5 MarImmortal Tango, LondonGerman Cornejo is currently regarded as one of the most versatile and theatrical of tango choreographers.
