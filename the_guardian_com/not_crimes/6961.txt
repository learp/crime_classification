Apichatpong Weerasethakul is an artistA few years ago, a career retrospective of Louise Bourgeois displayed her enormous statues of spiders alongside smaller artefacts such as her woven figures. Her parents were weavers by trade and the spider is a weaver of webs: the whole exhibition uncovered fascinating connections in her work but also showed her constantly busying herself with the act of creation. The Apichatpong Weerasethakul all-nighter did this, too: presenting him as a true artist with a rich and varied body of work, whose short films and experimental commissions return to and refine the same themes as in his feature films. The event reinforced a sense of him as a tireless creator.Apichatpong Weerasethakul: I won't censor my work for Thailand Weerasethakul is radical and politicalThrough the course of his work, Weerasethakul’s sly acts of political resistance start to feel more pointed. The theme of disease crops up in Blissfully Yours and his latest masterpiece, Cemetery of Splendour, which both show ailing bodies struggling to cope in hostile surroundings. Weerasethakul shows migrant workers in a playful skit, Mobile Men (2008), and prods at his country’s subservience in The Anthem (2006), a rhapsodic short film. His response to repression is to exalt powers of the imagination through storytelling, where everything is possible.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Got it all ...

Mysterious Object at Noon (2000), Haunted Houses (2001) and Ghost of Asia (2005) show him working collaboratively, using ordinary people to help him tell supernatural narratives, drawing on folk legend and pop culture. This aspect of Weerasethakul’s work is also properly queer, showing that identity is not decreed by the state or the body, but felt and lived. Weerasethakul can do it allThe variety of the work in the retrospective showed someone with a startling talent, who is able to work on all levels, from the unapologetic experimentalism of Windows (1999) to the rich, classical black and white of Worldly Desires (2005), from the playful (M Hotel, 2011) to the magisterial (Cemetery of Splendour). He is deeply attuned to his era, and thrillingly modern in his eclecticism, but timeless in his freedom.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Collaborative ... Mysterious Object at Noon Photograph: Kick the Machine FilmsCemetery of Splendour is the culmination of his work so farA retrospective of Weerasethakul’s work shows how he has deepened and broadened his themes. Cemetery of Splendour shows him filming his country again with more grace than ever; it reveals him at his most politically fierce and blurs boundaries of identity, of fact and fiction. His work on colour is bolder than ever. At the same time, this can make you fear for what the future holds for him as an artist. If the situation in Thailand is too hostile for him to carry on working there, if he can’t talk about his people and the places that so clearly stimulate his wild imagination, what will he turn to next?
