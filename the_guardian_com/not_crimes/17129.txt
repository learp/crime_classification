Tom Hanks has spoken out about the results of the election, reassuring people that the US has seen difficult times before and is still “the greatest country in the world”.The actor was delivering a speech at a tribute to his career at the Museum of Modern Art in New York when he took the time to deviate and address concerns over the state of America.Michael Moore: Oprah Winfrey or Tom Hanks for US president in 2020 “We are going to be all right,” he said, according to Vulture. “America has been in worse places than we are at right now.” He went on to praise the constitution, saying: “That document is going to protect us, over and over again, whether or not our neighbors preserve and protect and defend it themselves.”Hanks, who previously referred to Donald Trump as “a self-involved gasbag” and publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton, spoke about the importance of still respecting the US.“We may move at a slow pace, but we do have the greatest country in the world, because we are always moving towards a more perfect union,” he said. “That journey never ceases. It never stops. Sometimes, like in a Bruce Springsteen song, one step forward, two steps back. But we still, aggregately, move forward. We, who are a week into wondering what the hell just happened, will continue to move forward. We have to choose to do so. But we will move forward, because if we do not move forward, what is to be said about us?”He also responded to Michael Moore’s suggestion that he would make a great Democratic candidate in 2020, saying he wanted to “strangle” the documentary film-maker.
