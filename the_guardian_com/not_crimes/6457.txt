We’ve come a long way in terms of the gender pay gap, but new research shows women still earn 18% less than men on average. The gap, down from 23% in 2003 and 28% in 1993, has been highlighted by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). It also notes that the difference in pay widens markedly after childbirth (a 30% gap 10 years after giving birth) – with concerns being that women then miss out on pay rises and promotions. It’s a notion supported by a separate report on Tuesday which found male managers are 40% more likely to be promoted than female ones.Women in UK still far adrift on salary and promotion as gender pay gap remains a gulf The government hopes to tackle this with new rules – coming in next April – to force bigger employers to publish their pay gap. Additionally, more free childcare has been introduced, as well as shared parental leave (although campaigners worry too few families can afford for fathers to take it).But is this enough?
