In James Clarke Hook’s sentimental Victorian painting, Word from the Missing, two small children at the water’s edge are holding up a bottle with a message inside, while their weary mother is bent double gathering driftwood for the fire. The picture is pretty but the message grim: their father is missing at sea, and they may never learn his fate.Within the boys’ lifetime, the world of communications would be changed for ever with the laying – 150 years ago – of a 2,754km copper cable linking Europe and America. International messages that would have taken weeks or months to arrive by ship, or in the case of shipwrecks were lost for ever, could be exchanged in a day. The information age had launched. A new exhibition at Guildhall art gallery celebrates this triumph of Victorian engineering with a range of artefacts and rare pictures, including a spectacular shipwreck scene by Thomas Hope McLachlan that has never, to the curators’ best knowledge, been shown before.

The Atlantic Telegraph Company was a joint American and British project, established in 1856 with a working capital of £350,000 that would prove wholly insufficient. The first successful cable connection came in the summer of 1858, on the fifth attempt, but not before the loss of hundreds of miles of expensive cable. It was used to transmit a message between Queen Victoria and the US President James Buchanan. The occasion was a PR triumph but an engineering disaster – the cable was too weak, and failed within weeks. More murderously expensive attempts followed until Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s monster iron ship, the Great Eastern, then the biggest ship in the world, finally got the job done in 1866.

Photograph: Guildhall art galleryMany contemporary artists set out to capture how bewilderingly fast the world was changing, as in William Lionel Wyllie’s Scene on the Lower Thames, with its towering sailing ships and dirty little steamers vying for space on the river. “Art itself was transformed as telegraphic systems were established,” says Caroline Arscott, professor of 19th-century British art at the Courtauld.The exhibition has been created through a suitably Victorian collaboration of art, science and engineering, with the Guildhall gallery working with both King’s College London and the Courtauld Institute.It will feature a machine the Victorians would certainly have loved, the Great Grammatizer, which will scramble and code messages from the public into eccentric poems. This magnificently steampunk machine was the competition-winning creation of Alexandra Bridarolli, a chemist by background with a PhD from UCL in conservation science.• Victorians Decoded is at Guildhall art gallery, London, from 20 September to 22 January.
