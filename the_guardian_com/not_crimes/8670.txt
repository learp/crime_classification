10.00pm BST22:00Join us next week as the candidates take to bikes, have toe-curling sing-songs and buzz, apparently, about as much as dead bees. You can always rely on Lord Sugar for a final sting.Thank you so much for joining us and for all your comments this evening. You’ve all given 110%. Been fishes climbing up trees. Been water in cups, and bottles. And been excellent company. But, don’t forget, you’re not here to make friends.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.57pm BST21:57Jessica calls it. They all seem pretty happy to see the Big K return. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.56pm BST21:56Chin up Mukai. That’s right, not a foot wrong.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.56pm BST21:56Grainne’s got potential, and Karthik’s got a warning: Lord Sugar’s eyes are on him.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.55pm BST21:55I knew it Mukai, you should never have mentioned Italy! And Mr Handbag’s outta there.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.54pm BST21:54He’s like water – it becomes a cup, it becomes a bottle. He’s lean. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.53pm BST21:53As if that wasn’t bad enough, he seems to be confirming that the longer he spends with someone, the greater risk they’re at, or he’s at, or the team’s at, or the clutch bag is at?! I don’t know anymore but … did he mention he nearly made a £1,000 sale?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.53pm BST21:53Hang on, is Karthik seriously telling Lord Sugar that he struggles to work with people more powerful than himself, who he disagrees with?! Surely no amount of nearly sold £1,000 clutches can remedy that? FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.52pm BST21:52I love that Mukai’s now become “Mr Handbag”. He didn’t appreciate the influence he has, Claude thinks. Clearly everyone was going to trust Mr Handbag? Even if he does act like a consultant, or maybe because?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.51pm BST21:51Gosh, yes, isn’t it lucky that Grainne had a bag expert to hold her hand through this? And back to the age-old question: scarves or handbags, scarves or handbags. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.50pm BST21:50Mukai acts like a “consultant”. Is that the ultimate Karren Brady diss?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.49pm BST21:49Okay, Grainne wants to bring Mukai and Karthik back in. Oh no, hold up. Rebecca not Karthik. Oh no, and again, back to lineup number one. Grainne is not making this any easier, is she?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.48pm BST21:48Oooo, a couple of lad-y smirks at the mention of bras in the boardroom there. Bras bras bras bras bras. Is it nearly over yet?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.46pm BST21:46Alright, the window was a mistake, wasn’t it? Plus I would have liked to see Rebecca do her best non-cheesy interpretation of ‘please come inside and buy these handbags, inspired by New York and the Spanish island of Menorca’. I would, in fact, pay good money for that.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.45pm BST21:45Excellent “you’re not exactly Louis Vuitton” takedown from Alan there. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.45pm BST21:45Do you think Lord Sugar records the request for the candidates to come in every week, or do they just play the same one over and over – any signs of ageing?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.44pm BST21:44Back down to earth with a crash, bang, cuppa at the bleak-looking caff that’s probably very nice if the gloomy piano music’s not playing … and Mukai’s still on about that window. Grainne thinks it’s about the handbags. And Karthik’s STILL naffing on about that clutch bag sale that NEVER HAPPENED. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.44pm BST21:44And Courtney’s complaining about how competitive everyone is and then doing an Iago to camera and how much he loves triple firings, because they make his life easier. Apprentice gold.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
