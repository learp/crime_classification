It’s wonderful to read of the success and expansion of the Glasgow Women’s Library as it reaches its 25th birthday (Quiet, please!, G2, 20 September) but surprising to see it described as “the only museum of its kind in the UK”. The Women’s Library, which is now housed in the London School of Economics and celebrates its 90th anniversary in November, is nationally accredited both as an archive and as a museum.Glasgow Women’s Library: a treasure trove that shows how far feminism has come Its manuscript holdings date from the early 19th century to the present day, its printed collections have an even longer chronological span, and its ephemera and museum artefacts, regularly displayed in LSE’s new exhibition space, cover almost every conceivable sphere of female activity and activism. In 2011, some of its holdings were chosen to represent the UK’s outstanding heritage on the Unesco Memory of the World register. Readers can access its catalogues online.Dr Anne Summers Chair, Friends of The Women’s Library
