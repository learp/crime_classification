Guardian contributor BiffyClyro 05 July 2016 1:34pmS: We have slowly grown to enjoy playing in large venues. We still miss the intensity of the smaller shows, but feel we can reach similar heights in a large venue now. It's definitely a different experience, but one that can touch you all the same.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.40pm BST13:40ryanbmuff asks:Hello Mr Clyro, where do you see yourself in 20 years?  Guardian contributor BiffyClyro 05 July 2016 1:33pmS: Mr Clyro replies, I would hope to be in the same stratosphere as a Neil Diamond or a Kenny Rodgers. Perhaps opening for Streisand in Vegas. One can but dream. Thanks so much Mr Troll.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.39pm BST13:39Erin Connolly asks:How many B-sides should we expect to see from Ellipsis?  Guardian contributor BiffyClyro 05 July 2016 1:32pmS: We have recorded 13 B-sides, and unfortunately in this day and age there is no side B for these B-sides. So they will quickly become an album full of A-sides! And yes, they're amazing.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.37pm BST13:37'For our lyrics I make contact with the darkest parts of my life and soul. I want the songs to matter'Glozboy asks:You guys are my favourite lyricists of all time, along with the Smiths. How do you come up with them?  Guardian contributor BiffyClyro 05 July 2016 1:31pmS: For the lyrics I guess I make contact with the darkest parts of my life and soul. And I want the songs to matter. I never want to sing a song for entertainment purposes - music is much too therapeutic for that. Initially the therapy is for myself, I process hard things that happen to me through the songs, and I understand my reactions to events by reflecting through the music. And all I ever want to be is honest. And sometimes I wish I could write happy songs, but for some reason I don't think the human psyche works that way - certainly not mine. What means so much to me is how much the fans pay attention to the lyrics - it gives me confidence and belief in what we do. And that's high praise to be mentioned alongside the Smiths!Updatedat 1.38pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.37pm BST13:37  Simon Neil of Biffy Clyro.

Guardian contributor BiffyClyro 05 July 2016 1:28pmS: No. We didn't know anyone who had released an album when we started, even anyone who played shows or gigs, so we didn't even think we'd release our first album. We knew we'd make music. It's thanks to you guys we've had the chance to make a seventh album.Updatedat 1.56pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.35pm BST13:35Steven Davidson asks:Would you ever take the current working relationship with Mr Vennart to the next level?

And what song?  Guardian contributor BiffyClyro 05 July 2016 1:26pmS: Arca. I'd like him to cover There's No Such Thing As A Jaggy Snake. He's so fucked up - he's has incredible visuals, it's a complete package. It's so uncompromising and avant-garde, and he terrifies me.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.31pm BST13:31stoopid asks:If you were a fan going to one of your gigs and you needed to take a wee.

How long has that been the vision?  Guardian contributor BiffyClyro 05 July 2016 1:25pmS: Since Infinity Land. It became very apparent that I find it easier to write songs with a specific kind of attitude, and I feel like it forces us to evolve and change and never go through the motions. We have an end point to each one - we're in the third version of our band now.Updatedat 1.51pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
