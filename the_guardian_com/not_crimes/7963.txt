For this week’s readers recommend we want your nominations to be songs that capture the mood of a generation, tunes that evoke the spirit of an age, and tips that – as our setter DarceysDad says – show RR themes can mix it with the business end of the alphabet. You have until 11pm on Monday 21 March to post your nomination in the comments.Next week’s playlist will be curated by our new ‘guru’, misterbadexample – aka reader Scott Blair. If you would like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions – and possibly blog about the process/selection here at the Guardian – please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com or make yourself known in the comments.Readers recommend playlist: songs about Ireland Here’s a reminder of the guidelines for RR:• Tell us why it’s a worthy contender.• Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of a song’s words.• Provide a link to the song. We prefer Muzu or YouTube, but Spotify or SoundCloud are fine.• Listen to others people’s suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist.• If you have a good theme, or if you’d like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com• There’s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are “zedded”, at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of “zedded”, “donds” and other strange words used by RR regulars.• Many RR regulars also congregate at the ’Spill blog. We’d like to learn a bit more about you and what you love. So each week, alongside RR, we’ll be asking you to tell us more about the songs you’ve nominated through our GuardianWitness page. We want to hear the stories, see the photos – of gigs, of moments, of your record sleeves – that you associate with the songs you have nominated. You can also share your theme ideas.
