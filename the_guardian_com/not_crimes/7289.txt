Half a century ago this week – taking a last walk with my father before school began and autumn closed in – I made the most stubbornly enduring decision of my life. I asked my father what happened to the sheep we contemplated through the descending dusk. "Well, er – roast lamb, I'm afraid," replied Dad.I think it was the weirdness rather than the cruelty of the idea that made eight-year-old me decide never to eat meat again. We returned to the cottage we had borrowed for summer, which had neither gas nor electricity, and told Mum the news. I ate beans for supper and have been vegetarian ever since."You're a what?" they asked, when I sat down for school lunch with the cheese sandwich and dried banana Mum had prepared, as she would do every morning thereafter, though I never got to eat it: this was long before fashionable abstention from chewing animal flesh and every day boys would kick my packed lunch across the floor until it was inedible. I think the bullying made me stick with it, as much as anything to do with animals.The vile headmaster, a Mr Cooper, wrote to Mum urging help to purge "these nonconformist tendencies". She told him to get lost. My relationship to society, thus forged, has not changed – nor has my diet.Now we learn from leading water scientists in Stockholm that unless the planet's population turns vegetarian by 2050 then it will face catastrophic food shortages. For a number of reasons: climate change, land use, water supply and the fact that the middle class in China and other developing countries, fleetingly enriched by globalised turbo-capitalism, want, bizarrely, to eat like Americans. They think those 36oz steaks gorged until 18oz of them must be thrown away will make them virile, rich and, well, American (while America goes down the pan).So someone celebrating five meat-free decades might feel tempted to indulge in a moment of "told you so". But no, it's been a less decisive trajectory than that.It took another five years for the 1960s to become themselves in London's Notting Hill (when it was Notting Hill) and for other vegetarians to emerge – mostly hippies heeding the call of nature and mantras of India, later ital Rastafari. At last, justification and company! When people asked what kind of "–ist" I was, I could reply "pantheist" without shame. I took nature and animals extremely seriously. I stared at romantic paintings by Samuel Palmer, read Goethe, devoured – as it were – Coleridge, wore canvas shoes, listened to (vegetarian) Hawkwind.And yet: how can you be vegetarian and get arrested at a football match? It was a case to answer, after my detention for trying to climb into the 1971 FA Cup Final, and a later conviction for criminal damage against a small local record shop called Virgin owned by a "sellout hippie" called Branson. Vegetarians weren't supposed to throw ammonia at the National Front and riot police, but I did.I couldn't abide the evangelical vegetarians, nor was I interested in food. I couldn't meditate my way out of a paper bag and never ate at the pioneering Cranks restaurant; I described myself as a beer and chips vegetarian with sag aloo for the odd health kick. I did, however, join the veggie food co-op, secretly ate soya protein and loved Mum's special nut loaf at Christmas, long before Linda McCartney procured either. One's dichotomous identity as a vegetarian rebel wearing leather boots to study philosophy at Oxford needs to ebb and flow rather than make sense.When the 1980s brought Greenpeace, German Greens and Julie Christie's The Animals Film, I figured that, if being vegetarian was "in", I'd be in too, for once in my life. The school bullies' backlash mutated but remained among both yuppies and rednecks: vegetarians were impotent, granola-munching, Quaker queers, etc, etc. Then, in the 1990s, when working life took me to places such as Bosnia, compassionate farming seemed less of a priority and I certainly approved of people eating pigeons while starving under siege in Sarajevo, though not myself, and do not begrudge people their freely farmed lamb roast, though it's not for me.I'm no foodie, but vegetarian life on the road is more interesting than difficult. People presumed the Balkans to be hard, but they had not tried the wild mushrooms, spinach zeljanica or Vlasicki cheese. It helped to be an Italophile: I never envied anyone their veal while eating carciofi alla Giudia; vegetarians can live in Italy for months before anyone notices – I did.The American midwest (unless there are Mexicans around) and France were always a nightmare: I lived on grilled sliced-cheese sandwiches for three months across the Dakotas and Iowa in 1988, and often had "vegetarian" dishes kindly served in Languedoc into which they'd put "a bit of chicken instead of the beef, specially pour vous, monsieur – donc, végétarien". Then there's this macho look you get in Texas, Russia and Arab countries (for all the latter's delicious mezze) that says: "How can you be a vegetarian father? Surely … er … a real man …?"Now, however, the gastronomic descendants of food that got people derided as impotent hippies constitute the mainstream diet of those hedge-fund wives in now ruined Notting Hill – soya, five-a-day organic veg, spelt loaf. Yesterday's alternative cafe is today's ghastly Jamie Oliver shop where WH Smith used to be: similar rough idea but stripped of its politics and tarted up, at a price. For sure, this isn't vegetarianism like it is in Glastonbury: their decadent celebrity cooks gush on about scientifically cooked cod's tongues and boiled bull's bollocks, or whatever. But fried chicken is now for rioting hoodies, BBQ ribs for the plebs, and Olympic Big Macs are for shopaholic inmates of Westfield.However, the husbands of those healthily almost-vegetarian, personally trained wives are directly or indirectly ravaging the planet with corporate lust to such a degree that everyone but them must reportedly turn vegetarian or starve. This is a stark reflection on – and indictment of – what supposedly carnivorous homo sapiens has done to his surroundings and fellow creatures aboard Noah's ark. Flesh-eating has become an expression and part of the wider and catastrophic dysfunction in mankind's relationship to nature.I read two books back to back recently: one was The Goldilocks Enigma by Paul Davies, about how mankind has built – during the 50 years since that walk with my dad – machines enabling him to see the edge of the universe, ergo the beginning of time. The other was The Ages of Gaia by James Lovelock, about how, during those same 50 years, humankind has terminally trashed the only cranny of that universe the telescopes have found so far that is actually alive – the one we live in. Supposedly at the top of the food chain, we are the only species that utterly fails to understand – and is at war with – its habitat.Man doesn't understand what a wolf does when it dummy-runs a herd of deer, so that the weak get caught behind by the real attack, while the strong escape to reproduce food for future wolves. Postmodern capitalist man is not like these hunters with a sense of longterm survival; no, humankind is a self-destructive, Tesco-shelf, couch-carnivore.So, pushing 60, I return to that teenaged pantheism, to time with animals and challenging the basis of man's relationship with them specifically and nature generally, to which being vegetarian is integral, though not the entirety.I found out the other day that some birds migrate by reference to the stars, others to magnetic fields in the earth. Divine, in a way, and how unlike homo capitalistus, supposedly sapiens, gorging on meat from factory-fed lots of tethered cattle or warehouses full of tortured pigs, both pumped with alien hormones.Some god – and atheist humanism for that matter – gave us dominion over the birds and beasts, did he? In order to battery-farm, vivisect, extinguish, cull and kill – in pursuit of this fantasy we call "progress"?A corner of my eight-year-old brain asked a childish version of that question half a century ago. Now, if our claim to be the highest form of life is seriously undermined, on what authority do we put the others into our mouths, chew and swallow them?
