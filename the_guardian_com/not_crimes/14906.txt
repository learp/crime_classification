Ninety-nine percent of the new Walkers advert, you can probably ignore. There’s very little to it: Gary Lineker and Paddy McGuinness take over a cafe in some nondescript commuter town and replace its menu with a series of crisp sarnies in honour of Walkers’ new sandwich-flavoured range. The public come and gawk at the famous people in front of them, McGuinness attempts some clunky retired-sportsman banter, everybody smiles, credits roll. Job done in 30 seconds.But then just as the ad ends, Lineker is forced – maybe at gunpoint, I don’t know – to utter possibly the worst line of advertising copy in the history of the medium. ‘‘Try Walkers’ new sandwich flavours,” he says, his voice quivering with doubt and shame, “and you might end up with a sand wedge of cash.”       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Take me out... Paddy McGuinness in the new Walker crisp advert.Wait. Sorry, Gary? A sand wedge? Of cash? A golf club designed for getting balls out of bunkers, but made entirely of money? That’s what I can win, is it? Or did you mean a wedge of cash, but someone in the office couldn’t resist making a pun on the word “sandwich”, and now you’re stuck here making a fool of yourself on national television? Again? Is that what happened, Gary? ... Gary?
