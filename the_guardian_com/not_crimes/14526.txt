A couple of years ago, I made the dreadful mistake of going out on the town the night before the Golden Globes. It was 100F on the red carpet and the sweat (and alcohol) was pouring out of me. I thought, “I am never going to be this unprepared again.” So the night before, I don’t drink and have an early night so I’m fresh and ready.I work with a stylist called Sabina and she will give me the heads up on current trends. On the day of a big event, it takes me an hour to an hour and a half to get ready. I am told that some actresses literally get out of bed and start getting ready: it’s hair, choosing a dress and then makeup and nails. It’s much more fun for ladies, of course, because they get to wear colour and jewellery; for guys, it’s pretty much a tux and tie. Sabina has taught me how to tie a bow tie, so I am pretty chuffed about that.Golden Globes 2016 ceremony – in pictures For formal occasions, the studio sends a groomer and, to be honest, they don’t usually do much to me – not that I am flawless.

I would prefer to turn up in a pair of jeans and an old shirt, but it’s all about image – the studio wants you to look your best.On the red carpet, one tip is to suck in your cheekbones – apparently it looks better on camera. I don’t know, though, I think a nice smile is best.• David Harewood is supporting World Cancer Day on 4 February, worldcancerday.co.ukThis article was edited on 1 February 2016.
