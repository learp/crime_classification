What was the first ever record or cd you bought? Dukas’ Sorcerer’s Apprentice, 7-inch 45-rpm.

We’re giving you a time machine: what period, or moment in musical history, would you travel to and why? I would have enjoyed seeing Berlioz organising and conducting concerts of his music, and to hear what a really authentic performance sounded like. I’d have loved to have been at the premiere of Romeo and Juliet in Paris on 24 November 1839 and hear how unbelievably strange it would have sounded - Wagner was in the audience.What is the best new piece written in the past 50 years?   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I don’t know whether it’s the best, but a Desert Island disc favourite is Stockhausen’s Momente - a spectacular, life-affirming cantata.
