Your starter for 10 this week is: how many female winners have there been during the 45 series of University Challenge? The answer is 16, with the latest being Hannah Woods, who captained Peterhouse, Cambridge to a stonking victory over St John’s College, Oxford on Monday. As there are four members in a team, the maths experts among you will have already worked out that means there have been 164 successful male finalists – 10 men for every woman. (There’s no great blow for diversity when you look at which universities have dominated, either: the majority (56%) of series have been won by Oxbridge colleges, with Peterhouse’s victory the 25th.)University challenge winnersAmong the most notable female contestants was Gail Trimble, who disrupted the blokishness in 2009 with a mastery of general knowledge that led to her being dubbed the “human Google”. There was one woman on the Leicester University team that won the first series in 1963, but in the majority of years the victorious sides have been made up of four blokes. A particular barren patch saw no female students on winning teams between 1970 and 1983. The high point of gender representation was reached back in 2002 with Somerville College, Oxford – the only champions to have had more than one woman on the team.
