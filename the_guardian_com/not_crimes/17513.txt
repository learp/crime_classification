The LGMC responded in the only way we could: through song.”The chorus’s version of the track, from its forthcoming album, was actually recorded hours before the shooting. Following the unprecedented response to its performance at the vigil, the LGMC – which is Europe’s largest male voice choir – decided to release the track early in honour of the victims of the tragedy.Sharp said: “We were truly overwhelmed by the public response to our performance at the Soho vigil and want to do everything we can to raise money for the victims of the Orlando attack and for victims of LGBT hate crime in the UK.”In the footage, members of the chorus can be seen wiping tears away as the gathered crowd cheers at the end of the emotional performance. “It’s a song that has taken on new meaning for us as a chorus but we hope it sends out a message of love and support to all of our LGBT brothers and sisters and our straight allies across the world,” Sharp said.The chairman of the LGMC, John D Carrion, added: “The LGMC believes passionately that music has the power to heal and to inspire, to lift souls and to unite people in times of joy and sorrow.“The Orlando attack was an act of hatred directed towards the LGBT community and we want to combat this hate with a message of love, hope and solidarity. The response to our performance at the vigil has been incredibly overwhelming and humbling for all of our members.”This digital­-only release will be available to purchase or stream on all major platforms including iTunes, Amazon Music, Google Play, Spotify, Deezer and Tidal.
