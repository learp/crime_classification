First shown at London’s Barbican and now in Manchester, it presents a view of the UK that’s both odd and poignantly ordinary. Manchester Art Gallery, to 29 MayRobert RauschenbergThis new retrospective at Tate Modern, SE1, is the first major Rauschenberg exhibition in the UK for 35 years; surprising, given how vital and influential the US pop artist’s work now feels. The show includes 1959’s startling Monogram, featuring a stuffed goat girthed by a tyre, along with video of his pioneering fusions of visual art with dance and technology.

Heaven, WC2N, 30 NovTheatreLicensed To Ill      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the GuardianWith Hamilton validating the concept of a rap musical, this lo-fi (and unofficial) attempt to do a Jersey Boys with the Beastie Boys gets a run in London following a successful debut at Camden People’s Theatre last year.

Plenty of favourites have been exhumed for this anniversary tour, but the duo’s penchant for competitive improvisation should ward off cosy nostalgia.

Now MTV has undergone another transformation, into – gasp! – a serious news media organisation. OK, that’s overstating things a little: the channel’s Teen Mom-saturated TV schedules remain. Yet it’s a different story over on MTV’s website, which offers up some excellent US election coverage – including Brian Phillips’s fine essay on how the Republicans became postmodern, as well as a strong roster of podcasts covering everything from feminism to film to, yep, music.BBC1 follows Netflix true crime lead with Notting Hill serial killer drama TelevisionRillington PlaceJohn Christie murdered eight women in his west London flat in the 1940s and 50s.
