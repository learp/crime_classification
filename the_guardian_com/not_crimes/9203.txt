Less than half of all women in England are still breastfeeding two months after giving birth, according to data from the NHS and Public Health England (PHE).'An unrealistic pressure': mothers on what it's like to breastfeed Both the PHE and the World Health Organisation recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months because it helps babies’ immune systems, but most women had stopped after two months.Five hundred mothers participated in the survey, which discovered that their fears about breastfeeding included it being painful (74%), preventing them from taking medication (71%) and being embarrassed in front of strangers (63%). According to the WHO, breastfeeding should form part of a baby’s diet up to two years old or beyond. However, a study published in the Lancet last year found the UK had the lowest rate of breastfeeding in the world.Share your experiencesDid you find it difficult to exclusively breastfeed for the first six months?
