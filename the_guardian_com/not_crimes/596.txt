In 2011, Wes Craven decided to add a fourth instalment to the hugely successful late-90s slasher satire Scream. It was far too knowing: while the key to the original franchise had been not only its jumpy scares but its meta-ness, by Scream 4 things had become overly self-referential, with horror tropes running about like screaming teenagers. Plus, half the gags revolved around Facebook, Twitter and the rise of Saw-style torture-porn flicks. Scream had effectively become Scary Movie. When it was announced that MTV was rebooting the franchise with former Disney star Bella Thorne, it seemed that Scream might just become Gossip Girl with actual backstabbing. Indeed, season one set out a pretty similar stall to Sidney and co’s less successful adventures. Alongside Emma Duval (played by Willa Fitzgerald), a pretty teen with a penchant for answering calls from private numbers, there were updated twists that were about as subtle as a 50ft sign spelling “Snapchat” in blood. There was a visiting blogger, Piper, who turned up in Lakewood to investigate historic murderer Brandon James; a cyberbullying plot; and even a dash of slut-shaming when a video of two girls getting off in a car went viral. Siri contributed to the show’s first death, and horror fan Noah hosts his own crime podcast, The Morgue. So far, so Noughteens.

There was time in season one to build up empathy for Will, who became embroiled in a blackmail plot that went a shade too far. You cared about Emma enough to feel truly shocked when it transpired that her mum had been playing with the truth about her family’s connection to the Brandon James killings. And you wondered whether overzealous English teacher Mr Branson, or even Emma’s iron-jawed bf Kieran could be the killer – and then you wondered again.The murderous game of Guess Who? was preserved, but clues were drip-fed with each instalment rather than being revealed all at once. In the age of binge-watching, it was also a novelty to have a thriller you were forced to savour: unlike the majority of its other shows, Netflix released the show on a weekly basis. It also helped that Thorne’s appearance was essentially a cameo, so there were no big teen names (bar perhaps Arrow’s Bex Taylor-Klaus) here to distract from the authentic small town feel.

Emma’s post-traumatic stress disorder – sustained after a particularly horrific episode with season one’s text-happy killer – has been fleshed-out, and her stay on a psychiatric ward alluded to with disturbing dream sequences and bumpy camera work. Another character, Zoe, admitted that she had also had to leave school due to mental health issues not – as previously claimed – for a science camp. Domestic abuse even became part of the narrative when Emma discovered yet more insalubrious things about her family’s past. The slow-burning psychological aspect is key here, with a recent episode dedicated entirely to watching the pals undergo ayahuasca-induced hallucinations which only intensified Emma’s trauma. Indeed, she is even shown donning the Brandon James mask in the trailer, which begs the question: could our troubled heroine also end up a suspect?Scream of laughter: how today's best-loved pop culture grew from parody As we near the season finale, the pals are running straight back towards the danger, as Neve Campbell’s Sidney did all those years ago. However, that’s where the similarities end. You could see Scream’s 2016-ready plots as an affront to the legacy of a brilliant, subversive, horror franchise, or – as I do – a necessary part of a distinctive new saga that delves deeper into its characters’ backstories than ever. In Scream 4, Sidney says the first rule of remakes is “Don’t fuck with the original” – something that this new Scream is in no danger of doing, given that it’s a fresh proposition with only hints of Woodsboro-themed homage. That said, can someone tell the killer to give those gifs a rest?
