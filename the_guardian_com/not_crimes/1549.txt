Of course it makes sense that Alessandro Michele would have a wild-animal fetish: the Gucci demigod’s aesthetic persona is equal parts cowardly lion, Victorian dandy and Kings of Leon four albums ago. The spring/summer campaign shot by Glen Luchford is no Kenzo-lite; instead, it’s a beautiful diorama of hipsters with added wild beasts. The moodboard here is very “Mowgli from The Jungle Book moved to Brooklyn and brought his furry friends with him”. Stylewatch did a bit of a double-take, we have to admit, when we realised that the sleek tiger and giraffe prints existed on actual tigers and giraffes. The clothes are peak-Michele, with a soupçon of 80s about them: sweatshirts in Molly Ringwald pink, T-shirts emblazoned with retro logos and Freddy Krueger-cut suit jackets. And if there is a sense of the familiar about it – Gucci, like Westworld, is stuck in a narrative loop – we want to go there.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘No Kenzo-lite’ ...
