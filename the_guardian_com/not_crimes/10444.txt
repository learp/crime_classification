“Just as topographical London is a vast 20-mile saucer of people with a rim of low hills, so human London is a central goulash with its rightful inhabitants forming an unfashionable rim.”Ian Nairn’s charming, idiosyncratic and memorable guide to London turned 50 this week, and was republished as a Pengiun Modern Classic in 2014. Nairn’s reputation as an iconoclastic architecture critic has soared in recent years, as writers such as Owen Hatherley have paid tribute to the master. Nairn’s London: a grand unflattering tour of the capital in the 50s Nairn’s guide to London is a deeply personal one. He finds room to mention 27 different pubs, but has nothing to say about the Royal Festival Hall, bar the mere fact it exists.And of course, some buildings have changed since Nairn’s day. Fifty years ago, he described St Pancras station as “a vast throbbing hangar; the phrase needs to be repeated 16 times to make enough weight in the book and convey the overwhelming solid force of this beginning or end to journeys.” What would he have made of the remodelled station, with its clean upper level and shopping mall below?In this spirit, we’d like to hear your views on your own favourite London buildings. Share a photo of a building with GuardianWitness and tell us why it moves you. You can talk about buildings Nairn himself wrote about - though of course, not all have survived until 2016 - or entirely new ones.
