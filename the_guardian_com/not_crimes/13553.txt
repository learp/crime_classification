In afternoon sun dozens of both red admiral and comma butterflies swoop and glide between beds of Michaelmas daisy and the drifts of apples beneath trees in our steep orchard. The butterflies pitch on and sip the fermenting fruit of Pig's Nose, Venus Pippin and Rattler. These early varieties were the main ingredients of juice that was pressed, bottled and pasteurised for us at Greenbank near Halton Quay. Included in the bags and boxes of fruit were striped Hereford Pippin, scarlet Duchess's Favourite and the crimson Queen's. Bittersweet Gooch, Hocking's Green and the small Fern Pippin fell early and unripe, and may keep on the ground to provide a feast for visiting redwing and fieldfare as they did three winters ago. Tawny owls are heard at night as they hunt the mice that nibble fallen fruit, and deer have browsed leaves from the lowest branches. Mistletoe has at last established and produced berries for the first time, but not on those trees originally rubbed with sticky seeds gleaned from the orchard at Cotehele. Blackbirds are remarkably absent as they were earlier in the year when cherry trees, planted 35 years ago, were loaded with the sweet black fruit of Burcombe, Bullion and Birchenhayes, once grown commercially in the valley.In this fruitful autumn my sister and brother-in-law have enough ripe Colloggetts to make gallons of the legendary "champagne cider", or "ladies' cider", wistfully remembered by elderly farmers when the pair began on their mission to preserve local varieties. Meanwhile the farming cycle starts again. Corn is harvested, livestock markets are full of store cattle and sheep, dung is spread, arrishes (stubble fields) have been ploughed and seeded to winter corn, with the earth now dark after rain. We await the ripening of Tommy Knight and other late apples for a final batch of juice. It will have to last if next year's crop is as poor as that of 2012.
