The palatial interiors of Waddesdon Manor, a Rothschild mansion in Buckinghamshire stuffed with treasures once owned by emperors and queens – and now owned by the National Trust – have been recreated in gingerbread and sugar icing for Christmas.The miniature rooms are detailed down to the Sevres and Meissen porcelain set out on the dining room table for a banquet, the festoons of silk brocade in the grandest bedroom where Queen Victoria took a nap, and the views of 18th-century Venice by Francesco Guardi on the panelled walls of the east gallery.

The property, with installations by the light sculptor Bruce Munro, will be open until 2 January.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   One of Bruce Munro’s installations.
