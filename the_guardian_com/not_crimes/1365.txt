Former BBC Breakfast presenter Bill Turnbull has revealed he had the show’s famous red sofa customised for his own comfort.Turnbull left the show in February, with Dan Walker taking his seat on the sofa.He told the Radio Times: “I complained that the old sofa gave me a bad back, so they measured me for a new tailor-made one.”Thirty years of the TV sofa: from political strategy to sexism He insisted it was not a waste of money, saying: “None of us took any time off with bad backs and the audience kept going up.“It was ergonomic with a little backrest to lean against so you didn’t slouch.“It was the perfect height for me, so I’m not sure how it’s going to be for everybody else now I’ve gone. I have a quick look occasionally and they seem to be doing all right.”The broadcaster also praised the decision to move BBC Breakfast to Salford in 2012.“It was a shock and huge upheaval for so many, so it wasn’t surprising that some were reluctant, and then resentful because they felt it had been forced on them,” he said.“But I thought it was great – regionalisation has helped put the British back into the BBC. Taking three hours of news and current affairs programming out of London was a risk, but we made it work.“People were waiting for it to fail and it didn’t.”
