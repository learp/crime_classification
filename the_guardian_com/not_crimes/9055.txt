How do you debut the best album of all time? If you’re Kanye West – who described his forthcoming seventh album, Swish, as exactly that – the answer is most likely with a fashion, art and music multimedia extravaganza broadcast live from New York’s Madison Square Garden to cinemas around the world.Kanye West completes work on 'the best album of all time' The Cineworld website promises “a suitably spectacular unveiling [of Swish] in its entirety at Madison Square Garden with a performance by [West’s] visual art collaborator Vanessa Beecroft”. West’s representatives have told the fashion press that his show for Yeezy, his clothing label with Adidas, is likely to take place on 11 February, the day the album is released and two days into New York fashion week. The new clothes collection and album are expected to debut together. West has debuted new songs at each of his previous two fashion shows: the album’s concluding song, Wolves, a year ago and Fade for his SS16 presentation. In both cases, the music received more favourable reviews than the clothes. It has not been announced whether West will perform or play the album at the fashion show. On Tuesday, he further stokes anticipation for the record by tweeting “This is not album of the year. This is album of the life.” KANYE WEST (@kanyewest)This is not album of the year.
