9.59pm BST21:59In true Eurotrash fashion, the episode closes with a bad pop song performed by a European woman in barely any clothes. And now it’s finished. Well, that existed. BYE.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.58pm BST21:58Inspired, Gautier and de Caunes are replicating the stunt by wearing boxes over their penises and letting the artist grab at them. I’m convinced. We should remain in Europe.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.56pm BST21:56Now to Germany, where a Swiss performance artist makes a point about female sexual agency by wearing a box over her breasts and asking people to reach inside and touch them. But this is Eurotrash, so her sincere explanation is accompanied by the sound of a honking bicycle horn. And now I’m onboard again.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.53pm BST21:53We’re now being treated to a Lolo Ferrari retrospective. She had big boobs and then she died. It was a tragic story, and one once dealt with in a Eurotrash special. This time, though, it’s just a series of clips of a woman with big boobs saying things in a funny accent.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.51pm BST21:51Last segment now. Here’s a man called Prickasso who paints things with his arse and cock. He’s Australian. This is Europe in 2016: a place so deprived of silly nudity that we need to outsource to the colonies. If that’s not an argument for Brexit, then I don’t know what is.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.48pm BST21:48Incidentally, if you’re also finding Eurotrash a bit low on graphic depictions of depressing body parts, why not literally spend 45 seconds on the internet. The internet: Eurotrash, but slightly more so.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.46pm BST21:46I told you this was going to be impossible to liveblog, didn’t I?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.43pm BST21:43I looked down while I was typing that last entry, and when I looked up there was a naked man lying on an inflatable bed, eating worms and singing a song about how much he likes maggots. I think I’m going to have to watch this back tomorrow morning.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.41pm BST21:41Here’s Eddie Izzard, brought on to free-associate about nothing in an unfunny way for 30 seconds. Like I’m one to judge.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.40pm BST21:40I hope you’re all actually watching this and not just reading the liveblog. I just read the last three entries back and it sounds like I ran headfirst into a wall.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.39pm BST21:39This is something bordering on a serious message: Antoine de Caunes is explaining that life is short and happiness is fleeting and we shouldn’t judge anyone for how to chose their life. Which is a wonderful thing to say, except it’s immediately followed by a naked woman with a chicken beak.

We’re being treated to a full montage of nudity, and men who derive sexual pleasure by wearing inflatable PVC catsuits, and men who get off on smelling shoes, and more nudity.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.33pm BST21:33They’re dressed as Charles and Camilla now! ‘Please bring back that big redhead Fergie’ they say. Then they say the word ‘sex’ three times in a row and pull a funny face.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.30pm BST21:30I just want Antoine de Caunes to do alliteration and waggle his eyebrows at the camera. Remember his chatshow? I sort of wish Channel 4 had brought that back instead.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
