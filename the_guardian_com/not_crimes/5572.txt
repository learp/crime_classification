My heart hammers furiously against my chest as I desperately try to calm my breathing. My palms are hot and clammy, and I can feel the sweat forming beads on the back of my neck. Outwardly, I somehow manage to look vaguely confident and relaxed, though I know tears lurk just below the surface, waiting for their chance to escape. Nobody wishes me good luck: they tell me I don’t need it. That I can’t possibly be nervous, that I just want attention. They think that because my grades are high, I am exempt from any fear or anxiety. I wish that were true. If I come out of this with anything less than top marks, I know exactly what the reactions will be: Look who I did better than, accompanied by laughter. But of course, I cannot speak a word of complaint without being pounced upon. You can’t complain, they’ll tell me. Anyone else would be happy with that, don’t be so mean. They don’t understand, or they simply refuse to. They don’t have to cope with the incessant questions over why something wasn’t perfection, the feeling of complete and utter failure. Teachers will think I haven’t tried, that I don’t care.  Yet if I do well, I cannot be happy. Don’t rub it in, they’ll exclaim. No matter what the outcome, I cannot win. How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? With every second, the exam ticks closer. I can feel its breath hot against my heels now, its jaws snapping in anticipation. I want to scream, to cry, to be sick, but I have to keep it all in. My breaths are coming, faster, more frantically, in a vain attempt to outrun the beast. And all the pressure, and the hopes, and the expectations which rise with every good grade are rising up to swallow me whole. I can’t breathe, I can’t think. I’m drowning, tugged deeper by the weight of it all like an anchor, sinking. And nobody can ever know. Are you a budding writer or poet? Join the Children’s books site and send us your scribblings!
