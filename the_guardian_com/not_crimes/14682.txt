The Critics’ Choice awards are chosen by the more than 300 members of the Broadcast Film Critics Association (BFCA). Although its members are not usually part of the same guilds that pick nominees and winners for most of Hollywood’s awards shows, the critics’ awards help to build the buzz for potential Oscar front-runners.
