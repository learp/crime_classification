In the frenzy of harvesting, watering and pruning at high summer, it’s easy for foodie growers to assume the days of seed sowing are months behind us. Yet planting some crops now can actually give you measurably improved results in terms of quality, flavour and nutrition, not to mention greatly extending your harvest season. Here are my top three crops that are best to sow right now.Healthier beetrootBeets are enjoying a huge spike in culinary popularity. Arguably this is at least partly due to their intriguing health benefits, derived from the dietary nitrate that beets are so rich in. A growing body of research suggests that the ability of this substance to relax blood vessels may help reduce blood pressure, improve circulation and even boost athletic performance. Simply sowing beets after midsummer can measurably increase the amount of dietary nitrate your harvests will contain. Couple this with generous applications of a high- nitrogen fertiliser such as chicken manure (plants create nitrates using soil nitrogen as a building block) and you could get beets with 300% more of the good stuff. Good choices include ‘Red Ace’ and ‘Bull’s Blood’. Planting some crops now can give you improved results in terms of quality, flavour and nutrition Sweeter carrotsThe flavour of carrots is created largely by a balance of natural sugars and a group of chemicals called terpenes, which provide them with their metallic, slightly turpentine-like notes. These are believed to be produced by plants to defend them against insect attack, and the hotter the weather the more they generate.Sowing carrot seed in June and July means the roots mature in the cooler months of the year, thereby producing fewer terpenes at harvest time. This makes the carrots taste far sweeter without actually upping their sugar levels. In some Scandinavian countries late-season carrots are sold at a premium for this very reason. Try ‘Autumn King’ or ‘Purple Sun’.Lusher Chinese greensFrom pak choi and Chinese broccoli to mooli and chop-suey greens, a whole host of oriental vegetables are extremely prone to bolting if sown before midsummer. This is because internal chemical timers within the plants are capable of detecting increasing day length. From this information the plant is able to sense it has enough time to set seed before winter and takes advantage of the situation as soon as possible. Energies are diverted away from vegetative growth, leaving you with runty, fibrous and bitter-tasting leaves. Planting them right now, however, causes plants to direct energies into leafy growth in order to stockpile energy to flower and seed next year, making for larger, lusher, tastier harvests.Email James at james.wong@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @Botanygeek
