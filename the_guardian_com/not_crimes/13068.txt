He wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily that retaking Palmyra was “an important victory for culture … But this victory has not made Bashar al-Assad and his backers the saviours of cultural heritage.“Assad’s soldiers too plundered the ruins of Palmyra before the Isis takeover, and their rockets and grenades indiscriminately pounded the antique columns and walls when this promised even the slightest military advantage.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A Syrian government army officer guards the Temple of Bel.
