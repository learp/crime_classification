I was going to write about the Ten Style Rules You Need to Know This Summer, but then I realised that there is only one that really matters. Swapping your white work shirt for a blue one and showing your shoulders instead of your legs is good-to-know, but hardly deal-breaking. There is just one diktat that you need to pay attention to. It is this: no flip-flops.The flip-flop is the new dad jeans. It’s a red flag that unwittingly marks out your look as past its sell-by date. You might as well go out with your midi skirt caught in your knickers. Are you getting the picture yet?I know what you’re thinking: but I only wear them on holiday, and surely that’s allowed? Well, no. In the olden days, when photos from your holidays were something that you made your mum look through, your holiday wardrobe was between you and your conscience. But in 2016, holiday photos are a matter of public record. We’ve all been there: bit bored, wasting time on the internet, and before you know it you’re looking at your ex-colleague’s album from her trip to Mexico in 2011. If you take your phone on holiday, then what you wear on the beach follows you back to the real world.Anyway, if flip-flops had stayed on the beach, it might never have come to this. But since the mid-1990s, they have infiltrated urban life. What was once a generic, replaceable, functional beach shoe became a deliberate badge of laid-back cool. In the noughties, as soon as the sun came out, you put on your oversized bug-eyed shades, slipped on your Havaiana flip-flops and stopped off for a frappuccino, secure in the knowledge that you were living the lifestyle of dreams.

Photograph: Alessandro Lucioni/Rex/ShutterstockThe flip-flop trend rose in the slipstream of holidays becoming a lifestyle statement, and the cult of the boutique hotel. It is easy to forget, in the age of waist-trainers and contouring, of 6am workouts and over use of the muscle-arm emoji, that there was a time at the beginning of this century when the gold standard was being a laid-back, toes-in-the-golden-sand, beachy-waved natural beauty. A pair of perfectly pedicured feet with Chanel Rouge Noir-polished toes in flip-flops was a glossy-magazine standby signifying summery perfection. Peak flip-flop was reached in 2009, the year in which Halle Berry wore them on the red carpet for the premiere of The Soloist, and Brides magazine featured white Havaianas as the perfect beach wedding shoe, styled with a floorlength lace gown and veil.The modern story of flip-flops is the story of the Havaiana. In the mid 1990s, a utilitarian brand of sturdy rubber sandals worn by Brazilians repositioned itself as a premium brand, selling itself internationally on a platform of Brazilian beach glamour. The tiny Brazil flag on the moulded plastic of a Havaiana became an accessible piece of jet-set glamour, as essential to a capsule beach wardrobe of its time as a string bikini and a sarong. Havaiana still owns the lucrative flip-flop market, and has been smart about keeping the brand flag flying, with innovations such as a sandal-vending machine in World Square shopping mall in Sydney. But in a clear sign of which way the fashion mood is headed, the brand has diversified into new, more directional beach shoes. The website promotes a more elegant version of the flip-flop, with a snaking golden thong, which nods to the trend for Grecian-goddess styled sandals (the successor to the “gladiator” style), and a range of printed, cotton espadrilles.

Photograph: Stuart C Wilson/Getty ImagesIt wasn’t, incredibly, that maddening onomatopoeian noise that flip-flops make when you walk that killed them off. Or how said flip-flopping beats up dust from the floor, leaving the soles of your feet dirtier than if you went barefoot. Or even the weird toe-muscle grip you have to do to keep them on. It was that there is a fine line where being laid-back segues into being lazy, and flip-flops crossed it. Tom Ford began the backlash, when in 2011 he spoke out against the encroachment of flip-flops into urban offices. “Flip-flops and shorts in the city are never appropriate,” he told AnOther magazine.As the flip-flop faded, the pool slide came into view. The pool slide had long been the functional, clompy summer sandal. If Cinderella had been set in the Maldives, the ugly sisters would have been lying on sunloungers in flip-flops, while Cinderella swept the sand in slides. But in 2013, Phoebe Philo set a footwear revolution in motion when she put chunky flat sandals on her catwalk – and, just to make sure they got noticed, lined them with mink. By 2014, Vogue was shooting Freja Beha Erichsen wearing black Nike slides – with loose white trousers in one shot, and a split-sided black maxi in another – and Givenchy were making them for the catwalk. And by July that year, although Karl Lagerfeld put flip-flops on the catwalk for Chanel couture – “thong in chic”, he called it – Rihanna was wearing Chanel dove-grey pool slides for nights out in LA. In recent years, it should be noted, David Beckham has switched from trainers to pristine sport socks with pool slides as his default day shoe. In the sports-obsessed mood of fashion in 2016, the Olympic-village functionality of the pool slide, which once made it beta, now makes it alpha.

Photograph: Kimberly White/ReutersThe brazen high-street-sports-store ugliness of the plastic pool slide isn’t to everyone’s taste, and the triumph of the slide has been consolidated this summer with the addition of more elegant versions of the silhouette. Dolce & Gabbana has embellished silver-mesh slides with silver lace and Swarovski crystals, for £745, while Hermès is doing brisk trade in the signature H-shape Oran sandal (£425, and it’s all about the white calfskin version). The Diane von Furstenberg Marrakesh sandal bridges the aesthetic and financial gap between Hermès and Nike, with a sleek squared-off flat at £133.The oldest surviving flip-flop, thought to be more than 3,000 years old, is in the British Museum. Ancient Egyptian murals show pharoahs wearing jewel-encrusted versions around 4,000BC. The flip-flop has had a good innings – and, no doubt, will stage a comeback.
