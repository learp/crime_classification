At just 34 hectares, this ancient woodland is only 500 metres across at its widest. Walk for 15 minutes and you are confronted on one side by the traffic roar of the A1075 and on the other by the lifeless silence of the sugar beet. Who would have thought such a small parcel could give rise to so disturbing a myth as Babes in the Wood â€“ that classic outgrowth of our unconscious shadows in which a malign couple, eager for the inheritance of their stepchildren, dump these unfortunates in the woods with murderers. As if to ensure Wayland retained a gift for disorientation, its manager, the Norfolk Wildlife Trust, has created a gloriously confusing maze of wide paths. No doubt part of the explanation for this is ecological: the open rides are great places for woodland flowers and Wayland is noted for rarities, such as yellow star-of-Bethlehem (its only location in the county). Yet for sheer impact it's the commonest blooms that take precedence. In April, you feel you could almost sail through the trees on the hyacinth-scented lake of bluebells.What this place lacks in size, it more than compensates for through the depth of history and complexity of living community. Wayland is mentioned in the Domesday Book and was probably already hundreds if not thousands of years old by the Saxon period. This ancientness is the parameter of such an ecosystem that cannot be measured by any simple metric. Landscape scholar Oliver Rackham once suggested that 10,000 centurion oaks were not a substitute for one 500-year-old veteran. That's why it's nonsense for the misnamed environment secretary Owen Paterson to suggest you can offset the destruction of ancient woodland by planting twice as many trees. An equivalent would be to propose the substitution of Vermeers or Rembrandts or, worse still, the cave walls of Lascaux with twice as many square metres of paint by some fashionista of the contemporary art world.
