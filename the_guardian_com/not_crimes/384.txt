Where were you when #PopeBars started trending, in tribute to Pope Francis throwing hip-hop shapes in the Central African Republic? How did #BeingFemaleInNigeria help you to understand modern misogyny? And where do you stand on the heated #JollofDebate – is it from Ghana, Nigeria or elsewhere?

They’re also where some of the best jokes are made.Mapping this trend, satirical news site YesiYesighana and digital bloggers Circumspecte have just released their list of the most influential topics debated by Africans on Twitter (#AOT) in 2015. From #BringBackOurGirls which, on 6 December, marked 600 days since the schoolgirls of Chibok were abducted by Boko Haram, to #WhatWouldMagufuliDo, a tribute to the newly-elected Tanzanian president’s “revolutionary” commitment to cutting wasteful government spending, looking back at popular hashtags offers a useful overview on how the big events of the year played out online. “If African Twitter was a bar then the year 2015 would have been one of those memorable nights out,” YesiYesighana said. “Noisy drinkers would be eating jollof while debating xenophobia, everyday sexism and everything in between.”DR.Congo (@GloireAmani)#IfAfricaWasABar... #Congolese People will always arrive like... #SiLAfriqueÉtaitUnBar… #Congo #Kongo #Congolais pic.twitter.com/k3c0C3I97XNovember 28, 2015it's superteli (@superteli46)After following #IfAfricaWasaBar these are my top 4 favorites! pic.twitter.com/md51Rs6Q6ZJuly 30, 2015But that was 2015.
