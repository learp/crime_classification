In recent years, Kanye West has strenuously attempted to conquer the fashion world. He’s launched his own label, Yeezy; collaborated with the popular French ready-to-wear brand APC; designed expensive sneakers for Adidas and Nike; and recently starred in Balmain’s new fall/winter 2016 campaign. Now, it appears the contentious rap star is also set on cornering the furniture market by branding with Ikea.Last night was mad real: Kanye's new video depicts nude Trump, Taylor Swift “I have to work with Ikea – make furniture for interior design,” West declared during a BBC Radio 1 interview with Annie Mac airing Monday night. In a preview of the chat, BBC said West believed students would be keen for him to create “a minimalist apartment inside a college dorm”.“Yo Ikea, allow Kanye to create, allow him to make this thing because you know what, I want a bed that he makes, I want a chair that he makes,” West said.For West’s millions of followers on Twitter, this news probably doesn’t come as a huge surprise. Following a visit to the Scandinavian chain’s headquarters in March, West tweeted: KANYE WEST (@kanyewest)Super inspired by my visit to Ikea today , really amazing company… my mind is racing with the possibilities…March 9, 2016West has another connection to the flatpack behemoth: he previously collaborated with British fashion designer Katie Eary, who created a series of textiles and tableware for Ikea.In 2012, West launched Donda, a nebulous company named after his late mother, Donda West, which he vaguely described as a “design company” with the “goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford” – an ethos that shares a lot in common with Ikea. Ikea has so far declined to comment on a possible tie-in with West.
