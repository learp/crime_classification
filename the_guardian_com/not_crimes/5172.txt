Barack Obama will look back on 2015 as a banner year for climate change in his final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening.But 2016 will see the president back in the trenches, fending off law suits and Republican attacks that could undo his climate plan, and scrambling to get to key items on his to-do list before exiting the White House.In a sign of the battles yet to come, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said he had invited as his guest a Kentucky coalminer who lost his job when his mine shut down, a gesture intended as a rebuke to Obama.Obama's clean power plan hailed as US's strongest ever climate action Administration officials and campaign groups said Obama is unlikely to let up in his final year in the White House: pursuing new rules to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry and pressing Congress to increase funding to communities hit hard by flooding, drought and other extreme weather events fuelled by climate change.2015 was Obama’s biggest year for climate change with the finalisation of the clean power plant rules, rejection of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, ban on Arctic drilling and, in December, the forging of an historic global agreement in Paris to limit warming below 2C – all of which are expected to get a mention in Obama’s speech.“Under President Obama’s leadership, the United States has done more to combat climate change than ever before,” the White House said in a fact sheet prepared for the address. Administration officials said Obama planned to keep up the pace in the remaining months of his term. “2016 is not going to be a year we slow down. It’s a year we build on the momentum of the historic year that passed,” Gina McCarthy, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, told the Council on Foreign Relations last week. Officials said Obama will take centre stage in a signing ceremony for the Paris global warming agreement at the United Nations in April. “You can be sure that the United States will be doing what ever we can to get a lot of momentum into early entry into force of this agreement,” Paul Bodnar, senior energy and climate director at the National Security Council, said.But the president will be racing to the finish line to roll out the remaining items on his climate agenda – which are critical to delivering on the emissions goals he promised in Paris.In the weeks ahead, Obama is expected to roll out long-awaited rules to cut methane emissions from oil and gas wells and landfills, a rising source of climate pollution.The White House has spent the last six months on a final review of proposed new rules cutting methane, more than 80 times as warming as carbon dioxide in the 20-year timeframe.The administration is also expected to tighten curbs on heavy vehicle emissions.Analysts said that Obama will need to double down to meet the target of cutting emissions 17% on 2005 levels by 2020 set at the start of his presidency in 2009, and even more ambitious goal of 26%-28% cut in emissions by 2025 pledged under the Paris climate agreement.US climate pledges for ParisSome of those targets were based on assumptions that have not materialised - such as rapid growth of hybrid and electric vehicles. In 2011, Obama set a goal of 1m electric cars by 2015, but record low oil prices have sent consumers back to pick-up trucks and SUVs.The administration said it can find other areas to cut. White House officials told a seminar at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies last week that they hoped to amend the Montreal protocol ozone treaty this year to ban hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in air conditioning and are 10,000 more warming than carbon dioxide. The EPA estimates a ban could shave off 0.5C of warming.Obama was also counting on an international aviation agreement to help pare emissions. But Obama’s main focus will be ensuring that the rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants – the biggest single US climate pledge - survive a legal and political onslaught.McCarthy told an event at the council on Foreign Relations last week the administration wanted to do all it could to ensure the power plant rules remain “cast in stone”.She said the administration would spend its remaining months implementing the clean power plant rules, and defending the regulations from legal challenges.The speech promises Obama one of the last big moments to elevate the climate cause. In his 2015 state of the union address, the president said: “No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.”Obama is unlikely to ease up on climate now.
