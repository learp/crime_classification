DanceCoalIt might look like a scene from the Shangri-La at Glastonbury at 5am, but Coal is a powerful dance piece marking the the 30th anniversary of the end of the 1984-85 British miners’ strike. Choreographer Gary Clarke spent years researching his subject and the result explores “the darker underbelly of the mining industry” and its “hard-hitting realities”, with dancers and local casts accompanied by a live brass band.

Reich pioneered a style of composition that’s inspired everyone from the Orb to Sufjan Stevens.
