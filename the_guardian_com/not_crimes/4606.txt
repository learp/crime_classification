I’m thinking of giving up the Guardian on Fridays. It’s too depressing. Peter Bradshaw and his colleagues regularly review up to a dozen new movies of which only the dregs appear on any of the 20-plus screens within a five-mile radius of my home – this week a one-star comedy, a two-star horror movie and a domestic satire. One complex boasts 15 screens including five “studios”, comfortable 70-100 seater venues, one of which might profitably screen the reissued Barry Lyndon or this week’s intriguing-sounding The Childhood of a Leader. Instead, a new blockbuster will show up to eight times a day to often empty houses. My alternative? A cinematic drought or a long haul to Southampton or Chichester. Bradshaw and co do a good job, but exhibitors simply don’t follow through.Brian BaxterBournemouth, Dorset• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com• The address on the letter above was amended on 24 August 2016. A change made during the editing process meant that an earlier version placed Bournemouth in Hampshire; it was until 1974, but it is now in Dorset.
