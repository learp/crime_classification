We’re now running a regular weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review and the next theme is ‘fade.’ So whether it’s faded signs, a song that repeats to fade or a loss of light, share your photos of what fade means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Thursday 11 August at 10 am. We’ll publish our favourites in The New Review on Sunday 14 and in a gallery on the Guardian site.You can share your ‘fade’ pictures by clicking on the blue ‘Contribute’ button on this article.
