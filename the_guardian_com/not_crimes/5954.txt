Denis Villeneuve could be the next director who attempts to reboot Dune after he was approached to helm the project, according to reports.The Hollywood Reporter claims the Canadian director has been in talks with the production team who secured the rights to Frank Herbert’s cult sci-fi novel in November.Dune, 50 years on: how a science fiction novel changed the world Villeneuve, whose latest film Arrival is in cinemas now and who is also onboard for the Blade Runner sequel, Blade Runner 2049, will try to avoid joining the ranks of directors who have tried and failed to follow up David Lynch’s original.Both Taken director Pierre Morel and Friday Night Lights director Peter Berg were lined up for a reboot in 2010, but it failed to materialize, while Alejandro Jodorowsky’s aborted 10-hour attempt has been described as “the greatest sci-fi film never made”.Originally published in two parts in Analog magazine, the story of Paul Atreides’s adventures on Arrakis became a cult favourite in sci-fi circles before repeating the feat when David Lynch’s so-bad-it’s-good adaptation came out in 1984.Made for $40m, the film ended up losing $10m at the box office but went on to have a second life on home video and DVD. The original novel went on to influence the likes of George RR Martin, and also spawned a TV mini-series.
