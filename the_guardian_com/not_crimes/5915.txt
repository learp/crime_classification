The essential ingredient in politics, the late Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau once opined, is timing.It is a fact Israel’s struggling Labour party has been forced to confront after a clash between its leadership contest and an appearance by Britney Spears.The unfortunate coincidence has forced the party of the leader of the Israeli opposition, Isaac Herzog, to postpone its primary elections by 24 hours.Although both events were scheduled to take place next door to each other in the Exhibition Grounds conference and concert space in Tel Aviv on 3 July, the issue is not, it appears, that the membership of the centrist party might be persuaded that an evening with US pop singer would be less toxic than voting for its leadership.
