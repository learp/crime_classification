This is a celebration of all the different cultures that make New Orleans such a glorious melting pot: the deep, rich US bourbon and Spanish PX mix with the herby northern European kummel to luscious effect. Serves one.50ml bourbon (I use Woodford Reserve)10ml Pedro Ximenez sherry10ml Cocchi Americano1 tsp kummel (Wolfschmidt, ideally) 3 dashes Angostura bitters1 twist each lemon and orangeStir the liquids in a mixing jug with ice and strain into a chilled rocks glass over a large ice cube. Squeeze over the twists, discard them, then serve.â€¢ Dominic Whisson, American Bar, The Savoy, London WC2
