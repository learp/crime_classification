The first two badgers appeared earlier than usual, so there was no need for me to use the red filtered torch to see them. They were eating the peanuts I had put out earlier on top of an old oak stump only 3 metres from the window at the end of the house.When I first started feeding them I thought they would eat the peanuts very quickly but, as usual, these two were picking up one or two and chewing them carefully. They began to mesmerise me in the wonder of being so close to them feeding away but then, suddenly, possible confrontation.A roe deer, a doe, trotted round the nearest tree and then stopped and stood looking at the badgers. I had expected no reaction from the badgers but the opposite was true as they just fled. They went off in different directions and I have never seen badgers move so fast.There was no reaction from the doe, which walked to the sliced apples I put out for the deer every night. Then,  unusually, she walked over to the stump and began to eat the peanuts, something I had never seen before. Then a badger appeared from the right: it was Longtail, so called because it has an unusually long and very silvery tail.This is the biggest of all the badgers I have seen coming into the garden and it is very dominant. It slowly walked to the stump and, after only a slight hesitation, started to feed on the peanuts. So there was a very unexpected sight as the badger and the doe fed on peanuts, with their faces only about a foot away from each other. Neither showed any concern; the doe had her share and wandered off, leaving Longtail to take its fill.It seemed rather incongruous to walk back into the lounge and be greeted by five dachshunds who were, originally, partly trained and bred to bait badgers.Twitter: @GdnCountryDiary
