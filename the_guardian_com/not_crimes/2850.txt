Fig and thyme clafoutisMake sure you use really ripe figs for this. You may be surprised by the size of each portion, but the sponge is so light and fluffy that it’s very easy to eat a lot of it. I like to serve this with vanilla ice-cream or cream. Serves four, generously.110g caster sugar2 tbsp red wine 1 tbsp picked thyme leaves1 tbsp lemon juice, plus 2 tsp finely grated zest12 ripe black figs, tough stems removed and halved lengthways2 eggs, separated50g plain flour1½ tsp vanilla essence100ml double creamSaltHeat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3. Spoon 60g sugar into a small, oven-proof, high-sided saute pan with an 18cm base (if you don’t have one, cook the figs in a regular frying pan and transfer to a square 22cm baking dish when its’s time to move them to the oven), then put the pan on a medium-high heat for four to five minutes, swirling the pan a few times, until the sugar has melted and turned a dark, caramel colour. Add the wine and thyme – be careful, because it might spit – and stir until combined and thick. Off the heat, stir in the lemon juice and figs, and set aside to cool. (If you are transferring the figs to a baking dish, do so now.)Put the egg yolks in a medium bowl with 25g sugar. Whisk until pale and thick – two to three minutes by hand, one minute with an electric whisk – then add the flour, vanilla, cream, lemon zest and a pinch of salt, and whisk until smooth and thick.In another medium bowl, whisk the egg whites with the remaining 25g sugar (again, two to three minutes by hand, a minute with an electric whisk), until they form stiff peaks. Fold gently into the yolk batter, then pour over the figs in the saute pan (or baking dish). Bake for about 30 minutes, until the batter has risen, turned golden brown and is cooked through. Remove from the oven, divide between four bowls and serve hot.Coconut puddings with peanuts and limeI use 9cm-wide ramekins for these, but any bowl or glass with similar dimensions will do. They set quickly – within about an hour – so you don’t need to start way ahead of time, though they do keep in the fridge for up to three days. Serves six.800ml coconut milk (ie, 2 tins)50g caster sugar1 vanilla pod, slit lengthways and seeds scraped outShaved zest of 2 limes, plus 20ml lime juiceFlaked sea salt6.5g sachet vege-gel (a vegetarian setting agent that’s widely available in the baking section of supermarkets – Dr Oetker is just one brand to look out for) 30g dark muscovado sugar½ ripe mango, peeled and sliced into thin, 2mm x 5cm-long strips2 tbsp salted and roasted peanuts, finely choppedPut the coconut milk in a medium saucepan with the sugar, vanilla pod and seeds, lime zest and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt. Gently warm for 10 minutes, until the milk is steaming and aromatic and the sugar has dissolved, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 10 minutes.Strain the milk through a fine sieve, squeezing as much liquid from the aromatics as possible. Return the milk to the pan and put on a medium heat. Add the vege-gel and cook for three minutes, whisking continuously, until the vege-gel has dissolved and the milk has thickened slightly. Take off the heat and stir in a tablespoon of lime juice, then divide between six ramekins (or bowls or glasses of a similar size and capacity) and refrigerate for at least an hour.Put the muscovado sugar in a small saucepan with two tablespoons of water, bring to a boil, then leave to bubble for 30-60 seconds, until the sugar has melted and the syrup has thickened. Take off the heat, stir in the remaining teaspoon of lime juice and leave to cool – you should end up with two tablespoons of pourable syrup.To serve, top each pudding with a slice or two of mango, drizzle on a teaspoon of syrup and finish by scattering over a teaspoon of peanuts.
