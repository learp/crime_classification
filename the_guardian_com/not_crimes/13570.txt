Ideally positioned in King’s Cross, just a stone’s throw from the mythical beginning of the journey to Hogwarts on Platform 9 3/4, the British Library has announced it will be marking the 20th anniversary of the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone next year with a new exhibition about JK Rowling’s wizarding world.JK Rowling: I think we're done with Harry Potter now Featuring original material from Rowling’s archives, and from the archives of Harry Potter publisher Bloomsbury, along with wizarding books, manuscripts and objects, the exhibition will “take readers on a journey to the heart of the Harry Potter stories”, the British Library said. Running from 20 October 2017 to 28 February 2018, the exhibition will also look at the history of magic around the world, including manuscripts dating back hundreds of years and featuring medieval descriptions of dragons and griffins, as well as the origins of the philosopher’s stone.“We at the British Library are thrilled to be working with JK Rowling and with Bloomsbury to mark the 20th anniversary of Harry Potter, and to inspire fans with the magic of our own British Library collections,” said the library’s head of culture and learning Jamie Andrews.Bloomsbury said the display would be the first time the British Library had put on an exhibition inspired by a single series of books by a living author. “The British Library is a magical place for book lovers. They are the perfect partners for a once-in-a-lifetime exhibition exploring a once-in-a-lifetime cultural phenomenon, a thrilling celebration of magic and imagination with Harry Potter at its heart,” said Bloomsbury Children’s Books publishing director, Rebecca McNally.Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, the first Potter novel, was published by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997, with an initial hardback print run of just 500 copies. The series has now sold more than 450m copies around the world, according to the publisher, which will be marking the anniversary with events, competitions and the release of four “Hogwarts House Editions” of Rowling’s debut. The Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin editions will show the house shield on the jackets and will include “bespoke extra content”.
