10.11pm GMT22:11Talking of happy endings, that’s it for my brief toe-dip into this year’s Apprentice – thank you as ever for joining in and being marvellous – you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens if you want to say hello. My liveblog duties for 2016 are now over, which must mean it’s nearly Christmas. Have a wonderful festive season, and I’ll see you in 2017!

And am pretty sure someone will want to make Courtney’s Cuppy Cup, which would be a happy ending for everyone.

He’s going into cake by Alana, even though she didn’t put the word Sugar in the brand, which was FOOLHARDY. Courtney looks gutted, bless him.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose10.06pm GMT22:06Time for a final pitch from the finalists. Courtney calls Alana “just a baker”, and she rips him a new one over profits and margins. Courtney’s products are niche, but everyone loves cake, says Alana. Lord Sugar has a dilemma. Presumably because both have limited potential and he doesn’t really want either of them.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose10.04pm GMT22:04“Have you every come across a designer that’s got any commercial sense?” asks Lord Sugar. I don’t know, maybe James Dyson?

I’m guessing the motors in China are already running.

I reckon it has to be Courtney, because Lord Sugar loves a bit of old tat.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.58pm GMT21:58Alana chose her team because they’re marketing experts, strong women and Oliver, who does food. Lord Sugar likes that Alana put her name on the product, because Alana is his cross-dressing alter-ego. Oh my sides.Lord Sugar is being very complimentary and constructive. This is no fun at all.Updatedat 9.58pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.56pm GMT21:56Boardroom time! Lord Sugar is wearing a lurid Purple tie, which is a good sign for Courtney. Jessica, Vinnie Jones and Facial Hair made a digital billboard that didn’t show any products, and Monobrow was in charge of the TV ad. Lord Sugar and Karren were impressed with Courtney’s presentation. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.52pm GMT21:52 Courtney’s face has suddenly become animated, and it’s quite unsettling. He thinks he’s got a good chance of winning. 50/50 at least, Courtney.

Although secretly I hoped for more of a car crash, what’s the point of The Apprentice otherwise?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.50pm GMT21:50So far Courtney is holding it together, but his TV ad is really bad. I mean, like PANTSMAN bad. The audience are laughing, and quite like his prototype sippy cup. He’s playing the crowd really well, and even manage to crack a few jokes. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.48pm GMT21:48Lord Sugar gets some feedback from some tycoons. They’re generally quite positive about Alana, I think Courtney has got a job on his hands. But still, LANDFILL.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.47pm GMT21:47Alana is on first and manages about ten words before she starts crumbling like an overbaked brownie. She witters on a bit, then shows her cheesy video and flicks her hair a bit. Her nerves actually comes over as kind of humble and charming. I’ve seen worse.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.44pm GMT21:44I feel like I should be watching this from behind a cushion. It’s going to be horrible.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.43pm GMT21:43It’s presentation time! I hope Courtney is wearing robust underwear, he looks terrified. Alana is having a meltdown. Courtney asks Jessica and Facial Hair what the research reveals, and they lie through their teeth. Frances, Rachel and Oliver do likewise, because god forbid that Alana might go into this with some idea what the audience might roast her for. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.40pm GMT21:40Jessica and Facial Hair are doing some market research on the Purple Whale brand. It doesn’t go well. Motivation for both finalists comes from Grainne and Monobrow, who sends Courtney to sleep.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
