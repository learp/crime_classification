The tears shed by the crowd at Carole King’s Hyde Park concert were not just for the evocative lyrics of You’ve Got a Friend (Beautiful Tapestry performance finds a 50,000-strong backing choir, 5 July). At a time of great uncertainty, they were a cathartic reaffirmation of all that is good in life and an expression of defiance against those who wish to undermine our tolerant and freedom-loving society. The only downer was a ripoff £7 bratwurst. Thank you, Carole King, for lifting London’s spirits.Stan LabovitchWindsor• Our five-year-old granddaughter came home from school with a letter from the Metropolitan police about hate crime, encouraging anyone who experienced it to report to them (‘Unity events’ held in London after post-Brexit spike in hate crime, 4 July, theguardian.com) Although it was reassuring, it was also sad and shocking that small children in a multi-ethnic primary school should have to bring such letters home.Alicia BakerLondon• What a shame that in the current centenary commemorations of the Battle of the Somme (A new kind of war memorial: fleeting, human, haunting, Editorial, 4 July), there is so little – indeed any – recognition of the parts played by soldiers who came from the Indian subcontinent, including the 20th Deccan Horse regiment, which was comprised of Hindus, Jains, Muslims and Sikhs.
