Rooftoppers is an extraordinary book. It might make you laugh and fascinate you. Every time I read it I can’t put it down.A young orphan called Sophie can’t find her mother and is adopted by a man called Charles and gets an interview but it doesn’t go very well. She moves to France with Charles to hunt for her mother. I won’t tell you the rest because I don’t want to spoil it for you.I would rate it for readers aged 10+ on your own but 8-9 with your parents. I would give it 10 out of 10. I hope you read the book and if so enjoy it.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
