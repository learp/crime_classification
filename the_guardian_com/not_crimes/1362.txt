The starting point for Pieter’s AW16 menswear collection was a photograph from 1979 of Brian Ridley and Lyle Heeter by Robert Mapplethorpe. It’s a double portrait in a homely living room, of two men side by side, in leather and chains. One wears a cap, the other… well, his hair is fabulous. Pieter’s models were each styled in variations on the ultimate quiff, soft and relaxed at the front, slick as hell at the back. Prep with mousse and blast dry, working your wax through with a wide-toothed comb.
