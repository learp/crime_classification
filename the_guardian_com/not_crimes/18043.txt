During the culture wars of the 80s and 90s, artists such as Robert Mapplethorpe challenged the orthodoxy and provoked the ire of Ronald Reagan’s Special Presidential Task Force on the Arts and Humanities. Reagan continued on with his purges, marginalising and defunding dissenting voices, and ultimately absorbing the remnants of the avant garde that Charlotte Moorman (1933-1991) was not only at the forefront of, but central in helping to create.It’s a history that’s explored in the Block Museum’s A Feast of Astonishments: Charlotte Moorman and the Avant Garde, 1960s-1980s, the retrospective of the artist’s nearly lost legacy that serves as both an art-historical backdrop and parallel to a compelling resurgence of Chicago as center at the nexus of art, dance, performance and politics.Often her friends, who she made after an immersion in a New York scene, including artists Carolee Schneemann, Yoko Ono, Deborah Hay and Yvonne Rainer, joined in her pursuit of new forms of art through a rigorous exchange of ideas. Moorman’s work, alongside frequent collaborator Nam June Paik, represented the continuation of a long process of art’s disentanglement from a modernist culture that was not only anti-gay, but also often deeply racist, classist and sexist – work that inevitably drew the attention of another important collaborator, Joseph Beuys.Arguably among Moorman’s most compelling collaborations is in the making of Infiltration Homogen for Cello, a violoncello covering in the gray felt Beuys often used in his work, a material he saw as symbolizing warmth and healing. Beuys, who famously refused to enter the US during its continued prosecution of the Vietnam war, found in Moorman a like-minded collaborator and willing back channel into the American art culture while maintaining his dissent. Infiltration began as Infiltration Homogen for Grand Piano (abbreviated title), after a Beuys performance in Düsseldorf, when he slowly, eerily pushed a piano with Jörg Immendorff and Johannes Stüttgen across the walkway behind the audience.

Photograph: Michael WorkmanBeuys, whose work was often about trauma and healing, had attached two pieces of red felt in the shape of a cross, often used to signal international aid, to the gray covering. Similarly, Moorman’s move toward incorporating sculptural elements into her performances, including explosives such as the “practice bomb” she strapped strings to and played nude, in place of her cello, during her 1968 staging of Paik’s Opera Sextronique, resonated with understated political conscience, a performance for which she was arrested. Moorman, in a collaborative reinterpretation of Infiltration, turned the felt covering for the piano into one for her cello, which she subsequently used in performances with Paik. It came as little surprise that eventually, in 1974, when Beuys did finally set foot in the States, his body wrapped entirely in felt as he rode from the airport to her gallery, Moorman’s performances had served as a crucial antecedent.It wasn’t until 10 years after her death from cancer in 1991 that Northwestern University acquired her archive, leading to the retrospective exhibit now up through July. What perhaps best serves this retrospective’s painstakingly astute sifting under curators Joan Rothfuss and Scott Krafft is an acknowledgement of the opposition her work consistently presents of reductiveness to any kind of co-optation, an opposition built into the work’s ephemeral, embodied modes that gave it such crucial value at the start of the dematerialization movement in art among Moorman and her contemporaries.Artists such as Schneeman, Ron Athey or the late David Wojnarowicz, Robert Mapplethorpe, Barbara DeGenevieve and others, whose art-historical resonances converge now, ironically, in the same Chicago where the economic philosophies that went on to disrupt many such artists’ work originated – and were often challenged.The Moorman exhibition is the tip of a cultural iceberg that’s formed in Chicago. There is Theaster Gates’s historicizing performances of the black experience, Michelle Kranicke’s anti-ageist aMID festival, which recently brought Deborah Hay to Chicago for the first time since the 80s; as well, some of the programs at Links Hall, Defibrillator, Terrain and other places where grassroots work is being done on the fringes of institutions and market influence to foster a budding and fragile search for fresh artistic definitions. In fact, with unprecedented funding flowing from the MacArthur Foundation, who recently allocated all of its capital gifts this year exclusively to performance projects in the city, and the Chicago Dancemaker’s Forum, whose collaboration with the Regional Dance Initiative also resulted in funding exclusively for Chicago dancers, the city seems poised to take up the mantle of Moorman’s search for new, and newly relevant, forms of art. Time will tell. For now, we have Moorman’s example in history to help light the way.A Feast of Astonishments: Charlotte Moorman and the Avant Garde, 1960s-1980s at the Block Museum of Art at Northwestern University until 17 July
