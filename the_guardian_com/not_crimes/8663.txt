Is there anything more disgusting than a fatberg? These gargantuan mounds of debris block the intestines of civilisation (ie sewers). Fatberg season used to peak on Christmas Day, when people poured turkey fat down the drains in a mass festive clog. Now they’re an all-year hazard, thanks to the inexorable rise of the wet wipe.There are wet wipes for every conceivable bathroom occasion: deodorising under-arms, removing eye make-up and, perhaps the biggest seller, toilet wipes. Apparently swathes of the population no longer find paper bearable. They’re hooked on single-use wipes that combine synthetic cellulosic fibre with plastic fibres, marketed as “flushable”.The industry tests for flushability are the Volkswagen emission tests of the bathroom cabinet – failing to recreate the real- world scenario. Scientists, water companies and conservationists are pretty clear that wet wipes do not degrade during a flush.At least the fatbergs are visible. The Marine Conservation Society has seen a 400% increase in wet wipes found along our coastline over the past decade. As they fragment, they will release microscopic fragments of plastic. These join an estimated 86 tonnes of microplastics released into the environment every year in the UK from facial exfoliants alone.There are “eco” wet wipes, such as Yes To wipes (£3.99 from Boots), which claim to be compostable. However, I’d use these sparingly, as you don’t want to overload a normal compost bin.Personal-care giants have recently said that they will stop marketing wipes as “flushable”. They should have done this earlier, before the environment bore the true cost of their products. To my mind, they’ve been as slippery as the wipes they flog to us.The big picture: the art of saving the seas      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Big blue: art created from plastic pollution.
