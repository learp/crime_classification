A mining company expects to pay itself most of the royalties from one of Queensland’s most controversial coal projects under a century-old legal loophole.New Hope Group, whose proposed Acland coal mine expansion on the Darling Downs is under review by the state government, has revealed it would receive an estimated 77% of royalties while the state would get only 7%.Parliamentary speaker Peter Wellington said he was opposed to the mine and that the state’s loss of royalties due to the loophole, expected to amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, was a factor in his opposition.“It’s one of the things I’m concerned about,” Wellington, who made renewed scrutiny of Acland a condition of his support for the minority Palaszczuk Labor government, told Guardian Australia.“I don’t support the Acland stage three proposal and it’s a matter that the government is currently considering.”Mining minister Anthony Lynham was surprised to learn about the loophole – which gives royalties on all land titled before 1910 to the owners and not the state – in a meeting in April, according to activists.Controversy about Acland ran high during the Queensland election campaign in January. A host of senior government figures including the then premier Campbell Newman sued broadcaster Alan Jones for defamation over his criticism of their support for the mine. The lawsuits were later dropped.The Newman government had initially opposed Acland stage three but later came out in support of New Hope, which had donated almost $1m to the federal Liberal party since 2009.Guardian Australia also revealed during the campaign that a Newman cabinet minister, Ian Walker, who was involved in the government’s handling of the project, had previously taken a $2,000 donation from a New Hope director and that his daughter later took a job at the company. Walker denied any impropriety.New Hope chief executive Shane Stephan wrote to Wellington in May to reveal the company’s estimated cut from Acland after the independent MP asked about royalties in an earlier meeting.“The payment of royalties is very hard to calculate,” Stephan wrote. “However, an estimate can be made by considering the ownership of land and strata title of coal blocks.”This showed an “estimated average royalty split” of 77% to New Hope, 16% to other landholders and 7% to the government.New Hope has taken advantage of the pre-1910 loophole, which applies to a fraction of mines in Queensland, by buying up most of the land at Acland from farmers since 2002.Activists estimate Acland’s rare status means the state would lose out on $450m over stage three and almost $1bn over the life of the entire mine.Lock the Gate campaigner Drew Hutton said there were “so many downsides to this mine”. “It’s in the wrong place,” he said. “It’s going to have a very significant impact on agricultural land, water resources and the health of local people.“And just to add insult to injury, $450m will be lost to the state in royalties because the mine will be giving that money to itself.“(Lynham) didn’t know about it when we were talking to him.”Jo Bragg, the chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office Queensland, said the revelations about the Acland royalties “certainly feed into questions about the mine’s public benefit”.The EDO will next week hand the government a proposed draft bill to restore legal rights for the community to object to mines on environmental grounds after such rights were stripped away by the former Newman government.Bragg said the community risked being denied an opportunity to challenge Acland in the land court if the government did not move before the end of the year to enact its promise to restore the rights.Hutton called on the government to recall parliament early to pass the changes.“We’re hoping the government does the right thing here and gets those changes through the legislature and people aren’t disenfranchised,” he said.New Hope chief Stephan wrote to Wellington that: “It should be remembered that in addition to royalties, there are many other benefits to the local community, region and state that Acland stage 3 will bring.”He cited a $12bn boost to the economy from the mine until 2029.“These flow-on benefits include infrastructure and equipment capital, direct wages, the ongoing provision of goods and services, coal transport costs, taxes as well as royalties,” he said.According to a report by the former state coordinator general, the project would affect about 1,361 hectares of high quality farmland. The project would also cause groundwater to sink up to an estimated 40 metres in some places.
