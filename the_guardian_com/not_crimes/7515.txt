The deaths of Prince and David Bowie, whose musical Lazarus opened in London this week, were reminders of how theatrical the greatest rock stars can be. Yet there remains a gulf between the worlds of theatre and modern music (by which I mean pop, guitar bands, hip-hop, electronic sounds: anything that inhabits grassroots gig or club spaces rather than classical concert halls). That’s beginning to change with the rise of theatre presented as a gigs, such as Weekend Rockstars, and works such as the crazed J-pop explosion Miss Revolutionary Idol Berserker at Lift festival.But the crossover between these two worlds can be fraught and unpredictable. This summer, Róisín Murphy gave the first contemporary live music performance at Shakespeare’s Globe in London. It’s maybe symbolic that the Globe announced its parting of ways with artistic director Emma Rice shortly after its production of Imogen, which reimagined Cymbeline with grime beats.

Photograph: Christopher SheaAs someone who works with and writes about modern musicians, from the pop heartland to the experimental fringes, I was asked to help in programming the All the Right Notes season for Camden People’s theatre. They had theatre pieces with musical elements, and wanted me to bring in musicians with a theatrical edge. It was thrilling to think about – and quickly I found a grime veteran willing to perform his work as spoken word (Flowdan) and a rave provocateur with whom I can reconstruct 5am chillout room conversations (Andy Blake). But the process made me realise how little I know about theatre, its mechanics and its culture.  Even some of the sharpest minds within theatre seemed to have a hang-up that music was fundamentally 'cooler' Then I became aware that both sides were baffled by each other. Even some of the sharpest, most out-there minds in the theatre world seemed to have a hang-up that music was fundamentally “cooler” than theatre. As writer-performer Rachel Mars, whose Our Carnal Hearts forms part of the CPT season, puts it: “Theatre is a very nerdy world, not very rock’n’roll, really.” When I spoke to friends in the music world, the general impression of theatre tended towards total ignorance or a sense that it was all highbrow and, as such, intimidating. When pressed on the differences, Mars says: “Gigs are about quite an ecstatic experience, losing yourself along with a crowd of people – which usually means a constant stream of music. It doesn’t always work so well when that is interrupted by dialogue or anything else that isn’t expected by the audience.” Our Carnal Hearts, written with the composer Louise Mothersole, is built around “sacred harp” singing from the southern US states: “it’s about the deeply seductive and manipulative act of communal singing” and leads the audience into “some really quite horrid things”.Greater Belfast at Edinburgh festival review – evocative tales of the city Matt Regan concurs that the live music circuit is not always receptive to alterations in the usual formats. A working classical musician, but also a singer-songwriter, inspired in part by Sufjan Stevens’s performances, he began to want to “be identified as something other than a front-person” and to perform “weird gigs” using narration, lighting and staging that go beyond the standard performance format. “Sometimes it worked,” he says, “but mostly, gig audiences were just baffled if the music stopped and I started talking about something cryptic.” A friend who worked at the Tron theatre in Glasgow persuaded him that he should try his show in a theatre space rather than the standard gig venues he’d been using. Immediately his “weird gigs” became the theatre piece cum song cycle Greater Belfast, and he found himself “more welcomed than I could imagine” by the theatre world.Regan says the theatre offers “far, far more freedom to create what you want” than the music circuit. “And being pragmatic,” he adds, “more security, too. Where the best I could see happening with the gig circuit was essentially a life touring small venues, with theatre, once you’re established a bit, there’s the possibility of funding, of residencies, of building up a proper little team around your production. When I think of how I can maintain working as a creative person, this seems a better route.” Nwando Ebizie had her feet in live music and theatre before she created The Passion of Lady Vendredi. In the show, Ebizie plays “a voodoo priestess from a parallel dimension”, and she also has a convincing rock star persona, splicing equal parts Poly Styrene, Grace Jones and MIA. It has been well-received in theatres and gig/club spaces: its punky energy is more than enough to keep crowds on their feet, and Lady Vendredi as rock star stands up on the five-track EP she has released of the show’s songs.

Photograph: Dimitri DjuricHowever, when I ask if she’s ever been tempted to build Lady Vendredi’s career – make albums, tour properly on the gig circuit – she is horrified. “No! That would be absurd!” she gasps. “I mean, I could do it, but I’d go mad … We had to tone down the rhythms and stuff in the show, just for the sake of my own wellbeing.” She’s agog at the ability of music stars, be they Axl Rose or Kanye West, to inhabit the same inflated persona their whole lives. “I don’t know how they manage it,” she says. “I suppose the money helps.” She thinks that theatre is doctrinal in insisting on the primacy of narrative over other elements: “European theatre at least,” she says, “is hung up on the text. It uses music, of course, but it’s pretty unusual to let it be as central as the words and visuals, to be completely integrated in the way you might find in some other cultures.”It’s true that theatre and modern music have distinct infrastructures, rituals, social functions and written or unwritten rules of conduct that in many cases serve to keep them separate. But a more positive way to look at the gap between them is as a wide-open space of possibility. Rock, pop and soul have existed for maybe 60 years, hip-hop and disco for 40, electronica and rave for less than that: all are still maturing, still have many of their mechanisms unexamined or little understood, and all have deep and fundamental human experiences at their heart. Beyond the jukebox musical, beyond the concept album, beyond the rock star changing costumes between songs, there are untold dramatic ideas still to be explored in the hinterland.All the Right Notes is at Camden People’s theatre, London, until 3 December.
