Are you as greedy, selfish and nasty as the financial wizards somehow portrayed as heroes in The Big Short? If so, now could be the time to emulate your role models.The Big Short review – Ryan Gosling and Christian Bale can't save this overvalued stock The surprise Oscars best picture frontrunner shows Christian Bale’s Michael Burry, along with a sundry bunch of disciples, anticipating the 2008 crash, betting against the market and making it big when the sky falls in. A boom seemed to be under way, but they spotted its achilles heel. Marvel’s Avengers might have opted to save the world, but Burry’s gang find a higher purpose in their own enrichment. Should you share their approach to life, current conditions must surely look tempting.Now, as a decade ago, everyone’s behaving as if the economy were sound. After all, unemployment is falling, incomes are rising, consumer confidence is at record levels and inflation is flat. Global growth forecasts may have been trimmed but they’re still healthy, and investors are being advised to ride out a dose of unexpected market turbulence.Yet that turbulence is far from the only reason to suspect that another disaster may be looming. The last decade’s vast debt overhang hasn’t gone away; it’s merely been sidestepped temporarily with the aid of monetary jiggery-pokery. Among the many emerging chinks in our economic armour is the very element on which Burry fastened: the prospect of a wave of mortgage defaults when artificially low interest rates eventually have to rise.Of course, in any venture of your own you won’t have access to the credit-default swaps that enabled Burry & Co to bet directly on the collapse of the sub-primes. Yet if the whole house of cards is going to tumble once more, there are plenty of other doomed activities on which you can set your sights. Shorting assets isn’t as easy as it used to be, but for the determined vulture, plentiful opportunities remain.

He had investors, but if necessary you can resort to Wonga. Unfortunately, you’ll have to keep servicing your debt until your bet pays off. If this takes longer than you expect, you’ll be ruined before you can make your killing. Solving this problem is much harder than discerning impending catastrophe. How historically accurate is The Big Short? In truth, it’s not difficult to spot a bubble. The Big Short would have you believe that only “a few outsiders and weirdos” saw 2008 coming. Not so. Big-shot investors, high-profile economists and policy researchers together with financiers, politicians, bureaucrats and journalists all issued warnings. Yet they couldn’t say when the crash would come. No one ever can. That’s what makes shorting, most of the time, a mug’s game.Yet Burry believed he had cracked the problem of timing. Sub-prime mortgages had been sold with low, introductory interest rates. Many would convert to variable rate (and rocket up) at about the same time. The housing market would collapse at this precise moment. He was therefore uniquely equipped to bet on a sure thing.The film is awestruck by this stroke of brilliance, while being obliged to record that it didn’t turn out to be all that brilliant after all. One element of the stratagem might have been fixed, but an array of other variables went unnoticed. Burry’s investors could have abandoned him and almost did. When the mortgage default wave struck, the banks proved able to rig the market to obscure its impact. Bent ratings agencies chose to back them. If the banks had gone bust instead, they wouldn’t have paid out. Any of these unanticipated factors could have blown apart the supposed master plan. As it happened, none of them did. That wasn’t because the shorters were geniuses; it was because they got lucky.

Just like any other kind of gambler, you’ll need good fortune as well. And there’s a reason why you won’t deserve it.The Big Short presents its heroes as subversive warriors taking on the greed, folly and corruption of the evil banking establishment. Yet their own efforts contributed to the suddenness and severity of the crash, thereby augmenting the evictions and redundancies it precipitated. The sale of credit-default swaps weakened banks’ resilience. Meanwhile, it induced them to create even more dubious, synthetic mortgage bonds.This kind of consideration doesn’t bother Michael Burry. He’s driven by the kind of fanatical compulsion that Hollywood tends to confuse with missionary zeal. In this film, sociopathy earns you a free pass.However, for Steve Carell’s hedgie, Mark Baum, it has to be more of an issue. Mark, you see, is inspired by righteous outrage. Working in finance so charred his soul that he couldn’t coax a suicidal brother back from the brink. Shorting mortgage bonds helps him get back at those loathsome banks. So when he realises that he’s just as bad as his foes, he’s plunged into torment. He agonises and agonises. Then he cashes in, just like the others. Brad Pitt’s retired banker is supposed to be reformed, but he lends the conspirators a hand just to help them get rich.The Big Short: how Wall Street's crimes have been portrayed by Hollywood In fact, the shorters aren’t as bad as the bankers; they’re worse. It’s not just that they’re hypocrites; they’re also parasites. Sub-prime mortgages may have been abused by the bankers who rolled them into bonds, but originally they had a worthy purpose. They were designed to provide the poor with homes, and as such were welcomed by progressives, including Bill Clinton. Credit-default swaps, on the other hand, were never more than instruments of greed.So, imitating the sordid chancers of The Big Short might bankrupt you morally as well as financially. Don’t do it. Instead, why not watch a decent film about the 2008 crash? I recommend Margin Call. It didn’t win best picture but it told an honest tale.
