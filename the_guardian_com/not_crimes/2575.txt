It is the first emperor penguin to be found in the wild in New Zealand in 44 years.It became ill after eating sand, which it may have mistaken for snow.Kate Baker, a spokeswoman for the zoo, said the penguin had gained about 4kg (9lb) and this week passed an x-ray and blood test.Baker said the penguin would probably be released offshore from the south end of the country sometime in the next few weeks.
