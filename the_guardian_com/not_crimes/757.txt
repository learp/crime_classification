Theresa May has placed three battalions of up to 1,200 soldiers on 24-hour standby to help if England suffers flooding this winter.Last winter torrential rain affected thousands of families, resulting in criticism of the government. The storms forced the evacuation of homes and caused severe damage across the north of England. Somerset was badly affected by floods a year earlier.The involvement of the army this winter is in addition to a new 105 helpline for people hit by power cuts, and work with the energy sector to prevent outages.The government said local authorities and Highways England had stockpiled 1.7m tonnes of salt to keep the roads clear – 500,000 more than for the severe winter of 2010-11.In 2014, David Cameron drafted in troops to support the flood relief operation in Somerset. The decision, made during an emergency meeting of Cobra, sanctioned amphibious landing craft to be crewed by the Royal Marines and army engineers to help residents and rebuild damaged roads and infrastructure.

That is why we are working together to prepare for all that winter may bring, from providing flu vaccinations to specialist equipment and resources to deal with winter flooding. With the army standing by, we have the most comprehensive winter plan yet to keep people safe and the country moving.”Last week ministers faced criticism from a committee of MPs who demanded an overhaul of flood management systems. They called for the Environment Agency to be stripped of some of its powers and for new coastal and river boards to be established, with a commissioner to oversee them all.The committee’s chair, Neil Parish, said: “We propose a radical alternative to the current fragmented, inefficient and ineffective flood risk management arrangements.”The government said there was no need for organisational change. It said the Environment Agency now had four times more mobile flood barriers than last year, and that battalions were being trained to assist with the rapid deployment of these barriers when needed. They would also help evacuate stranded families from their homes.Ministers said the plans for the winter also took in flu immunisation for at-risk groups and a promise to work with the National Grid and other energy companies to make sure demands were managed.
