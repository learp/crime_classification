Speaking to Vogue, West said: “We’re just working on music, working on a bunch of music together, just having fun going into the studio. We’re working on an album, so there’s some exciting things coming up soon.”A joint venture between the pair had previously been hinted at, when a billboard appeared in Los Angeles next month, displaying a pairing of West’s GOOD Music and Drake’s OVO logos.Hip Hop Aficionado (@hhtycoon)Billboard in Los Angeles hints at a collaboration between Drake and Kanye West pic.twitter.com/1o6YZIjr3WAugust 29, 2016West offered no more information, but the announcement might be a welcome piece of good news for Drake.
