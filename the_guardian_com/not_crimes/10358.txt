In Dimbleby On Dimbleby (Saturday, 8pm, Radio 4) Jonathan of that ilk anchors while a succession of broadcasting dignitaries try to put their finger on what made his late father Richard such a broadcasting original. The dignitaries really don’t need to bother because Dimbleby senior’s unforced gravitas is evident in every clip from the archives, whether broadcasting from the belly of a bomber being buffeted by German flack, from the newly liberated camps at Belsen or at state occasions such as Churchill’s funeral in 1965. He described what he saw, not what he thought he ought to have seen, and it all sounds as fresh as paint.“Hello, I’m a criminologist,” says David Wilson in his disarmingly direct introduction to In The Criminologist’s Chair (Tuesday, 4pm, Radio 4). The first question he puts to the occupant of that chair has a similar Python touch about it: “How did you acquire the nickname ‘Razor’?” And we’re off. There may be people who can switch off an interview with a man called Razor who has one of those voices you last heard bantering with Terry over the bar of the Winchester Club. I am not one of them.The text of the programme is “Are criminals born or made?” but there’s a lot of dinner party ammunition you can pick up on the way to coming to a conclusion about that. Such as? Well, apparently armed robbers put a lot of thought into making their appearance frightening purely in order to put members of the public off getting in their way. Hence the ski masks, and the robber of yore who used to put on a series of overcoats, one over the others, purely in order to make himself appear massive.The river Severn was known to the Romans as Sabrina, which is a name subsequently borrowed by the handlers of Norma Sykes, who was the Jordan of the 1950s. I learned this vital information in The River (Monday, 1.45pm, Radio 4) when writer, naturalist and broadcaster Paul Evans stares at the rushing river and ponders its lessons for all of us. This is the first of five talks by different writers on the theme of the river.The Proms continue all this week. The memorably named Prom 44 (Thursday, 7.30pm, Radio 3) features the BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by Keith Lockhart, performing music from stage and screen inspired by Shakespeare’s plays, ranging from Kiss Me Kate and West Side Story to Walton’s Prelude to Richard III. The first half is British, there’s a chat with actor Michael Pennington in the interval and then the second half is Broadway all the way.Carlos Santana is the guest of Ken Bruce (Monday, 9.30am, Radio 2). Since breaking through at Woodstock in 1969, the beatific fretboard botherer has never slipped from prominence, which can’t be said of most of the people on the bill. He’ll be choosing his Tracks Of My Years, as is traditional, and plugging the inexplicably delayed follow-up to 1971’s Santana III.
