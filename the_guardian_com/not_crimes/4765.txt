Whatever happened to cinema’s Mel Gibson? Some will have assumed that he is beginning his 60s as vice-chair of the Los Angeles chapter of Momentum. Others, of course, will already know that Mel is back.He’s never been more back. Not only as a director – his second world war movie Hacksaw Ridge starring Andrew Garfield is very well spoken of – but as an actor. Mel is currently shooting a film with Sean Penn, and this past summer starred in the action thriller Blood Father. Yes, it’s a shame that Hollywood women aged 60 are playing Spock’s great grandmother or whatever, but that’s showbiz. Indeed, the Hollywood Reporter reveals that Mel is now in talks to star in yet another action-adventure movie, Every Other Weekend.Obviously, we’re all made up for him. And yet … I haven’t seen Blood Father, but looking through the available stills, my primary impression is that Mel got himself ridiculously ripped for it, as he did for Expendables 3 before it, and signing for another action adventure suggests he will have to continue the … regimen. I see he has previously been snapped a few times outside somewhere called the Beverly Hills Rejuvenation Clinic, while his friend Sylvester Stallone now claims that human growth hormone and testosterone “increase your quality of life”. Even so, LA traffic cops are advised that action cinema’s gain could be their loss, and to prepare themselves accordingly.
