Confectionery firm Mars is shrinking the pack size of favourite sweets including Maltesers, M&M’s and Minstrels by up to 15% in the latest example of an industry trend that is shortchanging shoppers.It is the second time within a year that Mars has reduced the number of Maltesers in its sharing bags, which now weigh in at just 93g. Last autumn packs of Maltesers, billed as the lighter way to enjoy chocolate, shrank from 121g to 103g.The American food giant appears to have taken action across its bestselling brands: family packs of M&M’s are now 25g lighter at 140g, while bags of Minstrels and Revels are also almost 10% lighter. Prices are unchanged.Food manufacturers are either increasing prices or shrinking pack sizes – described as “shrinkflation” – as ingredient and transport costs rise and then presumably hoping that consumers don’t notice the difference.Mars said: “We have been absorbing rising raw material and operational costs for some time, but the growing pressures mean that we can’t keep things as they are. Reducing the size of our products is not a decision that we take easily.”Steve Dresser, a supermarket analyst and author of industry blog Grocery Insight, said manufacturers were shrinking packs to preserve profit margins as they tried to hit the keen price points required for popular supermarket promotions. “Shoppers are losing out because they are getting less for their money,” he said, adding that the trend was likely to continue. “Manufacturers are trying to protect their profit margins but it seems excessive to move a pack size down twice inside a year.”Shrinkflation started during the last recession and in recent years chocolate-lovers have been regularly targeted. Last year Mondelēz, the American food giant that owns Cadbury, caused a furore after it cut the weight of Toblerone bars by widening the gaps between the chocolate “peaks”. More recently it raised the price of its Cadbury Freddo bars by 20% to 30p, despite maintaining the weight of the chocolate frogs at 18g. Nestlé is also shrinking its Aero Mint bars from 120g to 100g to hold the price at £1.After a benign period where inflation was close to zero, living costs started rising again last summer thanks to a combination of higher oil prices and the Brexit vote’s blow to the value of the pound, which has made imports to the UK more expensive. Last week official figures showed inflation had jumped to 2.3% in February, the highest rate for more than three years. The bigger-than-expected rise will intensify fears over people’s living standards being squeezed this year by higher living costs. While inflation has been going up, wage growth has been slowing, leaving households worse off.The squeeze means the major supermarkets are under pressure to keep prices low, creating tension with suppliers who want to pass on higher costs with the companies behind household brands such as Birds Eye fish fingers, Weetabix and Walkers crisps among those to have pushed through price rises in recent months. The slump in the pound’s value since June is estimated to have increased the cost of raw materials, such as sugar, wheat and packaging, by between 5% and 10% for UK food manufacturers, according to a recent report by analysts at Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency.Some of these price negotiations, which are usually carried out behind closed doors, have become high-profile public spats such as last year’s “Marmitegate” standoff between Tesco and consumer brands giant Unilever over the manufacturer’s plan to increase the price of a product range that spans Marmite, Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream and Comfort fabric softener. More recently Tesco has also removed a number of Heineken beer brands, including Amstel, Sol and Kingfisher, from its shelves after refusing to accept price increases the brewer blamed on Brexit and the budget.
