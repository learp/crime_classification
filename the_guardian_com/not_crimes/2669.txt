Already under scrutiny by a fictional police watchdog, DS Catherine Cawood appeared to have been censured by the actual Independent Police Complaints Commission this week. An IPCC survey has been released about public attitudes to the use of force by the police. Almost immediately, it was accused of blaming TV dramas for making people think cops use weapons and physical restraint far more than they really do. Illustrated with a picture of Sarah Lancashire’s DS Cawood in Happy Valley, the article listed other BBC dramas – Peaky Blinders, Luther and The Killing – and two Netflix shows (Orange is the New Black, Making a Murderer) as examples of series that might encourage audiences to feel that bobbies have turned psychotic.Intrigued by the apparent suggestion that Peaky Blinders is reducing faith in law and order (presumably by raising fears of being slashed by a razor in Birmingham in 1919), I read the 105-page report, which left me feeling that the reporter may have used inappropriate force to get that story out of it. Dame Anne Owen, who chaired the investigation, mentions TV just once; she lists three factors that influence public perception of policing as “personal experiences, news reporting and television dramas”. No examples of offending shows are given, and it is noted that the percentage of those who consider cops over-the-top was only 25% overall, although higher in some groups. What this means is that TV was mentioned only briefly, and that was in a list that included newspapers. But this deployment of Maria Sharapova-standard top-spin, with or without her heart drugs, is another illustration of the eagerness of parts of the media to demonise TV.

The survey finds that people of black or minority ethnic backgrounds, or with a history of mental illness, are considerably more likely to distrust the cops. But British TV, at least in recent years, has been notably careful to avoid the racial, social or medical stereotyping of criminals. For instance, screen villains frequently possess super-IQs, which is surely less often true in the real world. And, even if TV fictions have caused a few viewers to conclude that Dixon of Dock Green has been replaced by Robocop as the DVD of choice for the boys and girls in blue, the genre is called drama for a reason. The use of guns, tasers, batons and restraint holds is dramatic in a way that community officers strolling round their beat would not be. Completely good police officers make dull viewing, which is why both Happy Valley and Line of Duty (season three starts this month) have central characters under internal scrutiny. Scriptwriters and actors also aim to find the maximum tension and ambiguity in any situation. The IPCC report mentions as “good practice” the case of a local force that, suspecting a call-out would result in violence, arranged in advance for medical assistance to be on standby. If such a scene were included in a police drama, the precautionary phone call would come across as dark comedy or bureaucratic obedience rather than exemplary policing.It can’t be denied that TV does influence attitudes and beliefs. Doctors’ groups have complained that series such as Casualty and Holby City have given people an unrealistic expectation of the success rate of emergency resuscitations. Rare in clinical practice, heart restarts appear almost weekly in medical shows, for the same reason that taser strikes are more common on screen than on the street – real medicine and policing involve long stretches of tedium, but drama can’t afford to. Taking Happy Valley as a documentary representation of Yorkshire policing is like using The Great British Bake Off as a guide for what you’re going to have for tea. The only direct recommendation Owen makes in her report around visual culture is that officers should make more use of “body-worn video cameras”. If her advice is taken up, then, as has already happened with traffic cameras, the footage may become the basis for a reality TV series. Perhaps that would achieve the IPCC’s aim of convincing us that police response teams are nicer than you might think.
