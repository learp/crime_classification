I am sitting in my office, reading an information sheet titled Understanding Flexible Sigmoidoscopy. Although I’ve read it twice already, I keep skipping sections that I think won’t appeal to me. I’ve still managed to grasp its underlying message, which is: “You haven’t had a camera up your arse until you’ve had our camera up your arse.”A week later, I find myself in a hospital examination room. A nurse explains the entire procedure in a manner that leaves me unable to skip the bits that don’t appeal to me.“Here are your dignity shorts,” he says. “I’ll just leave you to pop those on.”Once I’m alone, I examine the shorts carefully. It is not immediately apparent how they might confer, or even preserve, dignity. I send my wife a text that says, “Just changing into my dignity shorts.” Her reply says, simply, “pic?”Eventually I am escorted down the corridor to another room, where the nurse tells me to lie on my left side with my knees drawn up. “Like a baby,” he says. Once I’m on the the table, another nurse adjusts the large ArseCam screen so that I have an unobstructed view.An hour later, I am home. “How was that?” my wife asks.“Fine,” I say. “I mean, you’re always quite conscious of the fact that, out of four people in the room, you’re the only one with a camera up his arse.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the GuardianOn Sunday, my wife’s sister and my niece come to lunch, bringing fresh asparagus from the country. My sister-in-law tells us a long story about hiring some kind of spiritualist, a self-proclaimed bringer of light, to banish a ghostly presence from an attic bedroom. “The thing is,” my sister-in-law says, “she was quite overweight, and I had to lead her up all these winding stairs.”“You imagine them being thin,” I say, “but I guess that’s a stereotype.”“When we get to the top, she’s like, ‘There’s definitely something here – have you noticed the change in my breathing?’. And I’m like, ‘Yes, I have!’ And she’s like, ‘I think I need to sit down for a minute.’”“How much does she cost?” I ask.“You pay what you think it’s worth,” my sister-in-law says.“And what did you decide it was worth?” my wife says.“Fifty,” her sister says.“You paid sixty,” my niece says.“I did,” my sister-in-law says. “I paid sixty.”Once, I would have felt an obligation to pour scorn on such a story, to mock the credulousness of the participants, to roll my eyes at the idea of confronting a ghost and, with help of two spirit guides, ushering it from the wardrobe into the light. But over the years I’ve realised that this impulse springs not from a desire to defend rationality, but from an unattractive urge to spoil other people’s fun. When conversation turns to the spirit realm, I mostly feel excluded, because I have nothing to contribute.Something occurs to me. “Speaking of bringing bright light to bear on a mysterious netherworld,” I say, “I, too, have been on a journey.”“Oh, Christ,” my wife says. “He’s going to talk about his colon.”“Is he?” my sister-in-law says.“A world where all is silent,” I say, “apart from the sharp tear of the velcro flap at the back of your dignity shorts.”“Do you want to see him in his dignity shorts?” my wife says. “I’ve got a picture.”“Imagine a dark corridor, full of twists and turns,” I say. “Potential malevolence lurking around every corner.”“But everything’s fine,” my wife says.“Not quite,” I say. “Because it turns out they have an even bigger camera.”
