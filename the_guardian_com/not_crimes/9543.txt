Juliette Binoche said on Sunday that she once confronted Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese about why they did not make films about women.Ma Loute (Slack Bay) review - Juliette Binoche goes mesmerically over the top in bizarre seaside comedy During a panel session at the Cannes film festival, the French Oscar winner recalled a conversation with Spielberg, a director she said she greatly admired, about why he rarely centers his films on female characters.Binoche said he defended himself, reasoning that he had made The Color Purple in 1985. Since then, all of his films have featured male leads. Binoche turned down a role in Spielberg’s Jurassic Park that went to Laura Dern. “Saying no to certain films is as important as saying yes, because it really defines you,” Binoche said, recalling a similar discussion with Scorsese. “He has a very feminine side of himself,” Binoche said of Scorsese, another director with whom she has yet to work. “But for me, he doesn’t explore it [in his work].”Binoche said she had had better luck with the French director Olivier Assayas. She said that once she phoned Assayas, to urge him to make more films centered on women, citing his love for Ingrid Bergman as an impetus. Following the conversation, he decided to make Clouds of Sils Maria, in which Binoche took one of three central female roles. The film played in the 2014 competition at Cannes and won Kristen Stewart a Cesar, making her the first American to be so honored.Binoche was speaking at the Majestic Hotel off the Croisette, on behalf of We Do It Together, a newly launched not-for-profit production company which aims to improve opportunities for women in Hollywood. She is on the advisory board, along with Jessica Chastain, Queen Latifah, Freida Pinto and Catherine Hardwicke.The company used Cannes as a launchpad, announcing as its first feature Together Now, an omnibus of short films directed by women of different nationalities. Robin Wright, Katia Lund and Patricia Riggen are among the seven directors. Binoche is slated to star in one segment.Binoche said she had been compelled to back such an organization for quite some time. “I felt the need to do something like this since very early on as an actress,” she said. “When you read scripts, you ask how you serve the story. Very early on, you see how you can be used. “What I’ve been seeing is that I’ve been refusing roles, instinctively, out of the need to talk about the feminine. The feminine has to have its place. It needs space, and we don’t have the space, so we have to take it.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Juliette Binoche won an Oscar for her role in The English Patient. Photograph: AlamyClouds of Sils Maria review – career-best magic from Juliette Binoche According to a recent study by the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School of Journalism, in the most popular films of 2007 to 2014, women had less than a third of speaking parts. A report from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, meanwhile, found that women directed just 7% of Hollywood’s top 250 films in 2014. Since winning her Oscar for The English Patient in 1997, Binoche has largely stayed away from Hollywood, acting mostly in European productions. Slack Bay, a Gallic farce, is playing in competition at Cannes.Asked why she had chosen such a path, Binoche said: “I was drawn to films that were very different, from different countries. I never chose to live in Hollywood because I didn’t conform to a mold. “American agents would sell me films to bolster my career, but I didn’t feel a connection. Staying in Europe was a way of resisting.“I knew I had to step away from the system. Being independent is the most important thing. I think as a free spirit, you have to be smart enough to be able to go in and then get out. Don’t belong to a system that rules your spirit.”
