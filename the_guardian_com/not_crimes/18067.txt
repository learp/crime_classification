Marina Lewycka is in the running to win the UK’s top award for comic fiction for a second time, after her novel The Lubetkin Legacy was shortlisted for the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize.The award, for fiction which best captures the “comic spirit” of the Jeeves and Wooster creator PG Wodehouse, comes with one of the more unusual honours among literary prizes: winning authors are presented with a Gloucestershire Old Spots pig named after their novel. Lewycka, who already boasts a pig named after her debut, A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian, which won the prize in 2005, now makes the cut for a story set in north London in the 21st century. Judge and broadcaster James Naughtie said it was a “warming, funny story”, and that Lewycka’s “ear catches everything, and she never loses her love of the absurd”.Terry Pratchett celebrates with a pig called Snuff With Lewycka the only female author to win the Wodehouse in its 16-year history – former winners include Terry Pratchett, Will Self and Jonathan Coe – one other female author makes this year’s shortlist. Hannah Rothschild was picked for her Baileys-longlisted debut, The Improbability of Love, which judge and Everyman’s Library publisher David Campbell called a “wonderful satire on the art trade, preposterous billionaires, Russian oligarchs and much else; a brilliant conceit faultlessly carried off”. It is also, added Campbell, “gloriously funny”.Two former nominees, Paul Murray and John O’Farrell, were picked by judges again this year, from 63 novels submitted. Murray was chosen for his third novel, The Mark and the Void, the story of a Dublin banker who decides to rob his own bank – described as an “achingly topical, clever, delightful tale of folly and delusion” by judges – and O’Farrell for There’s Only Two David Beckhams, a “gag-crammed, ridiculous and fantastical” tale that sees England reach the World Cup final in Qatar in 2022.The shortlist is rounded out with Paul Beatty’s The Sellout, in which the narrator starts a campaign to restore the town of Dickens, California, to glory by reinstating slavery. The writer and comedian Sara Pascoe, who joined this year’s judging panel, said that “the meaty dynamism of Beatty’s language and his fiery intellect combine to take literary comedy in an exciting and hilarious new direction”.Hay festival founder and director Peter Florence, who completed the judging panel, said the shortlist showed “extraordinary range”, moving from “black satire to a lighter ‘human comedy’”. “There’s writing that makes you laugh out loud, and truths told that make you shriek with delight and recognition,” said Florence, who will unveil the winner just before the Hay festival later this year.The shortlist in fullThe Sellout by Paul Beatty (Oneworld)The Lubetkin Legacy by Marina Lewycka (Fig Tree, Penguin Random House)The Mark and the Void by Paul Murray (Hamish Hamilton, Penguin)There’s Only Two David Beckhams by John O’Farrell (Black Swan, Transworld)Improbability of Love by Hannah Rothschild (Bloomsbury)
