Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy (above), the portrait of me and Ossie [Clark, her then husband], was painted in our Notting Hill flat. This is actually the bedroom, but the light came in better there, so we moved some things around, like the shagpile rug, to make it look like a living room. David couldn’t get Ossie’s feet, so I think the rug was useful in the end. Ossie has a shirt with a bit of my print on the collar, which was nice. The cat in the picture is actually Blanche, but David said Percy had a better ring to it. I have had a lot of cats in my life, but Blanche was a special one.What I see in the mirror: Celia Birtwell David took lots of pictures. I wasn’t wearing that dress in the pictures: I had just got back from Morocco, so I was probably in a jellaba. It’s a bit of a mystery how this dress, an Ossie Clark design, ended up in the picture. I didn’t realise I still had it until I was going through things in the attic when I was putting together the Ossie exhibition in Warrington in 2000. I sold it last year through Kerry Taylor Auctions and it went to Manchester Art Gallery.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   British fashion designer Ossie Clark with Birtwell, in 1971.

I had studied in Salford and came to London to do various tedious jobs. Alice Pollock, Ossie’s partner, asked me to do a couple of prints one season, then I just carried on. Ossie was an amazing cutter, and I am rather two-dimensional. We didn’t talk about the prints too much. He just said: “Do what you like.” It was great for me because there were no parameters. The first time I spotted David was at Portobello market. I was with a friend who knew him. He just stood out – he always has. He had on a corduroy jacket – and had the dyed blond hair. Ossie was better friends with him, and used to stay in his studio. I think he finds me a little bit ridiculous, but there is a fondness there. If I amuse him, then that’s a compliment. It definitely works both ways – he’s very funny. Being a muse is a strand of my life I never anticipated. I’m a textile designer and I love doing that. I am very proud of the series of drawings David did in the 70s: he was very keen on me then and that shows in the drawings. He also did a drawing of me for the cover of French Vogue in the 80s. Posing was the unknown, but it has become part of me, like that painting.David will always tell you if you look nice. I will dress up a bit when I see him because I know what he likes. Sometimes, he won’t say anything and sometimes he’ll give you a compliment, which is lovely. He puts colours together brilliantly. I remember going to Paris and wanting one pink boot and one blue, and him encouraging me. He always said a little disarray is nice, if something is not quite perfect. He wore odd socks for a long time. He had a white hat recently that was very bedraggled and I asked if he would like me to wash it. Eventually, my partner and I tracked it down to a shop on Jermyn Street [in London] and sent him a new one. He was thrilled. I think he’s quietly pleased with his fashion reputation. Recently, he’s been wearing bespoke suits from Savile Row, but also a really ratty cashmere cardigan that he painted in every day, so it’s full of paint.David Hockney’s retrospective at Tate Britain opens on Thursday.
