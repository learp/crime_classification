10.00pm GMT22:00Not a vintage episode, but certainly a pleasant diversion from the fact that we could be watching the next episode under the rule of a former Apprentice boss. We could ALL be working for Sir Alan come next Thursday. Which is why I won’t be here again because I will be crying into a hamburger and bourbon smoothie.No, but seriously, come back next week. Let’s stick together in these trying times and I’ll see you in two weeks.

Makes it much easier to get through I find. That, and biscuits.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.57pm GMT21:57Rebecca lives to fight another (probably one more) episode.

She’s so going.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.54pm GMT21:54Are you frowing in the towel, asks Alan to JD. Is he frowing in the towel? And if he is, what does it mean? Sitting on the front row at a fashion show, wearing only a towel? Let’s all picture that.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.54pm GMT21:54“I shouldn’t be here,” says Paul who goes onto admit he’s had “blow-ups”.

Rebecca? Seriously? Are they going to cut her because she’s not made much of an impression? He won’t, in a million years, cut Paul. Paul’s a geezer.
