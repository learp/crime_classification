Throughout history libraries have reinvented themselves from being agents of oppression and censorship to preservers of information and catalysts of invention. The oldest intact library structure can be found in Turkey, in the ruins of the ancient city of Ephesus. Guarding its doorway are four stone statues signifying wisdom, character, knowledge and judgment. But libraries in 21st century Britain are a source of intense debate, with 441 closed since 2010 and 149 under threat this year.When everything is downloadable or deliverable, are libraries ultimately doomed? No, says Lauren Smith, researcher at Strathclyde university and representative of the voices for the library campaign.She says there is a misconception that libraries are not a statutory service whereas, in fact, the Public Libraries and Museums Act of 1964 states that councils not only have a legal duty to provide libraries but also to promote and encourage their usage. That’s something councils don’t always realise: “Consultations come out, often with the decision already made to close libraries,” says Smith. When councils do become aware of the law, “plans quickly change”, she adds.With 265 million visits to public libraries last year, popularity isn’t the problem. That stacks up very favourably compared to British cultural touchstones such as Premier League football (13 million visitors in 2015) or West End shows (22 million). The problem is that libraries aren’t treated fairly as cultural institutions. Instead councils are forced to contrast them with acute public services, such as child protection or social care. This is an impossible comparison. Robbie Millen, literary editor of the Times, recently argued that councils are incapable of appreciating the real value of libraries as a symbol for culture, art and literature. He believes the answer is privatisation.I share Millen’s frustration at library closures but believe public libraries are still worth fighting for, because they remain the most effective – albeit imperfect – way of ensuring free access to quality literature. There is no quick-fix private alternative waiting in the wings.And councils are not, as Millen suggests, lousy library custodians. They have simply been forced to make very difficult choices about how to spend what money they have. Given the immense cultural importance of libraries, it is unfair to place their fate in the hands of councils alone. There should be a ringfenced fund for libraries direct from central government – an arrangement similar to education, where the money is passed through councils to schools or directly to schools, would work. Central government should show its commitment to Britain’s cultural life and help councils solve this problem. Whether as a service or a symbol, libraries matter.Liam Booth-Smith is head of communications at Impower.
