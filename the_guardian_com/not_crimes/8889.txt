Sophie Someone is a tale about a teenage girl uncovering the astonishing mystery behind her identity. The novel is based in Brussels, Belgium, where Sophie, her parents and younger brother, Hercule, live in a small worn down apartment.Although, Sophie is constantly questioning her parents about where they once lived, because even though Sophie hates to admit it, her earliest memories are of her and her mother leaving on a train from England.As the novel continues, Sophie starts to piece together the puzzle and eventually finds herself running away from home with her new friend. When she finds herself face to face with the grandmother she never knew she had, she finds out the true story of how and what really had happened.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Overall, I think that this novel was extremely well written, and the plot was exceptionally engaging. The book is written in a style that I have never seen before.Hayley Long replaces every day, ordinary words with new and more exciting words. For example, the word ‘friend’ is substituted for the word ‘freckle’, or the word ‘heart’ is exchanged for the word ‘heater’.The novel Sophie Someone was well strung together, had strong, unique characters and was a sweet, lovely tale in general. I would rate this an 8/10 because it was a wonderful book that I would recommend to children ages eleven to fourteen.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
