Gods Of Egypt, the Gerard-Butler-starring fantasy epic that recently bombed at the box office was mainly notable for inspiring a brief spurt of Twitter outrage over the casting of Scottish and Australian actors as warring Egyptian deities. That rancour, however, obscured a no-less-intriguing story: the rumblings in the movie industry that, what with Gods Of Egypt’s worldwide gross of $72m on a budget of $140m, the fantasy epic had ceased to be a viable genre. In the wake of such duds as Wrath Of The Titans (which made $305m, almost $200m less than its predecessor, Clash Of The Titans) and box office flops Seventh Son and Vin Diesel’s Last Witch Hunter, it’s unlikely that we’ll ever see a muscle-bound Hollywood actor in a loincloth again.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The fantasy genre is not the only one that feels doomed. Studios are happy to splash out money on a Marvel franchise, a Fast And Furious or a Kung Fu Panda. They’re equally as excited to spend almost no money on a bare-bones horror series like Paranormal Activity or Insidious. What they don’t want to do any more is gamble on medium-budget movies that can’t be endlessly sequelised and don’t play as coherently in Mumbai and Beijing as they do in Brooklyn. It means that movies that once enriched our cinemagoing lives are now facing extinction.Gods of Egypt review – ridiculous, offensive and tremendously fun Movies like the sports picture. Put an American male of a certain age in a room and show them a Hoosiers or a Rudy. Within seconds, they’ll be openly weeping. But that most reliable of All-American Genres is in steep decline. Kevin Costner drew few takers for 2014’s Draft Day ($29.5m). A similar fate befell the Clint Eastwood-directed, Justin Timberlake-starring baseball movie Trouble With The Curve in 2012. Jon Hamm’s 2014 baseball inspiration-athon Million Dollar Arm barely clawed back its budget, and Will Smith’s American football brain-damage drama Concussion (one star in the Guardian) felt like the final nail in the genre’s coffin. America lives and breathes sport. The 2015 Super Bowl drew 114 million viewers. Maybe the triumphs of fictional sports characters will always seem smaller-than-life when the real thing is so readily available.

The quality of its participants is in steep decline; no longer Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal but Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel in When In Rome or Amy Adams and Matthew Goode in Leap Year (both in 2010, both terrible). The romcom portrait of the successful career woman yearning for her childhood fantasy of the perfect wedding to the man of her dreams has become increasingly archaic in the era of Girls. The success of unsentimental sex comedies such as Trainwreck suggests there’s a future for fresh takes on the genre, but TV is where the romcom has found a new home. Catastrophe, The Mindy Project, You’re The Worst, Master Of None, New Girl, Love, Togetherness – all these shows feature diverse ethnicities, body types and flawed characters, ie the exact opposite of what we got from romcoms in film form.Sex on film has fared little better. Consider the erotic thriller, that steamy 90s genre that usually featured Michael Douglas. Basic Instinct wrote the formula for the R-rated film noir. Steamy titles such as Wild Things, Sliver and Jade enjoyed a lengthy afterlife on cable. But then the genre slumped to the ground like a blood-spattered negligee. The first Basic Instinct made $353m in 1992. Sharon Stone returned for the 2006 sequel, which grossed only $39m. In the intervening years, the clamour for lucrative PG-13 ratings in the US has seen serious adult depictions of sex largely disappear from mainstream cinema, rendering the erotic thriller largely moot. (50 Shades Of Grey is a notable exception – though it would be a stretch to call it an erotic thriller.)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Michael Douglas and Demi Moore in Disclosure. Photograph: RexThese are tough times for other once-popular genres: the musical (Rock Of Ages), the high-school movie (The Duff), the dance movie (Step Up: All In), the political satire (Our Brand Is Crisis) and the spoof (50 Shades Of Black) are all dangerously close to dropping off Hollywood’s cliff-face. The good-cop-in-a-sea-of-corruption genre that once gave us Serpico and Prince Of The City has grown weary, as John Hillcoat’s Triple 9, which opened to a less-than-stellar $6m, showed.Fifty Shades of Grey review – making a bad fist of it | Peter Bradshaw But there are glimmers of hope. The western has always teetered near the brink of extinction, with studios often labelling them expensive and old-fashioned (John Ford had trouble raising the finances for Stagecoach, in 1939). But they keep surviving because actors, writers and directors remain infatuated with them.The modern western has, especially in the late 2010s, filled the frontier with manure: Johnny Depp’s The Lone Ranger, Seth McFarlane’s A Million Ways To Die In The West, Cowboys & Aliens. But it recently received a shot in the arm from Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained ($425m) and The Hateful Eight ($152m so far on a $44m budget). The latter movie’s Kurt Russell also starred in Bone Tomahawk, a film that points to a different way to keep the genre movie alive: by blending it with another. The film mixed old west values with lashings of blood, suggesting that the horror-western could be just the jolt the genre needs to launch it into the future.

Photograph: AllstarMaybe that’s just what these ailing genres need: directors with original perspectives to bend them into interesting new shapes. After all, the teen horror genre was a twitching corpse until Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson’s self-aware slasher Scream. The old-man action movie was as active as Charles Bronson until Liam Neeson turned up in Taken. And let’s not forget that Star Wars revived the hoary old space opera by splicing it with religious mysticism and war movie derring-do. There’s always some weird genius figuring out a way to breathe new life into a formula, and another presumed-dead genre ready to take the world by surprise. My money’s on talking-baby pictures making a comeback…
