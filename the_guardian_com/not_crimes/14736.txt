Those Bowie tributes rated – from the Brits to Springsteen, Madonna to Iggy A tribute to David Bowie will be held at the Sydney Opera House in May, featuring the Sydney Symphony Orchestra alongside a number of high-profile Australian musicians, including You Am I’s Tim Rogers, Adalita, and Steve Kilbey from the Church.The concert, called David Bowie: Nothing Has Changed, will also star iOTA, Deborah Conway and Jack Ladder, with each performer choosing which Bowie songs they will cover.Singer-songwriter iOTA said the British musician had “amazing depth” and never disappointed. “He came to the end of an amazing life with a lot of class and integrity. He’s taught other artists how to be in the world and how to do it right.”The show will cover a 30-song set list, which creative director Amanda Pelman said will include some of Bowie’s more obscure numbers, alongside hits Changes, China Girl, Life on Mars, Under Pressure, Let’s Dance and Starman.“The most important thing to me was how Bowie’s canon would be portrayed with real integrity and nuance by the orchestra and artists with a sympathetic voice to the work,” said Pelman, who worked as a casting agent on the musical adaptation of Academy Award-winning film Priscilla Queen of the Desert.'He was like a god': how David Bowie left his mark on some of Australia's finest musicians “It would be foolish to suggest we can represent the whole of Bowie’s canon; the 30 songs are both the highest-selling songs and some of the most quirky performances.”Bowie died in January, 18 months after he was diagnosed with cancer. An outpouring of grief followed, along with tribute concerts and performances around the world. He was remembered at the recent Grammys with a tribute by Lady Gaga, and at last week’s Brit awards when New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde covered Life on Mars.David Bowie: Nothing Has Changed is at the Sydney Opera House on 19 and 21 May
