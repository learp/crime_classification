Wake up. Remove dog from head. Ponder 100+ items of clothing in drawers so overstuffed they no longer close properly. Feel defeated by this cluttered life. Then rub face against vintage silk kimono, purchased on impulse in a charity shop on Orkney. Perk up. Put on same jeans as day before but with different top. Done.This is my morning routine, and according to research by Marks & Spencer and Oxfam, I’m not the only one building up a collection of clothes I will never put on. The research, which polled 2,000 wardrobes for the “Shwopping” campaign to recycle clothes for charity, found £2.7bn worth of unworn items stored throughout Britain. All those stacks of identical Gap jeans are eating into our time, too: women spend an average of 17 minutes each morning, or four days a year, deciding what to wear (for men it’s 13 minutes).“As a nation we only wear 44% of our wardrobe on a regular basis,” says the campaign’s spokesperson Andrew Soar. “That means 3.6bn garments left unworn in the country’s wardrobes. Release their power by giving them to Oxfam.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   We only wear 44% of our wardrobe on a regular basis, according to the ‘Shwopping’ campaign.

On average, each wardrobe in the UK contains 152 items, of which 57 are never worn or haven’t been worn in the past year. I more or less stopped buying clothes three years ago when I had a baby and took voluntary redundancy. Since then, my clothes have come from charity shops – with the odd Uniqlo splurge. I soon discover that there is something particularly sad about an unworn item of clothing originating from a charity shop. Twice as rejected, twice as pointless.Of my 164 items, at least only 25 fall into the never/rarely worn category. The reasons for abandonment are various, ranging from sentimentality (the green corduroy skirt bought in Buenos Aires on the holiday of a lifetime) to shame (I should never have bought that Celia Birtwell for Topshop dress, therefore I will pretend I never did). What else? A 1950s tartan jacket that was deeply ironic when I lived in Glasgow but deeply conventional since I moved to Edinburgh. A black dress with gold coins attached to the asymmetric hem that is as silly as it sounds. An impressive selection from Stella McCartney’s first H&M collection. The afore-mentioned kimono. And a pair of white lace hotpants that Shirley Conran, author of 80s bonkbuster Lace, once gave me. Don’t ask.Top 5 charity shop finds: From Thom Yorke lyrics to Mozart scores Soar estimates the resale value of my 25 items using the Oxfam price guide. The total comes to a staggering £630. I’m shocked and inspired to have a clear-out, returning much of the clothing to the charity shops from whence they came. Which is double the recycling, or really, really pointless, depending on how you look at it. It’s the Stella McCartney that really bumps up the value – a silk dress goes for £120 and a pair of trousers for £80 – but the kimono plays its part, too. “Ooooh, I’m going to price it at £60,” Soar says when I reluctantly describe it to him. That may be three times what I paid, but some things are never worth giving up.
