Exhibition of the weekDelacroix and the Rise of Modern ArtFor that drug-addicted bohemian art critic and poet Baudelaire, the definitive modern artist was Eugène Delacroix. Picasso agreed when he painted his own version of Delacroix’s Women of Algiers, which recently sold for an eye-watering price. Delacroix is the last of the romantics and the first of the moderns: a sensual, even depraved connoisseur of sex and violence as aesthetic themes whose visions of harems, mass suicides, massacres and struggles with angels are painted with infinite sensitivity to colour. Matisse was as much in his debt as Picasso, while Van Gogh admired him deeply. This ought to be great.• National Gallery, London, 17 February-22 MayAlso this weekBotticelliThis exhibition includes no less than 30 of Botticelli’s drawings illustrating Dante’s Divine Comedy – some of the most beautiful drawings in the world, in other words.• Courthauld Gallery, London, 18 February-15 MayPerforming for the CameraThe art history of the selfie is laid bare in what is bound to be a popular exhibition.
