Four waxwings, very rare and beautiful winter visitors from the Arctic, were seen in Chapel-en-le-Frith last week. The bird is an irregular visitor to Britain, and usually, when it does appear, comes in considerable numbers; like the crossbill and sandgrouse, it "invades" our islands. We may, therefore, keep a lookout for others, and it is to be sincerely hoped whoever sees them will not attempt to shoot them but will leave them to delight the eyes of others. The waxwing is an easy bird to recognise; it has a fine chestnut crest, which is raises at will; its plumage is chiefly chestnut-brown, but there is black on the face and chin, and white and pale yellow on the wings and tail. But the characters in the bird's plumage from which it gets its name are the curious tips of some of the wing and tail feathers; these are like small bits of bright red sealing-wax. The four at Chapel were feeding on hips, the fruit of the wild rose, a favourite winter food of the bird. Formerly, the waxwing was known as the Bohemian chatterer, but we must look upon the word Bohemian as referring to its nomadic habits and not its place of origin.A correspondent reports a kestrel in Seedley; it is interesting to know that this fine falcon now ventures to come into the town. The increased interest which is being taken in birds is, without doubt, helping to protect them.
