A breeze is picking up, but the morning cloud has cleared and it's still hot. The early afternoon sun burns down through the canopy, lighting up the ride which curves away through the woods. I turn down a grassy track. The ground is solid, but there are a few pools of water. Horses' hooves have dug deep hollows in the clay which have hardened. It is like walking on lines of sharp-edged earthenware pots.The warm air has brought out the butterflies – dozens of colourful, bouncing shapes: large and small whites, commas and dark meadow browns. Groups of bright, burnished orange butterflies – silver-washed fritillaries – engage in flickering dogfights all around me. A dark butterfly settles on a bramble at knee height. The white flashes on its dark brown upper wings and pretty light brown and white underwings show it is a white admiral.Chiffchaffs chirrup and feed deep in the dense foliage. Another butterfly drops down from above. At first it looks like another white admiral, but it is larger and has a fast, "skimming" flight. I try to follow it but it stays just out of range until it suddenly turns back towards me, passing by at arm's length. I catch a glimpse of a large "eye" marking on the underside of its forewing as it flies past – it's a female purple emperor.I've seen the elusive purple emperors here before, from early to mid-July, but although egg-laying females can still appear, rarely have I seen any this late. The persistent sun of the past few weeks seems to have prolonged their season. If there are any males still around – the iridescent mauve-winged male is affectionately known as "His Majesty" among the dedicated emperor-lovers – they will be basking or flying high in the canopy overhead, guarding their territories from their "master tree" vantage points. I watch the tallest treetops, high above the tiers of green leaves.My vigil is finally rewarded when two large purple emperors appear, flapping their wings and circling each other above a tall oak. A wing flashes blue in the sun before the two butterflies drift from view.
