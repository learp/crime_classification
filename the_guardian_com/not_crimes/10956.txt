Exhibition of the weekSicily: Culture and ConquestThe island of Sicily has been a prize fought over by all the cultures of the Mediterranean world since ancient times. This exhibition tells how Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs and Normans conquered and reconquered Sicily. In spite of enmity and war, their arts merged and fused to create such multicultural masterpieces as the Cappella Reale in Palermo, with its gorgeous mixture of Christian and Islamic styles. A great advert not just for Sicily but for the unexpectedly enlightened Normans.• British Museum, London, 21 April-14 August.Also showingJim WoodallThe experimental space Matt’s Gallery, where some of the defining British artworks of the past few decades began their lives, will soon be moving to a new location. This is the very last show in its renowned east London venue and, with an anarchic spirit this gallery has done so much to uphold, it is on for just one day only: this Sunday.

Photograph: National GalleryIn Greek mythology, the cyclops Polyphemus was a one-eyed giant who lived among the massive rocks of Sicily’s volcanic Mount Etna coast. Turner translates this geographical setting into a fantastic vision of light, height, water and fire. The Greeks on their ship deliberately insult the giant as they sail away, but they are making a mistake; he is Poseidon’s son and that blazing sea will soon turn to a stormy, monster-populated hell and kill all but one of them.• National Gallery, London.Image of the week      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Stuart Haygarth walked from Kent to Land’s End, picking up the trash he found on beaches – and arranged it into collections.
