GreyWhat is the nub of such a plain grey day?Does it have one? Does it have to have one?If small is beautiful, is grey, is plain?Or rather do we sense withdrawal, veiling,a patch, a membrane, an eyelid hating light?Does weather have some old remit to mockthe love of movement, colour, contrast –primitives, all of us, that wilt and diewithout some gorgeous dance or drizzle-dazzle.Sit still, and take the stillness into you.Think, if you will, about the absences – sun, moon, stars, rain, wind, fog and snow.Think nothing then, sweep them all away.Look at the grey sky, houses of lead,roads neither dark nor light, carsneither washed nor unwashed, peoplethere, and there, decent, featureless,what an ordinariness of businessthe world can show, as if some level leverhad kept down art and fear and difference and lovethis while, this moment, this dayso grey, so plain, so pleasing in its way!Let’s leave the window, and write.No need to wait for a fine blueto break through. We must live, make do.“If small is beautiful, is grey, is plain?” The abbreviated triple-question in line three of this week’s poem recalls the title of EF Schumacher’s influential essay collection of 1973, Small is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered. Edwin Morgan would have been attuned to such radicalism. The intelligence and creative daring of his work never overwhelmed its humanity. His quest in this week’s poem for the virtue that might exist in the “grey” and “plain” evokes something of the stubborn democracy of his politics. And it permits him to investigate his own poetic impulse, the fiery fuel of so many glittering flights “from Glasgow to Saturn”.Grey comes from Morgan’s 2002 collection, Cathures. The book’s title derives from the old word for Glasgow, the city to which the poet, its official laureate before he was appointed Scotland’s makar, so unassailably belonged. The Cathures poems would in many cases date from his late 70s, a time in the most vibrant creative life when mortality casts shadows. As the poem’s final tercet declares, energies must be summoned: it’s well for a poet approaching 80 not to sit about waiting for a “blue sky” epiphany.  The shadows in the poem are thickest around the listed substantives of the fourth and fifth lines: “withdrawal, veiling, / a patch, a membrane, an eyelid hating light (?)”. They’re applicable to mood and cloud cover, but also, the last trio in particular, may connote bodily trauma.  Weather prevails as absence of weather. The speaker leans towards resisting its suspected “old remit” to mock the colour and movement we “primitives” helplessly applaud. For “weather” read “time”, perhaps. (This will turn out to be a kind of “carpe diem” poem.) He complicates the grey by taking it on, studying its external manifestations in a second stanza which seems to begin with a command to meditation, and finds its way to delight.  Morgan was a master of form and added to its infinite variety. In Grey, he conjures a shape that’s casually new. The opening stanza of nine lines has circled its themes in unhurried exposition. With the middle stanza, there’s consolidation, and the clinching couplet confirms the impression of a stanza built from some of the bricks of the sonnet. The speaker courageously lists the lost phenomena (sun, moon, even fog, etc) before following his own brusque advice: “Think nothing then, sweep them all away.” The scene picked out lacks light: there are the “houses of lead”, for instance, and the cars, interestingly described as “neither washed nor unwashed” – as if, ideally, they might have been shining with rain or cleanliness, but are, in actuality, neither bright nor grubby. People in this street scene are also, perhaps, “neither washed nor unwashed”. They are further equalised by being placed “there, and there”, and not scattered more dramatically “here and there”. Uniformity is expressed in an uneasy para-rhyme (“featureless / business”). To find the “nub” and value of grey requires aesthetic self-denial, and acquiescence to the industrial clockwork of the “level lever”, keeping down “art and fear and difference and love”. Line 20, with the slower pace of its extra foot, is beautifully lingering, but restrained by syntactical context, an exclamation of near-delight about the “ordinariness of business” and the decency of the ordinary. The very alliteration (level, lever, love) says Rejoice, and the quick succession of three strong rhymes (blue, through, do) brings to the verbal texture, after all, a flash of “some gorgeous dance or drizzle-dazzle”. A Morgan poem could never simply lie down and content itself with being grey.• Other more recent works by Edwin Morgan published by Carcanet include A Book of Lives and The Midnight Letterbox: Selected Correspondence 1950-2010.
