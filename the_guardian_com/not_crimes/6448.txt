David Cameron is to be congratulated for being the first British prime minister to visit the north of Sri Lanka since the country's independence in 1948 and seeing for himself how it has developed following the end of the long civil war there (Report, 12 November). As an organisation which has worked with communities here since 1989, we know he will see a country which is rapidly lifting itself out of poverty, but also one where there are still allegations of human rights violations from the war which need to be investigated.The Commonwealth People's Forum has now concluded its reflections on equitable growth and inclusive development beyond 2015, and some delegates will be visiting the north. However, in the next 55 years the greatest threat to Sri Lanka will be not be from war, but from climate change. Sri Lanka is particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and weather-related disasters have the potential to set back any gains made in agriculture, fisheries and even services such as tourism. It is therefore essential that progress is made in agreeing a legally binding climate-change treaty at the UN talks in Poland and that adaptation rises up the political agenda of the conference. As the devastating typhoon which has hit the Philippines has shown, the need for global action to combat the effects of climate change on islands has become urgent.Margaret GardnerPractical Action, Colombo, Sri Lankaâ€¢ Given the terrible situation in the Philippines, I have emailed the BBC asking that they give over all the money raised by the Children in Need appeal on Friday to the children and people of the Philippines. I hope there isn't a child in Britain as needy as they are.Gary StanilandTimperlay, Cheshire
