Netflix has announced it will produce its first original Indian series, an adaptation of the bestselling Indian author Vikram Chandra’s novel Sacred Games, in a fresh attempt to boost subscribers in India.The series will be produced in Mumbai in Hindi and English, targeting local audiences, but will also be available to Netflix subscribers around the world.The new series will “delve into the financial capital’s intricate web of organised crime, corruption, politics and espionage that lie beneath India’s economic renaissance”, according to a statement released by the company.Filming schedules and release dates are yet to be announced, but the series could mark an important first step for Netflix, which has so far struggled to take hold in India, where it launched earlier this year.In a country where a movie ticket can cost less than a dollar, the streaming-video service remains a premium product. But, as US audience growth slows, India represents a huge potential market. “I am confident that all the colour and vitality and music of the fictional world I’ve lived with for so long will come fully alive on the large-scale canvas provided by Netflix,” Chandra said in the statement.Madhu Mantena, co-founder of Phantom Films, which is pairing with Netflix to produce the new show, said “we are extremely confident that together, we will create some exciting and groundbreaking television content”.Commentators online were quick to urge the company to use local talent in the new series. One commentator on Twitter wrote: “Assuming the cast is subcontinental, it is interesting that Netflix might help erode Hollywood’s whitewashing.In recent years tech behemoths such as Apple and Facebook have taken a particular interest in India, where growing access to smartphones has brought a fifth of the country’s 1.3 billion population online. The new show will mark Netflix apart from its rival streaming platforms in India, such as Eros Now, Box TV and Spuul, which offer vast selections of films and television shows in Hindi and various regional languages at much cheaper rates. Critics have been quick to note that only a small section of Netflix’s vast library is available to Indian subscribers, even though a basic subscription of 500 rupees ($7.50) is not much cheaper than what subscribers in the US pay.Buffering issues in many parts of India where connectivity is weak, and the unnervingly bureaucratic process of passing Netflix’s international selection through India’s overzealous film censor board are added hurdles for Netflix as it attempts to take a slice of India’s booming movie market.However, as Netflix starts producing original content in India, the biggest challenge may be the huge local market of pirated film and television shows.“The problem in India is that as soon as a new movie or TV show comesout, you can get a pirated version immediately online,” said Ishani Shukla, who subscribes to Netflix. “It’s easy to stream or download movies online, and there’s not much regulation to stop people making copies of it. Even on the roadsides, they sell knock-off DVDs of new films.“That will be a bigger problem for Netflix than any competing companies or lousy internet connections.”
