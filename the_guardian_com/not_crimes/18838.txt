Stressed out by a fast-paced daily life and binge-watching the latest hit TV shows? Norway may have the answer with its latest slow TV instalment: watching the ebb and flow of the sea, for 12 hours, without interruption.Since 2009, the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK has been experimenting with live, slow-paced programmes, broadcasting a seven-hour train journey across the country from east to west, a six-day trip by cruise ship from south to north, and 12 hours of knitting – and it all started with a show on shearing a sheep. The programmes have proved popular with viewers, so the latest idea is to live broadcast the world’s strongest tidal current, called Saltstraumen, near the city of Bodoe, about 50 miles (80km) north of the Arctic circle.“People will experience the calm of watching the current,” said Gisle Forland, one of the two presenters of the show, due to be broadcast on 20 May, from midday to midnight. “It will be in the same style as the other (slow TV shows). We will show nature, with the camera rolling and a little music, and people who tell the history, geology and nature of Saltstraumen,” he said. Saltstraumen is a narrow strait linking two fjords, where sea water can flow through at speeds of up to 25mph, creating maelstroms famed at least since Viking times. Lights, camera – and not much action, in this “current affairs” show.
