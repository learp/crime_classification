Such is the allure of climbing Mount Everest that this week it emerged an Indian couple faked their ascent and doctored photos of their triumph at the summit. They have now been banned from climbing the mountain for 10 years by Nepalese authorities.Why do we still feel the urge to “conquer” mountains? Why, in ever increasing numbers, are we scaling Everest, or continuing to climb sacred places such as Australia’s Uluru in spite of the objections of traditional owners?Why are we venturing to the Galapagos Islands or taking a cruise ship to Antarctica to marvel at the incredible wildlife, in the knowledge that our visits there are assisting in destroying their fragile ecosystems? “Because I can” is no longer a viable answer.Indian couple banned from climbing after faking ascent of Everest In this year’s climbing season six people, including an Australian woman, have died on Everest. The Nepal Mountaineering Association said overcrowding and bottlenecks high on the mountain may have contributed to the fatalities.In Australia, the traditional owners of Uluru ask people not to climb the rock, erecting a sign at its base explaining that it is a sacred site. Still, tourists continue to climb it, despite 35 people dying while trying. Last year a Taiwanese man had to be rescued after spending the night stuck in a crevice of Uluru.So why climb?We can’t claim, like earlier European explorers could, that it’s for the benefit of humanity – mapmaking, trading routes, anthropology, botany. Now, with much of the surface of the Earth “conquered”, the challenges are personal ones. It’s for the bucket list.It’s to be the first Snapchatter on Everest. It’s for the physical challenge. It’s to be the “first Indian couple on the mountain”. It’s to see how close you can get to death. This testing-yourself-against-the-limits, Pepsi Max-style tourism is a far cry from the early days of climbing Everest. It’s individualistic, ego-driven adventure that is all about pitting you, the individual, against nature – conquering it, and winning.This type of tourism has to be ego-driven because only that mindset would allow you to override the wishes of the Indigenous people that find your climb on their sacred site offensive, or be wilfully harmful to the environment, or risk your life or those you’ve paid to assist you.

Norbu Tenzing, the son of history’s most famous Sherpa, Tenzing Norgay, says his father would be upset to see the circus that is modern Everest. He told the Guardian: I think he would be quite horrified with the way things have turned out. Since the time he was climbing there’s been a complete change, a shift in the way people climb Everest and what motivates them … The sense of people going on an adventure, working together, doing something nobody’s done before, with a sense of comradeship and working together – that spirit doesn’t exist now. It’s just a total service industry, where you’re fulfilling the egos of western climbers and people from south Asia who want to test the limits of how close they can get to death, at great expense of the Sherpas.If you haven’t seen the excellent Australian-made film Sherpa set on Everest, go and see it. The majestic backdrop answers a lot of the questions “why”: Everest is just achingly beautiful. The documentary follows a group of Sherpas and a commercial operator as they negotiate the fallout of the 2014 avalanche that killed 16 Sherpas. It’s a film about workers’ rights but it also highlights the increasing safety risks on Everest due to overcrowding and global warming. The most treacherous part of the mountain – known as the icefall – is more unstable due to a hotter planet. The director of Sherpa, Jennifer Peedom told me: “The idea of conquering a mountain is a relatively recent concept. Just 300 years ago, the idea of even setting out to climb a mountain would have been considered lunacy.” The question of why we still climb Everest is quite complex, she says. “There are some people for whom the urge to push themselves to the limit and take risks is literally in their DNA, just like those early explorers. But these days, there are very few new frontiers to be crossed. People with this particular DNA need high levels of stimulation to feel alive and Everest represents this place where they can test themselves.”Sherpa review – peril in the shadow of Everest They test themselves, but at what cost? The days of the early explorers are well and truly over. Our personal challenges (even if for noble reasons like raising money for charity, or for self-development, or goal-setting purposes) are no longer serving a greater good. The mountain has been conquered over and over again. Now big bits of it are sliding off it. There are queues to get up there. There is a financial benefit to the Sherpas and their communities but even so, they are getting a relatively small amount of the pie. There are other things that we need to conquer much more urgently. There are social and environmental problems that need solving right now. The sort of people we should throw at those challenges are men and women who have shown strength, grit, determination, fortitude, mental and physical strength, and courage. The sort that could climb Everest. If you want to be a real hero, why not make it your life’s work to help fight or solve the challenges posed by climate change? The next wave of explorers should seek to protect something beautiful rather than conquer it.
