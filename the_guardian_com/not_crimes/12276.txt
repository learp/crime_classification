Martin Shkreli, who bought the only copy of the Wu-Tang Clan’s 2015 Once Upon a Time in Shaolin for $2m, made good on his promise to leak excerpts from the album in celebration of Donald Trump’s shock victory in the American presidential election. Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli)Ok so I have unreleased wu, Beatles, 2pac, nirvana, radiohead, Hendrix, brand new, smiths, Elliot smith, Ramones... What do you want first?November 9, 2016Shkreli, a former pharmaceuticals boss notorious for hiking the price of Daraprim, a drug used by Aids patients from $13.50 to $750 a pill, started streaming excerpts of the record on Periscope in the early hours of Wednesday morning, as Trump’s victory became apparent. Excerpts from the record, with Shkreli’s commentary, can be heard on YouTube. Once Upon a Time in Shaolin has only been heard once in public, when 13 minutes from the 31-track album were unveiled at MoMA PS1 in New York. The rappers decided to make only one copy available, which was sold at auction to the highest bidder. They stipulated that the copyright for the record lasts 88 years.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest A character who relishes his supervillian status, and who recently offered the chance to punch him in the face for charity, Shkreli told a radio station that he bought Once Upon a Time in Shaolin in order to flaunt his wealth. “There’s a lot of things rich guys do to show off,” he said. “The press thing is a part of it, but it’s also to show your friends, or your last company, like, ‘Hey, fuck you, look at me, I got this $2m album.’ Guys do that all the time.”The purchase is said to have displeased the rappers, with Ghostface Killah describing him as a “shithead” to TMZ. However, RZA, the group’s musical mastermind was more equivocal, telling Bloomberg: “He bought it, he can do what he wants. The beautiful thing about art, from my standpoint, is that it has no discrimination.”
