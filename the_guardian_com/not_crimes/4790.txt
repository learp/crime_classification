The search has begun for a new chair of Arts Council England after Peter Bazalgette announced he will step down next year after one term in the job.Bazalgette said there were a number of new opportunities he would like to take up “before I pop my clogs”. He will remain in post until January 2017.He told the culture secretary, John Whittingdale, last summer that he only wanted to serve one four-year term.“I will be 63 next January,” said Baz, as he is known in the art world. “I spend a lot of time on the Arts Council and that’s fine, I love it. But the question is: do I want to do it for eight years? I am very active in the creative industries and intend to continue to be active but I want to do a few other things.”“It is in a way with regret but on the other hand you get into your 60s and think, ‘God, what do I want to do?’”Use the arts to boost the nation’s health | Peter Bazalgette His stewardship of ACE is viewed as a success, particularly the lobbying of government which resulted in a funding freeze in the last spending review when big cuts had been feared.“We have got Arts Council funding on a secure footing for the next four years so it is not a bad time to bow out,” he said. “If you ask me one thing we’ve achieved in the past three or four years, it is that we have really pushed forward the public policy understanding of why we put public money into the arts. We are in a good place and there are huge opportunities for the future.”He paid tribute to the “sophisticated and mature” generation of leaders making the case for the arts today, organisations such as What Next?, the Creative Industries Federation and the No Boundaries conference. “Ten, 20 years ago, arts leaders – quite rightly in many ways – would stand on their barricades and scream to the heavens they needed more money. Why? Because they need more money and in a way good for them. But now you have arts leaders who say these are the benefits, this is why we must do it ... It is a much more sophisticated and inspiring generation of arts leaders.”Bazalgette hopes his replacement will be in post by October so there is an overlap.“I have been extremely proud of the work we’ve done making the case for investment in the arts and ensuring that investment benefits more places. The Arts Council is in a strong position to ensure our arts and culture continue to flourish.”Whittingdale paid tribute to Bazalgette, who replaced Dame Liz Forgan as chair after Jeremy Hunt, then culture secretary, told her he wanted a change of leadership.“Sir Peter has done a fantastic job leading Arts Council England over the past three years and has brought real enthusiasm and expert knowledge. He has made an invaluable contribution to the arts in this country and I would like to thank him for the incredible work he has done championing the sector.”There were some eyebrows raised when Bazalgette was appointed three years ago because of his background as a TV producer and the creator of Big Brother.Quentin Letts wrote in the Daily Mail: “He is a glorifier of grot, a projector of piffle, a man who has made millions by filling our television screens with the inane, coarse and, occasionally, the mentally unwell. Peter Bazalgette made a fortune by harvesting misery and tarnishing the standards of broadcasting.”Darren Henley, ACE’s chief executive, paid tribute to Bazalgette: “Baz has been an outstanding leader for the arts and culture sector,” he said.“He’s a listener, an advocate and a strategist; a great communicator who has reached out across the arts and culture sector, and beyond, building relationships and forming alliances. He’s never been afraid to tell it as he sees it; to speak truths as well as to encourage; and to look for new solutions to old problems. “He’s promoted the digital agenda, challenged our approach to diversity, and introduced new ways of thinking about finance. He’s earned the respect of the arts and culture sector – and our stakeholders across government departments.“The recognition of the importance of arts and culture to this country in the recent spending review is a testament to the sustained and intelligent championing of public investment in art and culture by Baz throughout his time here.”
