To mark International Women’s Day I want to tell you about a woman who has inspired me in so many ways. Top 10 feminist icons in children's and teen books Needlework, my latest book is, in part, a story about tattooing. When I started to write it, I had no tattoos. Now I have two, and I want more. I’m not going to write about the guinea pig on my ribcage, an illustration from a book by Dick King-Smith called I Love Guinea Pigs, which is both a great title and an accurate statement. I’m going to write about the second one, a small dark star on the inside of my left elbow, right in the soft crook where the doctor takes your blood. I got it when a book I wrote was nominated for an award, to remind me that sometimes people like the things that grow out of my brain. And to keep working at it. But I choose that one to remind me of a particularly cool lady, whose crisp, cruel, gentle, heart-breaking writing can be cutting and kind, shallow and sincere, quippy and true all at once. People called her “deceptively sweet.” Her name was Dorothy Parker, and her writing is amazing.Needlework by Deirdre Sullivan – review Dorothy wrote reviews, short stories, screenplays and poetry. She was known for her wit. But behind the wit, there is this depth of feeling. Sometimes, when you write funny things, people think that’s all they are, something to laugh about. A gentle thing. There was nothing gentle in Dorothy’s humour. She used it like a razor, to slash at things. To cut them down to size. She abhorred racism, and hypocrisy. Pippi Longstocking: a feminist, an optimist and a free thinker She loved clothes, men, and social justice. She founded the Hollywood Anti-Nazi league. Sometimes, people made fun of her when she spoke out against things, like fascism because she was a woman who liked to drink and smoke and look pretty, and to them that meant her thoughts couldn’t be as deep or as kind or as valid as other people’s. They under-estimated her. And often, she under-estimated herself. But she still kept trying. Because it was the right thing to do. Dorothy’s humor, and in particular her beautiful heartbreaking short-stories, revealed a knowledge of how people work, and a very open heart. Enough Rope, her first poetry collection is funny, but also very sad. There’s an acknowledgement of the pain of being human. When bad things happen in life, one of my coping mechanisms is taking a step back and laughing. And sometimes that laughing is as much of a release as crying is. Letting something out. Releasing it, so you can carry on.

Photograph: Picasa/PRThe Constant Reader was her byline when she wrote for the American magazine Vanity Fair. And I’m a constant reader as well. I find it hard to understand people who aren’t hungry for story. In my handbag, there’s generally a book, a spare book, and a notebook. In case I run out of stories and have to make my own up at short notice. How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? When I chose a tattoo to remind me to keep on writing, I stole Dorothy’s. Because her life and work is inspiring to me. Her biographers disagree over where exactly she got a tattoo, and what is was, but most of the sources I read said it was a little blue star on her elbow or thigh. She got it on a mad night out, and regretted it, and hid it from people afterwards. My star is different. It’s black, my favourite colour, and the size of a little mole. I like to look at it throughout the day. It feels encouraging. You can be funny. You can be sad. A person is not just one thing. We are many. And on days when I feel like what I’m working at is dreadful and not working out at all, I remember that Dorothy felt like “a plain disagreeable child with stringy hair and a yen to write poetry”, like she was only following in the footsteps of other, better women, in dirty sneakers.  She worked hard, and cared a lot and felt deeply. That’s not a bad legacy to leave, never mind words that are beautiful, razor-sharp and tender as the youngest cut of meat.  She was a star, but a dark star. Impossible to define, impossible not to admire. Her work is collected in the Portable Dorothy Parker, and I’d recommend reading it, if you’re a young adult, or any other sort of adult, who likes brilliant, crushing things.
