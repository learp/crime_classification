Who is she?A 20-year-old Finn born Alma-Sofia Miettinen, who looks like a cybergoth reimagining of a young Adele and sounds like Beth Ditto had she been raised on tropical house. Her distinctive voice – a rib-rattling, frayed-around-the-edges clarion call inspired by her childhood love of punk – first gained attention in her homeland in 2013, when she finished fifth on Finland’s version of Pop Idol. Her audition featured a then pink-haired Alma (“I’ve had all the colours you could ever imagine: pink, blue, green, yellow, red, purple, blonde, brown,” she told one interviewer) tearing into Nina Simone’s Feeling Good like an unhinged Sia while sporting a silver bumbag. She went on to cover both emo Finnish goth-rockers the Rasmus and big-voiced TV talent show staple Jessie J. After the show, she toured with Finnish rapper Sini Sabotage, before signing to Universal Music in March this year.

The song was also given an international push after Elton John played it on his Beats 1 radio show (“I need to meet him in person so I can really understand it,” a shocked Alma told German website Easywriters . Karma has since been joined by the house-tinged new single Dye My Hair, which deals with how love can make people do crazy things, such as dye their hair blond. “To be honest, in real life I would never do that! That is actually the biggest lie I’ve ever told anybody,” she said. Both songs are taken from her debut EP, also called Dye My Hair, which features the relatively subdued ballad Knock, and – just to really showcase that voice - an acoustic version of Dye My Hair. Earlier this month, she supported fellow Scandinavian pop rebel MØ in Helsinki, which was swiftly followed by her debut UK gig in east London.This being 2016, surely she’s collaborated with a faceless EDM DJ?Absolutely! Her collaboration with DJ/producer Felix Jaehn, Bonfire – about how the constant chatter of “haters” fuels her fire to succeed – recently made the German Top 3.What next?Expect Karma and Dye My Hair to soundtrack every overly emotional teen-centric TV show trailer in 2017.The Dye My Hair EP is out now via PME Records/Polydor
