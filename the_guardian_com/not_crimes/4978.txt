Another weekend, another 20 miler. I think I’ve reached the point which, now on marathon number six, I recognise as peak ‘why the hell do I do this to myself’ moment. Not close enough to the race (just under seven weeks) to feel a shot of adrenaline, and still at least a couple of 20-plus runs to go. Still, at least there was consolation in the form of pizza after yesterday’s hot and windy effort - and Olympics to watch on the telly.Looking at the running blog’s own Strava group, I’m certainly far from alone with getting in some big miles last week. Top kudos to James, of Advent Running, who ran over 132 miles last week, 100 of them in one go, coming second in the Centurion North Downs Way 100. And I thought nearly-75 miles for the week was good going ... Guardian running club on Strava - do join!And on the subject of Strava, their new feature, Beacon, launched last week. It’s essentially a live tracking facility - up to three of your approved contacts can follow you live, on a map, in real time. You need to have your phone with you, of course, but it’s a great feature for those who worry about their friends or loved ones out on a run on their own - or those who in turn worry about being out there by themselves, particularly in more remote locations. (You need to have Strava Premium to use the feature, but the people you chose as your contacts don’t have to be members). So, over to you. How was your weekend running, did in involve PBs, pizza, watching Olympians on the telly or all three of the above?
