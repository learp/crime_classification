The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has intervened to delay plans to close eight of West Berkshire’s nine libraries.West Berkshire council made the proposals earlier this year in an attempt to save £730,000 by closing the eight branch libraries – as well as two mobile libraries – which would leave the district served by just one branch library in Newbury. The campaign group Friends of Hungerford Library said the plans would have a “devastating impact”, and the council has received over 2,000 responses to its consultation about the cuts.On Wednesday, the council told the BBC that seven branches and a mobile library would be saved from closure for the time being thanks to £1.4m in “transitional funding” from the government, £475,000 of which will go to libraries over the next two years.The local paper Newbury Today has revealed that the council took the decision following an intervention by the DCMS, which has come under criticism from campaigners for failing to prevent library closures.A report published by the council (PDF) showed the authority was told that a “detailed needs assessment, to inform any changes to the way libraries operate” was required before closures went ahead. This was because “the council will fail in its equality duty, and also its statutory duty to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service under the Public Libraries and Museums Act, if it proceeds with a major reduction in its libraries service without due process”.Nick Poole, chief executive of the libraries body Cilip, said he welcomed the intervention. “We are pleased to see decisive action by DCMS to maintain public libraries in West Berkshire and signs that government is prepared to intervene where councils may be considering cutting statutory services,” he said.In December, Cilip launched a campaign, My Library By Right, that set out to “hold the government to account for [its] legal duties” to keep libraries open.“I believe we’re starting to see a pushback against public library cuts and greater awareness of legal rights and duties as highlighted in Cilip’s My Library By Right campaign,” said Poole on Friday. “This is welcome temporary relief, but to secure library services in West Berkshire and in every part of the country, we urgently need to see a joined-up plan led by government.”Friends of Hungerford’s Helen Simpson welcomed the announcement of the delay.“We are of course thrilled at the news that the government have stepped in and insisted that West Berkshire now complete an independent needs assessment,” Simpson said.Ian Anstice, a librarian who has tracked the 463 library closures since the coalition government came into power in 2010, wrote on his website Public Libraries News: “Normally, the DCMS barely notices but this time the radical decision by West Berkshire to close all but one of its libraries, with insufficient regard to its population, has prompted a different response.”“It’s worth pointing out that the minister is unlikely to stop the drastic cut to just one library once it has done so, but at least the ministry is saying that the law needs to be followed first.”A DCMS source confirmed that the delay follows urgent discussions with West Berkshire council, part of a series of recent discussions with local authorities including Swindon.A DCMS spokesperson said: “Local authorities have a statutory duty to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service and we have powers to ensure they comply.”
