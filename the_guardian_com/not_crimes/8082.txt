Quick, think of a TV show more dangerous than The Jump. You can’t, can you? That’s because there isn’t one. Those wildlife shows, where grown men charge poisonous snakes then swing them around willy-nilly in front of the camera? Not as dangerous as The Jump. Those survival shows, where Bear Grylls runs off into the wilderness and eats rancid meat for a fortnight? Not as dangerous as The Jump. You’ve Been Framed, which at this stage is just a non-stop compilation of people getting booted in the nads by a goat? Still not as dangerous as The Jump.The Jump is out there alone. It’s a meat-grinder now. It’s only two episodes old, but Rebecca Adlington has already dislocated her shoulder. Linford Christie has done his hamstring in. Tina Hobley broke her arm in two places. Mark-Francis Vandelli fractured his ankle. Beth Tweddle hurt her back so badly that just the fact she can walk again is headline news. They could set Sunday’s episode in a burning firework factory, or a wind tunnel full of dirty syringes, and it would still be statistically safer than it is right now.Things have got so bad that reports today suggest Channel 4 has actually boarded up the course ahead of a safety review, amid fears that the next episode will end with Davina McCall tearfully crawling out from beneath a quivering pile of shattered corpses. Given that Sunday’s show will revolve around a speed-ski event, this sounds like quite a good idea.Obviously someone needs to question why a show like The Jump – which nobody would watch if it wasn’t explicitly a reality star injury delivery system – is allowed to exist in the first place. But that can wait. For now, The Jump needs to focus on limping towards the finish line without disfiguring any more beloved public figures. Allow me to suggest some much safer substitute events that The Jump should implement with immediate effect.

Instead, let’s put the celebrities on £3.99 Argos sledges, take them to a park and push them down a moderately sloped bank. First one to get to the bottom and run back up to the top wins a Happy Meal.Snowball fightObviously this one needs to be carefully policed because, the way this series is going, it’s inevitable that Arg from TOWIE will get hit in the face so hard that both of his eyeballs explode. But, hey, better to fling a loose mound of snow than to be pinged off the end of a ski-jump at top speed with minimal training and an unsatisfactory insurance policy.Competitive snow-angelingThis won’t look very good on television, because there literally isn’t a soul on earth who wants to see Ricky from EastEnders writhe around on the floor as if he’s riddled with tapeworm, but it’s either this or another trip to A&E. Beggars can’t be choosers.Parking a car on a frozen car parkNow this I would watch. When I was at school, I once saw a furious language teacher skid around impotently while trying to park her 2CV in the staff car park after a heavy snowfall. To this day it remains the funniest thing I have ever seen. Just think how much funnier it would be if it was Brian McFadden driving that 2CV.Wee calligraphyTen celebrities. Thirty pints of Berocca. Whoever writes their name most legibly in the snow wins. Television gold.
