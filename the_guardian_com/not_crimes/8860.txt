The most-ordered cocktail in the United States is the margarita. But during the run of the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which continues until 21 August, it may be supplanted by another south-of-the-border classic: the caipirinha.You don’t have to dig too deeply into Brazilian drinking habits before you bump into the caipirinha. It’s the national cocktail and is made with Brazil’s most common and popular indigenous spirit: cachaça, a rum-like distillate. (Don’t call it “Brazilian rum” unless you want to start an argument. The country lobbied hard to get to the American government to recognize the spirit as a distinct product native to Brazil.)The caipirinha isn’t too far removed from its warm-weather drinking buddies, the margarita and daiquiri. All share the tropical trinity of sugar, lime juice and spirit. In the caipirinha’s case, half of a lime, cut into wedges, is muddled with sugar at the bottom of a rocks glass and then topped with cachaça and ice. It’s a simple drink, even if it does require a little elbow grease to make.Americans first began to see the caipirinha pop up at bars in the 1990s, hot off the heels of the mojito craze, another equatorial drink that involves muddling – in the mojito’s case, mint.“A caipirinha is right on par with a mojito as a classic, refreshing, summertime drink,” said mixologist Ivy Mix, an owner of the Brooklyn bar Leyenda, which specializes in drinks made with Latin spirits. The caipirinha remains the cocktail most closely associated with cachaça . However, cachaça’s fortunes in the States have changed significantly since the dawn of the new century. “Before, most of the cachaça exported from Brazil used to be industrial cachaça,” said Thiago Carmosina, co-founder of Yaguara Cachaça, and a fifth-generation member of a cachaça-producing family. “It was column-distilled. Lately, you have a bunch of artisanal brands who have begun to export abroad.” Most white, unaged cachaças are made with a column still, which produces a clean but less complex spirit. Recently, they have had to share space on American liquor store shelves with cachaças made from an old fashioned pot still, which produce a more funky, flavorful spirit, and the aged versions of the spirit that are more commonly drunk in Brazil – often straight. According to Carmosina, cachaça can be aged in barrels made from any of twenty kinds of wood, many of them native to the country.

Mix, who carries four different versions of the Novo Fogo brand, thinks so: “It all tastes totally different.” The Tanager expression, for instance, which is aged in both oak and arariba (Brazilian zebrawood) barrels, “tastes like cinnamon nut crunch”.Novo Fogo also sells single-barrel cachaças, imitating the popular proprietary practice pioneered by the bourbon industry. Bars are able to sample and select a specific cask of liquid. Novo Fogo then bottles the barrel’s contents and ships it to the bar, which sells it exclusively. In this brave new world of wide cachaça choice, the tried and true caipirinha can been seen as both a boon and a burden. “I think it’s a positive to start with,” said Carmosina. “It’s a nice way to open doors so they explore the cachaça world. Then again, if they only know the caipirinha, they’re only going to drink that. In the long term, it hurts us. In the short term, it helps us a lot.”You can get a caipirinha at Leyenda, but don’t expect to see it on the menu. “We don’t really make that many caipirinhas,” said Mix. “I like to make cachaça drinks that aren’t so pigeonholed.”Caipirinha recipe ½ lime, cut into quartersBarspoon of sugar2 ounces unaged cachaçaPlace lime wedges and sugar in a heavy-bottomed rocks glass.
