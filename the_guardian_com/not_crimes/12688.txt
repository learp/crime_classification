President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance on last night’s Late Show with Stephen Colbert to undergo a mock job interview and urge millennials to vote in the upcoming election.'The lesser of four evils': John Oliver is not a fan of Gary Johnson and Jill Stein He sat down with the host to discuss his future job options after he leaves the White House next month. Colbert quipped: “55 – a tough time to start over for a man.”Colbert then took on the character of “Randy”, who proceeded to interview Obama for an unspecified role. “I don’t see any promotions for the last eight years, not always good,” he said. “Can you explain that?”“There wasn’t a lot of room for advancement in my last job,” Obama replied. “The only one with a more powerful position was my wife.”Colbert, or Randy, then asked the president why he’s leaving his current job. After hearing his reply, Colbert said: “Okay, little tip. When you say staying at your job would be unconstitutional, what employers hear is that you stole office supplies.”In his new job, Obama claimed he would like “a nice corner office or at least an office that has corners in it”.The real reason for Obama’s appearance then became clear as he took the chance to make a plea to millennials to vote in the upcoming election.“This is the most important election of their lifetimes,” he said. “They have the opportunity to make history and the results in November could change their lives forever so they have to get out there and vote.”While Colbert said Obama couldn’t endorse a candidate on the show, given that it’s on a network, he asked him a final vital question: “Would you care for an extra fiber nutrient bar that’s traveled to over 100 countries or this shrivelled tangerine covered in golden retriever hair, filled with bile that I wouldn’t leave alone with the woman I love?”Obama picked the nutrient bar.
