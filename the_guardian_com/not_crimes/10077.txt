Scientists have confirmed what humans have known for millennia: drinking alcohol removes inhibitions surrounding sex. A study by researchers in Switzerland has unsurprisingly found that beer drinking made it easier for volunteers to view explicit sexual images, and the effect was greater for women than for men.Plastered in Pyongyang: North Korea launches its first beer festival However, no change was seen in levels of sexual arousal.Another not entirely unexpected effect was a boost in positive behaviour. After downing half a litre of beer, study participants were more attracted to happy faces and social situations.The findings go some way towards providing an explanation for “beer goggles” - a slang term used to describe how the influence of alcohol can make an unattractive person appear suddenly desirable.Lead researcher Professor Matthias Liechti, from Basel University Hospital, said: “The effect of many medications and substances of abuse have been tested on various tests of emotion processing and social cognition.“However, although many people drink beer and know its effects through personal experience, there is surprisingly little scientific data on its effects on the processing of emotional social information.“We found that drinking a glass of beer helps people see happy faces faster, and enhances concern for positive emotional situations.

The remaining participants were given non-alcoholic beer.The volunteers were then asked to perform a range of tasks including a face recognition test, an empathy test and a sexual arousal test.Beer drinking had no effect on levels of the hormone oxytocin, which is thought to act as a “social lubricant” and assist bonding between individuals.
