The last thing that expectant and new parents dream of is having to plan and pay for a funeral for their baby or child (Society, 16 November). For many parents their baby’s funeral is the first they have had to think about, and for some it is the first they have ever attended. Organising a funeral when you are shocked and in the depths of grieving is not at all easy, and it’s something that parents haven’t planned or budgeted for. Many hospitals will offer a free funeral or cremation, but there will often be a charge for burial as the cemetery will charge for the space. Additionally parents who choose to plan a private funeral can often do this without charge as many funeral directors will not charge for baby or child funerals. When a baby or child dies we have found that hospitals are usually very helpful in directing parents to good (and free) funeral directors, particularly when there is a bereavement midwife in post who has this knowledge. Sands welcomes consideration being given to this very sensitive and important issue. This would help lift the burden of grieving parents who are on low incomes and find themselves in this position.Erica StewartBereavement support and awareness specialist, Sands• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
