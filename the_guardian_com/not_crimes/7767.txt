Britons should prepare for birdsong, daffodils and other signs of spring by the end of the week, with temperatures expected to reach 16C (61F) in parts of the UK.The Atlantic Azores islands, famous in British history for The Revenge, Sir Richard Grenville's battle against 53 Spanish galleons, is sending appropriately warm weather in the mildest westerly front of the month. The result will be exceptionally mild weather in the south, according to the Met Office, with the promise of similar blessings for northern England after an initial dousing with heavy rain.Sleet and snow in Scotland, and frost that has persisted from the weekend in northern English uplands, are gradually being driven back across the North Sea.The sunny start to spring will not last long however, with the UK's propensity for changeable weather in evidence for the rest of February and much of March. Colder weather is predicted to make a half-hearted comeback next week and the Met Office is warning of a prolonged rearguard action, especially in Scotland and the north.Its maximum, 30-day forecast says: "During early to mid March, daytime temperatures may start off below normal across some northern areas, bringing an increased risk of some wintry weather. However, a recovery to near or above normal values seems likely."Night-time temperatures follow a similar pattern, with frosts perhaps most likely at first. Further south, temperatures more likely to be around average, or perhaps slightly above, both by day and by night. Rainfall amounts look likely to continue below average in eastern and perhaps southern areas, but elsewhere average rainfall is most likely. Sunshine amounts should be above average in all areas."Signs of spring have proliferated across the UK, with Fairhaven woodland and water garden in the Norfolk Broads extending its half-term I Spy event, and the Guardian's country diarist Dr Phil Gates leading a plant, bird and insect detective tour in Durham in early March.Last year remains the spring to beat, with 2011 temperatures rising after a bitter early winter to the warmest since 1910.The forecast holds little cheer for Monday's drought summit â€“ and neither do recent weather records. March to April last year was the driest since 1893 and the third driest since the beginning of regular rainfall records in 1766. Current weather patterns show no sign of extra rainfall coming to the rescue, especially in the most vulnerable areas, central England and the south.
