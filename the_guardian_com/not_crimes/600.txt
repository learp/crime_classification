The X-Men are heading to the small screen.Days after X-Men: Apocalypse topped the weekend domestic box office, Marvel and FX have announced plans to launch a full season of Legion – a new TV series set in the X-Men universe – helmed by Fargo showrunner Noah Hawley. The eight-episode first season will debut in early 2017 on the cable platform.Can X-Men: Apocalypse pull together 16 years of mutated plotlines? Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens will star as David Haller, who in the comics is son to X-Men founder Charles Xavier (played by James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart in the film franchise). The show finds Haller struggling after being diagnosed as schizophrenic. A strange encounter with a fellow patient leads him to believe that the visions he sees might indeed be real.Parks and Recreation star Aubrey Plaza will also feature, while Fargo actors Jean Smart and Rachel Keller round out the cast. “Just as he did in reimagining Fargo, he is bringing an entirely new aesthetic and sensibility to the enormously popular and richly represented X-Men world,” the FX original programming president, Nick Grad, said in a statement.

Fox meanwhile has Hellfire, based on the Marvel comics group The Hellfire Club, in the works. In other comic book news, another Fantastic Four film is still a possibility, despite the spectacular bombing of the recent reboot with critics and audiences.Appearing on Josh Horowitz’s Happy Sad Confused podcast, co-writer/producer Simon Kinberg said a followup is “a big part of [Fox’s superhero] plan going forward”. “I would love to continue making movies with that cast,” he added.
