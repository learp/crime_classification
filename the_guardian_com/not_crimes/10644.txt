Three major Sydney art institutions – the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW), Carriageworks and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia (MCA) – have announced a partnership for a series of biennial exhibitions in Sydney, which will survey “the latest ideas and forms in contemporary Australian art”.The National: New Australian Art, announced on Tuesday, will take place over a six-year period, with editions presented in 2017, 2019 and 2021.The single curated program was touted as one that would enable a more strategic approach to programming by the institutions, connecting three of the city’s key cultural precincts – The Domain (AGNSW), Redfern (Carriageworks) and Circular Quay (MCA).The director of AGNSW, Michael Brand, said: “This major new initiative highlights what Sydney’s leading art institutions do best – that is, create a vibrant cultural life for the city and state.”Artists at all stages, from emerging to established, will be represented in the program. They will be drawn from across Australia, including Australians living overseas, and the work of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists will feature prominently.What Australia needs to learn from Victoria's arts funding push The director of MCA, Elizabeth Ann Macgregor, said an emphasis would be placed on “profiling new work and enabling innovative new commissions”.The director of Carriageworks, Lisa Havilah, said the program would also “chart the rich diversity of contemporary practice featuring artists that work in dialogue with other disciplines including performance, dance, music and screen”.The program has been called a counterpoint to the Biennale of Sydney and the only large-scale multi-venue exhibition series in Sydney to focus solely on contemporary Australian art. It will take place in the off-years of the Adelaide Biennial, which also surveys Australian contemporary art. The Biennale of Sydney chief executive, Ben Strout, said this was “good news” for Australian artists and arts audiences in Sydney.“The National: New Australian Art will provide tremendous opportunities for engagement with contemporary Australian art in the years between the Biennale’s international exhibitions.”Curators for the program’s 2017 edition are Havilah and Carriageworks curator Nina Miall, AGNSW’s contemporary art curator, Anneke Jaspers, and the head curator of Australian art, Wayne Tunnicliffe, and MCA’s director of curatorial and digital, Blair French.The National: New Australian Art takes place at Art Gallery of New South Wales 30 March-16 July 2017 and at Carriageworks and the Museum of Contemporary Art 30 March-18 June 2017
