The parents of a teenager who was mauled to death by a polar bear have said his funeral was a "wonderful tribute to his achievements".The service celebrating the life of Horatio Chapple, 17, an Eton pupil, was held at Salisbury cathedral in Wiltshire on Friday. He died and four others were injured when the bear attacked the group on a British Schools Exploring Society expedition to Svalbard island in Norway on 5 August.His parents, David and Olivia, and brothers, Titus and Magnus, said in a statement: "We are so grateful for the incredible support, generosity and kindness everyone has shown to us."The service today was a wonderful tribute to Horatio's achievements in the 17 years of his life."We would like to thank all who made the service possible."So much love has been shown to us in the last few weeks and we hope that Horatio will be remembered for how he lived his life â€“ full of love, hard work and kindness."We will always be very proud of him."During the service, Magnus Chapple performed, along with friend Nick Hampson, a song called Horatio, which he had composed in memory of his brother.Horatio's godfather Harry Cunliffe gave the address. The service was led by the dean of Salisbury, the Very Rev June Osborne, and the canon precentor, the Rev Canon Jeremy Davies.Osborne said: "Horatio was an exceptional young man who clearly had an attractive spirit of adventure and bravery."His death is not only tragic for his family but has reminded us all of the slenderness of the thread which separates life from death and the suddenness with which it can be broken."His funeral in Salisbury cathedral celebrated his life and allowed us to mourn his dying, whilst also reminding us of the things which give us hope in the face of such sorrow."At the time of his death, Horatio's relatives said he had been "so excited about his plans to be a doctor" and praised his "amazing sense of humour and ability to laugh at himself".His family, from Bishopstone, near Salisbury, added: "He was on the cusp of adulthood and had a clear vision of where his life was going."Four other members of Horatio's party were injured in the attack.One of the expedition leaders, Michael "Spike" Reid, 29, was eventually able to shoot the bear and end the attack, but not before he was also set upon, suffering injuries to his face and neck.Fellow leader Andrew Ruck, 27, from Brighton, Scott Bennell-Smith, 17, from St Mellion, Cornwall, and Patrick Flinders, 16, from Jersey, also suffered serious wounds.
