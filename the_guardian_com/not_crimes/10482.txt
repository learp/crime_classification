Film-maker Nate Parker, on an awards campaign for his debut film The Birth of a Nation, addressed a rape allegation made while he was a student in 1999.During his sophomore year at Penn State University, Parker and his roommate, Jean Celestin, who shares co-story credit with Parker on The Birth of a Nation, were accused of raping a female student while she was unconscious. Parker was ultimately acquitted of the charges in 2001, and Celestin’s conviction was overturned.Although there was no retrial, the case led to a lawsuit filed by the Women’s Law Project against the university over its treatment of sexual assault. That suit was settled for a cash sum and a vow to review procedures for sexual assault cases at the school. Court documents show that the woman eventually dropped out and attempted suicide.Parker addressed the trial and its aftermath on Friday in an interview with Deadline, as he continued on a campaign for The Birth of a Nation. “I was sure it would come up,” Parker said. “It is there, on my Wikipedia page … I stand here, a 36-year-old man, 17 years removed from one of the most painful … moments in my life. And I can imagine it was painful, for everyone.”“I was cleared of everything, of all charges,” the film-maker added. “I’ve done a lot of living, and raised a lot of children. I’ve got five daughters and a lovely wife. My mom lives here with me; I brought her here. I’ve got four younger sisters.”No prison for Colorado college student who ‘raped a helpless young woman' Parker also urged women to “stand up, to speak out when they feel violated, in every degree, as I prepare to take my own daughter to college”.“The reality is, this is a serious issue, a very serious issue, and the fact that there is a dialogue going on right now around the country is paramount,” he said. “It is critical.”Parker, however, told Deadline that he will not revisit the matter while promoting The Birth of a Nation. “I will not relive that period of my life every time I go under the microscope,” he said. “What do I do? When you have a certain level of success, when things start to work, things go under the microscope and become bigger and bigger things.”In an email to Deadline, Celestin added that he’s “since moved on” from the case and is “focusing on [his] family and writing career”.Parker’s film, which centers on the story of Nat Turner, a former slave who led a revolt in 1831 to free African Americans in Virginia, won the Grand Jury Prize at this year’s Sundance film festival, and was bought in a $17.5m worldwide rights deal to Fox Searchlight.
