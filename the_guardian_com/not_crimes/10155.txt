They might not receive the fame or prestige of the performers, but at every festival there’s an unsuspecting outlier; a badly washed, beating heart of every event who keeps everyone safe, fed or at the very least entertained. Here are five bona fide totems of the UK scene, none of whose names you’ll see in fancy typeface on a festival poster, but without whom our weekend carnivals would be a much drearier place. Sam Haines: VIP toilet serviceSam is one of the brains behind When Nature Calls, a VIP toilet service now found at festivals up and down the country. Their USP is that their private lavs, operated on pre-booked pay-as-you-go scheme for £2 a visit, are checked over by a cleaner after every use. They’re on a mission to take the angst out of your ablutions, and their medical-grade facilities can be found at the likes of Bestival, Isle of Wight festival, Boardmasters and Cornbury. Sam is a veteran of over 25 festivals, since taking over the business with his brother Ollie. He reckons the company – formed when its previous owner, an IBS sufferer, spotted a gap in the market for a festival loo experience that didn’t make you feel as if you were taking a dump in some kind of fetidentering Hades – has had in the range of 500,000 uses of their toilets. The most embarrassing part of the job, apparently, is punters forgetting to lock the toilet door and the cleaners going in after them. Most would take that over a visit to the long drop any day.Shaft: founder of the Fabulus of Unicorns      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Reminding us all how to party … ShaftReferring to Shaft as “secret” might be a misnomer, because if you’ve been to a festival in the last decade, it’s likely that you’ve seen him basking somewhere in the sunrise’s florid glow. Frankly, he’s a hard man to miss. Last year Shaft – a former breakdancer and advertising art director – found a very 2015.0 type of fame when he was the subject of a Vice documentary investigating the hedonistic, 3,000-strong Fabulus of Unicorns movement that he is the horn-bearing, sparkle-draped, self-appointed founder of.Times have changed for him and after years of addiction he’s completely sober, and though he doesn’t go to commercial festivals in the UK now, he still rates BoomTown. “Everyone thinks I’m gay and I really like women. So I’d rather go to a place where I can snog everyone,” he says. Nowadays he’s often found touring the world’s conscious communities and festivals under his new Tantricornia guise, teaching workshops in “sexual awakenings”.Sean Cunningham: leader of the The Funemployed“I’m 52, and having a mid-life crisis which is actually going incredibly well,” says Sean Cunningham. Sean is the man behind Facebook group The Funemployed, a kind of Gumtree for the UK’s free-minded and freelance festival worker community. Whether you’re a fire-breather looking for a gig at Secret Garden Party, or a carpenter looking to help craft one of BoomTown’s multitudinous stages, it’s where you’ll find someone seeking that very skill.Sean himself is a fashion photographer, taking snaps backstage at the fashion industry’s biggest shows. He’ll be found roving in the shadows at many a festival, with his highest profile role being a manager at Glastonbury’s near-mythical Rabbit Hole bar, where he “keeps an eye on stuff, and keeps the hot tub hot”. More than anything it’s clear that Sean is a man who knows people, a pleasure-seeking go-between; a facilitator of favours, friendships and, yep, probably even fun.Katie MacLeod and Michelle O’Loughlin: Chill Welfare      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Keeping everyone together … Katie MacLeod and Michelle O’Loughlin of Chill Welfare“After three days at a festival I feel so drained, like I need to not talk to anyone for a couple of days. I’ve just given so much to everyone else.” So says Katie MacLeod, who, along with Michelle O’Loughlin, is one of the two founders of Chill Welfare; a social enterprise that tours the country’s event providing welfare support for festival-goers. Their primary aims are to reduce the harms of drugs and alcohol, assist the mental health of punters and provide advice on sexual health, and since forming last year they’ve had a presence at Creamfields, Latitude, BoomTown and Secret Garden Party.Both Katie and Michelle have day jobs at the National Scottish Drugs Forum, with Chill Welfare essentially their hobby. The passion and empathy they possess, along with their team of volunteers, who give up weekends to work each festival, are inspiring to behold, and festival-goers up and down the country are safer and happier thanks to Chill Welfare. Chris Haritakis: Cornucopia      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A long way from a watermelon in 1992 … Chris Haritakis of CornucopiaChris’s first foray into outdoor catering was selling watermelon from a decorator’s pasting table at a Dire Straits concert at Woburn Abbey in 1992. Since then, his family-run Cornucopia company has evolved an empire of stalls and vans selling well-sourced and delicious Greek food, serving souvlaki wraps and mezze platters everywhere from Glastonbury to Womad, to Love Supreme and Cambridge folk festival.Chris can’t put an exact figure on the amount of people he’s served down the years, but it’s easily tens of thousands; he explains that “festivals are full-on, but in an enjoyable way”. He says Glastonbury 1997 was the biggest disaster – “It still remains the muddiest on record, we had over-ordered stock and were in a location that only tractors could reach” – but nearly 20 years later, they’re still here stronger than ever, watermelon stall and all. Garthy D: the backstage driver       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   I like mud … backstage driver GarthyGarthy may be the only person on the planet who likes Glastonbury when it’s muddy. “In a way, it’s easier for me. People don’t want to hang around. They want to get in the vehicle and go. When it’s hot and sunny, people have had a few beers and they start getting a bit dawdly.”Garthy, 37, has been a backstage driver at Glastonbury for the last decade, and drives his customised Land Rover – “An absolute dog, but it will power through anything” – for the festival’s entirety, putting in the sort of shift that would send shivers down the wellies of your average, Koppaberg-swigging city dweller. “One year I was on site for 120 hours, and I worked for 100 hours of those,” he says.He primarily drives between the Avalon and Glade stages and says that even though he doesn’t get to enjoy the festival much himself, “other people’s joy at Glasto makes me feel happier; like if they get a service they didn’t expect, or an extra helping hand”.
