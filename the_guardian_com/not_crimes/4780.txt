Some families spend their whole lives in each other’s pockets. They stay close, geographically and psychologically, long after the children have left home. Perhaps this is reassuring; or perhaps it suffocates. Our family is quite different. Free-range chickens rather than battery hens: we all go our own sweet way.I am the youngest of three – the only girl, and grew up with two brothers. We are very different, yet we like each other well enough. We close ranks when we need to, if there’s illness or trouble. Otherwise, independence is the key. My parents, both of whom are dead, never tied us down. They were free spirits themselves. And they were delighted with the new life they discovered, when all three children were grown up and gone.For the first time in their lives, they could indulge in holidays abroad and in hobbies – gardening, golf and long, indulgent lunches – that were blissfully, and honourably, childfree. (Until they became grandparents, of course, when everything changed again.)We have, as a family, led parallel lives: subjecting each other to a sort of benign neglect – a nod from afar at birthdays and Christmas – and coming together en masse only for occasions of significant import: births, weddings and, inevitably, funerals.Our mother’s funeral, in 2005, marked a step change, however. In her prime, Kathleen had been the life and soul of every party: gregarious, energetic, full of mischief and fun. Without her, the world – and the family – seemed a quieter, duller place.And even if we were a scattered brood, we needed a symbolic fireplace to gather round and never more so than now, when Mother’s own vivid flame had been extinguished for ever.David, our dad, was still alive, and still valiantly preserving the old family home – until he, too, died, in 2010. But it was different. Everything was different. Sadder.It was my niece, Ruth, who put it into words, on the day her grandmother was buried. “The only time we ever get together these days is at funerals,” she complained. “Why don’t we have some sort of regular celebration instead?”Thus it began, in 2005, the annual mini-festival, or Bardfest, as it has come to be known. My elder brother Martin and sister-in-law Mig are the indulgent hosts, and the “festival” is held at their family home in Berkshire, at the end of every July. Rain or shine. Usually rain. All family members, far or near, are welcome.Last year was our festival’s 10th anniversary. And I have come to rely on this weekend of cheerful chaos – tents of every size littering the large garden, sleeping bodies on blow-up beds in all available rooms – to catch up with my extended family. To remember my roots and to celebrate them.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Barney Bardsley and her daughter, Molly McGee.

There were eccentric elderly aunts; a clutch of curly haired blond children, whose names I never grasped, and whose faces were an indistinguishable blur of animation as they hurled themselves in and out of paddling pools and hammocks; a circle of suitably introspective teenagers; and a charming, leftfield contingent from Holland, who sat in a peaceful corner, rolling their own cigarettes, drinking their beer, and smiling at the British eccentrics cavorting around them.At dusk, there was juggling with fire. A music act involving ukeleles. Strange “Aunt Sally” games, where sticks were randomly hurled into the middle distance. Copious amounts of food, and dustbins, packed with ice, full of drink.It was all very lovely. And loud.Everyone decided we must do it again – and again. And so we have. As the years have rolled by, things have settled into a calmer but ever evolving rhythm: the faces and ages of the participants vary each summer, as the extended family develops and changes.In the early days, there were lots of young families, camping under the apple trees. Those children are disappearing on far-flung adventures of their own. Some of the parents have split up – and different family units are emerging in their wake. Babies have been born. Death has stalked the proceedings, too. The older generation has gradually been fading away.For the first five years of Bardfest, my father presided over the festivities: an ageing paterfamilias, sitting in his easy chair, undisturbed by the hectic whirr of motion around him, smiling with contentment, season after season, until his death.Now the field is left free for the middle-aged faithfuls – my brothers, their wives, a few cousins and me – and some young adult offspring, coming back to the nest with new partners and starting the whole cycle over again.It is fascinating to watch the shifting picture of our family life, through the prism of this one summer weekend: repeated, year in, year out, come what may.In the rest of my life I live quietly and independently enough with a free-range adult daughter of my own. My husband died young, a decade ago. Both parents are now long gone. So it is a source of great pleasure to know, that on the last weekend in July, the tent poles will be erected, the barbecue sausages bought and the doors of the Bardsley home in Berkshire flung open to welcome me and everyone else who wishes it back to the fold. For two days only. Our annual festival. A box of noisy, boozy, lovely family delights.Old Dog by Barney Bardsley is published by Simon and Schuster, £7.99
