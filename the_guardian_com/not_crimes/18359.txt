When Helen Marten claimed the prestigious Turner prize this week, she became only the seventh individual female winner of the prize. But a review of more than 30 years of Turner prize data indicates that the tide is turning.Helen Marten: an artist who thinks differently from the rest of us The inaugural Turner prize was awarded in 1984, but it was 1993 before Rachel Whiteread became the first female artist to take the title. The next was Gillian Wearing in 1997. The winners for the next eight years were all male.The last decade has seen a shift towards gender parity: of the last 11 winners, five were female and five male, while last yearâ€™s victors, the collective Assemble, were a mixed group.The number of female judges has also risen over the years. The jury, made up of five art experts, has often been dominated by men: female judges have outnumbered males on only seven occasions. However, in the last decade, for both judges and nominees, gender parity has been achieved.The prize, named after the English painter JMW Turner, is awarded to British visual artists under the age of 50 each year.Turner prize winners by gender
