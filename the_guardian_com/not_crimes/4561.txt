As a Millwall supporter for over 60 years, may I offer heartfelt thanks to the Guardian which, almost alone in the national press, gave the club support and the kind of publicity these hole-in-the-corner “developers” dread (Joy for Millwall after land sale plan is scrapped, 26 January). Without your efforts, it’s unlikely this result could have been achieved. Wonderful news at a time when it is in such short supply.Tom MahoneyBexleyheath, Kent• Will the Great Wall of Trump be visible from space (Report, 26 January)?Chris LakinLymm, Cheshire• Surely, if you can remember what Kings Road was called in the 60s (Letters, 26 January) you weren’t really there.Mike HineLondon• It is not true as Ann Mabbott writes (Letters, 25 January) that “only one team has the appellation the Arsenal”. Plymouth Argyle is commonly known as “the Argyle”, or very locally by Janners as “the Argo”.Mervyn ElyChudleigh, Devon• Well, If you get bombarded by letters from this part of the world debating the interminable Wirral versus The Wirral question, you’ve only got yourselves to blame (Letters, 26 January).Hugh LloydWallasey, Wirral • When I was a child I hated milk and soggy cereal, so I used to spread individual Shreddies with butter and marmalade, form them into a miniature Scooby-style stack and then eat them (Letters, passim). NB this method does not work with Kraft catering margarine – we tried it and it was disgusting.
