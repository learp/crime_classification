An announcement on the location of a further runway for the south-east is imminent. Seemingly the dithering and delay will soon be over. And not before time: Heathrow is indeed full. Gatwick’s runway is the second busiest on the planet. It is beyond doubt that additional capacity is needed. The imperative is overwhelming, but a decision on location is just the start of the process of delivering that capacity, not the end. There is still a considerable way to go. And it is absolutely right that the very serious environmental concerns that come with increased capacity are comprehensively addressed.Quality of life has a price. The frackers should pay it | Mary Dejevsky So yes, let’s have the decision, but quite rightly there are serious environmental issues to address, and it would be reckless not to pay them full and proper heed.From all the evidence, the analysis and commentary, a decision in support of a third runway at Heathrow looks to be the most likely outcome. It won’t surprise anyone if that is announced this week and the case is well made.It seems to be a hallmark of certain figures in the Tory party to have nothing but disdain for expert opinion, but I start from the premise that having asked the Airports Commission to carry out its report, there would have to be overwhelming evidence that the report and its conclusions were fundamentally flawed for parliament to depart from it.That is not to say that there should be no room for criticism or forensic examination. For instance, Gatwick will claim with some justification that the predictions made in terms of its passenger growth and long-haul flights were somewhat short of the mark. But that said, the commission has done its job.We’ve had consensus, but by no means unanimity, around expanding Heathrow for years. Until recent times, Gatwick was simply not in a position to present an alternative – but that they have certainly done, and with some considerable aplomb.But which is it to be? The four tests that Labour set to inform such a decision are as relevant today as when my predecessor Michael Dugher established them some 20 or so months ago. Those four tests are: delivering increased capacity; meeting UK climate change obligations; minimising local noise and air quality impacts; and looking at what is best for the UK economy as a whole.First, both Heathrow and Gatwick have set out cogent proposals that address the capacity needs. Their respective merits have been scrutinised by all and sundry. But what we cannot ignore in the years ahead is the need to better utilise our existing capacity by way of our other international gateway airports.That has to include improving rail services to Stansted and making sure that Manchester airport is served by HS2. At the same time, we have to take full cognisance of the increasing capabilities of “point to point” air travel, especially with advances in aircraft technologies. There are undoubtedly other opportunities, including at Edinburgh, Birmingham and East Midlands – and in terms of the latter, especially for freight.Second, the aviation industry had made a strong case that additional capacity can be achieved while stabilising the sector’s CO2 emissions and the agreement reached between the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the aviation industry at last month’s UN climate change summit is a welcome development, but it is critical that the closest scrutiny is permanently maintained.Improving air transport fuel efficiency is key, and the government needs to be giving assurances to the industry as to its long-term commitment to sustainability.Third, the issue of noise and air quality. It is imperative that the quality of the lives of those affected by current airport activity and any such expansion are given full attention, and that every avenue to ameliorate the impact of expansion is explored and effective responses are delivered. Government policies have to be aligned to directly address the air quality dangers that residents face While Heathrow’s air pollution is in very large measure due to the concentrated emissions of motor vehicles in the vicinity, relying on improved vehicle emissions from better engines in the coming years isn’t enough. Government policies have to be aligned to directly address the air quality dangers that residents face right now and are likely to face in the coming years.The government should also explore the ways in which emission reductions can be achieved to include greater use of more environmentally friendly modes of airport surface access.The establishment of an independent noise authority as recommended by the Airports Commission is a must, and the government should have made greater progress on that by now, and should not delay any further.Finally, to ensure benefits to the whole of the UK, while Gatwick claims more UK internal connections than Heathrow, the regions and nations of the UK, the trade unions and business community are clear that the connectivity to Heathrow as a hub is essential to their interests.Improved capacity in the south-east undoubtedly directly impacts on all of the UK’s competitiveness. But it is also essential that any development is mindful of the need to spread prosperity nationwide throughout the procurement process.With the current economic uncertainty, simply deciding where the additional runway will be cannot be the totality of government’s response to the UK’s aviation needs. There is much more to do.While Theresa May and her three Brexiteers are seemingly determined in their typically dismissive and arrogant manner to insult our EU partners so as to jeopardise our access to the single market, it is imperative that at this time the UK demonstrates not only to the EU but to the rest of the world that the UK remains an outward looking trading nation.A decision on the location of the runway will make a significantly positive contribution in that regard.Heathrow or not Heathrow: that is not the only question. Only if all our ducks are in a row – environmentally, economically and socially – can we be confident that we can achieve the much needed capacity to boost the entire UK with the least possible impact upon residents and the environment. No ifs, no buts.
