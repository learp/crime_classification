My sister wanted to ceremonially bury our clapped-out car in the garden, like a dead pet. When my old bike broke I wept as if I’d lost a boyfriend (I had lost a boyfriend, incidentally – it used to be his bike). When her car has managed to go up a big hill, my friend will tap it on the dashboard and mutter, “Well done, darling.” When we’ve knocked into a chair, who among us hasn’t uttered a quick “sorry!” to its rigid back?Ben (@Push10Ben)Omg opened my Nan's laptop and when she's googled something she's put 'please' and 'thank you'. I can't 😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/hiy2tecBjUJune 9, 2016So I can relate to May Ashworth, the 86-year-old whose unusually polite Google search has made her a Twitter celebrity. Her request to “Please translate these roman numerals MCMXCVIII thank you,” has now been “liked” more than 40,000 times, after her grandson tweeted a photograph, with the comment “OMG” and some “I’m laughing so much I’m crying” emojis.I may not talk to Google as if it’s deciding whether or not to stamp my passport, but by God I will use please and thank you to automated switchboards. I will kiss an acceptance letter; I will swear at a broken photocopier; I will try to sound endearing as I beg a ringing telephone to please, please be picked up.Of course, this sort of box-whispering has been made all the more complicated by the rise of voice recognition technology. When you actually can shout at your telephone until it gives in and tells you the answer to a pub quiz question, or ask your car how the hell you get home from here, it’s hard not to fall into a pattern of seeing objects as sentient beings and treating our gadgets like personal assistants. That’s not to say they’re always on your side, but they at least appear willing to listen. I can be brought to tears just thinking about my grandmother’s paint-peeling garage doors As children, most of us felt a deep, protective love for an object: a spit-chewed blanket, a toy, a yellow wooden brick, a favourite hat. And many carry that relationship towards objects into adult life. When I interviewed Erika Eiffel, the tower crane operator and former award-winning archer who married the Eiffel Tower, she talked poignantly of the love, empathy and heartache she felt towards girders, joints and steel. She told me how in Japan, the Shinto religion accepted as read that objects have an energy just like people, or animals. She explained how the division between a “them” and an “it” was something we learn, not something we’re born with. She told me how the Berlin Wall had given her strength and mended her broken heart. And I believed her.I wonder what Erika made of Tracey Emin marrying a stone. I understood completely – such security, such stability, familiarity, quiet companionship. Not to mention somewhere to rest your rucksack. It is utterly human, isn’t it, to look at the world around us and ascribe our characteristics to what we find? To believe a rock to be holy, a piece of wood to be healing, a ring lucky or a ladder cruel.Perhaps the difference with Google is that it is actually, at some point far back in its digital veins, people. People who don’t necessarily pay their taxes, sure, but people nonetheless. People coded it, people built it, people maintain it. And so we’re right to address it as such. Perhaps if we saw the internet as a collection of people, we’d be less likely to scream abuse.Stoned love: why Tracey Emin married a rock As an entirely animate, sentient and sometimes even cognisant woman, I can be brought to tears just thinking about my grandmother’s paint-peeling garage doors or my grandfather’s old twin hairbrushes. I can feel a swell of love that’s almost blinding when picturing my mother’s cupboard full of Tupperware or lining up my boyfriend’s inhalers on the shelf. You would too. I’m sure of it.As humans, we treat objects like people, precisely because we’re human. And, sometimes, whether we’re translating roman numerals, thanking a well-timed bus or apologising to a kicked chair, it is our humanity that shines through. Sometimes.
