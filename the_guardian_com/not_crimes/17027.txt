So he buys a Golem, known in Jewish folklore as a clay creature brought to life, but which in this theatre production operates as an obedient man-machine. Suddenly life goes from the quotidian knitting-and-Beethoven at home, to one that is little more complicated. Staged by the British theatre company 1927, Golem is a satirical dystopian fable about the dangers of the digital world and our unceasing urge to upgrade ourselves – but it’s also a family piece, combining animation, claymation, film, live music and comedy.• Golem is on at Adelaide festival centre from 8 to 13 MarchTectonicsThe idea the behind Israeli conductor Ilan Volkov’s Tectonics festival is to collide two worlds – here, classical and experimental music – with one another, like the Earth’s tectonic plates. “For an audience it’s a really powerful experience when you’re confronted by very diverse things,” Volkov told the Guardian.In 2012 the then-conductor of the Iceland Symphony Orchestra founded the festival in Reykjavik, hoping to make the 19th-century ensemble more radical. After stints in Glasgow and Tel-Aviv, it made its way to Australia in 2014.
