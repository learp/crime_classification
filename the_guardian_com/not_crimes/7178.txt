Nineties cinema produced loads of fashion references – most of them in Quentin Tarantino films: Uma Thurman in a white shirt in Pulp Fiction, Patricia Arquette in leopard print in True Romance, Mr Pink and friends in suits in Reservoir Dogs. All edgy glamour with a hint of menace. But Trainspotting, a 1996 Danny Boyle film about heroin addicts in grimy squats in Edinburgh? Hardly the most obvious moodboard fodder.And yet, 21 years on from its release and with the sequel in UK cinemas, the film’s fashion influence is being reassessed. Ewan Bremner, who plays Spud in both films, recently told Time Out that the costume designer, Rachel Fleming, “basically invented skinny jeans for men with Trainspotting”, revealing that she would adapt women’s jeans, or tighten men’s jeans, to get that drainpipe silhouette, predating Hedi Slimane putting them on the catwalk for Dior Homme in the early 00s. The image of a young Ewan McGregor running down the street in skinny jeans, bomber jacket and vintage T-shirt is pretty memorable even without that now much-parodied “choose life” monologue running over the top. Take away the junkie nod at the end of the scene and the outfit can be seen on young men everywhere in 2017. No wonder nods to his original looks, including a zip-up top in the white and orange colours of the Trainspotting poster, run through his wardrobe in T2.

While her screen time was at a minimum, she was the only woman on the original film poster. Her sequin slipdress, red coat, Justine from Elastica haircut and strappy sandals were burned on to the retina of any teenage girl growing up in the 90s. Similar outfits were everywhere after dark throughout the decade, and could be found at high street shops such as Miss Selfridge and Karen Millen. Following on from the slip dress revival over the last few years, with an elegantly wasted Kate Moss as its icon, McDonald’s more high energy version is surely next in line to be refracted through designers and end up on the catwalk.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Made for Insta … Ewen Bremner as Spud in Trainspotting. Photograph: Moviestore/REX/ShutterstockSpud’s outfits, though, are the unlikely fashion winner 21 years on. His 70s-through-the-90s wardrobe – so charity shop you can practically smell the musty, secondhand scent – is the kind of look that fashion insiders dub “new Gucci”, referring to the thrift shop-goes-luxe look on the catwalk at the Italian brand under the creative direction of Alessandro Michele. Bremner says that the clothes he wore in T2 were often the same ones worn in the original – printed nylon shirts, suits with the trousers slightly too short, angora jumpers. These are all items Michele – not to mention Miuccia Prada – are really into. He might be “pure shy with the interview cats” in that now-infamous scene but, if Spud circa 1996 had been around in 2017, Insta-style icon status would have been inevitable.
