British academics have used a combinations of maths, criminology and geographic profiling to back up a theory over the identity of mysterious street artist Banksy.Scientists at Queen Mary University of London said the pattern of how Banksy’s artworks were distributed suggested he was artist Robin Gunningham.What Banksy did next: five fresh ideas for the street art agitator in 2016 Gunningham was first named as Banksy by the Daily Mail newspaper in 2008.Banksy’s politically-themed street art has made him a celebrity in Britain, despite his true identity never having been confirmed.His most high-profile recent project was Dismaland, a “bemusement park”, located in southwest England.Geographic profiling is a technique used in fields from criminology to the study of patterns of infectious disease.The research, published in the Journal of Spatial Science, analysed a series of locations of Banksy’s artworks in London and Bristol and mapped them against “anchor points” such as the homes of people suspected of being Banksy to draw conclusions about possible identity.“Our analysis highlights areas associated with one prominent candidate (eg his home), supporting his identification as Banksy,” the paper said.“More broadly, these results support previous suggestions that analysis of minor terrorism-related acts (eg graffiti) could be used to help locate terrorist bases before more serious incidents occur, and provides a fascinating example of the application of the model to a complex, real-world problem.”One of the research team, Steve Le Comber, told the BBC: “I’d be surprised if it’s not (Gunningham), even without our analysis, but it’s interesting that the analysis offers additional support for it.”The BBC also reported that Banksy’s legal team had contacted staff at the university with concerns about how the research was to be promoted.
