So here we are at the end of the month when, after the false dawn of January’s payday, everyone is still too skint from buying £50-worth of fruit a week for our now crusty and uncleaned NutriBullet to leave the house, and too ashamed to admit that our Dry January ended about 13 days ago. What else to do but sink into the sofa, scroll through Netflix and land on Drew Barrymore’s cherubic face beaming beatifically? Her new show is called Santa Clarita Diet – which sounds wholesome. Maybe it’s about a new wellness trend, like a Chef’s Table for the Deliciously Ella generation? Well … no. Drew’s Netflix debut is the weirdest career U-turn since she appeared in ex-husband Tom Green’s mega-flop Freddy Got Fingered. While it’s not about a clean-living Californian diet, it might make you turn vegan.Drew plays Sheila, a suburban estate agent who likes patterned pyjamas, Jennifer Lawrence’s haircut and green juice. You know, standard TV mum stuff. That is, until she has a slapstick-comedy vomiting fit and pukes herself to death, right there on the bathroom floor. Only, she’s not dead – she has turned into a zombie. A totally cute and ditsy undead being who is suddenly obsessed with receiving oral sex and buying a Range Rover. Think How Stella Got Her Groove Back, only the “how” is “by eating a colleague’s fingers, entrails and testicles” rather than having a fling with a hot man.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Luckily, Stella’s husband Joel (Timothy Olyphant) is incredibly supportive. Only 24 hours after his wife dies, comes back to life, eats the new guy at work and they cover up his death, Joel’s whole vibe is very: “Sure, babe, we’ll become murderers so you can eat human flesh!” Also along for the ride: their daughter Abby, who’s so unbelievably relaxed about the whole situation that she brushes off her mum’s transition into a killer with: “I’m 16, I can deal with this shit!” The only problem? The family live next door to not one, but two local cops. One of them, Dan, is suspicious of Sheila’s newly erratic behaviour, but he never seems to be looking out of his window when she’s eating a human being in broad daylight.It’s unclear if the whole zombie thing is a metaphor – for the pressure that society puts on women to be perfect, how there’s something dark happening behind every picket fence – or it’s just to prove that Drew Barrymore can chew on a human foot and still look adorable. No one is expecting Mike Leigh levels of stark realism from a sitcom in which the star of Never Been Kissed eats human flesh, but the show skates over major plot points, such as how Sheila’s death happened and why no one is having a nervy b over the whole zombie thing. The show rushes along at such a fast pace – she needs human flesh! They’re buying a corpse off the morgue! They try to murder a drug dealer! – that it plays out like it’s all a weird cheese dream. It ends up being try-hard wacky – a series of half-jokes where, instead of a punchline, we get Drew grinning sweetly, because the show’s whole thing is: she’s cute and she’s a killer! Maybe they were going to add in the witty payoffs in the edit and ran out of time.Ultimately, Santa Clarita Diet’s one joke is basically: isn’t it crazy that we’re murderers and realtors? But to anyone who has experienced the UK property market recently, the idea that estate agents are cold-hearted killers who’d eat you to sell a house isn’t all that funny.Available from Friday 3 February on Netflix
