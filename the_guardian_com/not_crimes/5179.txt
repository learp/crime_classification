Spoiler alert: this recap assumes you’ve seen the third episode of Blue Eyes on More4 or Walter Presents. Don’t read on if you haven’t.Well, they had a nice day for Annika’s funeral. That’s something. The sun shone – for the first time in almost three hours’ television; the little country church looked lovely; horses nuzzled each other in the fields, oblivious to the fact that Sweden was falling apart as the stary-eyed (starry-eyed?) neo-Nazi Mattias roamed around Stockholm killing people.The only thing that marred Annika’s sensitive send-off was that Olle Nordlöf of the Assurance party linked her death to the assorted n’er-do-wells Mattias was despatching, which annoyed the hell out of her grieving daughter Sofia. So much so in fact that she and mad, murdering Mattias started exchanging billets doux on what appeared to be a fascist message board. The Assurance party are mortified to have lost their poster girl to a group even more extreme than they are.

They were not happy when their porky fellow fascist Henrik, soon to be a father, failed to turn up for a hit. “Belief is not something that you have as long as it suits you,” Gustav told him sternly when he caught up with him in what looked like a disused quarry. “It is a conviction that you have. A war that you fight with your comrades.” Henrik promptly threw up. He was also subjected to a mock execution – not once but twice – and was told that he, his girlfriend and his not-yet-born baby would be murdered if he spilt the beans. Mattias looked most disappointed that he didn’t get to shoot him there and then.Meanwhile, the Sarah situation – she’s missing, remember – took several new twists. Elin and slimy special adviser Ludwig discovered that she had left the industry department, where she worked before moving to justice, after an argument with her boss, and that she was also having some sort of relationship with the environment minister (I may have got this wrong – I found this section largely impenetrable and am in any case rather losing interest in Sarah’s fate).

Then, after Elin left, who should appear for a moment in a doorway of his house – illuminated by a flash of lightning Harry Lime-style – but Sarah. At least I think it was her – her hair was down, rather than in a bun as when we saw her briefly in episode one, and she looked younger.We still of course have no idea what her connection was with Annika, which is where the whole saga began, and it’s possible that, with Mattias on the loose in Stockholm murdering people to ingratiate himself with Sofia, we no longer care. There are only so many plates we can spin at any one time.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Poor Elin is standing up well, given the circumstances.A few general conclusions: the Swedish government appears to be even more dysfunctional than Britain’s; the police – who came to interview poor Elin – are hopeless; the justice minister Gunnar still strikes me as knowing a lot more than he is letting on; and Elin, who is nominally Gunnar’s chief of staff, doesn’t seem to do a great deal of chief-of-staffing, since she has her hands full with Sarah’s disappearance, a number of police investigations and the ambiguous attentions of Ludwig. At least Max, who also had designs on her, has for the moment disappeared. But not in a suspicious way. Oh, and Elin’s alcoholic father also put in an appearance, hospitalised by a fall before also disappearing from his flat, which may or may not be suspicious. Sweden is famous for its (red) herrings. Elin, who may hanker after her old job as a waitress, is standing up well to all this given the circumstances.Annika’s son Simon, just about the only likeable character (except for the heroic Elin of course), is shaping up nicely as the moral conscience of the drama: fond of his sister but not sharing her increasingly rightwing views, ostracised by his Muslim friends for not taking a firmer stand against racism, and still blaming himself for his mother’s murder. His is a still small voice of confusion in a roiling sea of arch-manipulators and political lunatics. And, unlike everyone else, he doesn’t spend all his time making clandestine phone calls and posting incendiary messages on social media. Stick in there, Simon. We need you.
