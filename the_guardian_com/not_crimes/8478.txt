If you are lucky enough to try guisantes de lágrima (peas of tears) in the Basque country, then you will surely agree that these are the best peas ever. I believe they got this name simply because they are very small. It’s true, they are really tiny, with an unforgettable sweet flavour. So few are produced that they can exceed the price of gold! Don’t miss the harvest, which runs from March to June. I think this dish is perfect at any time – for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Proper comfort food!(serves 6)Olive oil2 banana shallots (echalions), finely chopped2 garlic cloves, finely chopped400 g (14 oz) fresh baby peas125 g (4 oz) cooking chorizo, cut into small cubes150 g (5 oz) stale bread, cut into small cubesSea salt and freshly ground black pepper6 free-range eggsHandful of mint leavesHeat a little oil in a pan and gently fry the shallots and garlic for a few minutes. Add the peas and a little splash of water and sauté gently until tender.Meanwhile, fry the chorizo in a separate pan with a little oil. Once it has started to turn golden and has released all its fat, remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the bread cubes to the chorizo oil and fry until crisp. Put the chorizo back into the pan, mix together and season.Heat a good layer of oil in a non-stick frying pan and fry the eggs, so that the whites bubble up and go crispy but the yolks stay soft. Serve the sautéed peas and bread cubes with the chorizo migas, (“crumbs”), scatter with mint and top with the crispy golden egg. Serve immediately.
