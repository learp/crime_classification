Imagine you are on a ship that is holed beneath the waterline and starting to list. Then you notice the chief petty officer running around knocking more holes into the hull in a desperate, though obviously misguided, bid to keep the ship afloat. Welcome to Britain in winter 2011.In August 2008, on the basis of the best information available and a few conservative projections, colleagues and I estimated that the world had 100 months before it would no longer be "likely" (a definition of risk used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) that we could hold global warming below the threshold of a two-degree temperature rise – the agreed target of the EU and others.To some at the time it seemed dramatic, alarmist. To us we were just pointing out the inevitable physical and chemical consequences of greenhouse gases steadily accumulating in the atmosphere.Then two weeks ago, the International Energy Agency (IEA), typically a very conservative voice, concluded that the time frame for meaningful action on climate change was just as we had said. On our ticking clock, as of 1 December there are 60 months, or five years, to go. And five years is what the IEA too says we have left.Also back in 2008, we faced a financial crisis and volatile energy prices. There was an opportunity then to re-regulate the financial sector and to use public investment and new ownership of the banks to reboot the economy. Jobs, stability, carbon reductions and energy security were within our grasp – setting the foundations of a modern economy fit to face future challenges. Under the previous government that chance was spurned.The current chancellor, George Osborne, has not learned that lesson. He supports energy-intensive industries and road building, destabilises renewable energy, delays fuel tax rises, delivers an apparent U-turn in favour of new airport building and is openly hostile to environmental regulation generally. His government also secretly lobbies on behalf of Canadian tar sands, one of the dirtiest fuels of all. It's a lurch from tentative steps toward a "light, clean, modern" economy to a "heavy, dirty, old" one that makes Osborne look like a general building medieval siege equipment to ward off a modern, hi-tech invasion.He either doesn't understand, or doesn't want to understand, the nature of the threat from climate change, volatile energy markets and a still-untamed financial sector. The bluster would be laughable if it didn't leave us so critically vulnerable, with the poorest people pushed to the front to absorb the worst of the consequences.In the name of economic growth, Osborne appears nostalgic for the days of England's old dark satanic mills, and an approach to the labour market akin to holding someone's head under water and exhorting them to swim.Yet, whichever letter of the alphabet you would like to name it after, if he were not so ideological, he would see a huge range of alternatives. From the original Green New Deal launched in 2008, to the recently published Plan B backed by a bevy of economists, there is bold new thinking out there.Instead of a contradictory plan for growth whatever the cost (a BBC radio drama called The Hamster broadcast at 14:15 on 1 December, explores the consequences of that), a more intelligent economic policy would ask first, what do we actually want? And then, what is the most affective way to get there?Plan B has a vision for "a safe place to put our money, a rewarding job and a natural environment enhanced for the next generation; an affordable home; security, though not necessarily in purely financial terms; a society committed to nurturing, and prepared to pay for the health and development of its people; communities where we can belong, that have some autonomy and identity; and the chance to get off the consumer treadmill more often and find a life balance that leaves enough time to engage meaningfully with family and friends, and pursue interests outside work". There's also an arm-long list of proposals to fulfil those bold aims.Osborne's only vision seems to be a deficit reduction plan that is doomed to failure, and a further crippling of the public sphere, which was the only thing that stood between the failure of private financial markets and economic disaster. Yet jobs, a vibrant economy, carbon reduction and an economy better insulated from external economic and environmental shocks are there for the grabbing. In the meantime, in the run-up to Christmas, it feels a bit like a pantomime where the curtain is about to come down, George is the dame at the front of the stage feigning that he can see no alternative, and we're all in the audience, shouting "behind you".
