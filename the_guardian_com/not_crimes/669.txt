Wilson said he and a pilot were travelling home on Monday in a Beechcraft Bonanza when a pressure change caused the passenger door to slightly open.Wilson did not realise his phone had fallen until after had landed.“The pressure popped and a newspaper flew out but I didn’t see the phone go,” he said. “After we got back I looked for it on the floor [of the plane] and in my briefcase but couldn’t find it.” Wilson and an employee used the Find My iPhone app to narrow the search to near Jacksboro, more than 80km (50 miles) away.The pair set out to search on Tuesday and ended up in a rural pasture. They found the phone under a mesquite tree.
