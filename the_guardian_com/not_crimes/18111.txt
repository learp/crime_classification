The NFL have denied making an official offer to Adele to perform the Super Bowl halftime show. The Hello singer claimed she turned down an offer to play the slot in 2017 during a gig at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Saturday night (13 August). She told the crowd: “First of all, I’m not doing the Super Bowl. I mean, come on, that show is not about music. And I don’t really … I can’t dance or anything like that. They were very kind, they did ask me, but I said no.”However, both the NFL and the halftime show sponsor Pepsi have denied an official offer was ever tabled. In a joint statement, they said: “The NFL and Pepsi are big fans of Adele. We have had conversations with several artists about the Pepsi Super Bowl halftime show. However, we have not at this point extended a formal offer to Adele or anyone else. We are focused on putting together a fantastic show for Houston and we look forward to revealing that in good time.”Adele has a reputation for turning down big shows, and it was seen as a major coup when she agreed to headline Glastonbury this year. Were she to perform at the Super Bowl she would join a long list of stars who have previously played including Bruce Springsteen, Beyoncé and Katy Perry. The 2017 Super Bowl takes place at Houston’s NRG Stadium on 5 February 2017.
