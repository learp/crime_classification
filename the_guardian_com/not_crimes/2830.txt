Hamilton, the Broadway musical that has been a critical and commercial smash hit, has won the Pulitzer prize for drama.The judges called Lin-Manuel Miranda’s play – which tells the story of the life of founding father Alexander Hamilton and the American revolution in rap using a multiethnic cast – “a landmark American musical”.“We had a very good field in drama this year; there was just one play that really stood out to our board and that was Hamilton,” said Mike Pride, the administrator of the fiercely competitive awards for American journalism, letters, drama and music, on Monday afternoon at Columbia University’s School of Journalism.Hamilton has been such a cultural phenomena it has been credited with increasing  neighborhood house prices, sparking a growing interest in revolutionary history, and preventing the face of its titular founding father from being removed from the $10 bill. The show has made Miranda into a pop icon with both White House and late-night TV show appearances.Miranda tweeted his excitement shortly after the announcement:Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel)Grateful grateful grateful grateful grateful grateful grateful grateful grateful grateful grateful grateful grateful grateful great fullApril 18, 2016The Sympathizer, the debut novel by author Viet Thanh Nguyen, won the Pulitzer for fiction.Washington Post reporter Joby Warrick won the general non-fiction prize for his book Black Flags: The Rise of Isis, which shows how the flawed reasoning behind the Iraq war helped Isis grow.Musician and composer Henry Threadgill won the music prize for his recording In for a Penny, In for a Pound, a work the judges declared “a sonic tapestry that seems the very expression of modern American life”.In the journalism prizes, the Associated Press won the gold medal for public service journalism for its investigation of workers kept as slaves, supplying seafood to American supermarkets.
