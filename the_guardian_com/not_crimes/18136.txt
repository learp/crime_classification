Lisa Oldfield, the wife of former One Nation deputy leader David Oldfield, is one of seven women cast in The Real Housewives of Sydney, Sydney’s first season of the global hit reality show. Oldfield returns to television in 2017, 10 years after then-Nine executive Mia Freedman cast her as a panelist on Nine’s failed female daytime talk show the Catch-Up.Foxtel (@Foxtel)Welcome Lisa Oldfield, one of our new Real Housewives of Sydney announced today. #RHOSydney #Foxtel @arenatv 2017. pic.twitter.com/63gVJeMbBuJuly 22, 2016 Described as “sophisticated and vivacious”, Oldfield and her six cast mates will open their lives up for the reality TV cameras in a 10-part series produced by pay TV platform Foxtel. The Real Housewives of Sydney is the second in the franchise to be produced in Australia, following the The Real Housewives of Melbourne, starring Melbourne lawyer turned actress Gina Liano, who starred as the wicked stepmother in a pantomime of Cinderella that ran at Sydney’s State theatre in July. Oldfield, who describes herself as a “digital thought leader and technologist” on LinkedIn, was recently in the news for sharing a photograph on social media of an overweight woman on a flight and calling her a “fat fuck”. Foxtel has no doubt cast her with this in mind, describing her as “no stranger to controversy and being in the spotlight”.  “Opinionated, provocative and passionate, she is a media commentator, seasoned world traveller, astute business woman and savvy tech guru,” Foxtel says. “She is also a mother of two young boys and lives on the [Sydney] northern beaches with her family.” The only other known name in the cast is actress and singer Melissa Tkautz, who starred in the Australian soapie E Street in the 1990s, and Nicole O’Neil (nee Gazal), a former Miss Australia. The other Real Housewives of Sydney are: artist AthenaX Levendi; model turned real estate agent Krissy Marsh; cosmetic nurse Matty Samaei; and socialite Victoria Rees.
