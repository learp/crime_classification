A long weekend in the western Highlands of Scotland gave me the opportunity to catch up with several species I rarely get the chance to see. This was enhanced by our host’s desire to show us as much of this beautiful landscape as possible, which entailed going on very long walks, often involving dauntingly steep climbs. As I pointed out – in vain – I come from the lowlands of England, and “don’t do up”.En route, in the wilds of Perthshire, we took an eight-mile hike around a valley. Even though autumn can sometimes be rather quiet, the place was thronged with birds. Meadow pipits sprang up constantly; bouncing through the air as if hanging on invisible strings of elastic, while uttering their distinctive “sip” call. They were joined by tight little flocks of siskins and redpolls, which I rarely see at home on the Somerset Levels.Red and black grouse used to live in Somerset too, but sadly both have now long disappeared. Here, the reds were everywhere, shooting away low across the heather while uttering their rather comical call. Their scarcer cousin, the black grouse, is always far trickier to see. But as we turned for home at the top of the valley, three dark, crow-like shapes in a grassy meadow proved to be this handsome bird. They flew up and perched on one of the unsightly pylons that now cross this beautiful landscape, giving us excellent – if unorthodox – views.The west coast village of Glenelg, close to the magical place where Gavin Maxwell wrote his classic Ring of Bright Water, was equally productive. Rock pipits sprang up and down along the tideline, one helpfully perching right next to a meadow pipit, revealing its bigger bulk, longer legs and dark, seaweed-green plumage. Ravens croaked high overhead, and we had a single brief but memorable sighting of a young white-tailed eagle along the coast.Birdwatch: Golden eagle On a fine autumnal day we hiked up the nearest Munro – Beinn Sgritheall. At almost 1000m above sea level, and described in the guidebooks as “unrelentingly steep”, the prospect made me quake in my little-used walking boots. In the event the ascent was surprisingly straightforward, though I ached for days afterwards. During our five-hour walk we constantly scanned the skies for golden eagles, but with no luck. It was a timely reminder that eagles may be pretty big, but they are still dwarfed by this spectacular highland landscape.Compensation came on our final morning, when we took a walk out to Sandaig, Maxwell’s fictional Camusfearna. As we strolled along the alder-lined riverbank towards the shining sea, a dipper appeared in the rushing waters below. Dippers are one of my favourite birds, and a sighting of one, however brief, always brightens up the day.But for me the highlight was not so much the birds, but the place itself. Maxwell came here to escape from the world; the irony being that having written a major bestseller – later turned into an equally famous film – his secret hideaway became a place of pilgrimage for legions of fans.Gavin Maxwell’s later life was beset by tragedy: first the loss of the last of his beloved otters, when his home burned down; then his untimely death. Yet the “ring of bright water” remains; and on a bright autumn day, I could hardly wish for a more beautiful place to be.
