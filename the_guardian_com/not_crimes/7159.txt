West Yorkshire police force is to be investigated following the killing of a man by a dog days after it had been returned to its owner despite concerns it was dangerous.The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the circumstances surrounding the dog being returned to its owner last week.David Ellam, 52, was trying to protect his own yorkshire terrier when the larger dog turned on him in Huddersfield on Monday.Neighbours described how they tried to save Ellam by throwing him a kitchen knife to fend off the animal, before a police officer fought it off using a fire extinguisher.Ellam was treated by paramedics and taken to Huddersfield Royal infirmary, but was pronounced dead hours later.The IPCC commissioner, Derrick Campbell, said: “The death of Mr Ellam was a tragic incident and my sympathies go to his family.“Our independent investigation will look closely at police actions prior to Mr Ellam’s death, including the decision-making around the removal, testing and return of the dog.“A criminal investigation into Mr Ellam’s death is being carried out by West Yorkshire police.”The dog’s owner, a 29-year-old man who is thought to be the victim’s neighbour, was arrested in connection with the incident and has been released on police bail pending further inquiries. His dog has been detained in police kennels.The dog, named Alex, had been seized by police after being assessed by a dog warden in June following concerns from residents that it was dangerous. The dog was not, however, a banned breed under the Dangerous Dogs Act so was returned to its owner after being screened.Carol Hanson, a friend of Ellam’s partner, told the BBC: “It had been locked up already for biting somebody. It’s only been out for five days. Why did they let that dog go? Why did they let that dog back out when it was vicious?“What needs to be looked at is these dangerous dogs shouldn’t be let back out, should they. Once they have bitten somebody that should be it. They shouldn’t get a second chance.”Under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act, pit bull terriers, Japanese tosas, dogo argentinos and fila brasileiros are banned from the UK unless the owner has been given a special court exemption. Dogs that have received an exemption must be muzzled, kept on a lead in public, neutered, tattooed and have a microchip implant.
