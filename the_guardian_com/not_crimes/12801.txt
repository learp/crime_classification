Farmers’ interests are best served by the UK remaining in the European Union, their union has concluded.The National Farmers’ Union, which represents farmers across England and Wales, said it would not be actively campaigning in the EU referendum and would not tell its 55,000 members how to vote.But a resolution passed by the NFU council said: “On the balance of existing evidence available to us at present, the interests of farmers are best served by our continuing membership of the European Union.”The decision comes after the NFU commissioned a report on the impacts of Brexit on farming.The report by Wageningen University in the Netherlands found that in two of three scenarios farm-gate prices could increase, bolstering farming incomes but reducing consumption of products as they become more expensive.In the third, a more liberalised trade approach would see farm-gate prices fall, benefiting consumers through lower prices but hitting farmers’ incomes in many sectors.The future for British farmers is heavily influenced by what the UK government would do about subsidies paid through the EU common agricultural policy (CAP), which are worth about £2.4bn a year.Brexit supporters insist support to UK farmers would continue in the event of Britain voting on 23 June to leave the EU. However, farmers have raised concerns about whether this financial support would be forthcoming, as the government has previously argued against direct payments through the CAP.The NFU council, which represents members from each county and farming sector, looked at key issues including the implications for trade with the EU and the wider world, the impacts of uncertainty following a leave vote and farming regulation.The meeting assessed consequences for availability of labour, agricultural product approvals, farming science and research, the wider food chain and the risks of a national farm policy versus remaining with the CAP, before agreeing the resolution.
