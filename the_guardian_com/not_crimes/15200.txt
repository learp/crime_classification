I really, really enjoyed Bilal’s Brilliant Bee. I’ve read Choosing Crumble by Michael Rosen before and thought he was a very good author.I liked how an ordinary boy who always got bullied turned out to be famous after being on the quiz show, “What’s what? Win the Lot!” Bumble the Bee was great - he was very clever and he helped Bilal. My favourite character was Bilal’s grandmother, Nanu because she was very supportive of Bilal and told him he could do anything, particularly inventing and imagining. The illustrations reminded me of Quintin Blake’s and I really liked them. And those are all of the reasons I enjoyed Bilal’s Brilliant Bee!Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
