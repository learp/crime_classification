The federal government has released a shortlist of six sites in the running to become Australia’s first permanent nuclear waste dump for low-level and intermediate waste.The sites were chosen from 28 voluntarily nominated sites around Australia.They are Sallys Flat in NSW; Hale in the Northern Territory; Cortlinye, Pinkawillinie and Barndioota in South Australia; and Oman Ama in Queensland.Location of the six proposed sitesLocations of proposed sitesResidents of the six areas will be consulted over the next four months. The owner of the land selected would be paid up to four times its value, with the surrounding community set to receive at least $10m, resources and energy minister Josh Frydenberg said.A final list of three will be released next year, and after the next federal election the government will name its preferred site, which is due to be in operation by the end of the decade.Frydenberg said low-level waste was currently being stored at more than 100 sites, including hospitals and universities. Intermediate waste is stored by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Operation at Lucas Heights in Sydney.Australia could store nuclear waste for other countries, Malcolm Turnbull says “We have an international obligation to dispose properly of that waste,” Frydenberg told ABC radio.He said earlier: “Australia currently has the equivalent of around two Olympic-sized swimming pools of such waste, which may include laboratory items such as paper, plastic and glassware, and material used in medical treatments.“The [news]facility will be designed, built and operated to the highest safety and environmental standards.“This will require a thorough assessment by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, Australia’s independent radiation safety regulator, and an environmental assessment.”He stressed Australia would not be storing high level waste from countries that buy Australian uranium. In South Australia the nuclear royal commission is examining the prospect of a nuclear fuel cycle industry in the state, including waste storage.
