The Billion Pound Flower Market 8pm, Channel 4The flower industry is worth £100bn globally and is dominated by the Dutch, who have their mass-production techniques down pat. However, a new crop of Brits are using various initiatives to persuade customers to buy locally, including 21-year-old Jay and florist Geoff, who has learned Dutch to buy flowers at auction in the Netherlands. A touch of the Brexit spirit at work here: plucky, unfancied Brits taking on Big Europe. David StubbsLondon 1666 8.30pm, BBC4A bakery mishap sparked a conflagration that destroyed most of London 350 years ago this week. Lauren Laverne hosts this commemoration – a live broadcast of the ignition of sculptor David Best’s new work, a 100-metre-long replica of London’s 17th-century skyline, afloat on the Thames. The documentary includes interviews with the team who built the fire sculpture, reflecting on how to remember a disaster that, ultimately, allowed London to rebuild, much improved. Andrew MuellerCold Feet 9pm, ITVMike Bullen’s Manchester-set dramedy returns after 13 years. So does the old magic still linger? It’s tricky to tell from this opener, which spends so much time mapping out how its principals’ lives (sans the late Rachel) have changed, as well as getting new story arcs running, that everything seems rushed, even frantic. Which perhaps explains why the best moments involve deadpan Pete (John Thomson) slowing things down: “Pete, do you think Jen might be right?” “Very rarely.” Jonathan WrightWe the Jury 10pm, BBC2Imagine being so excited about jury duty you cartwheel your way to the courtroom? William can – his call-up falls on his 30th birthday, scratching a lifelong itch for dispensing justice. His co-jurors in James Acaster’s comedy are equally enthusiastic, eagerness arrested only by self-centred idiocy. The crime is murder; sadly, their concentration is focused exclusively on how they’re depicted by the courtroom artist. A delightfully off-kilter highlight of the BBC’s sitcom season. Mark Gibbings-Jones Too Posh to Parent 10pm, Channel 4One of those wilfully provocative documentaries that will likely cause many more grounded parents than those featured here to mount their high horses in indignation. As the film discovers, the very rich are now outsourcing potty training, never mind the cooking. With such luxury of choice, are the child-rearing tasks that wealthy parents decide to perform themselves the most rewarding ones? John RobinsonDara Ó Briain’s Go 8 Bit 10pm, Dave New panel-show fun, as gamers, comedians and series creators Steve McNeil and Sam Pamphilon take on a series of videogame challenges. This week’s guests are Susan Calman and David James and, with Ó Briain reliably droll as host and Ellie Gibson excellent in a sort of Richard Osman sidekick role, it’s 70% chat and very funny, too. So it’s not a huge problem that, apart from beat-’em-ups, watching gaming on TV is confusing and dull. Jack SealeInside Amy Schumer 10.30pm, Comedy CentralSeason four kicks off, and the US comic seems unlikely to reach the viral heights of previous series: a sketch in which she undermines Broadway composer Lin-Manuel Miranda with her own musical is surprisingly flat, while another where congressmen interrogate her on her reproductive health ends without a punchline. Although playfully titled The World’s Most Interesting Woman in the World, there’s little here to fascinate, let alone share. Hannah J DaviesFilm choiceGerry (Gus van Sant, 2002) Monday, 1.45am, Film4Two guys called Gerry (Matt Damon and Casey Affleck) abandon their car in the New Mexico desert and go walking until they are hopelessly lost. They plod through disbelief, desperation and resignation towards a bleak ending, sharing enigmatic little dude-discussions as they go. Made before his Cannes Palme d’Or winner Elephant, and after the mainstream Damon-drama Good Will Hunting, this feels like Gus van Sant’s return to his indie roots, and a beautiful one at that, thanks to Harris Savides’s wilderness photography. Paul HowlettShane (George Stevens, 1953) 4.35pm, Film4Buckskin-clad Alan Ladd is Shane, a reluctant gunfighter who rides into town to defend against a ruthless rancher and his hired gun: a grinning Jack Palance. What elevates the film is Shane’s emotional ties with honest toiler Van Heflin, his wife, Jean Arthur, and their boy, Brandon de Wilde. Among the top fistful of westerns, it was remade by Clint Eastwood as Pale Rider.
