JJ Abrams has said that it would be “counterintuitive” not to have a gay character in the Star Wars universe.Would a gay relationship in Star Wars: Episode VIII be revolutionary? The director of Star Wars: The Force Awakens has responded to fans calling for more diversity within the franchise and says that it might be on the way.“I would love it,” he said to The Daily Beast. “To me, the fun of Star Wars is the glory of possibility. So it seems insanely narrow-minded and counterintuitive to say that there wouldn’t be a homosexual character in that world.”The franchise reboot, which broke box-office records last year, was seen as progressive for a female character and a black co-star taking on the major leads. “When I talk about inclusivity it’s not excluding gay characters,” Abrams said. “It’s about inclusivity. So of course.” The suggestion follows news that this summer’s sci-fi sequel Independence Day 2 will include a gay married couple and a female president.Fans have already speculated that new characters Finn and Poe, played by John Boyega and Oscar Isaac, are having a gay relationship. Boyega told Radio Times that it wouldn’t be an impossible development.“As far as I’m concerned, when JJ sat us down to go through the script, it was a bromance,” he said. “But now I’m learning what Mark Hamill said before when he didn’t know that Darth Vader was Luke’s father: you never know what they’re going to pull. I’m looking at the director Rian [Johnson] closely so he can get me involved early, so I can prepare myself. So who knows?”
