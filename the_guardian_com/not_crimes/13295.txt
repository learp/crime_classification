When the news broke on Friday it caught the acting Labor leader, Tanya Plibersek, by surprise mid-press conference.The Conroy conundrum: enforcer's departure leaves Bill Shorten exposed On Sky on Tuesday, Conroy said he had “apologised profusely” to Plibersek. “I have to say I am embarrassed about poor Tanya –she’s a very dear friend of mine and I did embarrass her,” he said.Conroy explained that the other senior figure in the Labor left, Anthony Albanese, knew of his resignation because he had told him during a conversation about Labor’s national executive and the appointment of its next secretary.He said he had informed Shorten by text message because the Labor leader was in Canada at the time.Conroy said he hadn’t known Plibersek was holding a press conference but hetook “full responsibility”.Asked whether his resignation could weaken Shorten’s leadership, he said: “There are a whole range of people that have got Bill Shorten’s back.“Don Farrell is a passionate Bill Shorten supporter and has been for a long period of time … And Richard Marles will be working within the Victorian group along with David Feeney and a whole group of other people.”Farrell is in the box seat to replace Conroy as deputy Senate leader despite his history of tension with Labor’s current Senate leader, Penny Wong.

Being in politics is a noble profession. You can make a difference – I’d like to think I made a difference.“It is getting harder and harder, with the rise of right and leftwing extremists and the demands of the media cycle – even when there’s not much happening you’ve got to make it sound like something’s happening.”
