La La Land, Damien Chazelle’s musical ode to Hollywood starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, continues its quickstep towards the Oscars by dominating nominations for the Broadcast Film Critics Association Critics’ Choice awards. The film, about the relationship difficulties of a jazz pianist and aspiring movie star, took 12 nods, including best picture, director, actor and actress. Moonlight review – devastating drama is vital portrait of black gay masculinity in America Trailing by two nominations were Arrival, the Amy Adams-starring story of the linguistic fallout from an alien invasion, and Moonlight, Barry Jenkins’s story of a young black gay man at three stages of life. Also landing best picture nominations were Fences, Hacksaw Ridge, Hell or High Water, Lion, Loving, Sully and Manchester by the Sea – which topped the National Board of Review’s poll of the best film of the year earlier this week. There was space for glitzier, more mainstream movies in the 27 categories, including Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (which landed a nod for Gal Gadot) and Suicide Squad (whose Margot Robbie was honoured. The winners will be announced at a ceremony on 11 December.
