My mother was evacuated from London during the war. She boarded a train to Oxford aged two and would never see her own mother again. Her father came to collect her after the war but her mother, (a fiery Irish lady called Bridie, which is almost all I know about her) was never mentioned again.I now understand that my mother carried a well of pain around caused by the loss of her mother for the rest of her life. I don’t blame her. The fact her mother had just disappeared (in a conspiracy between adults) as opposed to, for example, more straightforwardly dying, I am sure made the sense of abandonment worse.When my own parents’ marriage broke down, my mother (who nursed me as an infant in her fifties - she had me incredibly late for the time) told me that she had no interest in another relationship because no one could possibly match my father. Again I didn’t realise it as a child, but I now see she was utterly brokenhearted. She gave no sign of having any romantic impulse for the rest of her life.My mother suffered, but I felt frustrated by the long and somewhat dreary days between us. I know now she wanted desperately to do better, but simply couldn’t because the pain was like a millstone around her neck.What does this have to do with gardens? I have discovered that my garden mothers me. This is a message my own mother would want me to share.First, gardens come back each year - and they don’t disappear when we leave them. This perennialism (being there again and again) is just what mothering small infants is about. So too with gardens, as we experience the exquisite joy of plants that come into themselves more each year. Second, all children want (need) to attach to something, and we can attach to our gardens because they are “ours” and they happen to be in England, which means they are usually both private and safe. Finally, they are never boring (at least to me) because they never stay the same and can be shared with those we love. Gardens that do stay the same (under the influence of minimalist design and a team of aggressive gardeners) are to me, boring and dead. In short, it is far easier for a garden to give us what a person, battered and beaten in matters of the heart but still bravely standing, cannot. My mother would have understood this completely; she would have celebrated it and she would have wanted me to remind others that the place where gardens and meaning meet is a good place, and a place where things can start to go right again.

Illustration: Modern Slavery GardenI was ecstatically excited when I discovered the Salvation Army are using an allotment to create a context for healing those rescued from modern slavery. This is pioneering and valuable work. It is a joy that slavery survivors have brought on oak saplings for our Modern Slavery Garden at next week’s Chelsea flower show. I can’t help thinking that not many of those survivors can have had functioning mothers. I hope that the Modern Slavery Garden and the Salvation Army may both release the mothering potential of horticulture and that many will feel its warm embrace. • Charlie Hart is a gardener and garden writer and helped with the Modern Slavery Garden at the Chelsea flower show this year
