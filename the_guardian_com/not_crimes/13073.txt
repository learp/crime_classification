Photograph: The National Gallery LondonThis powerfully realistic portrayal of the humble shepherds who came to see the new born Christ is palpably influenced by Caravaggio and was probably painted in Naples about two decades after he worked there. Who can have created this tough yet tender image of the Christmas story? It is a mystery, but Naples was under Spanish rule and as well as being Caravaggeian this resembles The Adoration of the Magi by Velazquez. A painting to open hearts.• National Gallery, London.Image of the week      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Irving Penn ‐ Yves Saint Laurent Blouse, New York, 2005.

She remembers: “I liked the ‘Minnie Mouse couture’ look of this mask and brought it to [photographer] Irving Penn. He thought it was charming and imagined it on a ‘young woman wearing an old‐fashioned negligee.’”What we learned this weekAdrian Searle picked his top 10 contemporary art shows of the yearA drawing, supposedly by Leonardo da Vinci, has turned up at a French auction house – and it looks like the real dealMenstrual blood is big in today’s performance artThe House of the Year, voted by RIBA, is a transforming Edinburgh townhouse – Oliver Wainwright went for a visitProperty magnate Harry Hyams has left his art collection to the state – including some true masterpieces from Turner and StubbsMarc Quinn is the first contemporary artist to show work at the Sir John Soane MuseumA new gallery space is opening in a Westminster Abbey towerA Chuck Close portrait of the former director of the National Portrait Gallery is to be the first work by the painter to enter a public UK collectionJennifer Scott is the first female director of the Dulwich Picture GalleryWe revisited the 1980s art-punk firebrands of New York’s Rivington SchoolTracey Emin has abandoned plans to demolish a listed East End building to build a new homeThe Fitzwilliam Museum has acquired a Whistler pastel of a very patient sitter – who sat for him over 70 timesAn Oscar Wilde portrait is going on show for the first time in the UKGet involvedBook now for Guardian members’ events: Insider’s View of Intrigue: James Ensor by Luc Tuymans, at London’s Royal Academy on 20 January; and a pair of events at London’s Science Museum, as part of next summer’s Robots exhibition.Our A-Z of Readers’ Art series continued this week, looking at your artworks with the theme N is for North Sea – check out the best entries here.We’ve also launched the theme for next month: O is for Oracle.
