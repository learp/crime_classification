The energy secretary, Amber Rudd, has been accused of misleading the public after a leaked letter revealed that the UK is predicted to fall short of its European Union obligations to get 15% of its energy from renewables by 2020.The letter from Rudd, which was obtained by the Ecologist magazine, discloses that the department’s internal forecasts say the UK will only manage to get about 11.5% of energy from renewables by that point, but adds that “publicly we are clear that the UK continues to make progress to meet the target”. The disclosure is particularly explosive because the government has been cutting subsidies for solar and wind energy, while maintaining that it is on course to meet its international targets.UK doesn't have right policies to meet renewable energy target, admits Amber Rudd In June, Rudd said in the House of Commons that the UK “will still be meeting our targets” and was “committed to ensuring that we deliver on our decarbonisation targets”, as she spoke about ending new subsidies for onshore wind power.But the letter, dated 29 October and circulated to four other ministers, says: “The trajectory … currently leads to a shortfall against the target in 2020 of around 50 TWh (with a range of 32-67TWh) or 3.5% points (with a range of 2.1-4.5% points) in our internal central forecasts (which are not public). Publically we are clear that the UK continues to make progress to meet the target.”It also warns that the UK could be liable for fines if it misses the EU target and a judicial review if it does not have a credible plan to meet its obligations.To address the predicted shortfall, in the letter Rudd suggests a range of measures, including a last resort of paying for renewable projects in other EU countries as a way of offsetting the UK’s failure to increase its own generation, speeding up a planned undersea electricity cable to Norway and attempting to engage with EU member states to make the target more “flexible”.The letter also suggests a continued commitment to renewable heat, which has been named as a possible area for cuts in the Treasury’s spending review due on 25 November.

But more deplorably, it is wilfully hiding this from public scrutiny. The government is planning on cutting support for the solar and wind subsidies in the name of affordability.”The Green MEP Molly Scott Cato also said Rudd had “serious questions to answer about why she has reported something to parliament which appears inconsistent with what she has been telling other ministers”. “The UK’s energy policy is bound by European law which Rudd appears to be flouting,” she added. “I have already raised with the European commission my concerns about the fact that the government’s changes to energy policy make it unlikely we will meet our renewables target. The evidence in this letter shows the secretary of state is aware of this serious situation and I will now be following this up with further questions as a matter of urgency.”A spokesman for Decc said: “We do not comment on leaked documents. As the secretary of state has set out clearly in the House, renewables made up almost 20% of our electricity generation in 2014 and there is a strong pipeline to deliver our ambition of reaching 30% by 2020. We continue to make progress to meet our overall renewable energy target.”
