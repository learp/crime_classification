The first day of the optimistically titled Festival of Really Good Sex feels like the first day of the new school year, except instead of finding out who your teacher is, you’re going to watch people masturbate.The festival, which ran in Sydney over the weekend, encouraged participants to consider what good sex meant for them, and the relationship between sex and their identity. Held annually since 2011, this year’s attendees had a comprehensive schedule of workshops and performance evenings and a party to choose from, ranging from the quite sweet-sounding “Making babies” to “Porn yoga for porn lovers”, in which participants were encouraged (via both live and video demonstrations) to develop a more mindful approach to masturbating to pornography.There are plenty of nerves, giggles and a feeling of ripe anticipation on the festival’s first morning; by the end of the day, I felt enlightened – but not in the way I expected. Here are some things I learned.A sex toy for women's health: dildo designer talks the joy of conception Going to a sex festival is a lot like going to the beachMost of my friends spent the muggy Sydney weekend taking their pre-Australia Day white guilt to the beach. It turns out we had a fairly similar day. For one thing, I needed to bring a towel to lie on (I imagine this makes cleaning up after the “clothing optional” workshops a lot easier). For another, while the conference centre in Potts Point wasn’t exactly Bondi beach, it was a space to accidentally reveal more of yourself than you’re comfortable with. And much like when I go to the beach, I wondered about just how little hair removal I could get away with. During a workshop, my freshly assigned partner politely asked if he could touch my legs. As he gingerly cupped my stubbly calf, I wished that I’d been a little more thorough with my razor.Perhaps I need to go on a digital detoxI began with the “Orgasmic breathing and moaning” workshop, facilitated by a prolific erotic massage teacher, Joseph Kramer. Kramer taught us several breathing techniques, explaining how important breath and rhythm are for having good sex with yourself and with other people. For the last half hour of the workshop, he led the group in a communal erotic meditation, consciously building and releasing breath and tension. The room filled with the sounds of people swept away by their own breath – one man was barking like a kelpie, and beside me a woman sounded like an episode of One Born Every Minute. Meanwhile all I could think about was my iPhone, gently nestled at the bottom of my handbag. I couldn’t wait to formulate the perfect tweet about this. After the final release, several people around the room experienced such catharsis that they were softly crying. I realised that not even the promise of a communal orgasm could separate me from my phone. I vowed to investigate going on a digital detox. Or at least download an app that rewards you for spending less time on it.Sex education is sorely lackingAll I can remember from high school sex education was a slideshow depicting inflamed, weeping genitalia in the advanced stages of syphilis. Mrs Fraser didn’t spend a lot of time talking about pleasure or desire. Psychotherapist Dragan Zan Wright, on the other hand, led a workshop exploring consent, communication and the dichotomy of giving and receiving. In pairs we experimented with setting a boundary, and having that boundary crossed. I felt a mixture of annoyance and betrayal when my partner moved from rubbing my scalp to tugging my hair, and when my hands moved from rubbing my partner’s calves to touching her thighs I felt disappointed with myself. I wondered what would have happened if Mrs Fraser had talked about pleasure and responsibility as well as the likelihood of getting an unusual rash. Would I still have felt like it was easier to just have sex with that guy at the pub Christmas party instead of making things awkward by saying no? Would I have politely guided more fingers in the general direction of my clitoris, instead of enduring quite so much vigorous rubbing of my left labia?Why I put 400 condoms in the kitchen drawer for my sons There are definitely some things that shouldn’t be taught in schoolsOn Saturday afternoon I attended the “Please daddy” workshop, which seemed pertinent because in 2015 even our political figures feel the need to clarify their stance on the word.Adam Bandt (@AdamBandt)I am not my wife's daddy 😒 @Rob_Stott @BuzzFeedOz http://t.co/VtIizGkjXVOctober 8, 2015This workshop focused on the dynamic between a “daddy” and his “baby girl”, a kind of BDSM relationship where two consenting adults eroticise the father figure. This workshop was facilitated by Lukas Zpira, who began the session by selecting perhaps the most conventionally attractive young woman in the room and telling her, with the beckon of his finger, “I will have you.” It didn’t get less creepy from there.Zpira spent the workshop cradling her in his lap while stroking her. He asserted that it “feels good to be wrong”, suggesting that punishments for a disobedient little girl could include revoking access to her car or her credit cards. He explained that his dynamic as a daddy is 24/7, and that he expects his little girl to give him full access to her phone and emails. Many of the shell-shocked participants were learning about the daddy/baby girl relationship for the first time, and Zpira’s didactic approach felt reckless. While a healthy BDSM relationship explicitly discusses consent, Zpira explained that he doesn’t use safe words because, he said, “Daddy knows best.”It’s a dynamic that might work for some couples – and I can appreciate a well-timed cry of “Daddy” as much as the next girl – but I can’t get off on financial control, or revoking a woman’s power to stop a sexual act. I caught a cab home after this workshop unsure if the queasy feeling in my stomach was an allergic reaction to the quinoa salad I ate at lunchtime or to Zpira’s workshop.

He said: “What I said, is, in some cases, when you know each other so well that you can pretty much read each other’s minds and body language, when you have no more doubts that whatever happens you are in a safe zone, safe words become irrelevant, as you know that anywhere you partner will take you is a place you want to go, even if your limits are pushed, you can always sit down, evaluate the boundaries and set new ones should you wish to do so.”
