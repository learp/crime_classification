He wrote: “When this ‘Uncle Tom’ incident happened on Celebrity Apprentice in the boardroom several of my cast mates and I addressed Mr Trump immediately when we heard the comment. I can’t say if he knew what he was actually saying or not, but he did stop using that term once we explained its offensiveness.”He added, “I also want to be clear that I don’t agree with many of the statements Mr Trump has said during his current run for President.”Trump’s alleged remarks were reported to The Daily Beast by staff of The Apprentice. They refer to an episode in which Lil Jon wore an Uncle Sam costume as part of a task. According to one member of The Apprentice’s production team, staffers kept trying to explain to the business mogul that patriotic mascot Uncle Sam was not the same as the racially loaded term Uncle Tom: “He just couldn’t grasp that it was offensive,” they told Billboard. “When [Trump] decides he wants to do something, that’s his way.”Lil Jon’s statement comes after the Trump campaign denied the story, issuing a statement saying: “This is simply untrue.”Lil Jon isn’t the only artist to criticise Trump this week. Franz Ferdinand were the latest band to sign up to Dave Eggers’ 30 Days, 30 Songs project, which invites artists to contribute new material urging voters to stop Trump getting elected. Franz’s song is called Demagogue and contains the lyric: “He pleases my fears / It feels so good to be dumb.”    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest
