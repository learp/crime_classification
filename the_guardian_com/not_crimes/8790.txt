For Catriona CroweAn anthology of poetry on climate change I read that every polar bear alive has mitochondrial DNAfrom a common mother, an Irish brown bear who onceroved out across the last ice age, and I am comforted.It has been a long hot morning with the children of the machine,their talk of memory, of buying it, of buying it cheap, but I,memory keeper by trade, scan time coded in the golden hive mindof eternity. I burn my books, I burn my whole archive:a blaze that sears, synapses flaring cell to cell where'Our melting, shifting, liquid world': celebrities read poems on climate change memory sleeps in the wax hexagonals of my doomed and melting comb.I see him loping towards me across the vast ice fieldto where I wait in the cave mouth, dreaming my cubs about the den,my honied ones, smelling of snow and sweet oblivion.
