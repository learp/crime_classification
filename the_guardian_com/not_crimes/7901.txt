The strong year enjoyed by Bordeaux winegrowers in 2015 will allow the most prestigious chateaux to raise their prices by 60%, equalling the great vintages of 2009 and 2010, experts have said.The price tags on second-tier Bordeaux were predicted to rise by between 5% and 35%.The boon follows a relative drought that saw only two vintages deemed “good” in the past few years, those of 2011 and 2014.Wine: there’s more to sherry than the stuff in your gran's sideboard The ideal growing conditions of 2015 produced what wine critics called an “exceptional” vintage with prices to match.The top grands crus – a classification dating to 1855 – are on average 56% more expensive than in 2014, at about €600 (£490) a bottle in the wine shop.“These are the luxury labels, in demand around the world,” one dealer said, voicing annoyance at “Bordeaux-bashing” claims that the wines were over-priced.The 2015 grand cru prices may shock, coming after a fall in prices following the spikes of 2009 and 2010, said Thomas Hebrard, president and founder of U’wine, a dealer for wine investors.The star quality of the 2015 vintage will be a major boost for the Bordeaux region, further helped by the weak euro, he said.
