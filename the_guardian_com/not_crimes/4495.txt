9.07pm BST21:07Secretsquirrel he may have been coasting, but it was a pleasure cruise for the rest of us. But point taken- it was his time to go.Thanks all of you for the insights and zingers and communal sobs below. So who do we like for the final? Argue it out and come back to me with a unanimous verdict, please. Like 12 angry men but drunker and gender-mixed. I will see you all here next week for...the big one. The final final as we know it. In the meantime say hello on twitter or Insta or in real life. Unless I’m sat in a parked car staring very intently at a building, in which case leave me the hell alone.See you next week, guys!xFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.59pm BST20:59Having said that his fondants did look like cubic diabetes.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.58pm BST20:58Andrew winsA flurry of pseudo French from Mel to announce Andrew has done it! But Selasi goes home. Oh god, the tears started early and no one would begrudge them. Splendid, says Selasi of his experience. He really was.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.55pm BST20:55Hmm. Do we think Andrew- currently 6 years old- can take this and graduate to long trousers? Jane’s fondants look like she dropped Lego in Pepto-Bismol, but she’s baked the elements perfectly. Or do we think Candice has edged this? Four star bakerships would make her outright favourite for the big prize. I’m almost too sad to care. Almost.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.53pm BST20:53Oh, the look in Selasi’s eyes as he’s knows he’s going home. “Maybe don’t try the icing.” Hahaha! Oh, I’m gonna miss the hell out of him. You were a prince, Selasi.Okay, moving on.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.52pm BST20:52Oh.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.52pm BST20:52Go out in style Selasi. Finish Mary’s sentence or something. I hope these are good. I need them to be.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.51pm BST20:51Judging time! Candice’s little piano – where did she get a little piano? – is so pretty. Her flavours are great too. “Nowt wrong wi’ that,” applauds Mary, briefly possessed by the spirit of Geoffrey Boycott.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.50pm BST20:50“My fondant’s just oozing” mourns Andrew. Come on man, those words are too ridiculous and/or suggestive to fill with that kind of emotion. Be like Selasi. Man is just chucking random fruits and piping at it with less than five minutes to go. He’s McGuyvering the hell out of these bastard little cakes.I’m starting to feel emotional though. Here come the judges.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.49pm BST20:49Gearóidín McEvoy (@GaRoDean)How do you even get into the bake off tent without sieving flour??!! #GBBOOctober 19, 2016By being...Highly.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.49pm BST20:49This is messy. Like someone let a chimp loose in the art room messy. Jane’s bench looks like a Pollock. Candice is creating clouds of icing sugar like a David Copperfield stage show. Andrew has wads of loo roll everywhere. Fondants? Fun don’ts, more like. I don’t know what that means.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.47pm BST20:47Candice just refered to herself as ‘CB’. The pouty illeist. I tried to get people to call me R-Dog for a time, but it didn’t take. It’s just not how nicknames work.Selasi is allowed though. He just referred to himself as ‘the baking athlete’ when he is objectively doing the worst he’s ever done. I love him.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.46pm BST20:46Hahaha! Yes, Andrew is somehow getting younger each week, AngryCymraeg. He Benjamin Choclate Button-ing this tent. Candice’s pop your cherry surprise fondants are shaping up nicely. I also liked her palmiers. But I have the feeling Jane is gonna take star baker this week? She has the -ahem- confidence.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.43pm BST20:43“I’ve never sieved my flour.” Oh, FFS.

DON’T SCREW THIS.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.41pm BST20:41‘Selasi – saverin in silence’ is a LOL unto the highest heaven, Hcollider.Andrew’s making philharmonic fondants, to follow up his musical stave-shaped palmiers. “Because of my love of music.” Ah yes, that famous love of music he’s always going on about, in this one episode. What was wrong with citing engineering every eight seconds, and making Pythagorean meringues? He’s trying to have his cake and eat it. I guess he’s in the right place.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
