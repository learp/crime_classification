I remember the night you were born. I stumbled into the maternity ward long after hours and demanded to see you. I was 16 and out of my mind on drugs and myself. Your mother tried to stop the nurse handing you to me but I held you in my arms briefly before heading back into the night, your stare still reverberating through the opiate haze. I never wanted a baby; I was a baby. But there you were. A baby.I think I can count on one hand the amount of times I saw you during your first years. I couldn’t deal with your mother and her family, and I couldn’t even look after myself. I couldn’t deal with anything.I ran away to live abroad as soon as I could. I wanted to put millions of miles between me and everything close to me. You fell victim to my reinvention and I buried you somewhere deep along with everything else from my all-too-terrible teens.There followed intermittent meets at my mother’s house – at the first, I didn’t recognise you. My aunts grimaced and I nearly died, but you just smiled. You were four. Never one to let mirrors or skeletons throw me off, I bounced around the world for years, I even had the audacity to carry your picture. The postcards and letters I sent you invariably landed in the bin in my mum’s house (as I discovered years later). I never wanted a child. But there you were. I revelled in my ego, my love for my wife and our new kids. After all, I never wanted you as a child Just before you were seven, I came back to live at home. I wanted to see you and introduce you to my fiancee. You were anxious at first, but we spent some time together at weekends. We had fun, although you didn’t like the way I dressed (weird) or spoke (too posh). But we seemed to enjoy each other’s company. I took you to London for a few days to see the sights. We stayed with friends and had a great time. When I came back, my fiancee had decided she didn’t like you. Just like that. It was you or her. Soon after that she, unbeknownst to me, insulted and humiliated you at my father’s wedding. Later on the phone you were hysterical and screaming at me and her; your mother was livid. You were eight. It was a no-brainer really – I chose my fiancee. We married and moved to her home country. I left you again. I never wanted a child at that age.It took my wife 10 years to admit to what she had done and even then she didn’t see how speaking to you could help. It took me 10 years to see what I had done. I didn’t know what to say. The occasional mail made clear what you thought of her (and me). I revelled in my ego, my love for my wife and our new kids. After all, I never wanted you as a child.The last time we spoke, I had to help you get a passport. You needed my signature. After you turned 18, you no longer needed me. You still won’t speak to me now.The funny thing is, I don’t know what I would change if I could go back. When I think of you, my mind goes blank. I don’t know if it is love, regret, or just more self-pity. What I do know is that I miss you even though I never knew or wanted you. I want to talk to you, but I still don’t know what to say. I never wanted you, but I think I do now. AnonymousWe’d love to hear your storiesWe will pay £25 for every Letter to, Playlist, Snapshot or We Love to Eat we publish.
