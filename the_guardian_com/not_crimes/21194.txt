Guardian contributor MarkRylance 16 November 2016 12:45pmI've always liked hats, since I was a teenager, and they used to be such wonderful hats in vintage clothes stores in the 70s and 80s, some of which I still have. When I took the job at the Globe theatre, and had to do a lot more media work, I wanted to distinguish between when I was speaking as an actor, and as an artistic director. Now, I've just become fond of wearing hats, and of course, as I lose my hair, they keep me warmer and comfort my wounded vanity. I saw Maggie Smith recently - and this is great example of her wondrous talent - and she said: "What's with the hat? Is it because you're losing your hair?" And there is some truth to that now. But my love of hats began before I started to lose my hair.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.51pm GMT12:51Simother asks:How do you look back on the movie Intimacy and why did you choose to do it?  Guardian contributor MarkRylance 16 November 2016 12:43pmIntimacy was the most difficult job I've ever had. Hanif Kureishi's work and Patrice Chereau's words convinced me it was a very true and vital story about the difficulties people face finding intimacy in a big city like London. I know Hanif Kureishi's writing couldn't have been more intimate and revealing, but I found the making of the film and the subsequent publicity and personal attacks very, very painful. And I wish I hadn't made it.Updatedat 12.52pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.50pm GMT12:50AlbertEinJockStein asks:Would you rather eat an elephant-sized Malteser or a Malteser-sized elephant?

I have seen these elements pumped up in a lot of characters you portrayed on stage, like the Rooster, Richard III and King Philippe V. Is this something you do on purpose or just a coincidence?

The theatre is such a thrill'Jo Allan asks:I was just wondering how you’d found the transition from theatre to film and back. Do you feel like they require different parts of your self to get to the same end? Thank you.  Guardian contributor MarkRylance 16 November 2016 12:38pmThank you. They are very different, and require different skills. Not necessarily different skills of acting, but different skills around the acting that you do in both. I fear that ultimately I need more sensation and activity than film can provide for me. The theatre is such a thrill for me.Updatedat 12.44pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
