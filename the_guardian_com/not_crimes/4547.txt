Horizon: Clean Eating – The Dirty Truth 9pm, BBC2“Can we really eat ourselves well?” asks Dr Giles Yeo in a Horizon that examines “clean eating”. For the uninitiated, this is the Instagram-driven dietary movement that attributes health-giving properties to certain foods. Thus, beef broth becomes an “elixir”. (Yeo: “You might call it stock …”) Interviewee “Deliciously” Ella Mills is sensible, suggesting the term “clean” has lost its meaning. Conversely, we see what happens when clean collides with pseudoscience. Jonathan WrightUnforgotten 9pm, ITVThe second series of this superior whodunnit rumbles on. Tonight, detectives Cassie Stuart (Nicola Walker) and Sunny Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar) continue to piece together details concerning the late David Walker, learning of a troubled childhood and assembling a hypothesis of what – and who – might have brought Walker’s life to a violent end. Elsewhere, a discussion about Marion’s past reveals a close relationship with an IRA activist. Andrew MuellerJack Dee’s Inauguration Helpdesk 10pm, BBC2It’s debatable as to whether the world is quite in the mood for a light-hearted take on the presidential inauguration of Donald J Trump. But sometimes, all you can do is laugh. Jack Dee – whose mordant wit should serve the context well – will be joined by Gabby Logan and Romesh Ranganathan to answer questions, attempt to assuage audience concerns and essentially join the rest of us in hoping for the best. Phil HarrisonUrban Myths 10pm, Sky ArtsEddie Marsan drawls opaque riddles as Bob Dylan, in the first of a series of tall tales about the famous. August, 1993: Dylan arrives in London, alone, and proceeds to Crouch Hill, where Dave Stewart has told him to visit any time. At the address Bob’s written down, Ange (Katherine Parkinson) confirms Dave (Paul Ritter) will be back in a sec, and shows him into the front room… it’s the sort of gleefully ephemeral comic oddity BBC2 might once have felt able to indulge in. Jack SealeSpies 9pm, Channel 4It’s halfway through the course in which regular folk are turned into spies by real-life intelligence officers, and 10 trainees remain in the game. An overseas challenge awaits the winners of this week’s covert shenanigans, involving the extraction of information from unwitting strangers in a pub. They then have to detect whether they’re being followed through the city streets. Finally, the trainees are given the tough choice of choosing just one trusted ally from their number. Ben ArnoldSword, Musket & Machine Gun: Britain’s Armed History 9pm, BBC4God knows what the neighbours thought as Hiram Maxim tried out his invention in the basement of 57d Hatton Garden during 1883. The first automatic machine gun was supposed to be the weapon to end wars, a moral deterrent, but “progress” always finds a way... In the final blast of this fascinating series, Dr Sam Willis explores Maxim’s game-changer, and the semi-automatic pistols that appeared in its wake. Ali CatterallChewing Gum 10pm, E4In light of last week’s cracking series two opener, this week Michaela Coel’s comedy feels slightly lighter on big laughs, its humour more understated. A now homeless Tracey wants to move back in with her mum, who stipulates she demonstrate her Christian piety first. Meanwhile, Tracey is pursued with a strange intensity by a posh, attractive man, a plot that allows the show to once again explore the objectification of black people with both wit and a simmering rage.

Photograph: Allstar/Miramax/Sportsphoto Ltd./AllstarHaving cut her way through swaths of villains in volume one, Uma Thurman’s vengeful, samurai-sword wielding Bride now has Eyepatch Elle (Daryl Hannah), trailer-trash Budd (Michael Madsen) and killer Bill himself (David Carradine) in her sights. More dizzying set-pieces – the live burial, the fight in the caravan – and more black-as-death Tarantino humour in this second slice of extraordinarily kinetic and inventive pulp fiction.
