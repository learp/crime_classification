ITV has abandoned plans to buy Entertainment One, the owner of Peppa Pig.The broadcaster said in a stock market statement that it had formally withdrawn its proposal to acquire eOne because the two companies could not agree on a price to begin negotiations.The withdrawal comes just two weeks after it emerged that eOne had rebuffed a £1.01bn offer from ITV, which valued the company at 236p a share, about a fifth higher than eOne’s share price before rumours of a takeover bid emerged.As well as owning Peppa Pig, eOne distributes television programmes and films, such as David Brent: Life on the Road and The BFG.The move by ITV was seen as an extension of its strategy to expand its production business and reduce its reliance on advertising income. However, analysts questioned whether ITV should take on eOne’s film distribution business, which is a notoriously volatile industry and relies on the performance of a handful of blockbusters. Despite not being able to agree on a price, ITV said: “ITV continues to believe in the strategic logic and potential benefits of acquiring eOne but has a clear view of the value of the business, recognising that this value would need to be verified by appropriate due diligence.“It appears this value is different to the level at which the board of eOne would currently engage in a more formal process. ITV has a clear strategy to build a stronger, more diversified international business and will continue its disciplined approach to evaluating its healthy pipeline of potential investment opportunities.”Shares in eOne fell 13% to 217.02p following ITV’s statement. ITV’s share price was up just over 1.5% to 205p.
