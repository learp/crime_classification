It’s not The Office. It mustn’t be. That was very then.”The film has been picked up in the US by Netflix after Gervais recently directed, wrote and starred in their original comedy Special Correspondents, which received largely negative reviews and a 13% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.David Brent: Life on the Road will be in UK cinemas on 19 August.
