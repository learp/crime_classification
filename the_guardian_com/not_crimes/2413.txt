Below is this week’s playlist – the theme and tunes picked by a reader from the comments on last week’s callout. Thanks for your suggestions.  about the format of the weekly Readers Recommend series at the end of the piece.Human beings, like all animals, are, basically, a big bag of gloop covered in skin. We leak, therefore we are. Here is a selection of songs about the kind of stuff that can leak out of us all the time – fluids, of the bodily kind.Let’s get this one out of the way first. The nominator, onarope, calls it “NSFW”: quite frankly, after many hours of watching the video very closely, I’d have to describe Peaches’ Rub as “Not suitable. Full stop”. Great song though.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The YouTube playlist, which begins with a song our reader warns contains some explicit material.Click here if you prefer Spotify.Americans call a full stop a period which, coincidentally, is the subject matter of Cherry Glazerr’s White’s Not My Color This Evening – a punkish delight.There was a lot of blood this week. So it was some relief to be able to choose an old favourite in the shape of Love’s Live and Let Live. The Summer of Love took on a rather more paranoid and snotty form when transported to Los Angeles. Back to blood and a very vampire-like take on things from Concrete Blonde, with Bloodletting: all black and white film and lacy clothes. The next track, Nicole Dollanganger’s Blood Brothers, is a delicate thing, though with somewhat disturbing lyrics. Described as a “haunted lullaby” by nominator MisterIks, I think it’s more than likely to engender some very weird dreams.Getting all Elizabeth Báthory on us, the Louvin Brothers ask: Are You Washed in the Blood of the Lamb? Personally I prefer shower gel, but each to their own.Australian legend Barry Crocker next, with a sensitive ode Chunder in the Old Pacific Sea. Speaking of the Pacific, it’s home, of course, to surfing. And who better to sing of bodily fluids than the Butthole Surfers, with a, for them, fairly straightforward track, I Saw an X-ray of a Girl Passing Gas.And, as we’ve got our board shorts on why not join pop-punk quartet Tacocat as they surf The Crimson Wave. Hang Ten, gremmies!Well, it’s been quite a party and, like all good parties it should end, I feel, in a slew of bodily gunk. So let’s join Andrew W.K. and Party Til You Puke. Clean up in aisle three!New themeThe theme for next week’s playlist will be announced at 8pm (UK time) on Thursday 9 June.
