Don’t Look Down: Rope Men 8pm, ITVOne-off following industrial abseilers who offer a cost-effective alternative to scaffolding. From heatstroke-inducing climbs in Dubai to a challenging job at Reading’s Madejski Stadium, there are plenty of hurdles facing the Essex firm. While it’s an interesting enough look at their exploits, there’s not much that couldn’t have been said in half the time, with half as many helicopter shots. Hannah J DaviesHorizon: Why Are We Getting So Fat? 9pm, BBC2Dr Giles Yeo is the charming host of a fun but flabby grab-bag of theories on obesity. Roaming the country meeting overweight Brits, Yeo investigates the genes that make excess fat more likely, and looks at whether hormonal appetite suppressants might be the future. It’s meant to deflate demands to eat less and exercise more, but that often does prove to be the answer. Meanwhile, our emotional relationship with food is touched on too lightly. Jack SealeRich Brother, Poor Brother: Cutting Edge 9pm, Channel 4This documentary sets out to explore inequality but can’t resist hitching this huge, complex issue to a pair of charismatic outliers whose circumstances are probably too unusual to offer insight into more universal systemic issues. Ivan Massow lives in a vast London pile while his brother David lives in a van. Can they bridge the gap by spending four days together? Up to a point. But where that gets us in terms of wider understanding is debatable. Phil HarrisonCameron and Farage Live: The EU Referendum 9pm, ITVA live studio debate, chaired by Julie Etchingham, in which questions will be taken from a studio audience. Farage has been somewhat sidelined by the Leave campaigners, many of whom regard him as a liability. Here’s his chance to prove them wrong – though, equally, he could be slaughtered. Meanwhile, on BBC2, Jack Dee’s Referendum Help Desk (10pm) sees Dee and a panel of comedians, including Katherine Ryan and Romesh Ranganathan, treat the debate rather more lightly. David StubbsBig Brother: Live Launch 9pm, Channel 5Summer can’t start until Big Brother kicks off. So here come another shiver of fame-hungry sharks who’ll do whatever it takes to be remembered as the new Michelle Bass. Emma Willis expertly shepherds them into the house in this Live Launch, and a nation waits for all hell to break loose on the cameras’ nightly visit. There are rumours of two houses this year, just in case there’s not enough rivalry already guaranteed. Hannah VerdierAgatha Raisin 9pm, Sky1Ashley Jensen is back as the sleuth whose life is packed with just-moved-to-the-country-based cliches. Former colleague Roy (Mathew Horne) turns up after being dumped, bringing a naked yogi with him. Agatha joins a rambling group and is soon dragged into a murder investigation after one of their members is found dead on a landowner’s estate. And so begins a flimsy but entertaining whodunnit in which Agatha is reunited with her ex, James (Jamie Glover), as they go undercover. HV Outcast 10pm, FOXDemonic possession is real, and only the kid from Almost Famous can save us. That, broadly, is the premise for this new gothic horror from Robert Kirkman, creator of The Walking Dead. Patrick Fugit stars as Kyle, a dead-eyed survivor of childhood abuse who teams up with a boozy local reverend (Philip Glenister) for some improvised exorcism in their West Virginia hometown. If you can make it past the deeply upsetting opening, Outcast shows some eerie promise. Graeme VirtueFilm choice The Last Picture Show (Peter Bogdanovich, 1971) 1.05am, Film4Surprising that city-boy Bogdanovich crafted such a note-perfect portrait of US smalltown life. Adapted by the director and Larry McMurtry from the latter’s novel, it’s set in a hot and dusty Texas town where two boys (Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms) stew and fall out over a beautiful girl (Cybill Shepherd). Howard Hawks’s Red River is the last booking at the rundown cinema.
