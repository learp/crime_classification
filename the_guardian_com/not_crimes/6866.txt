Trigger warning: this essay contains heteronormative material. As a sick man whose internal clock is so out of whack that it ticks in no other direction except towards silence, I am often up late in search of junk TV shows and bad movies that will lull me to sleep. In that condition I am grateful even for Steven Seagal movies, some of which could lull a charging herd of wildebeest. But there is a danger, when clicking among the scrapyard channels, that I will be suddenly confronted with those ephebic 118 twins who run around, pause, pose and run around again.Full of benevolence in my declining hours, I want to see nobody done out of a job, but I have to say that I had been expecting these two to be gone by now. Instead, they are still there. Only last night, while Steven Seagal was preparing to beat up an army of yakuza, the 118 twins were there again, running, pausing and posing. In one of these pausing poses they both pointed their bottoms at me. Imagine something totally uninteresting and then double it.The bottoms were clad in running shorts yet somehow managed to give a knowing wink. Perhaps it was a form of sign language. If so, it was a reminder that the spoken language is the real miracle. Recently, BBC4 ran Bob Geldof’s excellent programme about WB Yeats. Though it might at first seem anomalous to hear Geldof drop the F-bomb so often in a context where the linguistic standards are being set by such magisterial Yeats poems as Sailing To Byzantium, nevertheless the sonic fit was perfect, partly because Geldof speaks with such precise intelligence that he brings out the strength of the great poet’s verbal music. Though there was not enough about Mrs Yeats and her scornful tolerance for the absurdly heteronormative tail-chasing of her husband’s twilight, this was the perfect tribute, and since it was on BBC4 there was no chance of being interrupted by the pointing bottoms of the 118 twins.Clive James: ‘In my condition, you have to go on throwing a double six just to stay in the game’ There is always the chance, alas, that BBC4 will get cancelled, because the BBC is cursed with the superfluous presence of at least one layer of managers so dense that they don’t realise what is valuable about the institution they infest. What can we who depend upon it do to safeguard our magic channel against the rising ocean of Steven Seagal movies and commercial breaks haunted by the 118 twins? All I myself can do is issue a threat: if some upstairs nitwit even contemplates signing the cancellation papers, I will return from the netherworld in a chariot of atomic fire, leap out, and point my bottom at him.
