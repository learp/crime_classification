Hilary Clinton’s former policy chief, two Guardian journalists and a Syrian writer’s return from exile have all been longlisted for the 2016 Orwell prize, Britain’s prestigious prize for political writing which aims to reward the writing that approaches Orwell’s ambition to “make political writing into an art”.No fiction makes the cut this year, with Middle Eastern politics dominating the longlist. Guardian journalist and Middle East expert Jason Burke is on the 13-strong list for his book The New Threat from Islamic Militancy, as is Wendell Steavenson, for Circling the Square, her account of Egypt’s revolution from Tahrir Square in Cairo. Emma Sky’s first book, The Unravelling, is also included; as a civilian volunteer during the Iraq war, Sky’s insider account of the conflict was praised for its dark humour in Robin Yassin-Kassab’s review for the Guardian. Samar Yazbek: ‘Syria has been hung, drawn and quartered’ Syrian writer Samar Yazbek, who won the 2012 PEN Pinter International Writer of Courage award for her coverage of the war in Syria, is also nominated for her book The Crossing. This documents her return to Syria over the Turkish border, after being exiled for her political writing.Other contenders include Guardian journalist Andy Beckett for his book about Britain in the early 80s, Promised You a Miracle: UK 80-82; Gillian Tett and her book on communication, The Silo Effect; and Arkady Ostrovsky, for his book on Russia’s journey from communism to capitalism, The Invention of Russia.Two former political advisers, from different sides of the pond, also receive nods: Anne-Marie Slaughter – the former policy chief to US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton – for Unfinished Business, her book on gender roles and work; and Steve Hilton – former political adviser to David Cameron – for More Human, his manifesto for putting people first in government and business.The Orwell prize for books 2016 - the longlist in pictures The judges for the 2016 Orwell prize for books are Cambridge politics professor Andrew Gamble; journalist David Goodhart and the Economist’s books editor Fiammetta Rocco, with Lord William Waldegrave. In a statement, the panel said: “All of the longlisted books were written out of personal witness. They shared a relationship to the events they described, a holding to account, and they shared a direct, personal engagement with the material.”The winner of each £3,000 Orwell prize – for books, journalism and ‘exposing Britain’s social evils’ – will be announced at a ceremony at the end of May. Past winners of the Orwell prize for books, which has been running since 1994, include Alan Johnson, Andrea Gillies and British novelist and journalist James Meek, who won the 2015 prize for his book about the growth of privatisation, Private Island.The 2016 Orwell prize for books longlistPromised you a Miracle: UK 80–82 by Andy Beckett (Allen Lane)The New Threat from Islamic Militancy by Jason Burke (Bodley Head)The House by the Lake by Thomas Harding (William Heinemann)How the French Think by Sudhir Hazareesingh (Allen Lane)More Human by Steve Hilton (WH Allen)Other People’s Money by John Kay (Profile Books)The Tears of the Rajas by Ferdinand Mount (Simon and Schuster)The Invention of Russia by Arkady Ostrovsky (Atlantic Books)The Unravelling by Emma Sky (Atlantic Books)Unfinished Business by Anne-Marie Slaughter (Oneworld Publications)Circling the Square by Wendell Steavenson (Granta Books)The Silo Effect by Gillian Tett (Little, Brown)The Crossing by Samar Yazbek (Rider)
