Hannah VerdierPeaky Blinders 9pm, BBC2This week, the Russians employ a decidedly unusual recruitment process, leading Tommy to suspect he’s in danger of being outgunned. Elsewhere, with life on the wrong side of the law a lot more alluring than remaining on the straight and narrow, Michael might just embrace the darkness. Plus, there’s the return of Alfie Solomons (Tom Hardy) and his unusual turns of phrase. “Your head is like some sort of smashed vase stuck back together by a horse,” he says to Shelby. Mark Gibbings-JonesThe Americans 9pm, ITV EncoreIt’s a shame The Americans – an edgy espionage drama set in the Reagan era that has much to say about how we got to now – has never quite found a UK audience. Perhaps its cultural references don’t carry. Newbies, do us a favour: think about it for your next box set. Broadcast-wise, we’re early in series four, and Soviet agents Philip and Elizabeth are trying to cope with daughter Paige learning about their double lives. Jonathan WrightDan Cruickshank: At Home With the British9pm, BBC4Dan Cruickshank’s treatise on the British home ends by considering the emergence of the flat. After two million homes were destroyed by the Luftwaffe, and swaths of terraced slums were levelled, a bold experiment was undertaken to create utilitarian homes. Cruickshank visits the tower blocks of the Lincoln estate in Bromley-by-Bow, east London, to see how they worked, and how they were received by their new residents. Ben ArnoldNew Girl9pm, E4With Jess’s quirky routine far from new after four series, it’s a relief to see series five’s premiere focus more on Schmidt and Cece than its titular character’s own much-laboured kookiness. Jess (Zooey Deschanel) organises an engagement party for the pair, not realising that Cece’s mum has no idea about the relationship. Cue a frantic attempt to get Mrs Parekh to give the union her blessing, via the power of dance. Hannah J DaviesGoing Forward10pm, BBC4“I’m just going to empty your catheters: who wants to go first?” It’s the concluding part of this wonderfully tough comedy, as Kim confronts outsourced care providers Buccaneer 2000, along with a familiar old face from the hospital. Meanwhile, son Ryan returns to live at home to save some cash, although his contribution to the family meal – Chicken Alaska – isn’t the best (“Salmonella in the middle bit, carcinogenic on the outside”). There’s a showdown with Jackie, too. Ali CatterallFilm choiceLe Week-End (Roger Michell, 2013), 9pm, Channel 4A pair of sixtysomethings take the Eurostar to Paris to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary and desperately attempt to rekindle a faltering relationship. For schoolteacher Meg (Lindsay Duncan) and philosophy lecturer Nick (Jim Broadbent), a weekend in the capital of romance is a prickly proposition, veering between jollity and melancholy. Frailties of age loom and the appearance of Nick’s old university chum turned star academic Morgan (Jeff Goldblum) tests the marital faultlines. Still, the couple amuse, attract and irritate each other. Paul HowlettDonnie Darko (Richard Kelly, 2001), 10.45pm, Horror ChannelThis tale of an angsty, smalltown youngster (Jake Gyllenhaal), a Harvey-like 6ft rabbit and a jet engine that crashes through the roof of the family home is a brilliantly innovative slice of sci-fi that became a cult hit. Did the engine fall from the sky or through a space-time wormhole? Are Donnie’s visions – and warning of apocalypse – real or hallucinatory? It’s all a mystery in this darkly funny comedy.
