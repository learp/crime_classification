The masses have called out for a president known for duplicity, covering up inappropriate and even racist comments, and an obsession with the media’s opinion about certain anatomical shortcomings. No, not Donald Trump, as he steadily marches toward the White House – Selina Meyer, the woman who’s already there.We’ve weathered four years of  Meyer, and doled out awards to Julia Louis-Dreyfus ahead of her fifth season on Veep, which starts this Sunday, 24 April. We’ll have the same feelings for Trump, right? So sick of winning that we’ll throw every laurel in reach at him. That’s surely what’s bound to happen.What Hillary Clinton could learn from TV's women in power Both politicianshave a way with gaffes. Trump misspoke and called 9/11 7-Eleven. It was a bit like when Meyer misappropriated Shakespeare and said a member of her staff as was “hoisted by our own retard”.Trump and Meyer have even more in common. Both accused prominent politicians of not being eligible to be president. Trump said Ted Cruz, a former dual US-Canadian citizen, might not be able to run for the White House. Meyer questioned whether an Asian American governor was born in the US or China. Both enlisted the help of a pro-Caucasian wing to push their agenda forward. Meyer once walked into a room to people chanting “USA! USA!” after they learned she said: “It’s the White House, not the Yellow House.” This was all during her first term – and the US is still standing. How bad could Trump be?Meyer’s popularity seems to transcend her party, which might be why she gets a pass: both Republicans and Democrats figure she’s the fool on the other side of the aisle. Trump’s support also crosses party lines, with many who currently support Bernie Sanders, the most progressive candidate in the race, saying they will back Trump if Sanders doesn’t get the Democratic nomination. Neither politician has managed relations abroad well either. Trump’s promise to build a “big, beautiful wall” on the southern border has upset the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox, and his calls to ban Muslims alarmed the world. Meyer angered most of Europe with a silly song at a campaign rally and made it even worse when she had a horrible run-in with the Finnish president and her lecherous husband. But, hey, at the end of the day, she averted war.Malcolm Turnbull's ‘continuity and change’ slogan straight out of Veep And what about Meyer’s vain obsession with crude internet insults, such as “Viagra prohibitor”? Doesn’t that call to mind a “short-fingered vulgarian” who spoke about the size of his hands during a nationally televised debate? And let’s not forget Meyer’s tacky state dinner that surely resembles a Trump fete. Meanwhile, both political figures have been involved with Saturday Night Live – though Trump was in on the gag and Meyer demanded apologies.See, we’ve already experienced all of these things and more. How bad could Trump be? Oh, that’s right. Meyer is only a character on a TV show, and a satire no less. Never mind, then. It could be that bad. Veep’s season five starts Sunday at 10.30pm EST on HBO
