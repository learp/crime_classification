When things go bad, it always helps if we can pretend it’s someone else’s fault. This book is what happens when we run out of people to blame. It’s the story of 16 year old Ant and her 11 year old brother Mattie, locked up in Britain’s first family prison. Ant might not be everyone’s idea of a hero, but she’s all we’ve got!Blame is my first book aimed at a YA audience and I really hope you enjoy seeing the cover and reading the opening chapters for the first time. You’ll have to wait a little while to read the rest, as Blame doesn’t come out until July 2016.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I hope you enjoy reading the start of my YA debut thriller Blame. I’d love to know what you think on Twitter. You can follow me on @simonmayo and use #AreYouToBlame. Itchcraft by Simom Mayo - review
