‘Grass-fed” is the new organic. It appeared on Whole Foods’ new trend list, with “heirloom ingredients” and “ancient grains”. US sales of grass-fed labelled milk, eggs, yogurt, butter, cheese and even protein powders are soaring.The attraction is that livestock are reared outside, deriving most of their diet from grass. This is in contrast to the North American system where cows are grain-fed in a Cafo (concentrated animal feeding operation), with scant access to pasture.Studies suggest grass-fed milk contains far more omega-3 (desirable), and far less omega-6 (undesirable) than industrially raised cow-juice. It can also help ensure livestock products are free of GMOs, as most conventional feed contains GM ingredients. Plus, animals reared outside are given fewer antibiotics.This new label could bring ethical benefits, too. Peter Melchett of the Soil Association tells me: “It is wonderful that there is growing awareness of the lives farm animals lead. Anything which encourages grass-fed meat and dairy is a major plus.”The Pasture Fed Livestock Association in the UK advocates outdoor animal rearing, as does the Soil Association. But given our winters, most UK farmers have to supplement “buffer crops”, and few push for 100% grass-fed.Nearly all British beef is grass-fed (we have few intensive Cafo-type systems). Dairy is a different story. More grass-fed products would represent a buffer – for cows, customers and small farmers – against the rise of “mega-sheds”, which Compassion in World Farming campaigns against as cows do not get to frolic in pastures.I phoned Whole Foods’ flagship UK store to check. They do have heritage peppermint, but no grass-fed yogurt. “Have you tried organic?” they asked.The big picture: protecting our meadows      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The bee orchid is the poster flower against the decline of meadows and wildflowers in the UK. Photograph: Tim WilkinsThe bee orchid (photographed here by Tim Wilkins) is one of nature’s great mimics, tricking its main pollinator – the bee – into believing it is a female bee. It can grow on scrub, waste ground or verges. Now it’s the poster flower for plantlife.org.uk’s Meadow Maker Awards and the fightback against the decline of meadows and wildflowers in the UK. Since the 1930s we have lost 97% of these vital habitats.Well dressed: the Building Bloqs fashion lab      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Building Bloqs is currently at 4 Anthony Way, London N18.The ambitions of emerging designers can be thwarted by a lack of affordable facilities. Last year the Trampery fashion lab in east London was lost to a 400% rent hike.This makes Building Bloqs’s new textile studio in Enfield even more critical. For a £40 joining fee and a £26 per day rate, graduate and freelance designers will be able to make use of pattern-cutting tables, straight-stitch sewing machines and overlockers galore. Pictured (right) is how the space will look in 2017.Alis Le May is spearheading the fashion and textiles part of the equation. ‘The plan is that the studio will be part of a movement to bring back some of Britain’s lost textile industry, and help to provide employment to makers who wouldn’t be able to afford these kind of facilities themselves,’ she says.Email Lucy at lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @lucysiegle
