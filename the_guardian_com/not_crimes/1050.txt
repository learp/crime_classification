I never learned to ride a bike as a child. I grew up in London in the 1970s, and it just wasn’t on my radar. Plus I was scared of falling. It wasn’t until I was 41, married to a keen cyclist and feeling I was missing out, that we decided to give a tandem a try. The first time we rode it I was terrified. We’ve since done over 2,000 miles and it has become our favourite mode of transport.The front rider is known as the pilot. They control the gears, braking and signalling. The back rider is the stoker. They provide the power. That tends to be my job: pedal, pedal, pedal. The heavier rider should be at the front. It’s bad enough going up a hill when you’re dragging 20-plus stone and the weight of the bike, without having an anchor on the back.Trust and communication are vital. It can be disconcerting – even dangerous – if someone decides to brake, freewheel on the pedals or change gear without warning, especially for the stoker whose view of the road ahead is obstructed. You have to be aware of what the other person is doing the whole time, and communicate what you’re about to do. When you get it right and you’re perfectly in sync, you feel like you’re part of a machine. Somehow we never bicker. Well, I did have a few words when Phil piloted us at speed through a large puddle.My workout: Amy Horton, 26, rock climber – ‘It can be scary’ We’ve got “normal” bicycles, but we never ride them. With the tandem, we have the freedom of being on the bike, getting fresh air and enjoying the countryside, combined with being able to spend time with each other. We can have a conversation without having to shout across to another bike.People are supportive and curious. The reaction from teenage boys is surprising. Of all the things you would have thought a teenage boy would not find cool, it would be two middle-aged people on the same bike, and yet they’ll say, “Wow, cool bike!” On a tandem, you’re guaranteed smiles and comments from people you pass.My weekend workoutHow often do you ride?

It lists all the locations across the country where you can buy or hire a tandem, as well as details of organised tandem rides.2 You can pick up a secondhand tandem for relatively little on eBay, but it’s worth having a go first. Many bikes shops that sell tandems will let you try before you buy. You’ll find out soon enough if it’s not for you.3 The lighter the bike, the better. It just makes riding that much easier and more enjoyable, especially if you’re going to be tackling hills. Having said that, a heavy bike does have its advantages on the way back down.4 Choose your riding partner wisely. If you have a tendency to argue, or you’re still in the first flush of love, it could all go horribly wrong. There’s nothing like a tandem to expose cracks in your communication.5 Do not underestimate the turning circle of a tandem. Or what fun it is getting one through a kissing gate (upend and wheel through your unwieldy 7ft steed).Essential kit      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Clockwise, from left:Orbit Tandems Routier Sport Disc bike, £1,950;helmet, £33.24, wiggle.com;Pendle Standard Tandem roof rack, £199, pendle-bike.co.uk
