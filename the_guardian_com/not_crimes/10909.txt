As you looked over the marsh it seemed deeply anomalous that it was a sunlit September landscape but brutalised by gales that were pure December. The crowns of the trees flailed in a general north-easterly direction and the tall grasses running up the river bank were bent to the ground. Yet some of the wider sights and sounds seemed to fit happily into both contexts. The rooks, for instance, shone like black flints on the fields, but with their low centre of gravity they hunkered down to the turf as they hammered and shovelled in the earth, and seemed entirely untroubled. There was a winter quality to the grey heron's hoarse shout as it lumbered upstream. There was even something rather playful about the jackdaws, the way they swirled and flung themselves in great circular patterns against the gathering clouds. In that increasingly muddy sky they were like leaves swilled in dregs of an empty cup.Yet it was hard to square the swallows with this place. Three or four of them swooped low across the river Yare, and were almost blown back with the force of the opposing airstream. Somehow they picked out narrow fissures in that cold bluff of wind, and slowly reached the other side. They then arced down over the fields, flying almost sideways, as if resting on one wing, using the left briefly as a flail to paddle against the blast. By the time I'd turned for home the sun had gone. Rain started pounding down in diagonal sheets. Against the collar of my coat, which I raised to protect my glasses, it made a brittle sound like snapping twigs. When I got home I was completely soaked, cold trickles of water running down my shins. I thought finally of those blue birds. They weigh about 22g (less than 1oz), which works out roughly at one gram of wing muscle and sinew and hollow bone for every 450km of their forthcoming journey.
