Are you listening…? Hold onto your seats as you are about to be blown away. Have you read the School for Good and Evil series? If you haven’t my fellow review readers, you should get reading! It is one of the most thrilling and exciting books I have ever read. I assure you the final book of the series will make your heart skip and pounce through the paragraphs and dance through the pages.Two girls, Sophie and Agatha, fight for their happy ever after and for a prince. You will gasp as you uncover dark mysteries about the girls’ past and present. As the story unfolds, relationships unexpectedly change.When evil overtakes good, there is a huge war. Nothing will stay the same. Will magic bring people together or shatter the hearts of many? Will Good and Evil stay together or be torn further apart? I am warning you, my review readers, not every story has a happing ending and not every prince deserves his princess. This is definitely in my top three favourite books. I love the romance, drama and action which I am sure you will love it! 10 out of 10. A real page flicker and I recommend it for anyone aged 10-13.
