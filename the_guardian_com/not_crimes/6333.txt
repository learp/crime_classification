My mother has become severely sight-impaired and can see only white flowers well. What white or very pale flowering shrubs could we plant that will establish quickly (she is 81)? She has clay soil, some of it very dry, and a mixture of sunny and partially shaded beds.In the sunny bit, try planting a white flowering rose of Sharon, Hibiscus syriacus ‘White Chiffon’. This is a pure white, double form of hibiscus and in full sun it is very fast-growing, particularly if you dig in some compost. It’s pretty unfussy about its soil as long as it’s free-draining. The flowers stand up well to wind and rain, which is a bonus. The plants are not cheap: expect to pay between £15 and £20 for a three-litre pot.Ask Alys Fowler: does my antirrhinum have rust? A white buddleja is another good option – happy in sun or part-shade and willing to take on the clay. B. davidii ‘White Profusion’ has white flowers with a yellow eye that arch in sprays from July to September. You’re bound to get butterflies, too. They have a strong scent, so you could cut a few for the house.Finally, the giant blowsy flowers of Hydrangea arborescens ‘Annabelle’ flower from July to September. The blooms last a long time and fade to a pale lime.• Got a question for Alys? Email askalys@theguardian.com
