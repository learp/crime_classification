A TV presenter failed to make it clear she was being paid to send a tweet about a snack, the advertising watchdog has ruled.AJ Odudu posted a picture of an Alpro Go On yoghurt-type pot in her hand alongside the caption “Fave summer snack vibes”.The tweet should have been marked to show she was being paid to promote the company’s products, the Advertising Standards Authority said.Sexually explicit Sunday Sport ads banned despite 'censorship' claim Odudu, a former presenter on Big Brother’s spin-off show Bit on the Side, should have included a “clear identifier” in the post to let people know it was marketing, rather than her own editorial content, the ASA said.Odudu, who currently has more than 25,000 followers on Twitter, has been warned to mark future similar posts with #ad to clear up any doubt.In its ruling, which was sparked by one complaint, the ASA said: “The ad was presented in a similar ‘voice’ to Ms Odudu’s other tweets and did not include any clear identifier, such as ‘#ad’, to demarcate it from her own content.“While we noted that the tweet contained the advertiser Twitter handle and campaign hashtags, we did not consider that this would make clear to consumers the commercial intent of the content or the editorial control exercised by the advertiser.”The company, which specialises in soya food products, has pledged to ensure any future marketing communications are marked up as ads.
