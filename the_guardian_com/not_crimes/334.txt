Opening shot of high heels clicking across a Manhattan street. Camera pans back to a slender woman of a certain age with an expensive, slightly avant-garde hairstyle tapping out emails on her phone as she enters an imposing glass-fronted office. Cut to same woman striding out of lift 60 floors up, powering through an open-plan office, firing off orders about which Manolos to put Jen in for the cover try.The glossy magazine behind-the-scenes doc is a fully fledged screen genre all of its own. What started with The Devil Wears Prada spawned The September Issue and Absolutely Fashion: Inside Vogue. Only the White House and the Tudor court have proved greater catnip for the modern storyteller than the glass-walled office of an editrix.So Cosmo (available on Thursday 9 February on demand from Hayu) is a fizzy, peppy take on this format. This show makes no claim for insight into the fourth estate but instead aims squarely for “guilty pleasure” status. This is a media documentary for the audience of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Everyone has incredible eyebrows and carries a grande latte into every meeting. The opening minutes feature a vibrator, Kylie Jenner, more side-eye than an episode of The Hills and tips on good pick-up lines to use in the Starbucks queue.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Joanna Coles, British editor-in-chief of the US edition of Cosmopolitan, is the star of the show. Platinum cropped hair, crisp English accent, air of mischief: imagine if the Tilda Swinton of A Bigger Splash had a treadmill desk in the headquarters of Hearst International. Rather than allow the film-makers to find the story themselves, Coles has given them a ready-made narrative, by announcing her shock resignation on the first day of filming.So the show soon becomes about the ensuing jostling for position between Cosmo’s younger staff. They are all Cher Horowitz aspiring to be Carrie Bradshaw: cue several scenes of young ladies perched on bar stools downtown for salty sex chat with their gay male friends over cocktails.The best moments are when these young pretenders come into contact with Coles. Just as in House Of DVF, the E! reality show that followed fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg’s search for a young brand ambassador, the scenes where the sapling editors, thin gloss of youthful bravado over their trembling lower lips, get pulled into Coles’s office for a dressing down are utterly compelling. Coles is engaged in a personal myth-making exercise here, some of her lines lifted almost verbatim from the Devil Wears Prada playbook (“If you buy a new outfit, it’s because Cosmo saw it first, in Paris or Milan”). The need to appeal to a younger audience leaves Coles looking disconnected from everyone else on screen. There is no room for a Grace Coddington-style sidekick in a show whose other anointed protagonists have been chosen for their youth and great abs. But Coles creates some new and memorable girl-boss moments. When a young female visitor to the office introduces herself simply as Samantha, Coles scolds her for not seizing the moment professionally by giving her full name. “First rule of Joanna Coles: always say both names. That’s what a man would do. You can use that,” she adds to a writer listening in. “But quote me.”
