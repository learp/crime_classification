A key government website that enables those who have installed solar panels to apply for the feed-in tariff is experiencing serious technical problems, as contractors rush to register new systems ahead of this weekend deadline.Installers trying to log on to the Microgeneration Certificate Scheme (MCS) website, where all new installations have to register, are reporting huge problems. A message on the site on Thursday warned it is running slow. It goes on to advise users to come back later."We are trying to resolve this issue as soon as possible and do apologise for any inconveniences caused. Please visit the website for further updates," it says.Ever since ministers stunned the solar industry six weeks ago by halving feed-in tariffs – the money paid to those installing solar panels on their roofs – there has been a rush by householders and companies to beat 12 December, the date when changes are expected to take effect.Installers have been working long hours to complete new systems on customers' homes in time, but now find they cannot register their work.All systems have to be registered with both the MCS and the householder's energy supplier before this weekend's deadline. Anyone missing the deadline will get half the promised income, losingmany thousands of pounds over the 25 years that feed-in tariffs are paid.Andrea Hearne, who lives near Milton Kenyes, is one of those who contacted the Guardian concerned that the MCS webite's collapse will result in a big loss of income."Our installers say they can't get onto the system on a government-run website. It's all starting to feel like a political conspiracy to stop people registering their homes in time. What will they do it they can't fix the problem and thousands of householders systems aren't registered in time," she said.A spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: "The MCS website is working and installers can log in to register installations and generate MCS certificates. Many new certificates are being issued every day. We are aware that the website is running slowly due to the high volume of installations being registered and installers are experiencing delays in logging into the system. We are working with Gemserv, who operate the website, to monitor and manage the situation."Ministers are clearly aware of the problem. At lunchtime the environment minister Greg Barker tweeted: "Good conf call 2 DECC confirms action 2 boost #MCS website 2 deal w 9000 new applications per day. New servers & support lines quadrupled."In recent weeks, the tariffs have become a hot political issue. The industry has warned that it will be decimated in the new year when the impact of the changes are felt.The high court has agreed to hear applications by Friends of the Earth and two solar companies – Solarcentury and HomeSun – for permission to challenge government plans to slash financial incentives for solar electricity on 15 December.If they are unsuccessful, the solar industry fears it will lead to a huge loss in demand for their services. Last week construction company Carillion warned 4,500 staff their jobs are at risk because of the government's dramatic cut in the solar feed-in tariffs.
