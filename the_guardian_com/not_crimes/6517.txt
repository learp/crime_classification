Sleeping over at Battersea Arts Centre was a dream. From the moment you step into BAC, you’re part of the family and, as an audience member, you feel directly connected to the incredible work that happens in its mansion-like building.We arrived at Clapham Junction early, due mainly to pure excitement, and settled into BAC’s Scratch bar for a drink and a brownie. The bar looks as if it’s been kitted out with furniture from a side-alley shop in Camden. The mismatched chairs and tables took me back to my days in A-level art class. There’s a backstage feel, too: lights are rigged from the ceiling and it feels like an Aladdin’s cave for theatre lovers.We stayed in one of the theatre’s newly designed artists’ bedrooms. Our moss-green room, labelled the “posh room”, was designed by performance artist Victoria Melody, whose BAC shows have included Major Tom, based on her experiences entering beauty contests and putting her basset hound into dog shows. The room’s decor ranged from a model boat encased in glass, an elaborate painting of a flower basket, an old oak wardrobe and a small double bed with an overhanging headboard. The room was cosy, just like the family atmosphere of BAC.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Ventoux, performed by 2Magpies theatre company in the members’ bar, was the first performance we saw. The piece explores the relationship between Lance Armstrong and Marco Pantani during the 12th stage of the Tour de France in 2000: the infamous Mont Ventoux. With the actors pedalling away on fixed bikes, it was a physically exhausting piece of theatre, oozing masculinity and technical genius as it revisited the race with the knowledge of how each man’s career – and life – played out.Ventoux was staged as part of Leicester Curve’s takeover at BAC, which also included Rachael Young’s solo show I, Myself and Me, about being single in your 30s. I had high hopes for it after realising Young had been been inspired by working with the performance artist Stacy Makishi, a personal favourite of mine. The set was clever, the text was playful and poetic, the piece was complex and performed passionately.How the nation's theatre reinvented itself | Lyn Gardner On day two, we were intrigued to see if Shannon Yee’s immersive audio performance Reassembled, Slightly Askew lived up to its reputation. The piece charts her recovery from a brain infection, and the audience listen while lying down in hospital-style beds. Documenting the day-to-day pain of living with her condition, it was leaps and bounds ahead of any immersive theatre I have experienced before.A Nation’s Theatre festival features performances all over London. A trip across town took us to the New Diorama theatre for Idle Motion’s Voyager. Inspired by space exploration, the show merged multimedia, intelligent set use (exhibiting a hint of Frantic Assembly) and dance-theatre. The performers were fluid at multi-roling and, among them, one actor shone through: Grace Chapman, as the protagonist, Carrie, showed enormous skill to engage the audience.Saturday brought us our final theatre experience, back at BAC: Paradise Lost (lies unopened beside me) by Lost Dog. The show is described by its performer, Ben Duke, as a one-man contemporary dance reconstruction of John Milton’s epic. The piece was full of energy and aesthetically astounding but also offered a light, playful take on the story – a great finish to an incredible trip.
