Such figures would place it well inside the top 15 openings of all time.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Snyder’s film has benefited from enormous hype surrounding the first big-screen battle between the world’s two most celebrated superheroes. However, some fans have also complained that trailers appear to give away most of the movie’s plot, while Affleck’s casting as Batman received a mixed initial response.Poor reviews could yet scupper the comic-book epic’s chances of becoming one of 2016’s highest-grossing films. Snyder’s previous superhero movie, 2013’s Man of Steel, stalled on $668m at the global box office following a mixed critical verdict.The highest-grossing movie of the year so far is 20th Century Fox’s Deadpool, which has taken $708m worldwide off the back of strong reviews and excellent word of mouth. Disney’s Zootopia (aka Zootropolis) is another contender to hit $1bn, after scoring $431m in its first two weeks, including a record-breaking second weekend in China.
