The Boss Baby dethroned Disney’s Beauty and the Beast at the US box office with a $49m debut this weekend, handing star Alec Baldwin what President Donald Trump – to whom the lead character voiced by Baldwin has been compared – might call a “huge” opening. Boss Baby is an 'immature, sometimes greedy businessman' – not Trump Paramount Pictures, meanwhile, suffered another flop with its controversy-plagued Ghost in the Shell.The DreamWorks Animation release from 20th Century Fox, starring Baldwin as a suit-clad baby, narrowly edged out the previous two-week leader, according to studio estimates on Sunday. The live-action Beauty and the Beast took in $48m in its third weekend. Final North American ticket sales will be released on Monday.“We expected a decent opening. We didn’t expect to be No1,” said Chris Aronson, Fox distribution chief.Despite the popularity of Beauty and the Beast (nearly $400m domestically in 17 days, and $876.3m globally), Boss Baby was able to attract its own family audience.Aronson credited that partly to the appeal of Baldwin, whose impression of Trump on Saturday Night Live has lately been ubiquitous. Boss Baby also evokes Baldwin’s old Glengarry Glen Ross character with quips like: “Cookies are for closers.”“Alec Baldwin’s voice is recognizable, in general. But he’s so topical now because of some of the other things he’s doing right now,” said Aronson. “It’s a very distinctive voice, and if you put it on a baby, it’s funny.”Director Tom McGrath has called comparisons between his title character and the president “a gift or a nightmare, I don’t know”, telling the Hollywood Reporter the Boss Baby’s “you’re fired” line and other similarities were “a total coincidence”.“There’s an overlap in ‘business guy’ tropes but no, it’s in no way based on Trump,” he said. “It’s based on an immature, sometimes greedy businessman, so if people want to draw their own conclusions about that … but no, it really wasn’t.”Ghost in the Shell, a remake of a classic 1995 Japanese anime film, couldn’t compete with either family-friendly release. The dystopian science-fiction thriller, starring Scarlett Johansson, opened with just $19m, a poor showing for a film that cost about $110m to make.Many took issue with the casting of Johansson as the cyborg protagonist who was Japanese in the original, calling it another example of Hollywood “whitewashing”.Ghost in the Shell review – Scarlett Johansson in a thrillingly sordid world “We had hopes for better results domestically. I think the conversation regarding casting impacted the reviews,” said Kyle Davies, domestic distribution chief for Paramount. “You’ve got a movie that is very important to the fanboys since it’s based on a Japanese anime movie. So you’re always trying to thread that needle between honoring the source material and make a movie for a mass audience. That’s challenging but clearly the reviews didn’t help.”Audiences appeared to agree with critics, giving the film a mediocre B CinemaScore.Ghost in the Shell will instead hope to find more eager moviegoers in Japan (where the casting controversy has not resonated) and China next weekend. Opening in most other international countries this weekend, Ghosts in the Shell took in a modest $40.1m.Paramount has recently suffered a string of box-office disappointments. Last week, Viacom hired former Fox film head Jim Gianopulos to turn around its film division.In limited release, Focus Features’ The Zookeeper’s Wife, starring Jessica Chastain, opened well with $3.3m at 541 locations. Based on Diane Ackerman’s nonfiction book, the film is about a woman’s efforts to save Jews during the Holocaust. It will expand next weekend.
