Sheku Kanneh-Mason, 17, is a cellist who in May won the 2016 BBC Young Musician competition. He lives with his parents and six musician siblings in Nottingham, attends Trinity College Catholic school and also studies at the Royal Academy of Music’s junior academy. Kanneh-Mason is the subject of Young, Gifted and Classical: The Making of a Maestro, which airs on BBC4 on 20 November at 8pm as part of the BBC’s Black and British season.How have you dealt with your growing fame after winning the award this year?My life has definitely changed; I’ve gone from not doing many concerts to performing at lots of important venues. It’s been really exciting, but it’s important not to do too many things too soon. I’m in my last year of school, and at the moment I find the pressure manageable. I had a chat with the violinist Nicola Benedetti [who won the competition aged 16 in 2004], and she advised that while I’m still young and studying I should learn as much repertoire as possible, because it becomes more difficult once you’re doing lots of concerts. If you’re a young black child going to a classical concert you don’t see anyone who looks like you in the orchestra Last year you appeared on Britain’s Got Talent with your siblings. How did that compare to the BBC competition?Britain’s Got Talent was a good experience for getting used to performing in front of lots of people, with cameras and interviews. When it came to BBC Young Musician there were fewer cameras so I wasn’t fazed at all.Who are your musical heroes?Jacqueline du Pré and Mstislav Rostropovich – both cellists – are two of my musical heroes, but I never got the chance to hear them live, which is a shame. I listen to a lot of Bob Marley when I’m not listening to classical.To what extent was pursuing classical music your decision?Although my parents have always encouraged me to practise, I’ve always wanted to be a musician. I actually started on the violin for about a month, but my elder brother Braimah was also playing the violin. I wanted to outdo him and play a bigger instrument so I switched to the cello when I was six and a half years old.

They made a lot of sacrifices, like holidays, to pay for music books and instruments and to ensure we could go to the Royal Academy of Music. Also we travel from Nottingham to London about twice a week, which is expensive – it’d be a lot easier if we lived in London! Hopefully seeing us become successful will make it worthwhile.How did you become involved with [black and minority ethnic orchestra] Chineke!?My family have been with it from its birth. The founder, Chi-chi Nwanoku, came to watch a trio concert of me, my elder sister, Isata, and elder brother, and invited us to be involved. It’s inspiring, especially being one of the younger ones in the orchestra and having lots of role models to look up to.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Chineke!

It’s only when you look at the bigger picture and realise the lack of diversity that it becomes apparent. Ultimately, the classical music world isn’t racist, that would be the wrong way of looking at it. The problem is people not getting the opportunity to see it as something to get into. If you’re a young black child going to a classical concert you don’t see anyone who looks like you in the orchestra.How could that change?I think it’s a difficult thing to change, but it’s a case of giving everyone the opportunity to access classical music. For a number of reasons, music isn’t given enough time and money in many state schools, so kids miss out. Hopefully me being from a state school, and the first winner who is black, and seeing things like the Chineke! Orchestra, will inspire others from similar backgrounds to see this journey as something that they could also do.
