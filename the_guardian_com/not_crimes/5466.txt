Chinese wine tasters have sipped their way to victory at a blind tasting competition in France, sealing a win that organisers described as a “thunderbolt in the world of wine.”The Chinese team beat the French and Americans at the Chateau du Galoupet, one of the country’s biggest wine estates.China's Bordeaux: winemakers in 'gold rush' to turn desert into vineyards A total of 21 teams took part, during the fourth world blind tasting championships held by the French specialist magazine La Revue du vin de France.Belgium, the runner-up last year, came fourth while former champion Spain were placed a distant tenth.The teams from around the world had to identify the wines’ countries of origin, the grape varieties used in them, their appellations and their vintages.“Remaining humble even in victory, the astounding Chinese team conceded that in blind tasting 50% is knowledge and 50% is luck,” the organisers said.Next year’s championships will be held in Burgundy in the famed Cote d’Or wine-growing region.
