Heartbreaking news from America, where the creepy clown panic claims its highest-profile scalp. In a statement this week, McDonald’s announced it would be benching Ronald McDonald with immediate effect.According to its formal explanation: “McDonald’s and franchisees in the local markets are mindful of the current climate around clown sightings in communities and as such are being thoughtful in respect to Ronald McDonald’s participation in community events for the time being.”Clown sightings: Ronald McDonald keeps low profile amid creepy craze Disgraceful. Sure, a vanishingly small percentage of clowns hang out in Stephen King novels or are currently attempting to terrorise children. But it’s completely wrong that a guy who simply wants you to experience the magic of saturated fats – and maybe upsell you to a Coke you could windsurf on – is now being tarred with the same brush. He wishes you nothing but joy. How could these pranksters corrupt something so pure?Then again, should we really be blaming pranksters? Lost in Showbiz hereby proposes a major new theory on the creepy clown thing. To wit: cui bono? Could this not all be the masterplan of Hamburglar? It was widely thought that Ronald’s nemesis had been retired, or succumbed to type 2 diabetes, while lesser McDonaldland characters, such as Grimace, had gone straight after having been saved by lapband surgery. But the authorities can’t ignore the fact that this all plays right into their hands. Indeed, now it threatens to take out his arch-rival, is it not time to ask whether the entire creepy clown craze isn’t in fact Hamburglar’s Reichenbach Falls?
