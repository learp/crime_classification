Until I read Delia, I used to think I had a large kitchen. This is because most of my friends live in older houses converted into flats, where the kitchen is in fact a repurposed large cupboard. My flat was built in the 1960s, when they had all sorts of ideas we now regard as old-fashioned: for instance that as many as three people should be able to fit in a kitchen without a brawl breaking out.But from time to time, I realise that compared to Delia’s kitchen, mine is teeny-tiny. In the chapter Equipment for Serious Cooks, Delia turns her eye to the essential tools and gadgets that any cook needs, and runs through a list of no fewer than 22 different implements and nine gadgets. “If you want to be a good cook,” she says, “you’re simply going to have think about investing in the right kind of tools for the job.” And she’s right, of course. But first, I don’t have that kind of space. And second, I have long since accepted that while balance scales may be superior to electronic ones, I am never going to use a balance scale after a long day at work.But even though the full list is something to aspire to rather than accommodate, it is a handy guide – not only to what you do need, but also to what you don’t. Delia recalls her mother’s advice: “If you haven’t worn something for a whole year, you’re never going to, so give it to the charity shop.” Delia suggests applying the same principle to your kitchen implements. I recommend using Delia’s list as a way to stress-test what you’re using regularly and what’s loitering uselessly at the back of a cupboard somewhere. So, out goes my ridged griddle, which I only use under duress, and in comes a second colander, because they truly are the best kitchen implements in my book.But while you’re going about your kitchen audit, you’ll find there will be a few implements and gadgets that are neither absolutely essential nor completely useless. It’s here that Delia really comes into her own. Each item comes with its own recipe, and the foolproof way to work out whether you should keep something is to give each of these a whirl. If the resulting dish makes its way into your repertoire, then the implement’s saved.The first item under the spotlight is my electronic whisk, which has always been the source of excessive guilt. I don’t really need it, between my balloon whisk, processor and the frankly excessive number of forks in our kitchen, but it makes life a lot easier. Now, though, I can honestly say that it makes something that nothing else in my kitchen can: zabaglione. It is one of the easiest recipes you will ever make: whisk egg yolks, sugar and a sweet dry wine over simmering water for 15 minutes, and you have what is either a wonderfully light dessert or an incredibly luxurious after-dinner drink, depending on your perspective. Delia’s recipe is flawless, though I’m put out by her two suggestions to pass the time while making it. The first is to do a crossword, which suggests a level of hand-eye coordination that is certainly beyond me. The second is to “have a natter with someone to pass time”, which, when I try it, largely involves my partner and I shouting “What was that?” at one another. So, there you go. Thanks to Delia, I know what to do with my balloon whisk – and that I’m going deaf.•Stephen Bush is cooking his way through Delia’s Complete How To Cook (BBC Books, £40) in a year.
