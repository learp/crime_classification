Following on from Natalie Nougayrède’s article (The burkini ban ruling is a start, 26 August), it is worth considering that, when it comes to Muslim women’s dress, the French state has historically regrouped after rulings by the Conseil d’Etat, the highest administrative court.The 2004 ban on religious symbols in schools, which primarily affects Muslim wearers of headscarves, came after the Conseil d’Etat found in favour of individual schoolgirls expelled from school for wearing headscarves in 1989.The control of women’s bodies is nothing new. Lacking the nuance of many versions, the French attempts at regulating the clothing of Muslim women sully the work of feminists, womanists and everyone else seeking liberation from stifling patriarchal societal norms.The latest in a long line of humiliations is the case of the Muslim woman at the beach in Nice last week. The forced removal of her clothing by armed police officers exposes the fallacy of the idea that laws policing women’s bodies somehow contribute to their liberation.The undressing of Muslim women by French authorities has a long colonial history. Such a practice of imperial subjugation goes against women’s empowerment and should have no place in today’s society. We stand in solidarity with Muslim women in France and condemn the practice of stripping women at gunpoint and fining them for their beliefs.Arzu Merali Islamic Human Rights CommissionDr Kasia Narkowicz University of YorkProfessor Gurminder K Bhambra University of WarwickSamantha Asumadu Media DiversifiedProfessor Stevi Jackson University of YorkRevd Bonnie Evans-Hills Priest, Church of EnglandProfessor Marie Breen-Smyth University of SurreyHouria Bouteldja Parti des Indigènes de la République, FranceProfessor Victoria Robinson University of YorkSedigheh Bahmanpour FilmmakerDr Marta Araujo University of Coimbra, PortugalAzeezat Johnson University of SheffieldDr Katy Sian University of YorkEsther Stanford-Xosei Pan-Afrikan Reparations Coalition in EuropeOnjali Rauf Founder, Making HerstoryDr Julia Suárez-Krabbe Roskilde University, DenmarkAmina Taylor JournalistHumera Khan An Nisa SocietyKhalida Khan An Nisa SocietyNargess Moballeghi JournalistFreya Billington University of GloucestershireDr Narzanin Massoumi University of LiverpoolAmrit Wilson Freedom Without Fear PlatformHodan Yusuf PoetHafsah Aneela Bashir Spoken-word artistDr Louise Livesey University of Gloucestershire, Oxford Feminist NetworkRachel Hewson-Thornton York Feminist NetworkSofia Ahmed JournalistLidia Kurasinska JournalistDr Evangeline Tsao University of YorkAnaïs Duong-Pedica University of YorkMaryam Jameela University of SheffieldDr Angie SandhuDr Ann Kaloski-Naylor University of YorkDr Silvia Maeso University of Coimbra, PortugalAndree Murphy Relatives for Justice, BelfastPatricia Schor Utrecht University, NetherlandsDr Sukaina Hirji GPDr Suzella Palmer University of BedfordshireDr Claire Chambers University of YorkAnna Carnegie University of YorkCharlotte Jones University of SheffieldNicole Froio University of YorkGemma Gibson University of YorkDr Katherine Edgar York Feminist Network• Your coverage of the burkini issue has been shocking. It is possible to disagree with the ban on the burkini imposed in some French towns while also conducting a debate about what such garments mean in terms of the agency of women.I find it sad that you have bombarded us with articles on how the bikini is dying, how the burkini is for freedom and so on, but have published nothing at all about what the notion of “modesty” actually stands for (Why we wear the burkini: five women on dressing modestly at the beach, theguardian.com, 31 August). Why should women’s bodies be subject to a burden of shame?The judgment of non-Muslim women is implicit in the non-questioning usage of “modesty” in the Guardian’s coverage. I am confident that if any other religion were involved – Judaism or even Hinduism for that matter – your writers would have had a more rigorous reaction.How can you carry articles about the reproductive rights of women on one hand, condemning those who oppose abortion, and then casually make the female body an object that needs to be shielded from people’s gaze? Cultural relativism will only take you so far.For those of us who are fighting a losing battle against a patriarchal society telling us constantly to cover up, you could at least try to be more balanced.Ritwiza AsthanaLondon• I am deeply troubled by the recent use of the word “modesty” to denote Islamic clothing such as burkinis in your coverageI personally don’t have an issue with burkinis or Islamic clothing, but I strongly object to the message that the Guardian sends by using the word “modest” in connection with this type of clothing. The implication of using this wording is that any other dress is not modest. Therefore, you are subscribing to the Islamic fundamentalist belief that a woman who is dressed modestly needs to be covered up completely.I don’t think that I’m being bold, ostentatious or “slutty” by wearing a bikini or not covering my hair. But your coverage and your wording strongly implies this. I find this even more troubling coming from a paper that generally supports the women’s liberation movement.The implication behind using the word modest as a synomym for Islamic style clothing is that any woman that doesn’t wear this style is immodest and therefore open to scorn. This is especially concerning for young Muslim women who do not want to dress in the traditional style but are now told by a western newspaper that they are not modest.Andrea SchriberLondon• Please stop passing judgment on women’s dress. It is not “modest” or “immodest” for women to wear either a burkini or a bikini. We should be free to wear what we want on the beach.The Guardian is falling into the same trap as those who want to ban burkinis by stating that women who visit nudist beaches or wear bikinis are somehow “immodest” and that women who wear burkinis are “modest”. Stop judging what women wear.Katherine RainwoodLondon• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
