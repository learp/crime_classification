A large-scale video installation by artist Bill Viola of Mary carrying the body of Jesus will be unveiled at St Paul’s Cathedral.The permanent project, entitled Mary, will be a companion piece to the American artist’s Martyrs (Earth, Air, Fire, Water), which was unveiled in the south quire aisle of the cathedral in 2014.The installations are the first moving-image artworks to be installed in a cathedral in Britain on a long-term basis.Mary will be inaugurated in the north quire aisle on 8 September to coincide with the Feast of Mary, celebrating her birth.Viola said: “The two themes of Mary and Martyrs symbolise some of the profound mysteries of human existence.“One is concerned with birth and the other death; one with comfort and creation, the other with suffering and sacrifice. If I am successful, the final pieces will function both as aesthetic objects of contemporary art and as practical objects of traditional contemplation and devotion.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Martyrs at St Paul’s CathedralBoth Mary and Martyrs are collaborations with his wife, Kira Perov.The installations follow Viola’s 2003 exhibition The Passions at the National Gallery.
