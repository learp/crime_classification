The Middle Eastern flavours in this gin sour complement the gin’s herby notes. To infuse the vermouth, put half a teaspoon of peppercorns in 50ml vermouth, leave for 72 hours, then strain. Serves one.12.5ml pink peppercorn-infused rose vermouth (see introduction; for the vermouth, I use Cocchi Americano Rosa)25ml gin (I use Bombay Sapphire) 12.5ml poppy seed liqueur (try Briottet)25ml lemon juice20ml egg white (ie about ½ a white)3 dashes grapefruit bittersDry-shake everything (ie with no ice) to aerate the egg, add ice, shake again and double strain into a chilled glass. Garnish with a poppy seed.Mike McGinty, The Voyage of Buck, Edinburgh.
