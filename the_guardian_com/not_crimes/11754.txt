After the lashing fury of the gale it seems almost unnaturally still. The wind which for hours had battered the house and shrieked around the windows has died. The garden shrubs, so recently flailing helplessly under the onslaught, are now motionless and the loch, whose wind-torn surface had been white with waves and airborne water, has returned to its usual calm. Only the loudness of the constant grumbling roar from a still disturbed sea, nearly a mile away down the track, invades the quiet and indicates the strength of the previous day's winds.Down at the beach the influence of the wind and the pounding seas is obvious. Here and there, despite the binding effect of the marram grass, boulder-sized sections have been worried loose from the lip of the dunes and have tumbled to the beach, where they lie in a mass of sand and exposed roots. Windswept sand has plastered the face of the dunes, filling in some hollows and scooping out others. A huge ellipse of dark grey beach pebbles has appeared where before there was only smooth sand. For a moment I imagine the sea has deposited them there but then I realise it is the sand that has been swept away to expose them.For a short distance the whole profile of the beach has changed where it now rises gently to the pebble bank. Behind the bank a miniature shallow lagoon has formed, though the water is beginning to drain away, finding a path back to the sea where the bank tapers to a mere scatter of stones. As usual the rough seas have thrown up a mass of kelp but, rather than being deposited in the usual thick brown blanket, this time the weed has been raised into an impressive head-high rampart. It runs along the beach like an iron age earthwork, the placement of the interwoven kelp stems curiously reminiscent of the precise untidiness of a raven's nest.
