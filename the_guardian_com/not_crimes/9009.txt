Like Radiohead's Burn the Witch? Try Jonny Greenwood’s orchestral work A more ambient, contemplative and euphoric sound compared to the “burst of taut, tense music, driven by pizzicato strings” that filled first track Burn the Witch, Daydreaming comes with a video directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. In it, frontman Thom Yorke walks through a series of eerie spaces: a hotel corridor, an empty home, a hospital, a shop floor, a forest, a snowy mountain, a beach and a vacant car park. It loops and shifts as if trapped inside a dreamlike state until Yorke’s journey ends, curled up in a mountain cave; Jonny Greenwood’s lush orchestration adding to its cinematic suspense.

In between albums, the group’s members have concentrated on solo projects: Drummer Phil Selway released his second solo album, Weatherhouse, in 2014, while Yorke toured and recorded with Flea, Nigel Godrich, Joey Waronker and Mauro Refosco on the Atoms for Peace project. His solo album, Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes, was released in 2014.
