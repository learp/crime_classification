To be honest, it has been quite some time since I read this book. But the memory of it has been stuck in my head ever since. That thrilling shiver always enveloping me. A creepy, heart shading book that will keep you hidden within its fear forever: “Some curses grow stronger with time.”Emma is permanently restricted to a wheelchair after an accident which happened at the Water Witch when she was 10. Now she is 17 and revisiting the site where the accident took place, she meets her Grandma as well as an old friend there too. It only takes her a moment to realise that something isn’t quite right. The WaterWitch is still haunted and that the ancient inn still has ghosts, with one spirit more vengeful than ever. I love Emma, she is confident despite being in a wheelchair. She’s brave although she has no idea what’s happening around her and at all times she is supportive and caring. Her negative characteristic is her selflessness as she only pays attention to other people and not to herself. This story kept me engaged with its creepy and surprising content. I couldn’t put this book down. I would recommend it to everyone. However, it might be more suitable to an older age group as this book will give you nightmares. A strong, bold Red Eye book that will keep you hooked in. How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? On a scale 9.5/10! Amazing and Unique!
