Kurt Vile and the Violators – Wakin on a Pretty DayWe recently played a bunch of festivals in Australia with Kurt Vile on the bill. I went to watch them at every opportunity and fell in love with the live show. It’s a balance between chaos and zoned-out perfection. This track’s almost 10 minutes long but seamlessly drifts by as if it was under three.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Roots Manuva – Me Up!Roots Manuva is one of the UK’s most consistently great artists, his latest record is no exception. There is a huge amount of depth to the music he makes. His live show is constantly changing in its presentation, so it’s always worth catching to see and hear what direction he’s pushing things.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The National – I Need My GirlOf all the bands around, I think the National are the group with the most consistently brilliant songs. We’ve probably been listening to their music for the last 15 years. Their success is hugely deserved and it’s great to see them still at the top of their game.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Squeeze – Vanity FairHaving never seen Squeeze, I’m looking forward to seeing their set at Latitude. Vanity Fair was a song of theirs that always stood out to me. They have such graceful storytelling in their songs.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest British Sea Power – All In ItBritish Sea Power are another group who have delivered huge amounts of great music over the years. This song is possibly the best start to a record I’ve heard. We had the pleasure of having them open our show at Alexandra Palace a few years back, and it always feels like you learn something watching them play live.
