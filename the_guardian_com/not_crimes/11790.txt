Almost without thinking, I found myself falling into the botanist’s habit of counting species and reciting names as I walked through the meadow. Salad burnet, quaking grass, hay rattle, marjoram – an incantation that defined this grassland hollow at the eastern end of the dene. I must have seen 50 species, probably only half of those present.The best hay meadows in Teesdale and Weardale would have been mown by the end of July, in an uneasy compromise between gathering a crop and allowing the flora time to set seed. Here on the coast, Durham Wildlife Trust mows this meadow much later, giving all the plants a chance to fulfil their biological destiny. Although the drifts of cowslips, early purple orchids and lady’s bedstraw were just a memory, the field was still spangled with flowers of knapweed, meadowsweet and hemp agrimony, and the final act in the annual scramble to reproduce was well underway. Meadow cranesbills were sling-shotting seeds into the undergrowth. Flat pale blue faces of field scabious had begun to morph into balls of bristly seeds that might catch in fur or feathers. In the afternoon sunshine we could hear the crack of legume pods, rent asunder by tensions developing in their drying walls, hurling away their seeds.They will struggle to find germination space in the dense sward. A lucky minority may land in the seed bed created by a fresh mole hill; many others will remain dormant in the soil seed bank until an opportunity arises. But we also passed aggressive colonisers – hawthorn, sycamore and ash saplings that had arrived in last autumn’s seed rain from the dene’s woodland. The glorious floral diversity in this cherished patch of grassland will soon be smothered by woodland shade without the annual intervention of the mower. Like all our old hay meadows, it was created by agricultural necessity and still depends on annual human intervention for its survival.@seymourdaily
