Cats are the villains du jour of the environment. The 9.6 million pet cats and 50 million ferals in the US are held responsible for various crimes against nature, including a role in the killing of 2.4 billion birds and 12.3 billion mammals every year. “They are, pure and simple, ecological pollution,” University of Minnesota ornithologist Robert Zink wrote of cats recently.Last month, Australia’s environment minister pledged to wage war on feral cats, which researchers have tagged as a leading cause in the massive decline of native Australian species.Some cat advocates in the US, however, think they’ve found a way to capitalize on the feline killer-instinct and use it for good. Nonprofit shelters and pet adoption agencies across the US are offering “barn cats,” or “working cats,” to farmers, ranchers, and even city dwellers as an “environmentally friendly” alternative to pesticides.Consider it the greening – or possibly the greenwashing – of the neighborhood cat.Maracopa County, Arizona, is home to an estimated 250,000 “free-roaming” cats. In partnership with a number of animal-welfare organizations, the Arizona Humane Society does what it can to divert even the toughest cases away from euthanasia, said AHS communications director Bretta Nelson. Strategies include encouraging the maintaining of feral (spayed and neutered, of course) colonies across the region under trap, neuter, return programs.But adopting out problematic animals surrendered by their owners has proven more difficult, she said.“We were seeing that so many cats coming in were not being placed,” Nelson said. “That’s when we really started looking into different programs.”That exploration became the Working Cats Program, billed as an “environmentally-safe alternative to poisonous pest controls.” The program provides between two and four typically dark-colored cats (they’re able to avoid predation better, Nelson said) to the owners of warehouses, farms, and ranches, who are instructed to continue to provide them with a supplemental diet of cat food.“It’s environmentally friendly and it’s safe to everyone,” she said. “You always worry about secondary intoxication when you use poisons and things. And it’s just taking off like you wouldn’t believe.”Since launching in May, the program has placed about 100 feral and semi-feral cats as far away as the Grand Canyon, Nelson said. That’s hardly a statistical blip when one considers an estimated 1.4 million cats are euthanized each year in the US. But it is a public-relations win that taps into long-standing traditional partnerships between farmers and cats.Andi Davis, distribution manager for Crooked Sky Farms in Phoenix, said she wanted to avoid poisons when the company moved into a new warehouse. “Number one, it’s organic produce and I didn’t like the idea of chemicals,” she said. “It’s also ... I don’t know, I’m a girl. I didn’t like the way [pesticides] sounded. It sounded like a painful death for the mice.”As one of the first recipients of cats from AHS, Davis said her four cats’ enthusiasm for their work is hard not to notice. “The cats will find a mouse or a lizard or some random thing and they’ll lay it by the door so it’s there when you get to work in the morning. It’s like they’re saying, ‘Look what I got for you.’ They are definitely good at their job and they are very happy.”Similar programs have cropped up in Lodi, California, Lewisville, Texas, and Silverdale, Washington, as well as larger cities like San Francisco and San Antonio, Texas.The programs are not reserved to rural areas and barns, either.Anne E Beall, author of Community Cats: A Journey into the World of Feral Cats, writes that a rat infestation threatening to drive her from her Lakeview home on Chicago’s north side was solved by importing cats from the Chicago-based Tree House Humane Society’s Cats at Work Program.“I expected my cat colony, lovingly dubbed the Rat Pack, would solve my rat problem, but I never expected the bond our family now shares with our wonderfully clever and hardworking outdoor cat colony,” Beall writes in a prepared release.“Cats are great rodent-control technicians,” a member of the animal-rights group Animal Friends alleges on the organization’s website. “It’s a natural instinct. And a cat’s presence alone will deter rodents.”But are cats really that good at playing exterminator? University of Minnesota’s Zink told the Guardian that to show a net benefit, working-cat programs should demonstrate “that sterilized feral cats only killed introduced rodents and not native rodents or birds.” That doesn’t seem to be the case.A 2004 study of feral cat colonies fed by volunteers on parkland outside San Francisco found they seem to prefer native fare over more widespread house mice. The trio of researchers sampling in the mid-90s found that the cats appeared to prefer native mice over the house mouse, a relative newcomer. While most of the native mice collected over two years were found in no-cat areas, 79% of all the house mice were collected in areas colonized by the cats.Peggy Atkerson, a former IT consultant at IBM, said she set up one of the first working-cats programs in the country when she founded Barn Cats Incorporated in north Texas in 2003. She’s gone from placing a couple hundred cats per year to more than 700 across dozens of counties in 2013.She said the programs are a natural extension of the TNR movement and the “no-kill” anti-euthanasia sympathies that help fuels it. Their success, however, depends on identifying appropriate locations for the cats. “They’re loose, right? So you don’t have a whole lot of control of them once they’re out of that cage,” she said. “But I can tell you the whole bird thing doesn’t come up much in a barn environment.”But the advisability and effectiveness of using cats for pest management really depends on how they are used, according to Jack Peterson, acting director of Arizona’s Office of Pest Management. “The person that is using those tools needs to be certified and know what they’re doing to provide appropriate pest management,” he said.Cats, like any other species, can become a pest just like the mice they’re being recruited to hunt.“It’s just like a weed,” Peterson said. “I could have a beautiful flower, but if it’s growing in the crack of my sidewalk it’s just a weed. The same could be said for anything. If it’s not an appropriate location and an appropriate time, it’s a pest.” The Vital Signs platform is funded by Avery Dennison, Domtar and Chiquita.All content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled advertisement feature.
