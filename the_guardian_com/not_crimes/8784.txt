A wren scolds me for disturbing the peace as I trundle a full wheelbarrow along the grass path. On this mid afternoon, sun lights up the dahlias that edge the vegetable garden so that their colours glow fiercely.We have three compost bins, enabling their contents to be turned regularly, one into the other. Made from wood, they are each a metre square. My barrowful will add to the bin that is currently being filled. I go to check the one next to it. Debris lies scattered over the green carpet that covers maturing compost: faded catmint petals, wilted leaves, fragments of geranium stalks.I lift it slowly, then the next layer of heavy beige carpet, then the next of thick black plastic, its underside moist and sticky with grass clippings. There’s a warm smell of muck from the treacly surface of rotting humus where pink brandling worms curl and luxuriate. Even without touching it, I feel the warmth reach my hands.Encounter with the fragile snake There, in the corner, is a slow worm, its body looped like a meandering river seen from a plane. Smooth and shiny, this legless lizard has eyelids and a flat, notched tongue, not forked like a snakes. I often find slow worms in the compost bins, to which they are drawn by the heat and plentiful food. They eat worms and the small slugs that are so damaging to young vegetable plants.Hedgehogs also eat these little pale slugs, doubly protecting our seedlings and hostas, but they also prey on slow worms. Somehow they manage to co-exist in our garden, and when I cut the small meadow that fringes the lawn I do it with shears on hands and knees, not with a strimmer.Sometimes in summer, there are the remains of an egg sac lying wetly under the carpet, for, unlike grass snakes, slow worms give birth to live young. Soon, though, they will be leaving the compost heap as its warmth fades, to spend the winter hibernating underground. An old mouse burrow, or a hollow beneath a stone, it will need to be below the frost level of these north Pennine winters.• Forty Years on the Welsh Bird Islands, the 2015 memorial lecture in honour of the late Country diarist William Condry, will be given in Machynlleth on 3 October by Professor Tim Birkhead.• This article was amended on 23 September 2015. An earlier version said that slow worms, unlike snakes, give birth to live young. That should have been grass snakes.
