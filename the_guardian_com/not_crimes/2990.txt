HemAlle dining table £1,260Key side tables £157This Stockholm-based, predominantly online firm is only two years old but has already won an international following. Hem works with a number of designers and its stock includes plenty of ready-to-assemble marvels. The Key tripod side table by GamFratesi (£138) is an elegant piece: the legs are in varying shades of powdered steel, while the tabletop is either lacquered ash or a thick wedge of cork. According to Hem, it can be assembled in about 30 seconds – you don’t need tools, as it comes with a key to lock the parts into place. More impressively, there’s a 2.5m dining table (Alle by Staffan Holm, £1,260) built on the same principles. Both models are robust and practical. hem.com      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Sitting comfortably: the 6030 Ace Series 19 sofa from Normann Copenhagen.

Its aesthetic is rooted in mid-century Danish design, but Hay isn’t afraid to experiment with new materials and cutting-edge technology – and a touch of quirk. The Woody column shelving system costs from £269, and French designers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec have just created a luxury flatpack sofa and armchair (£1,019) called Can (as in yes, you can DIY if you can afford it). clippings.com
