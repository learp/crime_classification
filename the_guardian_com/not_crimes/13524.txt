Samantha Bee has criticized Donald Trump’s adviser and former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, labelling her a “soulless, machiavellian despot”.Samantha Bee meets Glenn Beck: 'It's all of us against Trumpism' In Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, the late-night comic referred to her as the president-elect’s “omnipresent spokescobra” for her ability to transform his “upended port-a-potty of a campaign”.Bee also discussed the fury of many rightwing pundits that Conway isn’t being labelled a feminist hero for being the first woman to successfully run a presidential campaign.“Oh my God you guys, it’s so unfair,” she said. “A woman pulls off the historic feat of electing a sexual predator who thinks women should be punished for having abortions and feminists don’t celebrate her with a Vogue cover.”A montage of earlier Conway appearances was also shown that displayed her criticizing Trump and his campaign before she got onboard, with Bee questioning her own beliefs.“I know Kellyanne doesn’t believe those homophobic and sexist things in her heart because Kellyanne doesn’t believe anything in her heart,” she said. “She will say literally anything.”She joked: “We haven’t seen a blonde do this much spinning and lying since Tonya Harding.”Bee also talked about the reappropriation of the term fake news, which Conway has used to refer to anything that is against Trump. “The phrase fake news is like a loaded gun that Kellyanne deftly plucked out of reporters’ hands and pointed at their heads,” she said.But Bee ended by crediting Conway for doing the hard graft while Trump has lazily reaped the rewards.“Kellyanne is the soulless, machiavellian despot America deserves not this undisciplined hobbit-handed omnishambles,” she said. “Lean in bitch, you’re the one with superpowers. You changed history and also possibly ended it.”
