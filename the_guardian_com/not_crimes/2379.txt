Badger culling is "ineffective", the expert behind the UK's biggest review of the links between badgers and tuberculosis in cattle, said on Monday.Professor Lord John Krebs was the government adviser responsible for the scientific review in the 1990s which found that badgers were a "reservoir" of bovine TB and could transmit the disease to cattle. He called for trial culls, which were then carried out. But he said on Monday the results of the trials showed that culling was "not an effective policy" and would be a mistake.His remarks are expected to reignite the debate over whether to cull badgers, as the government is set to make a controversial announcement this week allowing farmers to carry out their own badger culls around the country.The issue is highly emotive, with wildlife campaigners preparing to resist any moves to a cull, while farmers are adamant that a well-coordinated cull in TB hotspots would help to reduce the incidence of the disease, which costs the farming industry - and taxpayers - tens of millions of pounds a year and has forced some farmers out of business.The results of the 10-year "randomised badger culling trials" showed that widespread, highly coordinated culls requiring the destruction of many thousands of badgers resulted in a reduction in new infections in local cattle herds of about 16%. Ministers are expected to argue, with farmers, that this constitutes a good argument for allowing a cull to go ahead.But Lord Krebs said the trial evidence should be interpreted as an argument against culling. "You cull intensively for at least four years, you will have a net benefit of reducing TB in cattle of 12% to 16%. So you leave 85% of the problem still there, having gone to a huge amount of trouble to kill a huge number of badgers," he said. "It doesn't seem to be an effective way of controlling the disease."He said a better option would be to try to develop a vaccine in the long term, and in the short term to use better "biosecurity" measures to prevent cattle from coming into contact with badgers and other sources of the disease, and to prevent them passing it to each other.Lord Krebs said he recommended the randomised badger culling trials in 1997 because it was not known whether a cull would be effective, or cost-effective, and his view of the issue was only formulated once he had seen the results. While the trials showed culling did have an effect if it was done on a large scale, it was a relatively small one, he said.But farming experts told the Guardian they were in favour of a cull, which they said would be tightly controlled. They acknowledged that the cull would have to take place over as long as 20 years in order to have the effect needed, if the experiences of other countries such as Australia and New Zealand are anything to go by, but they said those countries showed that a long-term cull policy was effective and was needed to save cattle and farmers' livelihoods.Caroline Spelman, secretary for environment, food and rural affairs, is likely to say farmers can use "free shooting", which means shooting badgers in the field. This is much cheaper than trapping and shooting them. Farmers would need a special licence and training, and most of the shooting is likely to be done by trained marksmen hired by a group of farmers covering a large area.
