The White House’s inaugural South by South Lawn festival has booked an assortment of big names for its October event, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Sharon Jones, the Lumineers and the cast of Stranger Things. Taking place on 3 October, the president’s festival – a collaboration with South by South West’s producers – on the south lawn of the White House. Previously a speaker at the Austin Texas festival, at which he rallied for creative entrepreneurs, the festival aims to celebrate “that spirit of innovation at South by South Lawn, a White House festival of ideas, art, and action.”A statement on the White House’s website says: “At SXSL, we’ll call on every American to roll up their sleeves and discover their own way to make a positive difference in our country. And it’s an opportunity to celebrate the inspiring work so many Americans have already accomplished.”Among the guests at the festival are the Lumineers, Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, while DiCaprio will premiere his new documentary on climate change called Before the Flood, which features a score by Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor. There will be a live discussion between the actor and the president. The cast of Stranger Things will also run a film workshop.Tickets to the festival will be based on a nomination process, with the White House seeking those who have a “positive impact on their community”. The festival will be streamed live on whitehouse.gov, facebook.com/whitehouse, and sxsw.com/live.
