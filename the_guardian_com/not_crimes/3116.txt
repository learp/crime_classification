A 14 ft (4.2 metre) serpent-like fish washed on to a southern California beach last week was about to become a mother. The oarfish – one of two of the rarely seen deep sea creatures discovered along the US coast – was dissected on Monday and marine biologists found that the healthy female was ripe to spawn, said HJ Walker of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.The silvery fish's six-foot (1.8 metre)-long ovaries contained hundreds of thousands of eggs that were nearly ready to be released, Walker said.The fish had lost its tail while alive and it had disc-shaped wounds from cookiecutter sharks, but those injuries would not have been deadly. It is unclear why the creature died, although Walker said it was possible the deepwater fish came too close to the surface, where it may have been knocked around by waves.It is possible the fish had been caught in a current that pushed them to coastal waters, marine experts said."If they get disoriented and into the surf zone, they'll probably have trouble manoeuvring back out to sea," said Phil Hastings, curator of the marine vertebrate collection at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.They may also have been forced to the surface by underwater seismic activity.The oarfish washed up on a beach in the San Diego county coastal city of Oceanside on Friday. Several days earlier, a snorkeller found the carcass of an 18ft (5.4 metre) oarfish off Catalina Island and dragged it to shore with some help.The cause of death for the larger fish also remains a mystery.The creatures, which can grow to more than 50ft (15 metres), may be the inspiration of sea monsters found in literature and throughout history. Photos of the oarfish have circulated widely online, spurring general interest in them but contributing little to scientists' knowledge of the fish.
