In the autumn of 1916 the steward of Reading Gaol addressed a bitter official complaint to the authorities: the Irish prisoners were driving him crazy with their incessant singing and dancing late into the night.Ensuring provisions for the prisoners and staff in the middle of a war was a responsible senior position, and Mathew Loan and his family were lodged in a handsome stone building just outside the prison gates.Just on the other side of the wall lay the former women’s prison cells – including a maternity ward – which had been converted to hold some of the men of the Easter Rising, including poets, playwrights and, disastrously for the Loan family, musicians. Every night they were kept awake by the din of voices raised in song, the sound of fiddles and flutes, and the clatter of step dancing on the hard stone floors.A copy of his letter begging to be transferred to another prison, faded almost into illegibility, survives in the prison records for the year, now going on display for the first time in the Berkshire Record Office to mark the centenary of the Rising.However Mark Stevens, the county archivist, can find no evidence that the steward got a reply: he probably had to stick it out until Christmas Eve when, much to their surprise, almost all the men were discharged after being held without charge for eight months.The prison had been emptied in early 1916 to hold “aliens” – mostly interned Germans and Austrians. The collection includes a ledger recording the names of the new inmates, with “Irish” added in red ink on the spine.Stevens is struck by how different the Irish prisoners were. In the records of the men locked up in the 1890s with its most famous prisoner, Oscar Wilde, there are pages of unskilled labourers and destitute unemployed farm workers. In 1916, in the “occupation” column for the Irish, there are teachers and printers, mechanics, doctors and an insurance broker.Many of the men had been transferred from the more famous and far larger group held in Frongoch in north Wales, and Reading also became a “university of the revolution” with classes organised in everything from languages and woodwork to military tactics. The experience proved excellent training for a motley crew of raw recruits, office workers, experienced fighters and idealistic literary figures who had hardly seen a gun before their experiences in that Easter week in Dublin.There were many famous names in the old women’s cells, including Arthur Griffith, founder of Sinn Féin, first president of the infant republic and leader of the Irish delegation in the Treaty negotiations, who, worn out by overwork, would die of a brain haemorrhage in 1922. (William T Cosgrave, the first prime minister, would follow in a later round of arrests.)Steven Matthews, professor of modern literature at Reading University and co-curator of the exhibition, said Griffith was well aware of the potential propaganda value of so many literary activists, and proclaimed magnificently from the prison: “Mobilise the poets!”WB Yeats responded with his anguished elegy Easter, 1916, but several of Griffith’s fellow prisoners also answered the call, including Darrell Figgis, who wrote an account of his time in prison and a volume of prison poetry including A Visit Home, with the note “From my cell, Reading Prison, 27th July 1916” and the lines “I walk within the prison wall; Tis but my body owns their sway. Oh Ireland, home, I hear you call; Silent I wait the end of day.”Another was Terence MacSwiney, who published two volumes of poetry and would go on to become mayor of Cork city. In 1920 when rearrested and court martialled, he went on hunger strike in Brixton prison. Yeats responded by staging MacSwiney’s five-act play, the Revolutionist, at the Abbey in Dublin – but by the time of the performances the playwright was dead, making worldwide headlines, and commemorated in the work of both James Joyce and Samuel Beckett.Stevens and Matthews think the end of Figgis the most tragic. In 1924 his wife killed herself, and the following year his mistress died in a botched abortion: a week after giving evidence at her inquest, the poet killed himself in his London bedsit.Universities of the Revolution, Berkshire Record Office, free, 27 April until 29 July
