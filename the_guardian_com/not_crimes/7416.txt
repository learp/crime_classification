The publication of young adult novel When We Was Fierce has been postponed by its author and publisher following harsh criticism of the “deeply offensive” invented black vernacular it is narrated in.eE Charlton-Trujillo’s verse novel tells of a teenager, Theo, who sees a brutal gang attack on a disabled boy and decides to intervene. Its publisher, Candlewick, which had intended to release the novel on 9 August but has delayed it following the controversy, said it is told “largely in street dialect” by the Mexican-American Charlton-Trujillo, author of the award-winning Fat Angie.Charlton-Trujillo said in an interview that “right from the jump, I could hear the music of T’s world that hadn’t existed in YA before. Slang can become dated quick, so I had a unique opportunity to incorporate some slang along with a new vernacular.”When We Was Fierce initially drew glowing pre-publication reviews from book magazines including Kirkus, which called it a “compassionate, forceful look at the heartbreak and choices these black boys and men face at the lethal intersection of poverty and gang culture”, and Publishers Weekly, which said it was a “heartbreaking and powerful modern American story”.But others were less positive. Jennifer Baker, founder of the Minorities in Publishing podcast and part of We Need Diverse Books, called When We Was Fierce’s “constructed Ebonics … deeply offensive and extremely hard to read without having to reread, not for interest but for comprehension.”In a review on librarian Edith Campbell’s blog, Baker said that “the narration in Fierce shows a blatant disregard and lazy vocabulary creation that’s continually insulting in the hopes that it’s avant garde” and slammed the novel’s references to the Black Lives Matter movement, saying that “it feels like a carrot dangled to make the characters seem more real, but for those of us living this life and this fear in real time it’s another flippant element in a text rife with insult and lack of awareness”.Campbell’s own review said that “every major reviewer who embraced this book was impressed by the language Charlton-Trujillo made up for the contemporary characters in the book”, but asked: “Who makes up language when portraying real people living in a contemporary society? Just how entitled is that?”Charlton-Trujillo has said that the novel draws from her own experience as an outsider, as well as from her experiences mentoring young African American men and working with at-risk children across America. In an “note from the author” on the Candlewick’s website, she writes: “Empowering at-risk youth to harness their narratives through writing in traditional and alternative schools, libraries, after-school programmes and juvenile detention centres showed me there is a deep need for a book like When We Was Fierce – one about making choices and having hard conversations.”“But it had to be something new, reimagined, more poetry than prose. The story … is a work of heightened-reality fiction, a story of four boys experiencing life as outsiders, told by someone who has spent her life as one. It is my hope that young people will connect with this book and that it may, even in some small way, make things better for them.”But Candlewick has now announced that the novel has been postponed. “After discussion between the author, her agent and Candlewick about the dramatic contrast between the pre-publication reviews, as compared to many of the social media and blog responses to When We Was Fierce, we decided together to take some time for further reflection and thus postponed publication,” the publisher told School Library Journal.Children's author sorry for 'racial insensitivity' in picture book showing smiling slaves The delay follows the decision to pull a children’s picture book, A Birthday Cake for George Washington, earlier this year after it was criticised for the “dangerously rosy impression of the relationship between slaves and slave owners” it gave. Last year, the author Emily Jenkins apologised for the picture book, A Fine Dessert, which featured images of smiling slaves, saying: “I have come to understand that my book, while intended to be inclusive and truthful and hopeful, is racially insensitive.”
