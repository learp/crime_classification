Italy is to work with the UN’s cultural agency to protect ancient artefacts and archaeological sites in conflict areas from extremists. The Italian foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, and Unesco’s director general, Irina Bokova, signed an accord in Rome creating an Italian taskforce and a centre in Turin to train heritage protection experts. Officials say no country has been chosen yet for the first mission. The taskforce draws on Italy’s carabinieri paramilitary police, which has long fought trafficking in looted artworks.Gentiloni noted that extremists such as Isis sell looted art and artefacts to finance terrorism and destroy monuments for “cultural cleansing”.The cultural protection strategy “could be in the future one of the essential components in the fight against terrorism”, Gentiloni said.Isis is believed to derive some of its funds from a flourishing black market in antiquities. As well as the financial benefits for extremists, plundering or destroying monuments and archaeological sites has a “more insidious motive” – and is an attack on cultural “diversity and pluralism”, Gentiloni said. Last year, activists reported that Isis killed three captives in Palmyra, Syria, by blowing them up after tying them to ancient Roman columns. It also destroyed other monuments in Palmyra, a desert oasis standing at the crossroads of ancient civilisations, including the temple of Bel, temple of Baalshamin and the triumphal arch.“We are witnessing a tragedy of destruction of heritage, systematic and deliberate attacks on culture,” Bokova said at the signing ceremony inside the towering Baths of Diocletian.
