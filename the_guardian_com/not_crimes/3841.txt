On Monday we got an early glimpse of the pope’s encyclical on climate change, but we’ll have to wait until Thursday for the official release. In the meantime, one Brazilian climate action group has provided another taster of what could be this summer’s biggest blockbuster.The mock trailer, created by Observatório do Clima, stars Pope Francis and Jesus Christ* in an epic fight against the evils of coal, oil, gas and global apathy. Get yourself a ringside seat for a boxing match worthy of Rocky and everyone’s favourite papal line: “nature never forgives: if you slap it, it will always slap you back”.It comes as the leak of the pope’s document shows he will attack the human lifestyles that have created “unprecedented destruction of the ecosystem” and call for co-ordinated global action on climate change. As the trailer put its, he’s “an easy man to follow and a hard man to silence”. #PopeforPlanet: coming to a Twitter feed near you soon. *Not true to life
