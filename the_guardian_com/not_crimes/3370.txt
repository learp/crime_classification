FilmSupersonic   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Though there isn’t exactly a shortage of Oasis docs, it’s testament to the enduring appeal of the bros with two eyebrows between them that their story is given a go time and time again. The difference with Supersonic (out yesterday) is the involvement of the “mad ferrets” themselves and the wealth of unseen footage culled from around the world, with director Mat Whitecross charting the band’s rise from a bunker in Burnage to their record-breaking shows at Knebworth in 1996. Fan or not, it’s a cracking tale. But if that’s not enough Gallagher for you, there’s also an Oasis exhibition, Chasing The Sun, heading to Manchester’s Old Granada Studios from 14 October, where you’ll be able to recreate the cover of Definitely Maybe in a life-size replica of Bonehead’s living room.Supersonic is out now; Chasing The Sun is at Old Granada Studios from 14-25 OctoberAmerican Honey   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This portrait of a young gang roadtripping through backwater America – including Shia LaBeouf and newcomer Sasha Lane – is the most gripping youth movie in recent memory.

Photograph: Geoff Price/BBC/7wonder/Geoff PriceSkinheads are one of the most perplexing British subcultures. How did a movement that grew out a love for Jamaican ska music become associated with racist thuggery? In this BBC4 doc, Don Letts reveals how the culture’s powerful appeal to disenfranchised white working-class youth was hijacked by neo-Nazi groups, leading to a fight for the soul of the skinhead.

Photograph: Joe Humphrys, ©TateWhen it comes to Turner talking points (and, let’s be honest, Instagram bait), Anthea Hamilton’s massive bum is up there with Tracy Emin’s bed and Damien Hirst’s cow. But also worthy of your carefully curated feed is her Brick Suit (pictured, above), which would have looked very fetching at the Labour party conference. Also on show are Josephine Pryde’s photos, Helen Marten’s curious junk assemblages and Michael Dean’s abstract scenes of corrugated iron and wood.

Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAIf any unnervingly jabby, doomily bronzed reminder was needed that Britain is going to seed, then the artist David Shrigley’s sarky, spindly thumb (inset, left) is up there with Jeremy Hunt being in charge of something more complex than a box of gravel. And it is literally up there, too, on the fourth plinth, presiding over Trafalgar Square and awaiting the inevitable games of traffic cone hoopla.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the GuardianThis all-male dance troupe is one of the most thrilling around, and its latest work – a double bill called Life, which was at Sadler’s Wells earlier this year and goes on tour from 12 October – is no different. First comes Rabbit by Swedish choreographer Pontus Lidberg, featuring the Boyz in bunny masks; then Fiction, by Javier de Frutos – once censored by the BBC for his show featuring pregnant nuns – where dancers stage De Frutos’s death.

It follows Tasmin, working in a factory on a zero-hours contract by day and caring for her brother Dean by night. Such is its emotional heft, you’ll be watching with a “clenched stomach”, says our Lyn Gardner. Shopping And Fucking      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The stars of Shopping and Fucking.

The profane consumerist parable is being revived at London’s Lyric Hammersmith, with Sophie Wu (AKA Heather from Fresh Meat) as Lulu.
