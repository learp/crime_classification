The winner of the popular BBC show said she would be serving an orange drizzle cake with orange curd and orange buttercream. Revealing the news on ITV’s Loose Women, Hussain said the cake would be “very citrusy”. She had considered doing a fruit cake but told the panel: “I thought ‘Let’s do something a little bit different’.”       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Hussain’s final showstopper challenge: My Big Fat British Wedding cake.

I told my daughter and she said, ‘Oh Mary Berry? You’ve made lots of cakes for Mary Berry.’” The cake will be delivered personally to the Queen next Thursday on her 90th birthday at Windsor Castle’s Guildhall.
