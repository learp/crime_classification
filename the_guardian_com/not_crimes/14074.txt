Catching cheating boyfriends, stumbling across dead bodies and advertising one‚Äôs services as a professional Pok√©mon Go trainer ‚Äì less than a week since the launch of the virtual-meets-real-world app Pok√©mon Go and the stories it has sparked are kookier than the names of the critters its fans are trying to catch.Cheating boyfriendEvan Scribner, a resident of Sunnyside, Queens, told the New York Post that his girlfriend spotted his infidelities after accessing his Pok√©mon Go app and noticing that he‚Äôd caught a Pok√©mon in the exact location of his ex-girlfriend‚Äôs house in Bushwick, Brooklyn.How Pok√©mon Go took over the world in a weekend ‚ÄúShe saw that I had caught a Pok√©mon while at my ex‚Äôs house,‚Äù Scribner told the Post. ‚ÄúShe found out last night at my house and hasn‚Äôt contacted me since then.‚ÄùProfessional Pok√©mon trainerNo time to spend your summer days walking the streets in search of Pok√©stops when you also have a real job?

The official website of Pok√©mon Go spells the app‚Äôs name with an accent but AP Stylebook has decreed the accent over the ‚Äúe‚Äù must disappear. It also deemed the term ‚ÄúPokestop‚Äù OK (hence we felt safe using it earlier).Just to put this in perspective, AP Stylebook only permitted from 1 June of this year that internet could be written without a capital ‚Äúi‚Äù.Dead bodies and funeral gamesA 19-year-old girl in Wyoming stumbled across a dead body in a river while playing Pok√©mon Go over the weekend.‚ÄúI was trying to get a Pok√©mon from a natural water resource,‚Äù said Shayla Wiggins. ‚ÄúI was walking towards the bridge along the shore when I saw something in the water ... I had to take a second look and I realized it was a body,‚Äù she added.Even if people aren‚Äôt stumbling across dead bodies, they are finding plenty of Pok√©mon in completely inappropriate places, such as coffins at funerals or next to their wives in hospital giving birth.David S. Bernstein (@dbernstein)Which is worse, a Pokemon being at a funeral home mid-wake, or me knowing that he's there? pic.twitter.com/vLE5oKa3VdJuly 12, 2016O Canada, no Pok√©mon GoOur fine neighbors to the north might have Justin Trudeau but they don‚Äôt have Pok√©mon Go. At least not officially ‚Äì although many are finding ways of skirting the system through third-party apps. But Canadians still have their sense of humor, creating piles of memes about the Pok√©mon Go shortage.Brynn Elizabeth (@brynnsadventure)we don't need #PokemonGO in Canada because we already have real ones roaming the country üá®üá¶ @Pokemon pic.twitter.com/OBO5V9epCOJuly 10, 2016Princess Zelda (@TriforceOfW)Me playing Pokemon Go in Canada like: pic.twitter.com/S9cbQuogIpJuly 12, 2016Sarah GRONKowski (@Sbeezy28)When you live in a country that doesn't have @Pokemon GO yet! üòÇüòÇ #PokemonGO https://t.co/YQA168ldbFJuly 12, 2016N.
