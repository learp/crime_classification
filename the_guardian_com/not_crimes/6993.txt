The more sticky the weather, the more I want cool, sharp flavours; food that is light, refreshing and, above all, has a snap of acidity to it. All of which has lead me to a succession of vibrant fish dishes – sweet, oily fleshed mackerel and salmon – marinated with citrus juice and golden vinegar, a little ginger, lime perhaps, and served with wholegrain sourdough with a dark and chewy crust.Dishes such as soused mackerel, or salmon that has been browned in a pan then left to mingle with fruit juices, vinegars and aromatics make a teasingly piquant start to a meal. But they work in high summer as principal dishes in their own right with little more than a robust, rough-edged potato salad to push them towards the role of main course.The acid nature of the dressing “cooks” the fish lightly, but also removes the natural richness of its oil-dense flesh, producing something light and fresh-tasting, a dish with a spring in its step.Bread, something dark and sticky, feels appropriate, not purely because of tradition, but as a sweet, doughy contrast to the sharp, bracing flavours going on in the main dishes.Mackerel with juniper, coriander seeds and bayServes 4mackerel 2, filletedFor the marinade:red onion 1, mediumwhite wine vinegar 200mlwater 200mlbay leaves 2garlic 1 medium-sized clovesugar 1 level tbspcoriander seeds 1 tspjuniper berries 15white peppercorns 5black peppercorns 5salt 1 tspfresh dill a little, lightly choppedPeel the red onion and slice it thinly. Pour the vinegar into a stainless-steel saucepan and add the water, sliced onions and the bay leaves. Peel and flatten the garlic, then add it to the pan, together with the sugar, coriander seeds and juniper berries.Bring the lot to the boil, then add the salt and peppercorns. Turn off the heat. Place the mackerel in a shallow dish in a single layer. Pour the marinade over them and set aside in a cool place for at least four hours, until the fish is opaque. Chill thoroughly and eat within a day or two. Add the dill as a garnish.Salmon with ginger and star anise      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Star quality: salmon with ginger and anise.

Finely chop the chilli, removing the seeds if you wish, and stir in.Place the pan over a moderate heat and bring to the boil, then add the star anise, the coriander seeds and peppercorns. Add the sugar and a generous seasoning of salt then, once the onion has softened a little, remove from the heat.In a shallow pan, warm the oil and lightly brown the salmon tail on both sides. Transfer the fish to a serving dish then dress it with the warm vinegar and spice dressing. Set the plate aside somewhere cool, then, just before you serve it, grate some of the ginger very finely over the surface.Salad of new potatoes, watercress and friseeThis recipe makes about twice as much mayonnaise as you need. Save half for later. Scrub the potatoes or peel them as you wish.Serves 2-3new potatoes 400gFor the dressing:egg yolks 2groundnut oil 100mlolive oil 200mllemon juice a good squeezehoney 1 tbspgrain mustard 1 tbspcornichons 15, halved lengthwayscapers 3 tsp, rinsedwatercress a handfulfrisée or other crisp salad leaves a good handful per personWipe or rinse the potatoes, then boil them for 12-20 minutes, depending on size, in generously salted water until tender to the point of a knife.Make the dressing by putting the egg yolks in a bowl, adding a pinch of salt and then slowly adding the oil, the briefest trickle at first, beating all the time until you have a thick mayonnaise. Add the lemon juice and a little finely ground black pepper.Stir the honey and mustard into half of the mayonnaise, putting the other half away for another day. Slice the cornichons in half, then stir, together with the rinsed capers, into the mayonnaise, and season to taste.Remove and discard the toughest of the watercress stems, then pick over the leaves, keeping the freshest. Snap or cut the frisée into large pieces. Drain the potatoes, then, using the back of a spoon, press down lightly on each potato to crack it open.Drop the potatoes into the dressing and fold them into it, so that they soak up as much of it as possible, then add the torn frisée leaves and the watercress.Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
