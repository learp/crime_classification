John Hurt has withdrawn from this summer’s revival of The Entertainer in London. The actor, 76, was due to appear opposite Kenneth Branagh in the production of John Osborne’s play but doctors have advised him against taking to the stage.Kenneth Branagh on The Entertainer: 'I've been bending Rob Brydon's ear about standup' Commenting on his withdrawal, Hurt said: “I have recently been in hospital with an intestinal complaint and although I am much improved and on the road to a full recovery, my doctors have advised that it is too soon for me to undertake a lengthy and arduous stage role. It is therefore with great sadness and disappointment that I must withdraw from The Entertainer.”Hurt was due to play the retired music-hall star Billy Rice, father of the lead character, Archie, who will be portrayed by Branagh. Directed by Rob Ashford, The Entertainer is the closing production of the Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company’s first season at the Garrick theatre, in the West End, where previews of the show begin on 20 August. Its current production is Romeo and Juliet, starring Lily James and Richard Madden.John Hurt given all-clear on cancer Speaking to the Guardian earlier this year, Branagh said of The Entertainer: “You could argue that this is perhaps a more revolutionary play than, say, Look Back in Anger [John Osborne’s best known play]. And I think it gives voice to what you might call the angry young woman in [Archie’s daughter] Jean Rice. I’m trying to come at it from a different kind of place. Despite Archie being at the centre of things, there’s a youthful fire in the play.”Hurt’s replacement has not yet been announced. The Entertainer’s cast includes Sophie McShera as Jean Rice and Greta Scacchi as Archie’s wife Phoebe.
