Here’s what he thought:  Dressed in a gown that nods to new album The Bride, Natasha Khan doubles down the torrid emotions of her work to date, bringing powerfully heartfelt songwriting that oscillates between the desperation and rapture of true love. Her driving disco numbers cruise with pure confidence, but the likes of Laura challenge Adele for the weekend’s ballad crown.Could a battle of the balladeers be on the cards? I definitely do not condone violence but I’m thinking of trying to arrange a fight between the two artists in a mud pit later on. Who would win do you think? I imagine Adele’s tactics would be quite shove-based while Natasha concentrates more on strangulation and kicking. Just a hunch.

As the bouncy opening chords to Mr Blue Sky make an appearance, you wonder if the clouds above the Pyramid might take the hint and part, but they stay stubbornly in place. No matter, the communal sing-song that follows is enough to lift anyone’s spirits.

Festivalgoers struggle to leave on the final day of Glastonbury festival. Photograph: Yui Mok/PAAccording to our reporters Lisa O’Carroll and Hannah Ellis-Petersen, Glastonbury has suffered the worst rain and mud since the festival began 46 years ago, consuming the area’s entire supply of woodchip in the process. Founder Michael Eavis says he will not consider moving the festival to later in the summer to avoid the wet blaming the torrential rain that hit the 1,000 acre site in the weeks before the gates opened on global warming.He said he was amazed at how the 180,000 festivalgoers remained cheery despite the weather.“I drove round the whole site last night. It took right up until 4.30am and the sun was up and there was just thousands of happy people with smiles on their faces despite the adverse conditions. It is extraordinary. I do not know how they do it, but they love it so much,” he said.“Every single bit of woodchip in the south of England, all of it is here over 1,000 acres,” he said.

Other than maybe self-service checkouts, earwigs and people who put their bags on the empty seat on a busy bus. Could the impromptu Bowie dance-athon over on Pyramid stage convince me otherwise? I don’t know, I didn’t go! But my dear friend and esteemed colleague Marta Bausells popped along. Here’s what she thought: Marta Bausells (@martabausells)Starman flashmob at Pyramid stage (vid doesn't remotely reflect its awesomeness etc) #guardianglasto pic.twitter.com/bi8hgP9xs8June 26, 2016 There’s nothing like a Starman flashmob to wake up the hungover crowd hanging at the Pyramid Stage. Laura Mvula had just finished an electric and emotive show and the sleepy crowds were slowly making their way into other fields, when a member of the production crew took over the mic and started to pay homage to the many musical stars that passed away this year – Prince, Lemmy, Bowie – before adding that “there’s a lot other going on in the outside world. Here at Glastonbury we’re going to recharge ourselves.” He said the crew wanted to pay tribute to Bowie by screening his final performance at the Pyramid stage – which took place in 2000 – on the screens. The crowd immediately switched back on and embarked in a mass singalong. Amazingly, this was followed by a Starman flashmob with choreography directed by a group of dancers on stage. The perfect way to recharge the collective spirits if there ever was one.

Photograph: Alicia Canter for the GuardianSix years ago, the Jazz World stage was retitled West Holts, with a promise to bring “the best groove-based music from around the world” to the festival. For today’s huge lunchtime crowd, Kamasi Washington and his band did just that. But the 35-year-old Los Angeles saxophonist – who cropped up on the left-of-mainstream’s radar thanks to his playing on Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly before he really made his mark with his own album of last year, The Epic – didn’t shy from real hardcore jazz either. Bassist Miles Mosley and keyboard Brandon Coleman helped produce a thunderous sound that recalled early to mid-70s Miles Davis at his most badass. Washington, meanwhile, powered through, aided by a special guest – his own father Rickey Washington – on soprano sax and flute. Often it felt like a Sunday religious service, only of the funkiest kind.Me and the muse: Kamasi Washington on his sources of inspiration   Kamasi Washington and his dad Rickey on West Holts stage, Glastonbury 2016 Photograph: The GuardianUpdatedat 4.08pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.12pm BST15:12What the Dickinson!Gwilym also overheard Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott – who were playing on the Other Stage – share some insight into their key demographic…“It’s so nice to see some young people here.

There’s blatantly going to be at least five proposals during Yellow alone, isn’t there?) Over at the Pyramid stage, love was in the air for the soul man’s show. Ben Beaumont-Thomas got emotional … With a sizeable crowd needing heads soothing, ever-ascendent jazz superstar Gregory Porter applies a caramel-rich balm. His soul-pop hits have people clapping delightedly along, but there’s still room for improv and bop; the languid Take Me to The Alley sees Porter deliver saintly lyrics with gorgeous precision. It’s so swoony that a couple get engaged on stage – my eyes rapidly moistening – before Porter hits the crowd with a cover of Papa Was a Rolling Stone. His status as the biggest crossover jazz artist of the decade is further cemented with one of the weekend’s best sets.Glastonbury Live (@GlastoLive)Gregory Porter getting the crowd started at the Pyramid Stage.
