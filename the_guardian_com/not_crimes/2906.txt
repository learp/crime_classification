Those inclined to take comfort from Peugeot’s assurances about job security for Vauxhall workers ( Report, 7 March) may have forgotten how the same company, which bought Chrysler’s European operations for $1 in 1978, closed its Coventry factory in 2007, when production of the 206 came to an end, and opened an assembly line for the 207 in Slovakia instead.Tim OttevangerLutterworth, Leicestershire• As a British citizen who is permanently resident, and running a business, in Spain, I welcome your recent coverage of the plight of UK citizens resident in other EU member states (Giles Tremlett, 6 March 2017). We face a very uncertain future, personally and professionally. But I wish you would avoid the lazy depiction of us, in accompanying photos, as beer-swilling, union-jack-clad, sun-worshippers. It is inaccurate and it makes us seem not serious and therefore not important.Jenny MayhewBérchules, Granada, Spain• Please assure Mary Bolton (Letters, 8 March) that we northerners had/still have jam tarts, which we can afford because we made/make our own jam.Gill CarrickDriffield, East Yorkshire• My mother’s take on sugared currants in leftover pastry (Letters, passim) was known as Saturday cake.Cherry LavellPolegate, East Sussex• My mother used to save stale bread throughout the week, soak it overnight in water, then mix it with lots of dried fruit, butter and other ingredients and bake it. Cut into generous squares and served with custard, it was delicious. I believe this was probably a London recipe, as what they sell around where I live now, which is also called bread pudding, is so insipid. Bernard LancasterMansfield, Nottinghamshire• According to the man who came to evict vermin from our hen run, decking (Letters, 8 March) is “rat heaven”.Griff EverettMilford, Derbyshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
