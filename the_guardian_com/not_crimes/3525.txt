"Don't eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn't recognise as food." With such eminently sensible advice, Michael Pollan was always going to win over the hearts and minds of real food lovers.The American food writer and campaigner has written several excellent books – The Omnivore's Dilemma, In Defence of Food, Food Rules – examining modern industrial food production chains, the affects on our health and the confusion that exists among our generation about what real food is. If you're not already familiar with his work, take a look at these simple rules to get a sense of his thinking.In his latest book, Cooked, Pollan turns his attention to the relatively unfamiliar territory of cooking, as he works through the elements – fire (BBQ and roasting), water (braising), air (bread) and earth (fermentation) – to relearn the importance of cooking in our homes and culture.He will be online to answer your questions at 3.30pm BST on Tuesday 28 May.
