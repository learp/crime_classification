Going upSofia Malamute Photographer, Balenciaga catwalk star, has Lotta Volkova and Jamie Bochert party shots on her Instagram feed. Jells.Pop.See.Cul Oddly named brand with funny slogan tops. Our favourite: the Buy Me A Drink jumper.Chinti And Parker grey ruffle sweater Don’t need another grey knit? This one (the lovechild of an Alexa pie crust blouse, a Christmas sweater and JW Anderson)will change your mind. £325, but obsession-worthy.Warehouse Emma Cook’s reworking of the high street brand is working. Love the prints and frilled jumpers.Puffa jackets As in the originals, which remind you why Puffa has the monopoly on padded jackets. The silvery one is cheap and very Nasa.S+T Not a drink but “socks and trainers” – autumn’s socks and sandals (eminently more doable).Going downCashmere We’ll accept only technical cashmere now, found at Kit and Ace.Jamie Dornan The Fall series three is a bore. Jemaine from Flight Of The Conchords is your new TV crush c/o Sharon Horgan’s Divorce, starring SJP. TBH we’ve always fancied him a bit.Red padded coats Spoiler alert but post-The Girl On The Train, we’re looking at the It item of the season in a whole new light.Fiance The word, not the status. Deemed pretentious and “too hetero” by the NY Times. Sort of agree.Shoulder robing The new pose is modesting: holding your bag in front of you because you’re a) hiding a baby bump or b) your skirt keeps riding up. Millennials do the craziest things.
