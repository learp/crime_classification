Ride are set to release their first album in more than 20 years. The four-piece band, who re-formed in 2014, will finally follow up 1996’s Tarantula with a new record in 2017. The news was broken online by DJ Erol Alkan, who revealed that he would be producing the new record. In an Instagram post of the band in the studio, Alkan wrote: “Currently in the studio with Ride producing their forthcoming album.” Currently in the studio with Ride producing their forthcoming album @rideox4official #ridebandA photo posted by Erol Alkan (@erolalkan) on Dec 1, 2016 at 8:00am PSTRide formed in 1988 and were once regarded as leading lights in the shoegaze scene with two Top 5 albums in the early 90s. They split in 1996 after relationships frayed during the Tarantula sessions. The band briefly regrouped in 2001 for a televised live performance, while Andy Bell went on to form Hurricane No 1 and then joined Oasis as bassist. In an interview in 2015, singer Mark Gardener told the Guardian that they were open to writing new material if the atmosphere was right. He said: “Last year, when we were talking, we all chose the Going Blank Again time as when we were all really enjoying it, all really together, and that was the feeling we wanted to feed from and get back to that way of working. Especially if, in the future, there’s going to be more recording, then that’s the way we want to do it, to recreate that and work like that again.”
