Lil Wayne has said he understands why some people criticised him for saying racism is over, but claimed people don’t see it from his perspective.The rapper was the subject of a backlash last month after he told the Fox Sports 1 show Undisputed that there is “no such thing as racism” because his concert audiences are attended by a lot of white fans. He also said millennials know racism isn’t cool.When asked to expand on his thoughts, Lil Wayne told the Associated Press that one of the reasons he feels this way is that a white police officer saved his life when he was 12, after he accidentally shot himself in the chest. “Yeah, he was a cop, and my life was saved by a white man. I don’t know what racism is,” Wayne said.Lil Wayne: the tragic decline of a hip-hop trailblazer The Grammy-winning rapper said he was lying on the floor when police broke down the door, stepping over his body looking for guns and drugs. But one man stopped and chastised the others for leaving him. “He was white as snow. Them that hopped over me were blacker than me,” Wayne said.Wayne says the man he called “Uncle Bob” personally took him to the hospital and stayed with him. “[He] stood there and waited until the doctor said ‘He’s gonna make it’.”Wayne acknowledged that, despite what he said previously, there is such thing as racism. However, he added that when he looks out from the stage, he sees all colours. “It’s the world out there. It’s not a certain part or a certain kind or a certain culture or whatever of people. It’s people. Those people out there in that crowd,” he said.He added: “I’m blessed to have that opportunity, so with that said, I can only be honest with such a thing, I have never witnessed racism.”
