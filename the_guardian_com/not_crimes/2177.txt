I grew up in a vibrant east London working-class community, which made my Ghanaian parents and their three children feel at home in this country. We initially lived in a council block in Leytonstone, then we moved to a council place in Walthamstow, which resembled Brookside Close. Our neighbours there were really helpful, checking up on my siblings and me when my mum began working full time, after my parents separated. Working-class communities have been getting a really bad rap because of the Brexit vote, but they have embraced immigration, while economics has sheltered wealthier communities from it.My family moved to Ghana when I was two, although I was born in east London. My parents always planned to raise a family there. Dad worked in finance for the Ghanaian government and we had a very big house in a posh part of the capital, Accra. We enjoyed all the trappings of wealth, including drivers, servants and housekeepers. But then, suddenly, we had to return to the UK after a coup in 1984.The pressure of going from a very cushy life to a council estate, plus my dad being unable to get the kind of job he was qualified for, took a toll on my parents’ marriage and they separated when I was seven. Dad moved to America and got a job with Bank of America. He remained in contact and used to send us money. My mum became a nurse. I have to give my mum credit for picking herself up, because she had been a housewife throughout her marriage and so having to then work full time with three children wasn’t easy.My mother was very glamorous and beautiful, and I looked up to her. One of my fondest memories from childhood is of her getting ready for parties. I’d also play with her handbags and totter about in her high heels. But I have been a daddy’s girl my whole life. When he moved to the US, it was a shock, but I don’t remember crying – I just got on with my life. As I got older I realised that his departure wasn’t ideal, but kids can be quite resilient. And at school I was the cool kid because I always went to America during the holidays and brought back the latest trainers.Education is everything in Ghanaian culture and so my parents were furious when, at 18, I decided to get a job as a receptionist with Kiss FM, instead of going to university. We had this family meeting and all these uncles came, people I hadn’t seen since I was two. They told me how much shame I was bringing on the family by not going to university. I stood my ground and so my dad eventually said: “I am going to give you a year and if this nonsense doesn’t work out then you are going to university.” Luckily, it did work out. The funniest thing is that my family now say to people: “We told her: ‘Follow your dreams.’”My older brother Sam and I were very close. We used to play doctors and nurses, and he would let me pretend to give him an injection, by pricking him with a pin! He was an amazing human being. His passing in October last year is still so raw, really painful.My sister Rebecca used to save up her pocket money and buy nice dresses from Walthamstow market, which I would wear to show off to my friends at school. When Rebecca found out, she hit the roof! I have a younger sister, Gina, who came along when I was 14, after Mum remarried. I babysat Gina a lot and became more like an aunt than a sibling because of the big age gap. • June Sarpong recently launched Ldny, a clothing collection in partnership with the United Nations Trust Fund, to end violence against women (Ldny.com).
