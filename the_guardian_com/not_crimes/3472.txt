Another Olympic athlete has proposed to his partner at the Rio de Janeiro Games, as debate rages about when – if ever – public marriage proposals are appropriate.Tom Bosworth, a race walker for Team GB, tweeted a photo of him proposing to his boyfriend on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday with the caption: “He said YES!!!”Tom Bosworth (@TomBosworth)He said YES!!! pic.twitter.com/roXsw7oq8fAugust 15, 2016His now-fiancé, Harry Dineley, later shared a photo of the ring, adding: “Ok then.”Bosworth retweeted the picture.Harry Dineley (@harryd1010)Ok then. @TomBosworth x pic.twitter.com/OzGvzTeJkSAugust 15, 2016Bosworth, from Kent, had finished sixth in the 20km event.The first marriage proposal reported at this year’s Games was between a Brazilian women’s rugby sevens player and her girlfriend last Monday.Marjorie Enya, a manager at Deodoro Stadium, asked Isadora Cerullo to marry her after the Brazilian squad had been knocked out of the competition.Bosworth’s proposal also follows a more public declaration from Chinese diver Qin Kai, who asked his teammate He Zi to marry him moments after she was awarded her silver medal in Sunday’s 3m springboard event.Kai surprised He by getting down on bended knee as she stepped off the medal podium and spoke at length before presenting her with a ring.Though He told AFP that she “didn’t expect him to propose today”, she did say yes. The pair have been together since 2010.Team China (@XHSports)ROMANTIC #Rio2016. #CHN diver Qin Kai proposes to teammate He Zi after 3m springboard final https://t.co/meVYf0QEal pic.twitter.com/AnP6KRHpIZAugust 15, 2016But in stark contrast to the warm reception of both Bosworth and Enya’s declarations, Qin was criticised for his poolside proposal, seen by some to be an attempt to co-opt He’s limelight.Photographs of Qin’s surprising He at the podium were widely shared by media on social media, prompting discussion of when – if ever – public proposals are appropriate.Timing seemed to be a crucial factor, with Enya asking Cerullo to marry her after she had been knocked out of the competition and Bosworth waiting until after his event to propose to Dineley.Qin’s popping the question so soon after He had been presented with her silver medal was felt to detract from her sporting achievement, though media reported on it positively.SportsCenter (@SportsCenter)Chinese diver He Zi won silver, then had another special moment as fellow diver Qin Kai proposed to her. pic.twitter.com/KTebQFL35XAugust 15, 2016Gene Demby (@GeeDee215)Have we talked abt ol' dude entrapping his ladyfriend w/ a very public marriage proposal after she medaled in the Olympics?Don't do that.August 16, 2016Ellie Groves (@EllieRuthGroves)Can't get on board with this public proposal palaver at the #Olympics. Men just let your girlfriend have the spotlight and enjoy their win.August 15, 2016Charlotte L. Riley (@lottelydia)Public proposals are bad enough but a public proposal that also detracts attention from the fact that she's just won a silver medal?! Nope.August 15, 2016Tranquila.Tranquila. (@yeeshie_)Tbh it's only fair that you check with your partner that they'd be cool with a public proposal. To force it on them is too much pressure.August 16, 2016Meanwhile, Britain’s Charlotte Dujardin, who retained her individual grand prix dressage medal at Rio’s Olympic equestrian centre on Tuesday, was put in the unusual position of having to dispel reports of a public proposal.After Dujardin beat Germany’s Isabell Werth with a stunning round on Valegro, Dujardin’s fiancé, Dean Wyatt Golding, unveiled a T-shirt with the slogan “Can we get married now?”Dujardin later confirmed this was not a proposal, as the couple are already engaged – simply an expression of impatience.
