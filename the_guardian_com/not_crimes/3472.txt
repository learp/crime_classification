Wildlife rangers pulled almost 300 saltwater crocodiles from Northern Territory waterways in 2015, more than in either of the two previous years.As part of its population management program, the Parks and Wildlife Commission NT (PWCNT) removed 290 crocodiles of various sizes from NT rivers, harbours and waterholes, the largest measuring 4.38m from the Daly River.Two crocodiles which were smaller than two metres were pulled from Shoal Bay on Thursday.Human activity 'driving half of world's crocodile species to extinction' The figure is slightly about 2014’s 287 and well beyond the previous year’s 226. The highest number of crocodiles removed by PWCNT staff was 318 in 2012.Rangers use a combination of baited traps and boats custom-fitted with harpoon racks, slides, a self draining deck and side rails to catch the “problem animals”.All crocodiles are caught alive, and taken to the NT’s crocodile farms, which pay a “nominal fee” to the government based on size and weight, and “can do what they like with them,” PWCNT wildlife ranger Tom Nichols told Guardian Australia.The vast majority – 252 – were found in the Darwin region, prompting a warning from rangers that crocs “could be anywhere at any time”.“Unfortunately, the ‘Be Crocwise’ message isn’t getting through to some people who are still partaking in risky behaviour. Remember that a crocodile will see you before you see them,” Nichols said.Local media, such as the NT News, routinely feature stories on people caught behaving irresponsibly in croc-infested waters.Last month onlookers were horrified to watch a man wade into waist deep water to attempt to rescue his car from a notorious flooded causeway.A coronial inquiry examined the deaths of two people taken by crocodiles in terrifying circumstances. Coroner Greg Cavanagh recommended changes to official warnings to better reflect the increased danger of crocodiles in the NT. “A few decades ago Northern Territorians, including myself, used to swim in many of the waterways of the Northern Territory,” he noted. “That cannot be done today, not without significant danger.”While crocodiles are removed as part of wildlife management, another 30,000 or so eggs are harvested annually by authorised farmers.A new saltwater crocodile wildlife trade management plan, which came into effect on Friday increases the maximum harvest to 90,000 viable eggs and 1,200 animals, the NT land resource management minister, Willem Westra Van Holthe, said.The move is expected to increase the international export of crocodile products from the NT.“I commend the federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, for approving and gazetting the WTMP and enabling the continued international export of crocodile products from the territory,” Westra van Holthe said.
