I agree with Jill Bennett (Letters, 4 April) that daffodils may not look great on urban verges, but here in Old Buckenham we persuaded the parish council to fund the purchase of sacks of varied narcissi for us in 1999. These were planted in bulk by volunteers around the base of all of the seven 30mph speed signs at the various entrances to the village as a Millennium project. They first bloomed in 2000 and are still providing a welcome sight, some 18 seasons later. Perhaps Patrick Barkham should come and have a look before the blooms die off.Ron BrewerOld Buckenham, Norfolk• Re David Shariatmadari’s article “Here’s one title we need” (3 April), using the word “actress” to describe a female actor is frowned upon. Might the Academy Awards help “remove gender from our calculations” by abolishing this anachronism and awarding one Oscar for the best actor, regardless of gender. Apart from anything else, it would make life easier for PwC.John LoweryLondon• What your editorial (Ancient churches need protection as works of art for everyone, 4 April) didn’t say is that the Church of England either remains established – and therefore in receipt of public funding – or becomes disestablished, and left to fend for itself among the rest of the beasts in the funding jungle. Perhaps anti-antidisestablishmentarianism will come into fashion? Fr Alec MitchellDenton, Manchester• We get round the inconvenience of the Icelandic Althing having been established before our Tynwald (Letters, 3 April) by pointing out that the Althing was discontinued for 45 years (1799-1844), making the Manx Tynwald the world’s oldest continuously established parliament.Dy Quentin L BurrellBallabeg, Isle of Man• Robert Anderson surmises (Letters, 4 April) that the enduring appeal of the Boat Race is due to its amateur status. Funny – I thought it was because it doesn’t charge for admission. On a personal note, when I went for the first and only time to see the race, I was waiting at the finishing point when we heard that the Oxford boat had sunk.Maurice GeorgeOrmskirk• I’m afraid San Serriffe (Letters, 3 April) is being used as a bargaining chip in the Brexit negotiations.Kevin LeonardCardiff• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
