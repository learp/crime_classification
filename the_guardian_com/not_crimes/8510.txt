Direct action groups including UK Uncut are planning a series of protests at the headquarters of RWE npower, British Gas and other large energy companies.More than a thousand people are expected to demonstrate against the big six next Tuesday – the day that the latest winter mortality figures are published by the Office for National Statistics.Protesters will meet under the banner "Bring down the big six – fuel poverty kills" at Exchange Square in the centre of the City of London before marching with coffins filled with energy bills to npower's supply and trading offices at Threadneedle Street.Oxford-based campaigners will demonstrate outside the new headquarters of British Gas there, with further protests planned for Bristol and Lewes in Sussex."People must be put before profit, and with creative direct action, we will stand with the elderly, the poor and vulnerable to fight for our power. Fuel Poverty must end," said Sarah Price of UK Uncut."The big six are an example of incredible corporate greed. Huge profits are extracted from the public whilst they suffer at the hands of austerity. David Cameron and his cabinet of millionaires are only too happy to stuff the pockets of big business while ordinary people are left out in the cold."James Grainger of Fuel Poverty Action, also involved in the protests, said people were angry that the big six had tried to blame green taxes for putting up bills."The real problems are the big six's profiteering and the rising cost of polluting energy like oil and gas. Energy is a basic need, too important to be left in the hands of profit-hungry private companies."A combination of publicly owned and community controlled renewable energy – alongside mass insulation – is the way to bring bills down and stop people dying from cold."The energy debate has become ever more heated since firms raised their fuel bills earlier this month. Next week's annual statistics on "excess winter mortality" will not break down how many of these extra deaths were caused by cold homes, but the World Health Authority estimated that 7,200 of the 24,000 extra British mortalities last winter were due to houses without proper heating.Betty Cottingham of the Greater London Pensioners Association, which is also supporting the protests, said her members had limited time to wait or change. "We want an immediate response to the dire circumstances that pensioners live in. Jumpers are not a solution. The solution is to take back the fuel industries into public ownership, and to see them as a public service and not something for someone to make a fortune out of."Npower has become a particular target for critics because the company has been at the centre of rows over tax, overcharging and most recently coming top of the customer complaints league.
