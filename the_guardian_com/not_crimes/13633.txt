This week, we’re not simply looking for songs by the King, but songs about Elvis Presley. See below for more detail on that.You have until 11pm on Monday 11 July to post your nomination and make your justification. Regular RR contributor Sheila Deane (who posts as thoughtballoons in the comments) will select from your recommendations.Deane says: “Covers of Elvis songs could be taken into consideration if a case can be made for their being tributes, criticism, or commentary on Elvis’s version (which I suppose most covers implicitly are). I like a range of musical styles in the playlist, so feel free to nominate whatever takes your fancy, no matter how out there.”Here is a list of all songs previously picked and therefore ineligible for the series.If you want to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions – and potentially blog about the process/selection for the Guardian – please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com with the subject line “RR guru”, or make yourself known in the comments.Here’s a reminder of the guidelines for RR:Tell us why it’s a worthy contender.Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of a song’s words.Provide a link to the song. We prefer YouTube, but Spotify or Soundcloud are fine.Listen to others people’s suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist.If you have a good theme, or if you’d like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.comThere’s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are “zedded”, at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of “zedded” (picked for a previous playlist so ineligible), “donds” and other strange words used by RR regulars.Many RR regulars also congregate at the ’Spill blog.
