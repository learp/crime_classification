As a book group we were motivated by the article by Danuta Kean (Report, 8 February) to do the same as the “mystery benefactor” she describes by giving away copies of George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale and Erik Larson’s In the Garden of Beasts. A local bookshop in Norwich has agreed for us to buy the books at cost price. We intend to pile them up in the shop with a poster announcing the date they are to be given away. We will encourage recipients to pass on their copies once they’ve read them. With luck, this will help us reach beyond the bubble of those who already share our opposition to Donald Trump. We encourage other book groups to follow suit and spread the Read Up! Fight Back! campaign begun in Haight-Ashbury, California.Name and address supplied• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
