 We ate our sandwiches in a bay of trampled grass, under a cascade of ripe blackberries that had been beyond the reach of weekend bramblers. The hedge that sheltered us had never suffered the annual flailing that indiscriminately removes shoots that should bear flowers and fruit, leaving a trail of shattered branches and neat uniformity. Here elder branches sagged under their burden of berries. Sinuous shoots of briars decorated with rosehips and honeysuckle still bearing a few late flowers had woven themselves into the tapestry of scarlet haws and yellowing leaves.After the hysteria of spring and the exuberance of summer, it was as if the hedgerow and its tenants had ground to an exhausted halt, on the cusp of decline and decay. A speckled wood butterfly spread its wings across a leaf. Red admirals, stupified by fermenting juice, drank from over-ripe blackberries. A swarm of tiny, newly emerged nettle-tap moths congregated on the last of the hogweed flowers, reluctant to fly. Hidden in the shade of leaf, a spider rested one foot on a silken thread, waiting for vibrations that would signal that a hoverfly had been snared in its web. A snake millipede that had climbed to the top of a brome grass stem rested, head tucked into its tight coils, inert, warmed by sun filtered through high, hazy cloud.And then the blue tits arrived, followed by a gang of great tits and long-tailed tits, a raiding party ransacking every nook and cranny in search of insects. We watched as they approached through the hawthorns, a hyperactive flock hanging from twigs, searching under leaves, pecking hidden prey from crevices in bark. They would, for the most part, have been this year's fledglings, practising their skills in a time of plenty, before winter strips the hedge of its resources and the surfeit gives way to a struggle for survival.
