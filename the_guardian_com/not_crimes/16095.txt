Washington Larry Parks, star of the Al Jolson films, said to-day that he expected ten words he uttered to-day to end his Hollywood career. The words were “I was a Communist party member from 1941 to 1945.”He is the first Hollywood figure to admit that he had been a member of the party. He made the admission before the House of Representatives’ Un-American Activities Committee.“But there is a difference between being a Communist in 1941 and one in 1951,” he said. “I was younger then.” Giving evidence in a low voice, often scarcely audible, Parks said he had had no connection with the Communist party since he left it. He attended very few meetings and drifted out the same way as he drifted in.“I think that being a member of the party ten years ago fulfilled certain needs of a man who was a Liberal,” he told the committee. It was sympathy for the “little man” that caused him to join the party.There were certain principles in which he believed deeply. “I was taught that equality meant equality of peoples before the law and before God.” For that reason he believed in equal rights for Negroes, that anti-Semitism “is a crime against humanity,” and that all men have a right to worship freely. His only loyalty was to America and the freedom of all Americans.
