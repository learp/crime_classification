That character resonates so well with audiences. People want to know what happened to him, so it’s a perfect foray for us to explore. Obviously we would love it if Denis could [direct]. He’s a busy man, but he’s certainly part of the process with us right now.”Sicario was a surprise hit last year after opening to positive reviews at Cannes. From a $30m budget, it made $80m worldwide. It starred Emily Blunt as an idealistic FBI agent who found herself in the middle of the war against drugs.
