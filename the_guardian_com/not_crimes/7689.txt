Co-operative Bank is to stop lending to companies involved in irresponsible gambling, payday lending and fracking, as well as those dodging corporate taxes, in a reaffirmation of its ethical credentials despite its controversial rescue by American hedge funds.In the fifth review of the bank’s ethical policy since launching two decades ago, human rights again topped customers’ concerns. But concern about international development and animal welfare slipped down the table, while more UK-focused issues moved up, along with worries about fracking and the environment. The bank’s expanded ethical policy is based on responses from 74,000 customers and staff in what will be seen as a barometer of public opinion on key isues.Customers also want the bank to campaign more vigorously around social and economic issues, in a return to the type of action the bank took around landmines and cluster bombs in 2003.But the bank will not ban lending to all companies involved in gambling. Chief executive Niall Booker said the focus will be on companies that exploit vulnerable people, minors and addicts rather than those “who just want to have a flutter on the Grand National.”He added: “When it comes to companies that do not pay tax responsibly, there is going to be shades of grey. We will be going through this on a case-by-case basis, looking at what is in the public domain and in a company’s report and accounts.”Booker said the bank has turned away business worth £1.4bn since instituting its ethical policy in 1992, and that figure will grow as more companies are refused financing under the expanded policy.When it began surveying customers in June last year, questions were asked about fracking, mass surveillance and GM foods. But while fracking raises alarm among Co-operative Bank customers, GM foods were less of a concern and mass surveillance came in as a relatively low priority.The new policy follows deep concern about the bank’s ability to describe itself as an ethical co-operative after the crisis in 2013 left the Co-operative Group of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies – the UK’s largest mutual – with a stake of just 20% in the bank it once owned outright.The bank has since largely withdrawn from lending to large companies, diminishing the influence of its ethical policy. But Booker said: “We have made it clear we are now in the SME space, but that still means companies we lend to have to go through our policy.”In the poll, customers also made it clear that the bank’s ethical policy should not just be about who it lends to, but also about behaving honestly and transparently with customers. Many loyal customers were disappointed when Co-operative Bank emerged as a major mis-seller of payment protection insurance. Unexpectedly high costs to compensate for PPI mis-selling were among a string of conduct issues that forced the bank to seek extra capital funding in March last year.Booker said: “The Ethical Policy will for the first time provide a framework for how the Bank operates. In particular this will cover the products and services offered to customers, the Bank’s relationships with external stakeholders and suppliers and the workplace and culture and ways of working for colleagues in the Bank.”Campaign group MoveYourMoney, which encourages the public to bank in an equitable and sustainable manner, said the poll demonstrated how much demand exists for ethical banking on the high street, and applauded the new policy.But spokesman Ffion Travers Smith said: “The cornerstone of ethical banking is sound management, and ownership structures that prioritise the interests of people and planet over profit. Our bank ranking scorecard shows that the Co-operative still needs to strengthen in these areas. Until these concerns are addressed, The Co-operative Bank will fall short of its ethical aspirations, despite a progressive approach to lending that still places it leagues ahead of the UK’s biggest banks.”
