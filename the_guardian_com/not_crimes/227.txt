1 Abstract ExpressionismPrepare to be awed and exhilarated by some of the greatest art of the modern age. In the 1940s, a generation of New York artists who were fascinated by the psychoanalytic escapades of European surrealists and impressed by the muralists of revolutionary Mexico invented a new kind of art that was spacious, all-embracing, sublime and cosmic. Jackson Pollock was the first to become famous for his dripped and flicked curls of colour. Willem de Kooning painted his sexual demons, Mark Rothko the colours of nausea. The abstract expressionists are dark gods of painting.Royal Academy, W1, Sat to 2 Jan2 Paula Rego      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Paula Rego’s Dancing Ostriches from Disney’s ‘Fantasia’, 1995. Photograph: Marlborough Fine ArtPungently powerful paintings, inspired by Walt Disney’s Fantasia, from one of our finest portrayers of the human body. Rego’s tough, muscular, awkward girls move through a world halfway between modern London and a European folk tale. Her art is both savagely realist and eerily fantastical, viscerally dreamlike yet rawly ordinary. She is a suburban Goya crossbred with Alfred Hitchcock: a true imaginative artist who will outlive our time.Marlborough Fine Art, W1, Wed to 12 Nov3 Eva Rothschild      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Eva Rothschild’s What the Eye Wants, 2014. Photograph: Robert GlowackiThis intriguing sculptor draws in space on a sometimes colossal scale. Her abstract entanglements and towers allude to classics of modernist art from Brâncuși’s Endless Column to Picasso’s monument to Apollinaire. Yet they also look like random doodles in nothingness. Rothschild seems to yearn to make grand sublime visual statements but can’t quite take them seriously, and always ends up with a cockeyed smile. This is what abstract art looks like now.The New Art Gallery Walsall, Sat to 15 Jan4 Marc Camille Chaimowicz      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Marc Camille Chaimowicz’s An Autumn Lexicon. Photograph: Cabinet LondonToday’s conceptual art is emotional and obsessed with popular culture. Chaimowicz is its godfather. This exhibition typifies his belief in emotional honesty: it is called An Autumn Lexicon and uses everyday stuff to conjure up memory and autobiography.Serpentine Gallery, W2, Thu to 20 Nov5 Suzanne Treister       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Suzanne Treister’s HFT The Gardener/Outsider artworks/Cestrum laevigatum (Dama da Noite), 2014-15. Photograph: Annely Juda Fine Art A City trader called Hillel Fischer Traumberg who has moved from hi-tech banking operations into art is the fictional creator of the works in this exhibition. Treister, herself a painter who evolved into a digital artist, reveals Traumberg’s experiments with more than 100 psychoactive plants and his research into Hebrew numerology. Her exhibition has it all: drugs, advanced technology and a very strange banker.Annely Juda Fine Art, W1, to 29 Oct
