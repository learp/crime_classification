Polar researchers thought their models were broken when they first saw the results.Almost 12% of Greenland’s ice sheet was melting on Monday, according to data crunched by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI).It beat, by almost a month, the previous record for a melt of more than 10%, on 5 May 2010.“We had to check that our models were still working properly,” Peter Langen, climate scientist at DMI, told blog Polar Portal.Temperature readings on the ice were in line with the numbers, however, exceeding 10C in some places.Even a weather station 1,840 metres above sea level recorded a maximum of 3.1C, which data analysts said would be warm for July, let alone April.Greenland’s usual melt season runs from early June to September. “Too much. Too early,” tweeted the World Meteorological Organisation.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Left: Maps showing areas where melting has taken place within the last two days.
