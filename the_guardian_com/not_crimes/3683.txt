This is a mystery taking place in ancient Egypt. It’s a story about a boy called “boy” and his sister named Imi. The boy is special because he is a great sculpture artist and he has a good heart. Many bad things happen to him but he always manages to survive because of his goodness and his skills. In fact, he even becomes the king’s favourite person.It took me a while to really get into this book, but towards the end it gets catchy and made me more curious about what was going to happen next. Some parts of the book were a bit scarey and gruesome, like something from Horrible Histories. Generally I liked this book and I would recommend to anyone who does not mind reading about some pretty gross things!! • Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
