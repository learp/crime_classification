The first thing I do as I prepare to go for holiday is panic. “How will I ever get it all done?” I ask myself. “What will happen if this or that doesn’t get follow-up while I’m away?”Then, I try to breathe and remember the advice a mentor once shared: taking care of me is the work.Taking time off is not a luxury. It is a necessity in becoming inspired and effective contributors to social change. Our work relationships require us to recommit every day to making them work, with deep listening, patience, humility, and an embrace of paradox. These qualities are hard to come by when I’m stressed and overcome by the tyranny of the to-do list.So I’m sharing five steps I take when it’s time to switch off and revitalise: Every day I’m away, I commit to doing something that gives me a clear sense of taking care of myself 1 Make comprehensive handover notesI start by taking everything that’s in my head and on my to-do list and make a summary for my co-workers. This “status update” helps me identify what really needs to get done while I’m away and what can wait for my return. Making handover notes also helps me determine what can be delegated and if, when, and how I can be contacted if questions or emergencies arise. They are also a great way to remind the boss of the responsibilities and projects I’m holding. Ultimately, the handover notes are for me, so that I go on holiday feeling all the loose ends are tied up.2 Cut off email from your phoneI have a hard and fast no-email rule while on leave. Given that I’m tethered to my phone for social media and the camera, it is just too tempting for me to see what emails have come in. So I make sure those emails are simply not delivered to my phone. How many of them are truly urgent anyway? I’ve learned the hard way to not let the fear of returning to hundreds of emails be stronger than my resolve not to be disturbed by work.3 Commit to a daily practiceIt could be a walk every afternoon, 20 minutes of meditation, reading a beloved book, making breakfast every morning, or calling my grandmother. Every day I’m away, I commit to doing something that gives me a clear sense of taking care of myself or my family. Too many times, during busy work days, I just don’t have the time, or make excuses for why this has to be put off. These things become my first priorities while I am away, and become easier to integrate into my daily life on my return.

I am a poet all the time, but exploring new music, making a collage, or taking a storytelling or cooking class reconnects me to my creativity and my passion. I use different parts of my brain from those used to plan and budget and evaluate. Every time, it’s amazing what unexpected “a-ha” moments occur as a result.5 Take time to reflect on your goals Thomas Merton wrote: “It is true that we are called to create a better world. But we are first of all called to a more immediate and exalted task: that of creating our own lives.” Time to take a careful accounting of what I have experienced in my life, what has shaped it, is often hard to come by on holiday, especially if surrounded by family or friends. But it’s crucial. Our professional goals and achievements are only part of our lives. What should I celebrate? What do I have yet to attain? Am I creating the life I truly want? Am I resisting change, or embracing it?Development work is an emotional and spiritual endeavour, requiring us to not only to use our intellects, but our whole selves. The world needs many more people resolved and fearless enough to work and fight for a better future for us all.So take your days off, and “fill up the well”. Return from leave as your most hopeful, courageous self.Jennifer Lentfer is the creator of how-matters.org and director of communications at IDEX - International Development Exchange.
