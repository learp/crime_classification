The Unexpected Everything is Morgan Matson’s latest book, and it was everything you’d expect from Morgan Matson. I love her books for their summery feel, and the way they make you wish you were having the summer her characters are having, and this latest book failed to disappoint. It centres around Andie, Palmer, Toby and Bri and their respective boyfriends, particularly Andie, and how her summer becomes totally unexpected after her Dad’s career in politics goes somewhat awry, just before she is about to embark on her summer course for aspiring doctors.I really enjoyed the light-hearted and easy-going tone of the book, however it still managed to tackle serious subjects and be emotional at the same time. The only thing I’d say I disliked about it was how jealous it made me! Somehow I don’t think I’ll ever have a pool in my back garden! I would recommend The Unexpected Everything for a lovely summer read, perhaps on your summer holiday or to break up the time in between exams.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
