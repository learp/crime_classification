If you enjoy comic stories, Jack Dash and the magic feather is right up your street! Jack, a 10 year old boy, is forced to move to a new house in the small town of Curtly Ambrose with his parents. Life up to that point is completely normal until…Jack discovers an empty notebook with his name inside it and hidden within a feather he finds a quill pen. This is a magic feather bring syour dreams to life: “if you know where to draw the line”. Just when things are looking up, Jack discovers that he cannot start ticking off his wish list because he isn’t very good at drawing! His plans to draw a dog and lots of chocolate don’t quite turn out the way he expects. Instead his father is about to lose his new job, a Sea Lion called Sardina needs his help and the despicable Mayor Gristle is chasing Jack. To make matters worse, Jack is constantly pestered by Coco McBean, his neighbour from hell who loves to play tricks on him. Will Jack be able to draw the right thing and save the day?I believe this book is very funny and it is bound to be popular with both boys and girls. Children who have had to move to a new town or country will particularly be able to relate to Jack. It cannot be easy to leave your friends and have to get used to a new way of life. My favourite character is definitely Jack because he finds a magical feather and he can have anything he wants, whenever he wants it. I also sympathise with him because he is missing his friends, home and a routine which made him feel safe. Another thing that I really like is the funny illustrations that really go well with the story. How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
