Daniel Craig and Halle Berry are set to star in Kings, a love story set amid the 1992 LA riots, according to Deadline. It will be the English language debut of Turkish-French film-maker Deniz Gamze Ergüven, whose first film, Mustang, was Oscar-nominated for best foreign language film. Craig will play Ollie, one of the few white residents living in South Central during the Rodney King trial. The recluse is brought out of his shell when he meets Berry’s character, a working-class mum who has taken responsibility for a group of local kids. When violence breaks out, Ollie helps Berry’s character get the kids to safety.The 1992 riots started after three of the four police officers caught on video beating unarmed taxi driver Rodney King were acquitted of brutality charges. A seminal moment in modern American history, the riots have rarely been depicted outside of documentary cinema. Yet Ergüven’s film is one of two related feature projects currently making their way to the screen: John Ridley, writer of 12 Years a Slave and writer-director of Jimi: All is By My Side also has a film about the unrest in development. Craig, officially still the lead in the James Bond franchise, famously said he’d rather “slash his wrists” than play 007 again, but still hasn’t confirmed whether he’ll leave the role. He’s signed up to star in Logan Lucky, Steven Soderbergh’s official return to feature directing, which will also feature Channing Tatum, Adam Driver and Katherine Heigl. Berry, who appeared opposite Pierce Brosnan in the 2002 Bond film Die Another Day, will next appear in Kidnap, an abduction thriller. She’s also signed up to play an American secret agent called Ginger in Matthew Vaughn’s Kingsman sequel The Golden Circle.
