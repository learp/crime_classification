Next year, students at the London School of Economics will welcome new professor Angelina Jolie, who will teach a class on the impact of war on women alongside William Hague. But over in Texas, a star teacher has already started work: Matthew McConaughey, who co-ran a film course at the University of Texas at Austin this spring. A repeat of the seminars starts in 0autumn.Offered to 30 students of the Moody College of Communications, the class is a collaboration between lecturer Scott Rice, McConaughey and his Free State of Jones director Gary Ross. It aims to teach pupils film-making through focusing on behind-the-scenes processes on the Free State of Jones, a moderately-rated awards hopeful about a southern soldier who ended up fighting the Confederacy. It opened in the US a week ago.A spokesperson for the school said the course revolves around pre-taped videos featuring the film-makers, but also includes “at least one on-campus visit” from McConaughey, who graduated from the university in 1993 with a BA in radio, TV and film studies.
