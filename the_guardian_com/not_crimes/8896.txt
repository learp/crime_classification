James Murphy and LCD Soundsystem released their first new music in over a year with two new tracks from their forthcoming reunion album.Murphy broke the news that the tracks, which the band debuted at a recent residency in Brooklyn, would be released at midnight on Thursday via a lengthy Facebook post. He said: “We’re releasing 2 songs tonight at midnight … we played them both at Brooklyn Steel. They’re new.”Murphy also added that the finished album would not be released until a vinyl version of the album was ready. “I insist that there is vinyl on the day it’s released (because ... well ... because I’m an old person.”He went on to say that the band is reticent to play large-scale shows, firstly because he’s not sure it fits with what the band is and secondly, because he doesn’t want fans to be ripped off by ticket scalpers.LCD Soundsystem – 10 of the best “Since we’ve only ever played hollywood bowl, red rocks and MSG, all of which were ‘special’ shows,” he wrote. “So it’s just hard to get our heads around the fact that maybe many more people that we assumed want to see us perhaps DO want to see us. It’s been a very nice revelation, but oh dear it’s still hard to make sense of.” “What we also don’t want: tickets to our shows being sold for $1,000 on eBay, and people who like our band standing outside crying because they bought some bogus barcode from some shit-heel scalper.”
