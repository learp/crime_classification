1 Ed RuschaThere is an eerie, apocalyptic undertone to Ed Ruscha’s apparently bland vision of Los Angeles. The gas stations and strip malls he paints or photographs may burst into flames any second. Morbid, poisoned skies glow above their neatly painted signs; flat yet bizarre messages are written in the ether. Ruscha is a pop artist, a conceptual artist and a surrealist whose images portray the same sinister Hollywood you see in David Lynch films. In other words, a contemporary great.Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, to 29 April 20182 Chris OfiliThe story of Chris Ofili might make a compelling biography or even a novel. This artist who leapt to fame and won a Turner prize at the height of the sensationalist British art craze of the 1990s has since shunned the public eye to explore the landscapes of Trinidad in personal, idiosyncratic paintings that wilfully refute his elephant dung-and-superheroes era. Here he reveals a new direction as a tapestry designer. National Gallery, WC2, to 28 August3 David HockneyThe modern Greek poet CP Cavafy has been a fecund source of inspiration for artists: the sensual painter Cy Twombly loved to scrawl quotes by him on languid canvases. David Hockney is another fan and this display coinciding with his Tate Britain blockbuster showcases a 1967 series of etchings in which he illustrates Cavafy’s poems. These terrific images featuring gay men were published in the year homosexuality was partly decriminalised in England and Wales.British Museum, WC1, to 14 May4 Lucy Beech & Edward ThomassonCooperation and conflict, social norms and raw individualism are explored in a performance art piece that dramatises society and its discontents. There are two parts to it: a series of live sessions on Saturdays and a video that replays these happenings through the week. Fine art or yet another retread of live art ideas that were new and fresh when first enacted 50 years ago? You decide.Tate Britain, SE1, to 18 June5 Lucienne DayLike William Morris before her, Lucienne Day turned the patterns of nature into a vision of the good life. Spindly, abstract wild flowers populate calm olive-coloured imaginary gardens in the textile designer’s soothing art. Her rustic modernism is on display as part of a project that links horticulture to improved mental health. This blend of art, nature and engagement would have delighted the great Victorian visionaries of art in society.The Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, to 16 July
