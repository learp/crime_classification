A vulnerable primate has been flown more than 5,000 miles from the Maldives to start a new life in Britain.The Bengal slow loris, a species no larger than a bag of sugar, had been living in the capital Male after police officers confiscated it during a drugs raid.Officers housed the nocturnal creature in a birdcage on Dhoonidhoo, also known as "prison island", for eight months, feeding it baby food and bananas, while they searched the globe for a suitable new home. Officers named the loris, believed to be male, Kalo, which translates as "Buddy".Alison Cronin, who runs the Ape Rescue Centre at Monkey World in Dorset, embarked on a complex mission to rehouse the primate in the south-west of England.With other countries unable to help transport the animal, which is one of only a few thousand in existence, she brought the case to the attention of the British authorities and requested permission for it to be brought to the UK.She said: "It would have been a huge loss if a healthy, vulnerable animal had to be destroyed, but it was also really important for us to support the Maldivian authorities, and to send a message to other countries around the world that vulnerable creatures don't need to be put down – organisations like ours will provide support and assistance to ensure that endangered species aren't allowed to die off."British Airways captain Will Rennie, who flew the animal from Male to Gatwick airport, said: "Travelling at more than 500mph with us, our special little guest was for once not such a slow loris!"The animal will spend the next four months in quarantine at Monkey World. It is then expected to begin a new life at the Shaldon Wildlife Trust in Devon, with a new friend, a slow loris called Doris, who has been without a companion since she arrived in the UK 15 years ago.• This article was amended on 19 August 2014.
