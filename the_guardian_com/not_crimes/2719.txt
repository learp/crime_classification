The Assassin (12A) (Hou Hsiao-hsien, 2015, Tai/Chi/HK) Shu Qi, Chang Chen. 106 minsA feast for the eyes and a mild ache for the brain, Hou’s ancient Chinese fable unfolds in ravishing images, graceful movements and bursts of action. When it comes to working out exactly what’s going on, though, good luck. The bare bones of the story are clear enough: Shu’s silky, silent killer is tested when she’s ordered to kill her former fiance. The finer details are wilfully opaque, but somehow that only adds to the spell this extraordinary film casts.The Big Short (15) (Adam McKay, 2015, US) Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell. 130 minsThe guy who made Anchorman tackling the 2008 crash? This fact-based financial comedy is the best of both worlds, following the oddballs who bet against the banks. It’s told with snappy energy and caustic humour, plus some ingenious explanations of complex financial instruments. But it’s morally grounded, too (see feature, p14).Our Brand Is Crisis (15) (David Gordon Green, US) Sandra Bullock, Billy Bob Thornton. 107 minsBullock has the smarts and slapstick skills to carry this offbeat satire, playing a formidable but flawed election consultant drafted into a Bolivian presidential campaign. That sets up a rematch with her arch rival, and an amusing study in political cynicism.The 5th Wave (15) (J Blakeson, 2016, US) Chloë Grace Moretz, Nick Robinson, Liev Schreiber. 112 minsThe title could refer to the endless tides of Hunger Games imitators this is part of, but it actually names the final stage of an apocalyptic alien attack – within which Moretz’s ordinary teen must locate her missing brother, negotiate romance and train up for the resistance. Sound familiar?Ride Along 2 (12A) (Tim Story, 2016, US) Ice Cube, Kevin Hart. 102 minsUnreconstructed buddy antics with the law enforcement brothers-in-law, now on assignment in Miami, where the comedy is even skimpier than the bikinis.Lost In Karastan (15) (Ben Hopkins, 2014, Ger/UK/Geo/Fra) Matthew Macfadyen, Noah Taylor, MyAnna Buring. 96 minsA washed-up British film-maker finds himself directing a propaganda film for a central Asian dictatorship in this absurdist low budget comedy.The Last Diamond (15) (Eric Barbier, 2014, Fra) Yvan Attal, Bérénice Bejo, Jean-François Stévenin. 108 minsA serviceable, classical French heist thriller, complicated by safecracker Attal’s romantic liaison with Bejo’s auction dealer.Attacking The Devil: Harold Evans And The Last Nazi War Crime (12A) (David Morris, Jacqui Morris, 2014, UK) 102 minsRigorous, effective chronicle of the Sunday Times editor’s long campaign to gain compensation for those afflicted by Thalidomide – which was developed by the Nazis, it turns out.The Visit: An Alien Encounter (PG) (Michael Madsen, 2015, Den/Aus/Ire/Fin/Nor/Swe/Neth) 83 minsWhat would really happen if aliens made contact?
