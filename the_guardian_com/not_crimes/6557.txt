  Love is grand; divorce is a hundred grand.” Divorce can be expensive, yes. It can also be heart-wrenching, cathartic and, at times, even funny. We’re launching a series of stories all about divorce – the actual event, not HBO’s new show, although we do have an interview with series star Thomas Haden Church this week – and we want to hear from you.How has divorce affected your life? Did it shape who you are, for better or for worse? What were the lowest moments you wish more people discussed openly? What surprised you most about the experience? Did someone offer much-needed advice at just the right time?Share your stories with us using the form, below. It can be a quick memory, a longer explanation, or anything in between. We’ll feature a selection of your responses in our coverage of this topic.Thank you for your submissions! The form is now closed, but check back soon to see a selection of the responses.
