The bad hombre revolution is here and it’s delicious. Restaurants across the country have taken advantage of Donald Trump’s laughable attempt at speaking Spanish and cooked up some cheeky dishes at his expense. On Wednesday night during the final presidential debate, when asked about his thoughts on immigration and border protection (as if we didn’t already know) Trump decided to test his entry-level español and uttered , “We have some bad hombres here and we’re going to get them out.”The best (and worst) jokes from the Al Smith dinner The problem is that what he actually said was hambres – hambre meaning hungry or hunger in Spanish, so food trucks and restaurants across the nation decided this was the perfect opportunity to showcase some ingenious menu specials.Here are some of our favorites: El Corazon in Portland, Maine, sold out of the Bad Hombre Burrito in two hours on Thursday morning. This tasty special is filled with carnitas, asada grilled onions, jalapeños, guacamole, sour cream, beans, cheese, rice and extra hot salsa. We’re thinking you can’t find this at Trump Tower.Philadelphia’s Grubhouse is offering the Bad Hombre Breakfast Sandwich – made with chorizo, eggs, pepper jack and jalapeño ketchup. Since launching in 2013, The Grubhouse is known in south Philly for its creative brunches, and we’re sure this new item will attract a few more customers.Meanwhile in Nashville, Rosepepper Cantina created two new cocktails. The Bad Hombre will most likely put you to sleep as it is made with “very, very strong, believe me, mezcal”, while the Nasty Woman is made with very strong tequila. Let’s remember Trump damaged his reputation with the Hispanic community long before this week’s debate, and food has weirdly played an important role in his controversial campaign. In an attempt to attract the Hispanic vote on Cinco de Mayo, Trump tweeted an image of himself eating a taco bowl declaring “I love Hispanics!” and in September, Marco Gutierrez, the co-founder of Latinos for Trump, declared that without tough immigration policy there would be taco trucks on every corner (sign me up).On Wednesday, the Culinary Workers Union created a taco truck wall outside Trump International Hotel on the Las Vegas strip. More than 400 workers and activists protested over management’s refusal to meet with the union to discuss better salaries and improved working conditions.
