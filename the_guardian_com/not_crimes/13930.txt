Think your coloured vinyl is unusual? Or your double-grooved single? They’re nothing. The American band Slightly Stoopid – who describe their music, somewhat unpromisingly, as “a fusion of folk, rock, reggae and blues with hip-hop, funk, metal and punk” – have just broken new ground in vinyl by producing the world’s first smokable record, made from hashish.“It’s all about putting two old-school vintage mediums together,” the band’s manager, Jon Phillips, told Billboard. “Vinyl is an old-school medium, and that’s how we feel about hashish, too.”The good news is that the record is indeed completely smokable. The bad news is that you can’t buy it by the quarter, and it doesn’t come cheap. In fact, you’re not going to be able to buy it at all. Open thread: the best weed anthems So far two copies of the track Dabbington – described by Billboard as “a jazzy, stoner-friendly instrumental” – have been pressed. The first was described as passable, “but the office potheads couldn’t help chipping away at it for their own enjoyment”. It was made from $6,000 worth of extra-resinous bubble hash, and cost $1,000 to press and master. A second pressing produced unsatisfactory sound, and a third attempt is now being planned. The final record will either be auctioned off for charity or kept. It will not be sold. “It’s not something you’re going to plop on your turntable over and over again,” Phillips said. “For now, this is an art piece.”
