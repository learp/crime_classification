His upcoming work includes the Winston Churchill drama Darkest Hour, starring Gary Oldman.“The story will focus on ripe and relevant themes of love, courage and activism in the US – with the intention of inspiring today’s youth to stand up for and have a clear vision for the world they want,” said producer Michael De Luca, whose previous credits include The Social Network, Captain Phillips and Moneyball.The script is likely to cover the pair’s status as a celebrity couple throughout the 70s, Lennon’s move away from the Beatles, the couple’s music together and Lennon’s murder in 1980. In 2009, Lennon’s life as a youth was brought to the screen by Sam Taylor-Johnson in Nowhere Boy, where he was played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson.
