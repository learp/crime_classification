HarperCollins said: “It was a delightful surprise when Michael delivered this wonderful new book and it is always a joy to bring new Paddington adventures to fans young and old.” Paddington’s Finest Hour will feature illustrations by RW Alley, who has illustrated the Paddington books since 1997, the same year Michael Bond was awarded an OBE.Paddington through the ages – in pictures This is the first original Paddington story since Love from Paddington – a book of letters from Paddington to his Aunt Lucy – was published in 2014. Paddington’s Finest Hour will be published ahead of the much anticipated second Paddington film, which is scheduled for autumn 2017 and stars newcomer Hugh Grant alongside the original cast, including Ben Whishaw and Hugh Bonneville.
