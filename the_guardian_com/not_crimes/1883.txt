So yum, did you not see my Instagram, look, wagyu steaks? Remember I said I was going to try the Jamie roasted quails with couscous; well can you believe we were out of za’atar? I’d have made my own except try asking the corner shop for sumac, but we were already defrosting the wagyu for later, of course normally you’d age it for 48 hours to concentrate the flavour, and it had only done 24 but we thought what the hell, if it’s wagyu or plain quails, no brainer.Strictly speaking it’s Welsh not purebred – from a non-wagyu cow inseminated with wagyu sperm? – so there’s not that same incredible level of marbling, and they slaughter them younger, you can totally tell the difference, but our lovely butcher, Mr Sweeney, doesn’t do purebred, don’t ask me why, all his other meat is amazing, but I still treat it like actual wagyu – putting on chilled gloves so you don’t melt the fat? – and you have to do that Heston thing of flipping them every 15 seconds for the Maillard reaction – so it’s crunchy outside but tender inside?

No? So yum, I just…
