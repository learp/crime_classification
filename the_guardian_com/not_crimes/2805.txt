Some great buildings flaunt themselves. But others hide – like the tiny brutalist jewel known as Ansty Plum, nestled deep in a Wiltshire valley. It’s a miniature masterpiece which, in the words of its latest residents, “somehow slipped through the 20th century unnoticed”.Architect Sandra Coppin and her husband Nico had wanted something entirely different. South African-born, with two young daughters, they’d begun to feel confined in their London flat. Initially they’d set their sights on Norfolk, aiming for wide horizons and extra breathing space (and, critically, somewhere for Nico to fulfil his childhood fantasy of a garden big enough to warrant a tractor-mower). But, instead, an internet search threw up this intriguing 60s modernist house in a small Wiltshire village, which had sat on the market for a year. Coppin stresses: “We were not interested. It didn’t fit the brief at all. A one-bedroom house, on a third of an acre, in the middle of nowhere. But I saw that it had a little studio built by the Smithsons, so my interest was piqued. We just thought: ‘Let’s go, have a pub lunch, and pretend we’re going to buy it.’”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Let there be light: the shower has a glass wall which opens on to a fern bank.

You turn around and look down over the valley at the village pond and past this very special collection of 12th-century buildings. I’d never seen anything like it. Nico and I walked around the house for about 20 minutes in silence, and met back at the front door. And he just said: ‘This… is… amazing.’”Ansty Plum comprises a half-built stone cottage, the main house itself (designed for Roger Rigby, a partner in engineering firm Ove Arup, by David Levitt) and a later studio building by Peter Smithson (a key name in the new brutalism movement). Engineers Peter Rice, Max Fordham and Ron Marsh also contributed at various points, making the house a fascinating Who’s Who of midcentury British design greats.“It might be small, it might have been built on a tight budget – the whole thing was done for £5,000 – but there’s absolutely no excess,” says Coppin. “It’s an amazing example of a design team working closely together. You can never see where the architecture ends and the engineering or services begin. It’s absolutely seamless.”At first the family camped out in the unheated space. But as the property began to deteriorate, a plan to install some basic services expanded into a full renovation. For Coppin and practice partner Bev Dockray, it became an exercise in subtraction. “Anything superfluous we stripped away – anything that might compromise your reading of the building in its pure state.” So the gorgeously slender Douglas fir roof, tilted to mirror the angle of the hill, was retained in its pure, lightly insulated state, the brick floor was lifted to install underfloor heating and all the holes in the structure plugged. Storage and utility areas were reworked, superfluous elements removed and spaces rethought. The tiny studio was expanded to create a shower room nestled into the hillside, its glass wall revealing a bank of ferns.

The studio’s zinc roof panels were dressed over door blanks to create tables. Floor bricks were reused for landscaping, and dug-up soil used to meld the buildings back into the slope.The renovation has just been nominated for RIBA’s House of the Year award – a fitting tribute to the original building Coppin calls “brave, exciting, determined”, and to the equally brave project she and Dockray have undertaken.Roger Rigby, the original owner, still lives nearby and visits regularly. “I think it’s not easy, actually, to go back to your former home,” says Coppin. “But he knows that we all live in different ways in different places, according to where we are in time. And the house allows that. It can cope with whatever comes at it.”So could Coppin ever see herself, like Rigby, saying goodbye to the house? “I feel more attached to Ansty. I could leave London, but I couldn’t leave here.” She pauses, and qualifies. “Or if I did, it would be with a very heavy heart.”
