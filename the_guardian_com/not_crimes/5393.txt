It beggars belief that John Manzoni has been appointed as chief executive of Whitehall (Report, 3 October). According to BP’s own internal investigation into the Texas City disaster, which killed 15 and injured more than 150, he was found to have ignored “clear warning signals” from previous accidents and “failed to obtain information needed to understand better his most complex and important refining asset and the risk of a big accident”. Cue the chorus of praise heaped on Mr Manzoni. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude speaks of Manzoni’s “impressive record”; chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander opines, unaware perhaps of the irony, that “John’s experience speaks for itself”. The fact that former chairman of BP John Browne was apparently on the panel that appointed him is of course irrelevant.Michael McColganSheffield• The civil service does not need a chief executive. It already has one in the form of the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service. The import of business people to the civil service over the past 40 years has not been an unalloyed blessing. The odd one has reached the very top, but many others have disappeared without trace within two or three years of taking up office. The achievement record is in fact very much the other way round, with some Whitehall-trained civil servants having become successful chairs of banks and other City-based firms, and others holding effective non-executive director positions in business. The one regret is that no former mandarins have moved to the trade unions or the wider Labour movement.Robin WendtChester• According to John Manzoni: “My priority is building on the existing momentum to strengthen the execution muscle of Whitehall and embed a sustainable productivity agenda across government.” Mandarins whose physique is to be improved by Mr Manzoni in this way will no doubt be familiar with The Complete Plain Words, written by the late Sir Ernest Gowers at the invitation of the Treasury, with the aim of improving official English.Adrian Whitfield QCLondon
