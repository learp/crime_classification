Bafta has announced the nominations for the 2017 British Academy Game Awards with indie title Inside and blockbuster Uncharted 4 leading the way.Fifty games received nominations across 15 categories, but many appear more than once. Inside has the most potential wins since it is nominated in seven separate categories – every category for which it qualifies.Big-budget blockbuster Uncharted 4, on the other hand, has eight nominations in total, but across fewer categories, so it could take home a maximum of six trophies. In the Performer category, Uncharted 4 represents half the total nominations, for Emily Rose (Elena Fisher), Nolan North (Nathan Drake), and Troy Baker (Sam Drake).

The Witness and The Last Guardian, which respectively came out very early and very late in the year, both also received four nominations. Fans of the new virtual-reality headsets fresh on the market last year will be pleased to see that VR games have already made it to the list of nominations, with Batman: Arkham VR nominated for both Best British Game and Innovation, and Unseen Diplomacy also appearing in the Innovation category. Hugely popular AR game Pokémon GO also makes the list for Innovation. The way the landscape is changing, perhaps next year we’ll see a separate category for VR and AR games.
