This Is Not Forgiveness is the story of Jamie and Rob, who are brothers.At the beginning of the book Jamie has just come back from Rob’s funeral. Jamie is talking to an urn containing Rob’s ashes and goes on to talk about his relationship with a girl called Caro, who was also cheating on him with Rob.This was a good book with lots of twists, turns and unexpected moments. The tangle of Jamie’s love life with Caro, intermingled with transcripts of Rob’s video diary after coming back from Afghanistan with PTSD, makes for a great read. The book nearly ends with Rob’s death and finishes back where it started, with Jamie talking to his ashes.I would give it a 5 but it wasn’t entirely perfect, so I’ll give it 4.8.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
