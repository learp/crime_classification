A Workington correspondent reports that a field mouse was found in the stomach of a brown trout, upwards of a pound in weight, which was caught by Colonel Green Thompson on the Cumberland Derwent. Big trout are not particular about their diet, and similar instances have been recorded, though rarely. I wonder, however, if it was a field mouse or a water vole.Another correspondent has been noticing the effect of a passing aeroplane on birds. On August 31, when the "Daily Mail" aeroplane travelled over Garstang, at an altitude of, he thinks, between 500 and 800 feet, it passed above a small flock of starlings. The birds at once speeded up and darted into his shrubberies, scattering right and left and without any cry of alarm. The were undoubtedly frightened, but whether they thought the machine was a predaceous bird or were merely terrified by the unusual sight and sound we cannot say.
