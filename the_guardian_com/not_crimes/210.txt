Being a judge for the Man Booker prize has at times felt like being part of a team of archaeologists excavating some vast buried city. Once the dust has settled – after nine months of reading – you stand back to survey your labours and realise all that’s left is a small pile of gleaming fragments. I hadn’t expected the process to be quite so emotionally exhausting. Nor had I thought it would be quite so exhilarating.It has been as much fun reading and talking about the 155 submissions themselves – and selecting 13, and now six, that we want to evangelise for – as trying to establish our own criteria of excellence. Our shortlist can’t be reduced to a set of individual tastes, even less to a list of adjectives. It makes little sense to ask whether it is a diverse list or a challenging one; if it represents pleasurable or difficult books; whether it celebrates craft or originality. To do so is to read the list, rather than to read the books on it. We were looking for all these things and more.The books on our longlist were all, in their own ways, extraordinary. Those on our shortlist have survived – indeed thrived – under the intensive scrutiny of a second close reading. Thematic unity, where it can be found, is a by-product of the judging process. But to my mind these books are connected by their interest in the world at large, and in how novels can make us feel things we don’t always know we want to feel.

Photograph: Dinendra Haria/REX/ShutterstockPaul Beatty’s blistering The Sellout shares DNA with the work of Swift, as well as possessing some of the savagery of Wyndham Lewis, and the single-minded absurdity of Myles na gCopaleen. The symbolic richness and mythic complexity of Deborah Levy’s Hot Milk is also underpinned by a wicked humour: it’s like Virginia Woolf with good jokes.The dark intimacy of Graham Macrae Burnet’s His Bloody Project – a rich, brooding book that, like Levy’s, is in part an exploration of familial relations – is equally difficult to classify, and utterly compelling from the first page. So too is Ottessa Moshfegh’s Eileen, a dazzling, original novel with noirish flourishes voiced by a wickedly sardonic narrator.We relished the formal inventiveness and stylistic verve of David Szalay’s All That Man Is – a composite portrait of modern masculinity and the foibles of contemporary Europe – and were in awe of the expansive historical span and formal intricacy of Madeleine Thien’s Do Not Say We Have Nothing.What most unites them is that these are books that demand to be read. I will not tire of pushing them into people’s hands.What are the odds – an analysis  by John Dugdale The scandalous 2011 Man Booker shortlist banished the big names to include only one author (Julian Barnes) with past shortlist form. Reflecting some of the judges’ mistrust of literary novels and preference for those that “zip along”, none of the books was more than medium-length, and genre fiction, normally frowned on, was favoured. Two, arguably three, were thrillers. Only two Canadians challenged the British contenders, with no one from other continents.Five years on, grandees have been sent packing again, leaving Deborah Levy in the Barnes role as the sole previous finalist; the average length is a lenient 336 pages; genre works by Ottessa Moshfegh and Graeme Macrae Burnet have made the cut; and the wider world is again unrepresented – though a pair of Americans, Moshfegh and Paul Beatty, have joined Canada’s Madeleine Thien and Canadian-British David Szalay. Yet, far from creating another scandal, the broadly welcomed list was applauded by a Times leader “in praise of shorter novels”.That’s because Amanda Foreman’s panel have been warier in voicing what guided them – no negative comments about rejected titles, no loose populist talk enthusing about quick reads and page-turners. Rewarding “risk” in fiction, Foreman indicated, was the underlying principle; there was no drive to promote unknown authors or get away from the lengthy complexity of recent winners by Hilary Mantel, Eleanor Catton and Marlon James. What links the six authors is the liminality that enriches their writing What strikingly links the six they picked is the liminality and dual (or multiple) identity that enriches their writing; several have either changed countries – Levy and Szalay moving from South Africa and Canada respectively to the UK – or are second-generation immigrants: Moshfegh’s parents were Iranian and Croatian, Thien’s Chinese-Malaysian and Hong Kong Chinese.Their literary identities, too, tend to be shifting or bridge two forms. Beatty (below), the prize’s first African-American finalist, was originally a champion slam poet. Levy began her career as a playwright. Moshfegh (as she describes on page 11) is a literary writer having a go at a thriller. Macrae Burnet, after a Simenon-influenced debut set in contemporary France, has switched to a historical Scottish mystery. Szalay, spurned when he produced conventional novels, has at last been recognised for a book some reviewers saw as a short story collection.They may be feeling grateful – since the frontrunner hardly ever wins – that a clear-cut and hence accursed favourite has yet to emerge, though across the bookies Levy (5/2 at Paddy Power, 3/1 at Ladbrokes) is just ahead of Macrae Burnet (7/2 and 3/1) and Beatty (4/1 at both) with better value available for Thien at 6/1, Moshfegh at 7/1 and Szalay at 8/1.
