Helsinki may miss out on a striking new temple to modern and contemporary art after one of Finland’s three ruling parties vetoed any possibility of government funding for a Guggenheim museum on the capital’s waterfront.“There will be no state money for this venture,” Timo Soini, leader of the populist Finns party, said bluntly in a blogpost. “The matter will not even be raised during coalition budget talks. I hope this is now clear for our coalition partners.”Last month the economic affairs minister, Olli Rehn, suggested the government could provide €40m of the museums’s estimated €150m construction costs, arguing that a Helsinki outpost of the New York-based foundation would be good for tourism and business. But Soini rejected the idea outright, stressing that his party did not object to the museum itself, just to any public money being spent on it. Deploying a favourite Finnish metaphor, he said Rehn was “trying to get steam from a cold sauna”. The decision is the latest blow to the Guggenheim Helsinki project, whose initial plans met with widespread public opposition when they were unveiled in 2011 and were formally turned down by the city board the following year. After an international competition last year drew more than 1,700 entrants, the scheme seemed to be back on track. The winning design by the Paris architects Moreau Kusunoki was described as a “fragmented, non-hierarchical, horizontal campus of linked pavilions where art and society can meet and intermingle”.Proponents of the harbourside project, who include a consortium of Finnish travel, hotel and tourism businesses such as Finnair and the cruise lines Viking and Eckerö, say it would revitalise the capital’s cultural standing and economy.They point to the example of the Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim Bilbao, which has transformed the fortunes of the Spanish city since its opening in 1997, turning it into a thriving art and architectural destination.

It’s a shame the Finns party doesn’t see that.”Lahti said that with 20% private sector funding and the government and city splitting the rest, Guggenheim Helsinki would employ more than 100 people, create up to 400 more jobs indirectly, and be worth more than €40m a year to the local and national economy. “Unfortunately, it’s become very political,” Lahti said. “The Finns are a populist party, and many of their supporters are rural and older voters. If Guggenheim Helsinki had been mooted before the crisis, it would have been built by now.”He said the project’s supporters had not given up hope and would continue to seek alternative and more creative sources of financing. “We’re in this for the long haul. But there’s no doubt that if we can get some kind of state support, even if it’s not direct investment, we’d be more optimistic.”
