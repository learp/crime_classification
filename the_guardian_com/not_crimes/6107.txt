Walt Disney has shelved the release of its new film Beauty and the Beast in Malaysia after film censors said it could only be approved if cut to remove a “gay moment”.The country’s two main cinema chains said the movie, due to begin screening on Thursday, had been postponed indefinitely.Russia gives Beauty and the Beast adults-only rating over gay character Abdul Halim Abdul Hamid, film censorship board chairman, said he did not know why the film was postponed by Disney, as it had been approved by the board apart from a minor gay scene. He said scenes promoting homosexuality were forbidden and that the film was given a P13 rating, which requires parental guidance for children under 13 years of age.“We have approved it but there is a minor cut involving a gay moment. It is only one short scene but it is inappropriate because many children will be watching this movie,” Abdul Halim said.He said there was no appeal from Disney about the decision to cut the gay scene.Disney officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Star English-language newspaper cited the Disney company as saying the movie was postponed for an “internal review”.The film’s characters include manservant LeFou, who plays the sidekick to the story’s villain Gaston, and, according to director Bill Condon, “is confused about his sexuality.” Condon has described a brief scene as a “gay moment.”Russia last week approved the movie but banned children under 16 from watching it.Malaysia’s censors in 2010 loosened decades of restrictions on sexual and religious content in movies, but still kept a tight leash on tiny bikinis, kisses and passionate hugs.The new rules allow depiction of gay characters, but only if they show repentance or are portrayed in a negative light. Sodomy, even if consensual, is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and whipping in Malaysia.
