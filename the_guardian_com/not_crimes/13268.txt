5.56pm BST17:56Horn: "This was not a corporate decision"We will be ending our live blog here. Here is a quick summary of today’s hearing: Michael Horn is not an engineerThe Germans did it: the code in the software that created the defeat device was created by engineers in Germany, not in the US where Horn is the bossWhile the cars do not meet emissions standards, they are safe to drive Horn feels personally deceived and cannot sleep at night. His goal is to see that US dealers, consumers and employees through this crisis. Profitability of US dealers is his number one priority. Recall and fixes could take years. Horn outlined company’s five-step plan. The first step is investigation. Second, the company is focusing on reassuring the public that their cars are safe to drive. Third, VW is working to develop a fix for all the different groups of cars affected. “Each will require a different remedy, but these remedies can only be our first step for our customers,” Horn said. As fourth step, VW will examine its compliance, processes and standards to “make certain that something like this cannot happen again”. The final, fifth step, is to have regular and open communication with VW customers, dealers, employees and public. Three people have suspended so far“To my understanding this was not a corporate decision,” Horn said. “This was something individuals did.”Horn said that the reason this might have happened “was pressure in the system to get resolutions and also in conjunction with cost pressure as well”. He continued: “It’s…wrong if you put corporate profits before people. I think we have to get to the point that we put people first and not the pressure and corporate profits.”Updatedat 6.01pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.34pm BST17:34Here are Grundler’s prepared remarks. As we reported yesterday:  The EPA is also being taken to task to determine why the agency failed to detect the use of such software earlier.“VW manufactured and installed software in the electronic control module of these vehicles that sensed when the vehicle was being tested for compliance with EPA emissions standards,” Christopher Grundler, director of the EPA’s office of transportation and air quality, will testify on Thursday according to his prepared remarks. “Put simply, these cars contain software that turns off or significantly reduces the effectiveness of emissions controls when driving normally, and turns them on when the car is undergoing an emissions test.”Grundler will also inform the committee that on 25 September the EPA contacted all auto manufacturers to inform them that the agency is “stepping up our testing activities in response to VW’s alleged violations”.  In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, some of the biggest names in the car industry have denied cheating emissions tests.

He says his goal is to help dealers and consumers and his employees to get them through this crisis.Asked why did this happen, Horn says any answer will be speculation, but that he thinks it was “pressure in the system to get resolutions” and costs pressuers. “It is dead wrong if you put profits before people,” says Horn.

He completely rejects Horn’s explanation of the events. He tells Horn to tell those in Germany that this response in insufficient and is arrogant. He says when trying to figure out a way to meet emissions standards, VW engineers were stumped - “what is stumped?” asks Horn - and could not figure it out. Collins says he finds it difficult to believe that when the cars finally met the emissions standards, no one said: This is break through technology. Let’s patent this. Collins says that he categorically rejects the story of two rogue engineers adding a line of code into software with no one asking any questions. Either VW is incompetent, he says, or they are complicit in a “massive cover-up”.Graham Ruddick (@GrahamtRuddick)Congressman Chris Collins has just hammered Volkswagen for blaming rogue engineers.

Griffith says that a VW was the first new car his mother was able to afford and it was the car he learned to drive on. He also inherited a Super Beetle, which he says he still has. Speaking of disgruntled employees, he says: I am your consumer. I am a VW driver and I am disappointed. Griffith suggests that VW create a database where consumers can enter their car information and find out if their car is one of the affected cars.Amy Harder (@AmyAHarder)GOP Rep.

It read: I finally got the VW letter from Michael Horn yesterday explaining what they intend to do. Not very much, because I am guessing they are still working out what to do, so it was less than comforting. By the end of 2016 it should all be sorted out! To say I feel let down is an understatement. I have owned many VW diesel cars back in the UK and now living in California I thought long and hard whether I should get a Subaru or the VW. The VW won out. What a mistake that was. In my view, I don’t really see how they can gain the trust back. Even if they pay out compensation there is not a chance in hell I would buy a VW again. And from talking to fellow VW owners they feel the same way. The fact that Michael Horn knew about this a while back, (before I bought the car) makes it even worse. I would really like my money back, but I cannot see that happening …My son has taken to teasing me with “Should have bought the Subaru”.High class problems I know at a time when to world is going to shit … I guess I’m lucky I have a car.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.35pm BST16:35Dominic RusheHorn has a two pronged strategy: “I’m not an engineer” which gets him out of answering technical questions and “the Germans did it” which gets him personally off the hook. It’s a tough job but so far he’s pulling it off.   General Motors CEO Mary Barra Photograph: Carlo Allegri/REUTERSThis hearing is far less heated than the grilling Mary Barra, GM’s boss, received over their ignition switch recall.But that’s understandable considering that GM’s scandal killed people.US senators accuse GM chief Mary Barra of 'cover-up' over recall Updatedat 4.36pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.33pm BST16:33Jan Schakowsky, representative from Illinois, is asking Horn how long this will all take - asks for a timeline as to when cars might get fixed. Horn says this depends on a car: Generation 3 - fixes could come as early as next yearGeneration 2 - fix is still in development. Will not happen before mid-next yearGeneration 1 - Horn calls this the “biggest feat”. Says there is no date yetSo, these cars will be on the road for at least a year? asks Schakowsky. “More than a year, definitely,” said Horn. Schakowsky suggests that VW consider providing financial compensation to customers who want to return the cars, because they feel they have been deceived.

If you expected him to say “I am not an engineer” again, you’d not be the only one. Instead, Horn said: The defeat device is not a device, it’s a software code.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.24pm BST16:24Graham RuddickSo far, the most interesting part of Michael Horn’s testimony is the VW America boss admitting that it will take one to two years “minimum” to fix the affected cars in the US and that these vehicles will take 5 to 10 hours to fix each, with some needing a new tank fitted to them. This is likely to be the same across Europe. Horn claims that performance of the car will be relatively untouched, with miles per gallon the same, but any difference will leave company open to legal claims.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.23pm BST16:23Joe Kennedy, representative from Massachusetts, presses Horn to confirm if anyone has been suspended so far. Three people have been suspended, but Horn says he cannot disclose names. How much will this entire scandal costs? ask Kennedy. The costs depend on fines that VW will have to pay, cost of the fix and the compensation for consumers, says Horn. It will be a “whole lot of money, I am quite sure”.Horn also provides an important clarification, pointing out that those who are responsible for installing of these defeat devices do not work under him at VW America, but in different departments in Germany.

Barton says it’s hard to believe that this was not a “corporate decision”. Horn is sticking with the line that two rogue software engineers are responsible for this mess but Barton stuck with it eventually forcing Horn to admit that he too finds it “hard to believe”. “Personally I struggle as well,” he says. It does seem hard to swallow that no one else knew what was going on and the software engineers’ supervisors were wholly unaware.
