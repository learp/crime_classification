The world has still to see the final two Fifty Shades films, but the actor who stars in them, Jamie Dornan, has made no secret of his desire to free himself from the handcuffs.“We have done two movies back to back now, and I’m actually finished with it,” he said earlier this month. “I move on very fast in my mind. As much as from the outside people think you are synonymous with one character, but I’m very much like, ‘Right, that’s done’ and move on to the next project and worry about that character.”One fresh project appears to be playing Will Scarlett in a new movie about Robin Hood. According to Variety, the actor is in talks to join a starry Crusades take directed by Peaky Blinders’ Otto Bathurst, produced by Leonardo DiCaprio and starring Taron Egerton in the title role, with Jamie Foxx as Little John. The most recent Robin Hood movie was Ridley Scott’s 2010 hit starring Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett.
