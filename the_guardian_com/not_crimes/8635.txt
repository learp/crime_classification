Union leaders at the French energy company EDF have called for investment in Britain’s Hinkley Point nuclear power plant to be delayed for at least two years, warning that it represents a threat to the company’s future.Workers’ representatives say the sudden resignation of EDF finance director Thomas Piquemal has revealed that doubts over the feasibility of the controversial project go right to the top.“The resignation of such a high-ranking executive is pretty spectacular and shows the disagreement even at the highest levels,” Serge Gianorsi, trade union secretary for the Force Ouvrière union at EDF, told the Guardian.“Until now, managers have not expressed themselves publicly, but we have known for a long time that our position is shared by the majority of specialists inside and outside the company.”EDF's Hinkley Point nuclear nightmare adds to company's woes The union leader’s warning was backed up by Martin Young, an analyst with the investment bank RBC Capital Markets, who said proceeding with the Hinkley project would verge on “insanity”. “The European electricity industry faces unprecedented challenges and change. EDF is not immune from these challenges, and we believe needs to act to a greater degree than has been proposed. Against that backdrop, to proceed with Hinkley Point C at this juncture would be verging on insanity. M Piquemal’s resignation arguably suggests exactly that,” wrote Young in a briefing on the company.Gianorsi is the latest union leader to express deep misgivings about the Hinkley Point project, and to question the French government’s insistence that it go ahead.He added that if the French state, which owns roughly 85% of EDF, did not step back from the deal “there will be very heavy consequences for the future of the company and staff”.In January, EDF announced it was laying off 4,000 workers over the next two years. Last summer, the French government and EDF were forced to step in with a multibillion-euro package to rescue Areva, France’s designer and builder of nuclear reactors that had been hit by competition from foreign rivals and a plunge in demand for nuclear reactors following the Fukushima disaster.Marie-Claire Cailletaud, of the powerful CGT Energie union at EDF, agreed the UK project must be delayed.“We have already said it is urgent that this project be postponed because we feel the current state of EDF’s nuclear branch and the company’s financial situation make it dangerous to launch this right now,” Cailletaud told Europe 1 radio.“We know this view is shared at the top level of the company but that people don’t feel free to express themselves. So, I imagine this is a way for Mr Piquemal to show his disagreement.”On Monday, EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy said he wants to reach a final decision soon on investing in Britain’s Hinkley Point nuclear power plant after Piquemal’s resignation cast further doubt on the French energy company’s ability to fund the £18bn project.Levy said he regretted the “hastiness” of Piquemal’s departure. Piquemal resigned because he believed pursuing the world’s most expensive nuclear project could threaten the group, whose finances are already stretched by rising debt.The finance chief’s departure increased the feeling of crisis surrounding the Hinkley project, which is seen as vital for Britain to keep the lights on. If the plan were to collapse, it would be a serious blow to the UK government, which has offered generous guarantees to build two reactors at the site in Somerset.When asked if she could guarantee that there would be no additional costs for UK taxpayers, David Cameron’s official spokesperson pointed to the discussions that were under way with the French government.“I am not going to speculate about the resignation of one individual, that is a matter for EDF,” she said, and insisted that it was clear from François Hollande at the UK-France summit in Amiens last week that it had “the full support of the French government”. EDF’s battered share price fell 6.5% on Monday after Piquemal’s resignation was revealed over the weekend. The company’s shares have more than halved from €22 to €10 in the past year as concerns have mounted about its finances.Hinkley Point locaterIn a deal supported strongly by the chancellor, George Osborne, EDF joined forces with the Chinese utility CGN in October to construct the reactors. But many industry figures now believe the project is on the verge of collapse.EDF said in October it expected to take a final decision and start deploying engineers at Hinkley Point in November. But the company has still not signed a final contract as fears have mounted about its financial strength.In an emailed statement, Levy said: “With the support of its state shareholder, EDF confirms it is studying the investment in the two Hinkley Point reactors in the best financial conditions for the group, with the aim of announcing a final investment decision soon,” Reuters reported.On top of its large debts, EDF is grappling with a collapse in power prices, cost overruns on a nuclear project in France and upgrades costing tens of billions of euros on its domestic reactors. Piquemal’s resignation raises grave doubts about EDF’s ability to carry out the project, which the UK government is relying on to meet the country’s energy needs.Levy said last month a decision on Hinkley Point was “coming closer” as EDF reported a 68% plunge in annual profit and cut its dividend. The company said its net debt had increased by €3.2bn (£2.5bn) to €37.4bn.EDF union leaders say the state and company should wait until France’s first European Pressurized Reactors (EPR) go online at Flamanville around 2018 – six years late – to evaluate their safety and efficiency before agreeing to build them in Britain.“It will take at least two to three years to see how they work and to evaluate the technology and a minimum of security,” Gianorsi said.“We consider that EDF is not in a position, financially or industrially, to launch the Hinkley Point project.”
