Guardian contributor Rankin1 21 June 2016 2:43pmI have no idea - it's always different. I'm the least interested in the technical aspects of photography out of all the photographers I know. I love it when people say, "your camera is so good" - it's not my camera. It's literally not! Cameras just capture light - the rest is about how you find that light, see that light, create that light.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.45pm BST14:45Nigel Roberson asks:Whose work inspires you?  Guardian contributor Rankin1 21 June 2016 2:42pmI love lots and lots of different people's work, but I always go back to four: Bailey, Newton, Avedon and Penn. I think they just were more than photographers, and they were trying to capture what they saw in the world on film. When I look at their photographs, I get a feeling. How they framed it, what they did to get it, I don't care about - it's what they captured. Every time I look through their work I'm green with envy. They were my first loves. I could name you photographers now that I love but they're my peer group - it's always a bit weird. I love Juergen Teller, Nick Knight, David Sims... I really love photography. That's why I set up a magazine - we wanted to see people's work in print. We wanted to give people a platform. I haven't lost any of that. Still now when I get a shoot in for Hunger, I go wow! That's amazing! I get a buzz out of it. I'm not just addicted to photography because of work - I'm addicted to seeing it and consuming it. That's why I can't hate Instagram, because it's a great way of seeing work and being introduced to new work.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.44pm BST14:44djramsay asks:Do you ever use film or just digital? I was lucky to be photographed by you for your Snog project.  Guardian contributor Rankin1 21 June 2016 2:40pmI use digital most of the time, but I love film. I went through a period of thinking film was best... I don't care really. The good thing about film is that if you were doing a project where you didn't want to share it with anybody... everything in what you do in life can get boring, so changing it for a few days on a project is a good way of mixing it up. My natural instinct is to please people and want people involved, so at the moment I encourage collaboration, and so I use digital. But that doesn't mean I don't love film - I love everything about photography!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.43pm BST14:43Richard Spence asks:Which camera would you buy if you wanted to enter photojournalism with a paltry £500 in your back pocket. I know you prefer Canon, but I would try any suggestion you have.  Guardian contributor Rankin1 21 June 2016 2:38pmI would buy a Ricoh GR2.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.42pm BST14:42ilGatto asks:Who are the underrated talents across various art forms that more people should know about?  Guardian contributor Rankin1 21 June 2016 2:38pmThere's always underrated talents across any artform. Photography is a very strange creative process because I need so many people to create what I do every day. I'm the one who's feted, and put on a pedestal - but with that comes the criticism and the crap.Make-up artists are called artists for a reason. Everyone I work with, I'm privileged to get to work with some of the best people in the world, and they're all underrated. It's becoming less like that though, because they're now being recognised. But at the same time, I could take pictures on my own. That's why I think we get that extra validation.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.41pm BST14:41ilGatto asks:What is your favourite comic book?

Or because you’re Rankin, are they all keepers?  Guardian contributor Rankin1 21 June 2016 2:36pmA really good question. It's always at the end or the beginning. A lot of the time you're struggling to get the picture at the end – which is why it's at the end. They kind of come from nowhere, which is what's exciting about it. You might take 100 frames of someone, and generally it's from 90-100 you get the keepers.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.38pm BST14:38duncandunnit asks:Did Rankin come from a rather wealthy and privileged background? Was his daddy and mommy wealthy? Did he attend public school? From what I remember of my assistant days, Rankin entered overnight and had very good agent, and the first time I met him, 26-odd years ago, he was well off.  Guardian contributor Rankin1 21 June 2016 2:35pmI didn't go to public school. I've never called my parents mummy and daddy. They gave me money which helped me early in my career, but I worked my arse off - people will tell you I'm one of the hardest working people in the industry. Sorry to burst your bubble. I paid my dad back, with a lot of interest. My dad was Scottish, know what I mean? Money was very serious in my house!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.36pm BST14:36I like that people think I look like James Corden: he's really funny and rather handsomeNecesseter asks:How often do you get mistaken for James Corden?  Guardian contributor Rankin1 21 June 2016 2:34pmI don't, because he's a lot younger than me, but when I photographed him, we joked about how many people had said that we look like each other. Which I take as a compliment, because he's really funny, and rather handsome.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.35pm BST14:35exstalbans asks: If you typically earn £100,000 for a photo shoot, do you think your privileged lifestyle compromises your work? Do you think you are worth £100,000 for a shoot?  Guardian contributor Rankin1 21 June 2016 2:33pmI don't get paid £100,000 - that's not to say I never have - but typically I get paid between nothing and what someone thinks I'm worth. I think it's bizarre they pay me that much - how can anyone be worth that much? But Ive worked for nothing, time and time again, and hopefully that balances itself out over time. That's not to say I'm not successful - I am both commercially and financially - and I don't take that for granted. I love what I do and would do it for nothing. Did I mention I would do it for nothing? When you get paid that much money it's incomprehensible. If anyone says, I did 100 grand's worth of work there, they're mad. But when you're giving someone something that helps them make 20 million pounds, they're going to think you're worth that. The balances hopefully level off. I tend not to think about it. If you start to think about it, you go a little crazy. It would make me nervous. You're not being paid to be nervous - you're paid to have an opinion. And a lot of what that is is me being very honest with brands or whoever I'm working for.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.33pm BST14:33jamesehanson asks:What’s the best advice you were given when you were starting?

Or do you use gossip, reputation, etc to inform your approach?  Guardian contributor Rankin1 21 June 2016 2:31pmThat's one of the best questions. I've not been asked it very often. I really try to not ever believe anything I've read or seen or heard when I go into a photoshoot. You can be completely swayed by that stuff. You can do your research, but you have to let it go, and base it on your empirical view of the person, because part of being a portrait photographer is being able to judge what's going on in front of you, look in someone's eyes and see if they're telling you the truth. That's my job - trying to do that, and seeing their imperfections and insecurities and all the things that make them a multilayered human being, I'm trying to capture an aspect or part of that. I have to trust my instincts to do that, because if I trusted what people said, I would take shit pictures. What you see in Planet Selfie is the nice lighting that doesn't let you see what the person is about. You see a two dimensional recording of someone you want to see. My job is to dig deeper, what are you insecurities, and make people feel comfortable to show the most honest side of themselves. I'm trying to find the honesty in the dishonesty of photography.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.31pm BST14:31Optimismisachoice asks:Do you have personal projects?
