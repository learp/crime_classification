Where is the beer capital of Britain? It is a debate as old brewing itself (probably) and one that repeatedly flares up online, despite beer drinkers knowing that, ultimately, it is a matter of subjective taste. There can be no definitive answer.Unless that is, you are the University of Sheffield. In a new report, provocatively titled, The World’s Best Beer City, it asserts that the Sheffield City Region (we’ll come back to that) is, variously, “the real ale capital of the world”, the possible birthplace of UK craft beer and an area of unique brewing vitality. What is more, these claims are backed-up by hard statistics. Or data which, on closer inspection, should be categorised a bit of fun. The main thrust of Sheffield’s triumphalism is that Sheffield City Region, which includes South Yorkshire and bits of Derbyshire, has 3.5 times as many breweries per capita as Greater London. Even before we get into how big or well-established (or good) those breweries are, how can you fairly compare a partly rural region of 1.8 million people with a metropolis of 8.5 million? And why were those geographic areas of such wildly differing sizes chosen? Why not compare – equally arbitrarily, if less flatteringly – an area in a five mile radius around Bermondsey, which takes in Hackney and Brixton (circa 25 breweries), with the city of Sheffield (23)?Naming Sheffield the real ale capital of the world, based on the number of cask beers available in the city on a chosen day, is equally spurious. The Camra survey referenced does not include, among others, Manchester or London. And, anyway, don’t we leave such hyperbole to the Americans? Much like their baseball World Series, no one else in the world cares about real ale. The title is meaningless. As is Sheffield’s claim to be the birthplace of UK craft beer. This is based on the fact that, in 2005, Thornbridge (in, erm, Derbyshire) was one of the first UK breweries – note, not the first – to start producing craft beer, whilst employing Martin Dickie, future co-owner of BrewDog. Who, as they never tire of telling us, are rulers of the craft beer universe. Or something.None of this is to do Sheffield down. The main thrust of the report is perfectly reasonable. With its 57 breweries (31 opened in the last five years, five launched in 2016), the Sheffield beer scene is evidently vibrant and, yet, not particularly well known nationally. The report’s author, Pete Brown, maintains that Sheffield hides its beer light under a bushel and fails to properly promote itself to visitors. “Having pioneered the beer revolution, Sheffield is in danger of being eclipsed, especially in the realm of craft beer,” he says. The suggestion that Sheffield’s brewers should jointly fund a bottling plant in order to export their beer beyond South Yorkshire, and spread the word, is sensible. The report suggests that this is one way to turn Sheffield into a global beer destination.That idea of promoting Sheffield as an exceptional city for a pub crawl, is another argument that could run and run. According to Sheffield’s Camra group, “beer tourism” is already worth more to the city than the World Snooker Championships at the Crucible. Indisputably, there are some tremendous places to drink in the city (Sheffield Tap, Beer House, Bath Hotel, Rutland Arms, Shakespeare’s), several A1 breweries (Exit 33, Abbeydale), with more coming online all the time (North Union, Sentinel, Little Critters). However, having visited Sheffield periodically and having toured Britain’s best beer cities for this Guardian series, would Sheffield top my list for a return visit? Probably not. As a beer fan, when visiting a city for the day, you want to pack in as much quality, variety and local beer, as conveniently as possible. For that I would first recommend Newcastle, Bermondsey, Leeds and Liverpool, all of which have tight clusters of pubs that go big on regional beers.My No.1 choice, though, would have to be Manchester. From Piccadilly Station I could plot you two pub separate pub crawls: Piccadilly Tap, Port Street, Soup Kitchen, Common, the Smithfield, the Angel, Marble Arch or, alternatively, the Molly House, Joshua Brooks, Font, Knott Bar, CASK, the Brink, Café Beermoth. In each case, you can hop from pub to pub in a few minutes and in each drink, not just a wealth of north-west beers, but many made in central Manchester itself, by a, still, rapidly expanding group of superlative craft beer producers such as Cloudwater, Squawk, Track, First Chop, Blackjack, Runaway.But then I would say that, wouldn’t I? I’m from Manchester. We all have an agenda.
