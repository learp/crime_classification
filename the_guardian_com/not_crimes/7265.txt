As celebrity revelations go, it’s one of the more unusual: as a boy, Chris Packham would decant tadpoles on to a special spoon and eat them.The naturalist and Springwatch presenter reveals his tadpolephagy in his new memoir, Fingers in the Sparkle Jar, and he’s not sorry either. They are gritty and tricky to chew, Packham reports, comparing them to watery semolina with a bit more “thrashing” under the tongue.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Good enough to eat?

This could never have arisen from experiencing nature via books or television but “only from that heart that fluttered, as my throat was tickled, softly, by simple beauty at that essential point in my own metamorphosis”.Packham has previously spoken of the need for children to “be stung, slimed, slithered on and scratched”. Although the natural drama delivered by programmes such as Springwatch is entertaining, it is no substitute for direct, sensory encounters.Wildlife is often seen as either a health risk or too rare for children to mess with. But Packham and other conservationists increasingly argue that only by allowing children to mess with nature will they care for it in the future.

She’s superbly gentle with, say, ladybirds but does not yet understand their complex requirements and may have inadvertently killed as many minibeasts as Packham did as a boy.But what Packham’s tadpole-tasting reveals is the importance of parents not supervising a child’s every moment in nature. Parent-led pond-dipping is perfectly pleasant but we need to enable children to have their own private moments with wild creatures as well. We, too, are wild things, after all.
