Elvis & Nixon review: Michael Shannon resurrects the King Richard M Nixon is like Macbeth or Iago: there are as many possible versions of him as there are interesting actors to play him. I’m not quite ready to add Kevin Spacey’s portrayal to the roster of Top Tricky Dickies just yet – Elvis & Nixon is perhaps too slight a movie – but that’s because the gallery of great Nixons already teems with big thespians making big noises in the Oval Office at 3am, a large scotch near at hand as the end draws inexorably nigh.Nixon is the crucial absence in the definitive Nixon movie, All The President’s Men, the great white whale for Woodward and Bernstein’s Ahab to harpoon with headlines. But in the decades since his fall in 1974, that yawning emptiness – the word is apposite to the man, too – was filled by a succession of great actors who, simply by watching the news all their lives, had come to their own diverse conceptions of the man, and how to tackle him: sweaty, neurotic Anthony Hopkins in Oliver Stone’s Nixon; drunken, vengeful Philip Baker Hall in Robert Altman’s Secret Honor; and smooth manipulator Frank Langella in Frost/Nixon.

For The Longest Yard (1974), director Robert Aldrich told Eddie Albert to adorn his prison warden with unmistakable Nixonisms. Bob Gunton’s Warden Norton in The Shawshank Redemption draws deeply on Gunton’s own long-touring Nixon one-man show (he also played Nixon in contemporary reenactments of the Watergate tapes for ABC News), and while watching Renny Harlin’s disposable 1988 horror movie Prison, I immediately thought its governor, Lane Smith, would be a perfect Nixon. Imagine my delight when I discovered him slaying the role in the 1989 TV adaptation of The Final Days, effortlessly capturing the unshaven, vindictive Trickster as he faced his götterdämmerung.But might I pipe up in favour of a particular favourite? Dan Hedaya’s Nixon in Dick, a sure-footed Watergate parody highlighting the comedic potential of the scandal, is a comic masterpiece, all growls (“Shuddap, Checkers, goddammit!”), hooded eyes and bulging neck veins, mixing rage and drunken self-pity with surprising sweetness. To see him in the final shot, ruefully acknowledging from his departing helicopter the two idiot teenage girls who, in this version of the scandal, have accidentally toppled him is to wonder what might have been had Richard M Nixon just been a little nicer to everyone.
