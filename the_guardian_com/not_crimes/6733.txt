A black-faced woodpecker had come to ground on a white-out of a morning. Frost had played peculiar tricks with its colours, highlighting the dark markings on its head, suppressing the muted shades on its body.Just as it had cast a glaze over the meadow, the frost seemed to have bleached out the grass-green tones that gave the bird its name. The green woodpecker pecked at the frozen soil, a peck-and-pause routine that lasted for some minutes. An ant-licker in summer, what was it finding now?In the bright white landscape of fields and lakes, strong colours and sudden movements sang out. Binoculars swung towards a glowing orb on the far side of the big lake. It was as if a zebra-crossing beacon had parked in the reeds. The image resolved into a beach ball of lurid yellow, lodged among the stems.At once, a shape popped up from the water much closer to. I caught sight of a grebe, slim and angular, great but not crested, but then it was under again.The ripples from its dive had barely smoothed out when a cluster of bubbles appeared at the surface five metres or so to the left. Five metres more and another cloud of froth came up.I was playing Guess the Grebe, anticipating exactly where the next eruption of air would happen. I guessed right just once, before the swimming bird doubled back and surfaced at the spot where it had dived.Here was a hunter with no frills attached. The softening springtime orangey-brown ruff of feathers around its neck and dainty little ear tufts were no more.Stripped bare in winter of its delicate finery, the grebe took on a different character. This was a creature of a monochrome world, drawn in charcoal, its lighter patches smudged, dark areas fuzzy. A tail of black dribbled down from its jet-black eye to the one feature that dominated the bird. Sharply defined, it was a deadly sharp beak of enormous proportions.A line of Shakespeare filled my head: “Is this a dagger I see before me?”
