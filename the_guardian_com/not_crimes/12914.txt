The former Queensland National party senator Ron Boswell made a gaffe-riddled appearance on Q&A on Monday as the Coalition’s only representative, three weeks into the Abbott government’s boycott of the ABC talk show.Boswell, the one-time “father of the Senate” who retired from politics last year, spoke out against the pope’s encyclical on the environment, despite admitting he had not read it.Pope Francis’s environmental message brings thousands on to streets in Rome Boswell, 74, also mistakenly claimed Australia accepted more refugees than any other country, prompting corrections from his fellow panellist, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and host Virginia Trioli, standing in for Tony Jones.His faltering appearance came amid a boycott by federal government ministers over the ABC’s decision to allow Zaky Mallah, once jailed for threatening an Asio officer, to question government MP Steve Ciobo from the Q&A audience last month.Q&A checked Zaky Mallah's background but missed tweets – government report Q&A producers made their own mistake during the program broadcast from Brisbane on Monday, misspelling the Queensland premier’s first and last names in a caption that read “Annastasia Palasaczuk”.Boswell said that “as a practising Catholic … I was somewhat concerned about the pope’s statement” last month calling for more action on climate change because he said it risked condemning 300 million Indians to poverty by denying them access to cheap coal-fired electricity.Asked by Brisbane Catholic archbishop Mark Coleridge if he had read Pope Francis’s encyclical, Boswell admitted he had only seen a “three minutes” long television segment on it.“But what immediately struck me is there is 300 million living in India … living without a light, living in terrible circumstances,” Boswell said. “And would this statement prevent coalmining that would allow them to industrialise, allow them to have somewhere to go?”Coleridge said the pope had not “sort of excommunicate[d] coalminers”.Boswell replied: “I only saw this for three minutes and I should not make this statement, but I’m forced into it … because I was disappointed and if I thought if I have an opportunity, I have to challenge what was in this statement.”He said it was “within [the pope’s] portfolio” to make a statement on the environment.“But making a statement that would preclude people using the use of cheaper power – whether it be hydro or whether it be coal – and preventing them from having a better standard of living, I just found it very hard to accept.”Coleridge, who hailed the encyclical as a “breakthrough document”, said: “The question I think is can we not afford to explore renewables in a more sophisticated way.The Q&A scandal is very, very serious. We know because we've been told so | Gay Alcorn “I hope we’re doing it here in Queensland because if we don’t explore renewables in this imaginative and cutting-edge way, the point may come eventually, in the longer term that we’re not renewable.”Boswell declined to comment on the credibility of federal opposition leader Bill Shorten on immigration issues in light of the ALP’s endorsement of boat towbacks at last weekend’s party conference, but said: “We can’t open the door to everyone. We take more refugees than I think any other country.”Palaszczuk, who said she supported the towback policy, interjected: “No we don’t.”Boswell replied: “We certainly take more refugees than maybe Canada … ” Trioli intervened: “There are many other countries that take many more than us.”Coleridge said while Labor’s credibility on asylum seekers was damaged, “there is a much larger issue I think of moral failure on both sides of politics”. “It puzzles me that systematically cruel policies are devised and implemented by men and women in politics who are not themselves cruel,” he said. “It’s one of the mysteries of public life in Australia at this time.”Colerdige said the policies – particularly conditions in the Nauru and Manus Island detention centres – were an “international disgrace”.The number of asylum seekers coming to Australia was “minuscule” in comparison with countries such as Italy, and “the least we could do is process them onshore”, he said.
