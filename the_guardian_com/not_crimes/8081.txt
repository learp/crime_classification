But my heart belongs to music and I want to concentrate 100% on making my next album and getting back to performing.” Flack also confirmed that she will not be returning to the show this year.“I have had a brilliant time working on The X Factor over the last few years, and hosting the main show was just fantastic, I made some amazing friends,” she said. “I’m looking forward to carrying on working with the team over at ITV.”As well as hosting The X Factor, Caroline previously hosted The Xtra Factor for three years from 2011 until 2013.“We thank Caroline and Olly for all their hard work on The X Factor and the contribution that they’ve made over the past few years,” said Peter Davey, commissioning editor at ITV entertainment. “We look forward to working with Caroline again soon and wish Olly the very best as he returns to concentrate on his music career.”There has been speculation that O’Leary may return to host this year’s X Factor, the last under the current deal that Cowell has with ITV.One Direction star Louis Tomlinson is said to be in the running to replace Grimshaw, as is former judge Louis Walsh.
