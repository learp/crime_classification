Forgive me: I’ve been tempted to make useof dissonance in an effort to resonate;I’ve walked all over my principlesin day-glo flip-flops;I’ve attempted to schmooze when I shouldhave been rough and abusive;In the locked bathroom, I’ve allowed my idto goose my poor ego, scarring it mentally;I’ve papered over the cracks with more cracksto obtain a “crack effect”; I’ve admired the cutof my own jib, juddering stiff on a wester;I’ve planted weeds in other people’sgardens on purpose; I’ve pretended my eyesare windows and got drunkin a room behind them; I’ve pretended everything’s just terribly droll and awful.• From Meanwhile, Trees (Bloodaxe, £9.95) by Mark Waldron.
