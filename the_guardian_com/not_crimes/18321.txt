Speaking during a show in California last month, West said: “The album I listen to the most this year is Frank Ocean’s album. I’ll tell you this right now, if his album is not nominated in no [sic] categories, I’m not showing up to the Grammys. As artists, we’ve got to come together to fight the bullshit.”While West has eight nominations, he’s not included in major categories, such as record, song and album of the year. His album The Life of Pablo is only featured in rap-specific categories.At the 2016 awards, Taylor Swift picked up album of the year while Kendrick Lamar won five prizes.The 2017 ceremony will be hosted by James Corden and take place on 12 February.Nominations in full: Record of the yearHello - AdeleFormation - Beyoncé7 Years - Lukas GrahamWork - RihannaStressed Out - Twenty One PilotsAlbum of the year25 - AdeleLemonade - BeyoncéPurpose - Justin BieberViews - DrakeSailor’s Guide to Earth - Sturgill SimpsonSong of the yearFormation - BeyoncéHello - AdeleI Took A Pill In Ibiza - Mike PosnerLove Yourself - Justin Bieber7 Years - Lukas GrahamBest new artistKelsea BalleriniThe ChainsmokersChance the RapperMaren MorrisAnderson PaakBest pop solo performanceHello - Adele Hold Up - BeyoncéLove Yourself - Justin BieberPiece By Piece (Idol Version) - Kelly ClarksonDangerous Woman - Ariana GrandeBest pop duo/group performanceCloser - The Chainsmokers featuring Halsey7 Years - Lukas GrahamWork - Rihanna Cheap Thrills - Sia featuring Sean PaulStressed Out - Twenty One PilotsBest pop vocal albumAdele - 25Justin Bieber - PurposeAriana Grande - Dangerous Woman Demi Lovato - ConfidentSia - This Is ActingBest dance recordingBob Moses - Tearing Me UpThe Chainsmokers - Don’t Let Me Down Flume - Never Be Like You Riton - Rinse and Repeat Sofi Tukker - DrinkeeBest dance/electronic albumSkin - Flume Electronica 1: The Time Machine - Jean-Michel JarreEpoch - TychoBarbara, Barbara, We Face A Shining Future - Underworld Best rock performanceAlabama Shakes - Joe (Live from Austin City Limits)Beyoncé featuring Jack White - Don’t Hurt Yourself David Bowie - Blackstar Disturbed - The Sound of Silence (Live on Conan)Twenty One Pilots - Heathens Best metal performanceBaroness - Shock Me Silvera - GojiraKorn - Rotting In VainMegadeth - Dystopia Periphery - The Price is Wrong Best rock songBlackstar - David Bowie Burn the Witch - RadioheadHardwired - Metallica Heathens - Twenty One Pilots My Name Is Human - Highly SuspectBest rock albumBlink 182 - California Cage the Elephant - Tell Me I’m PrettyGorjira - MagmaPanic!
