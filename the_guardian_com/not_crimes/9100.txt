A new Google doodle marks the birthday of the noted British ornithologist William John Swainson, a fellow of the Royal Society who was known for the quality of his illustrations.While he did not always see eye-to-eye with his contemporaries, records kept by the society show that he was described as being a "gentleman very zealous in â€¦ various scientific pursuits, particularly in natural history, having travelled in South America for the purpose of investigating the productions of that continent".Swainson, born 224 years ago on 8 October, was also described as a "very talented artist, [who] became the first person in Britain to publish works of natural history (on birds and shells) illustrated by lithographs," in a 2001 article by David Knight entitled High Church Science: William Swainson and William Kirby, and published in the journal Paradigm.He later travelled in New Zealand and Australia. During his time in the latter, he was hit by some of the most strident criticism aimed at him by contemporaries.The Australian National Botanic Gardens (ANBG) noted that much of his work as a botanist - not his usual discipline - was never published by the Royal Society of Tasmania.Another botanist William Hooker wrote of Swainson's attempts to define species there: "In my life I think I never read such a series of trash and nonsense. There is a man who left this country with the character of a first rate naturalist (though with many eccentricities) and of a very first-rate Natural History artist and he goes to Australia and takes up the subject of Botany, of which he is as ignorant as a goose."The ANBG noted that another Joseph Maiden described Swainson's efforts as "an exhibition of reckless species-making that, as far as I know stands unparalleled in the annals of botanical literature".
