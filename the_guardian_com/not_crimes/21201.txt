Congratulations to Leonardo DiCaprio for his win, then. The Revenant was great. He ate a raw fish, he slept in a horse; all in all, it was a performance worthy of an Oscar. Still, we all know the reason he won was a nod to Titanic, which is why Vetements – the newish, very cultish French brand beloved by Kanye, which does an excellent line in sexy, gnarly oversized womenswear – mocked up their “homage hoodie” emblazoned with that film’s stars like some sort of election merch.  #FTW: Vetements Black Oversized Titanic Hooded T-Shirt.It’s been out all season, but yesterday resurfaced on the frow at Versace and earlier, at New York fashion week, on transgender model Hari Nef. The good news is that while it is sold out everywhere, it does appear to be in-stock at online shop, SSense. Incidentally, Vetements will be showing at Paris fashion week on Thursday night. DiCaprio has already won, of course, but it’s nice to keep the dream alive.
