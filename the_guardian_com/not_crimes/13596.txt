The Bataclan, the Paris music venue where 90 people were killed in November’s terrorist attacks, will reopen in the autumn, with Pete Doherty playing one of its first shows.The venue, a landmark on the Paris music scene, has been closed since three terrorists with Kalashnikovs burst in and opened fire on the crowd of 1,500 people during a gig by the US band Eagles of Death Metal on 13 November 2015. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the massacre, one of a series of attacks on Paris that night. In a statement released on Twitter, the Bataclan management said the exact date for the venue to reopen was not yet set, but announced a series of bands who would play there from next autumn.British rocker Pete Doherty is scheduled to play at the venue on 16 November, three days after the one-year anniversary of the attacks. The Senegalese star Youssou N’Dour and his Super Etoile de Dakar band will play a few days later, the managers said in a statement.
