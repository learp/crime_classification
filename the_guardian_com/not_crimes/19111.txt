Christine Langan, head of BBC Films, is to step down from an influential post at the heart of the British film establishment to become CEO of Baby Cow, the production outfit established by Steve Coogan and Henry Normal, it has been reported. Normal, the previous CEO, left the company in April, saying he wanted “to take a long overdue break from TV and film production”.

Her tenure as head of BBC Films saw multiple award-winning films go into production, including My Week With Marilyn, An Education, and – in collaboration with Baby Cow – Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa.Baby Cow was set up in 1999 by Coogan and Normal, and initially concentrated on TV, before the company moved into film in 2001 with The Parole Officer and the Michael Winterbottom-directed 24 Hour Party People, in both of which Coogan had the lead role. Another Coogan vehicle, Philomena, became an awards magnet and international commercial success in 2013. BBC Worldwide bought a 25% stake in the company in 2008, a shareholding which has increased to 73%.The BBC have yet to officially confirm the story, stating that Baby Cow and BBC Worldwide have yet to complete their search for a new CEO for the business.” However, according to Screen, an exit timetable is yet to be worked out, but the suggestion is that Langan may leave the BBC post in October.
