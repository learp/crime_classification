This book is HILARIOUS and it really makes you feel so sorry for Nathalia!!!I would give this book 5 stars!I love this book so much! In Nathalia’s dad’s world, driving a van full of junk into a tree and setting it on fire isn’t weird but when Nathalia’s birthday comes up and her dad is in charge of the party things could go horribly wrong...I am not a fan of comedy so I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I would recommend this book for people who like comedy (obviously) but I think that you should try it; even if, like me, you’re not a comedy fan, you might be surprised. Once I started reading it I couldn’t put it down! I really enjoyed reading the book and it made me laugh lots.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
