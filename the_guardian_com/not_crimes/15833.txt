I just read Tim Barlow’s letter about the lack of cinemas in Chester (Letters, 2 September). We’ll gladly send him a copy of our new programme of films being shown by Chester Film Society, which was established in the city way back in 1970 and has offered a selective season of world cinema and arthouse movies ever since. As a community cinema we can’t boast the really big screens, but we offer an intimate surrounding to watch films with an appreciative and discerning audience. This season starts on 13 September with the Estonian anti-war film Tangerines, then we follow up with the Lily Tomlin film Grandma. Other highlights in our 19-film programme include the Turkish film Mustang and the sumptuous Tale of Tales. And we round off our season next April with Love and Friendship. All this and an international film festival in March, too. Since the last city cinema in Chester closed in 2013, Chester Film Society has been the only permanent cinema offering in the city.Rachel CrossSecretary, Chester Film Society• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
