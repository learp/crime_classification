At 2am the night her husband died, Diane Rehm began writing what would turn into a memoir of her life as a widow.The radio host had been trying, unsuccessfully, to sleep fully dressed on two chairs next to his bed. “I remember getting up and looking at my watch and then setting up my iPad and just starting to type,” says Rehm, who at 79 has been the voice of NPR’s The Diane Rehm Show for more than 30 years. “I don’t even remember what I wrote – just what I was experiencing being in the room with my husband of all those years, who was passing from one life into another.”On My Own is a series of short essays spanning the year after John Rehm’s death in June 2014. John was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2005, and moved into an assisted living facility in 2012. After losing nearly all his mobility, he decided to refuse food, water, and medication to voluntarily end his life – a process that took 10 days, and a decision that pushed Rehm herself into advocacy work for the right-to-die movement. Rehm, who plans to leave her show after the 2016 election, was criticized by NPR for overstepping journalistic objectivity by attending fundraising events for a right-to-die group. This backlash, she says, “has given me even a greater conviction that my right to speak out on this should not be inhibited”.Some of the chapters in On My Own were written in real time (“Last night, for the first time since John died, I invited a few friends in my building for dinner”) while others are letters addressed to John, whom she calls by his nickname Scoop. Rehm writes honestly about their 50-year relationship, which the two had earlier discussed in a book called Toward Commitment: A Dialogue about Marriage. Though there were “times of joy”, there were also “years of hostility … endless periods of silence … physical and emotional distance between us”, she writes, remarking on how her gregarious nature clashed with his introversion: “John often said he’d prefer to have lunch with the New Yorker rather than with any human being he knew. I realised that included me.”Days before he died, John told her that he had “deliberately emotionally abused her during the marriage”, something he had never before admitted. This new level of honesty gave her the courage to be so open, she says.Rehm writes about small, personal moments – sitting with John and reading haiku to him, moving to the center of the bed after years of sleeping only on “her side” —and hard decisions like the “capital-G Guilt” of putting him in an assisted-care facility. “He would never have wanted me to give up my career, but there was my own sense of ‘Diane, is it your responsibility to give up and stay home?’, even when I knew I couldn’t have done it without extreme resentment indeed and anger,” she says. She discusses the challenges of taking financial responsibility, being far from her children, the definition of grief. On My Own will invite comparisons to Joan Didion’s own memoir of loss, The Year of Magical Thinking. Rehm, who had interviewed Didion shortly after The Year of Magical Thinking was published, recalls Didion being frail and saying that she “felt out of her mind”, but says that she herself is “too much of a rational speaker to have thought in those terms”.“I think the thing that most surprised me was that I could rationally deal with each and every one of these things,” says Rehm. “I did not become overwhelmed to the point of not being able to function. I have not fallen down on the floor crying or moaning or saying, ‘I can’t do this any more.’”Rehm says she still talks to John every day, and can hear him asking, ‘Diane, do you have to do it all? Can’t you take out some of it?’ But she has to do it all, she says, because her experience with him has given her a new purpose. She’s going on a book tour and, after leaving the show, will help raise money for the station as well as be more involved in the right-to-die movement. She and John had often discussed end-of-life care, but “too many of us are afraid to speak about death and dying and therefore when the time comes, the people who are left behind don’t know what to do”.And so, she says, “when the time comes, I will continue to talk about John’s experience and how he had to suffer through 10 days of agony, about my own experience watching him die, and I will speak out about the right to die”.
