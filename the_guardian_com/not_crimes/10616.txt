The ninth annual Record Store Day will be held on Saturday 16 April, a day where independent music retailers and recording artists are celebrated. In previous years you have shared your Record Store Day experiences with us and, if you are taking part again this year, we’d like to see your photos and hear about your vinyl and CD bargains. What rare releases are you interested in getting your hands on this year?

Is there a particular record you discovered or a live event that you were lucky enough to witness? What is your local record shop like and what activities are planned for this year? Whether you are looking ahead to this year’s event or have fond memories of past Record Store Days, share your photos and stories with us. We’ll feature some of them on the site.
