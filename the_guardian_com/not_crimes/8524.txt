I always wait until everyone has left our student house to tiptoe to the shower. You probably wonder why I wake up so early or late. Or why I do the laundry so often, and never invite anyone into my room. It is because I live in shame.I have wet my bed every single night for the past 23 years. I use adult diapers, but sometimes even those are not enough to keep everything dry. When I wash, I use different shower gels each time, because the same smell only reminds me of my morning trauma.I was diagnosed with nocturnal enuresis at 16. Until then, each specialist told my parents simply to wait it out, that the bed-wetting would end one day. My parents found it a challenge, but I was the one who was giving up on having a normal life.At 17, I became suicidal. I could see a life of loneliness ahead of me. No one will ever want to share a bed with me. No one will love me. I will have no sex or intimacy with anyone. I can never have children. How can a bed-wetting adult – a baby adult – ever have a baby of her own? How can I ever bring a child into this life knowing that the chance of them also being a bed-wetter is higher than 40%?Bed-wetting comes with low self-esteem and no hope. It also comes with exhaustion. Mentally and physically, I am drained all the time. Next month I will see yet another specialist, but my hopes are not high. I dream of waking up dry, and slipping out of my room and saying good morning to you. But for now, I can’t. I am ashamed.• Tell us what you’re really thinking at mind@theguardian.com
