Name: Hull.Age: First mentioned in 1193.Full name: Kingston upon Hull.Twinned with: Freetown, Sierra Leone.Appearance: Fixed dot on a map of the British Isles, next to a cloud.Is that all? Of course not. Sometimes there will be rain coming out of the cloud.What about a sun? Theoretically, that could happen, too.

It came and went – a bit like Brigadoon – much to the irritation of locals.Why the change? It’s part of BBC director general Tony Hall’s overall plan to make the Beeb “unashamedly Hull-centric in 2017”.Wow. How does a mid-size English city earn such odd flattery? It has to be named the UK City of Culture for 2017.That sounds like a lot of paperwork for a spot on some stupid map. Oh, but there is much, much more. The title also comes with a £32m budget and a year’s worth of cultural attractions.Like what? Hull will play host to the 2017 Turner Prize. A new Richard Bean play, The Hypocrite, will premiere at Hull Truck theatre. The expensively refurbished Ferens art gallery will open its doors.

The city has a long and rich artistic history. The Spiders from Mars – Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Woody Woodmansey – are local boys. The poet Philip Larkin spent most of his life in Hull. Andrew Marvell grew up there, and was once its MP.So is everybody in Hull wholly and unironically committed to this government-sponsored renaissance? Perhaps not everybody.

If you drilled from Hull straight through the centre of the Earth, you’d come out in Nugget Point, New Zealand.Do say: “Hull isn’t just a city of culture; it’s a cultural community.”Don’t say: “Hull is other people.”• This article was amended on 26 September 2016.
