Twenty protesters have targeted the headquarters of energy company Cuadrilla by blockading it with their bodies. There are two people inside the building in Lichfield, Staffordshire, and they are hanging banners off it saying "Reclaim the Power" and "Power to the People". The company, which has a license for hydraulic fracturing or fracking to extract gas from shale, issued a statement saying: "Three protesters have forced their way into our offices. The police are in attendance and are dealing with this matter. A small number of protesters are outside the building. Our office remains open."Six campaigners also superglued themselves on Monday morning to the London headquarters of Bell Pottinger, the PR company employed by Cuadrilla, raising a banner above the entrance calling the firm "fracking liars".Six activists superglue themselves to Bell Pottinger HQ in Holborn in anti-fracking protest.
