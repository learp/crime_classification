2.17pm BST14:17And that's all …Thank you to Natasha for coming to the Guardian and for everyone who asked questions.  Guardian contributor NatashaKhan 29 June 2016 2:09pmThank you to everyone for taking the time to submit these wonderful questions. I'm really thankful for all your support and really excited the album is coming out so soon. It's really nice to have the opportunity to discuss other subjects outside of music with you as well. Sending you loads of love!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.15pm BST14:15Nitzan Pincu asks:I saw you live last month at the Manchester Cathedral – truly unforgettable. I was wondering about the cover to the Carpenters song you perform live, We’ve only Just Begun. How and why did you choose this song and how do you feel it relates to the context of The Bride?  Guardian contributor NatashaKhan 29 June 2016 2:07pmI chose that song because it's a song I've loved since childhood, and the story of Karen Carpenter is such a beautiful and tragic tale. And her voice has always really resonated with me. I've been a fan of that song since I was a kid, and realised around the time of creating The Bride show, I realised that song is about a newly wed couple and their journey into living a life together. Exploring those things with a sad chord structure would hint at her life and The Bride's life - it just felt like the right one to do.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.12pm BST14:12wraith lover asks:Hello darling Natasha. Love the album. Have you started work on a feature length [version], or are you still toying with the idea? Do you think it will just be like a long music video to accompany the songs from the album or a more traditional movie, with dialogue, etc?  Guardian contributor NatashaKhan 29 June 2016 2:05pmHello darling. Thanks for your question. Yes I am currently writing the novella version of The Bride, which I then hope can be adapted for a screenplay, and yes it will be a proper film with dialogue, not so much like a music video. I do hope it can cross some boundaries with good mainstream film storytelling, with something more avant-garde.

I’m personally devastated by the recent Leave vote, and think it will leave a stain in history on our nation. As a British person with Pakistani ancestry, how does the recent vote make you feel? How has the music industry reacted, and what impact do you think this will have on musicians who currently freely move around Europe?  Guardian contributor NatashaKhan 29 June 2016 2:03pmI'm obviously devastated by the message that this choice has put out to the world, because I'm a product of a multicultural society. My mother lives in Germany, I have French aunties and uncles and cousins, and I've benefitted from being part of the European community. And my dad is Pakistani, an immigrant in this country, and met my mother and I was born out of his ability to come and live and work here. However, I'd like to offer some reassurance in the fact that I think the corporate structures of our world are not serving us and haven't done for many years, and even though this is a scary time of unrest and upheaval, looking at it from a grander perspective, it's an important part of the breakdown of outmoded political and economic models. I hope this helps us to break down the things that aren't working for us any more, and to bring about more emphasis on community, loving our neighbours, re-educating ourselves that we are all global citizens, and start to rebuild structures we're facing in the future, like stopping wars that create the immigration crisis, environmental issues we've been ignoring for too long, and the fact we need to reach out to each other as a global human race. Obviously this sounds like a fairly idealistic view, but I do believe the breakdown of the EU, whether I agree with it or not, is a symptom of a greater breakdown, and although it's painful for us in the near future, including for artists and musicians, I somehow have the sense it needs to happen to revolutionise the structures on which we build our society. It's a wake-up call. I'm working out my opinions on it still - it's still fresh.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.56pm BST13:56My influences are diverse – from Night of the Hunter to The Wizard of Oz to ElvisMichael O’Brien asks:What were your musical influences for The Bride?  Guardian contributor NatashaKhan 29 June 2016 1:54pmThey were so diverse and often not mainstream. The Night of the Hunter, the audio book, which is very cinematic and melodramatic; 1960s films like Rebel Without a Cause; the choral music from Wizard of Oz; BBC Radiophonic Workshop; classics like Elvis, Nick Cave, David Lynch; classic 60s songwriters; and really from The Bride herself, who told me which sounds resonated with her story the best. She's just in my head. She inhabits a universe that's very specific, and I know when I'm expressing that sonically and when I'm not - does that sound wave correlate with the film that's playing in my mind of her story?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.54pm BST13:54Glen Baldwin asks:Can you tell us about the photo books you have coming out in collaboration with Neil Krug?  Guardian contributor NatashaKhan 29 June 2016 1:52pmNeil and I have been working on two photographic books over the last two years which we're completing. One is called The Dreams which is a document of many places and spaces we've been and had a kind of surrealist otherworldly undertone to it, and we've used very old Polaroid film and hand coloured the photographs, and double exposures, where we both take pictures exposed over the top of one another. He's taught me a lot which I've really enjoyed - it's been a really fruitful collaborative process. The other is called Rose Syrup, which is lots of colourful and modern-looking images of my hands in nature, in amongst flowers. Celebrating the beauty of plants and Mother Nature.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.53pm BST13:53Andrew Jamieson asks:There is a distinctly ethereal beauty to your music that offers profundity and yet is also inclusive to the listener’s ears. Are you aware of that paradox when you go into a new project and is that something you railed against when creating an album with a story or theme?  Guardian contributor NatashaKhan 29 June 2016 1:50pmI think regardless of whether I have a story or theme to an album, I'm always trying to make somthing that's equally creative and in the tradition of good songwriting. It's really important for me over the years to have harnessed the ability to be a good songwriter, and I don't think the artist should really overtake that. But I am also always wanting to push the boundaries, and in terms of production I like to explore avant-garde areas. There's a paradox - it's a balance I'm always trying to achieve. I'm proud of this new record because it's one of the best examples of treading those two worlds.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.53pm BST13:53impetusturn asks:What’s the album cover going to look like? Same as on your website? And what will it consist of on the inside?  Guardian contributor NatashaKhan 29 June 2016 1:48pmIt's the same as the website image, but there's plenty of other beautiful imagery inside with Neil Krug, taken on dark rainy highways and in vintage wedding cars, and there's lyrics and lots of other things to explore.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.52pm BST13:52PatheticPanda asks:Would you ever lose the pseudonym and put out a Natasha Khan record? Do you consider BFL and yourself as separate entities or one and the same?  Guardian contributor NatashaKhan 29 June 2016 1:47pmI don't think I'll ever lose the pseudonym Bat for Lashes as it's a very specific universe I inhabit when I write from that place. But I do hope to branch out creatively and I might make more work under just my name in the future as I hope to express myself in other ways through writing, directing, design, drawing etc.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.51pm BST13:51I'm terrible at squash. Natasha Khan: bad with balls, good with nuts.SquashMan asks:Hi Natasha. Were you ever tempted to follow the rest of your amazing family into the squash business?  Guardian contributor NatashaKhan 29 June 2016 1:46pmI'm terrible with balls. And rackets. Natasha Khan: bad with balls, good with nuts. Haha! I would have loved to have been part of a squash dynasty. But it's not a skill I inherited from my dad - it was definitely more the creative side. But I loved seeing squash tournaments, travelling the world with my parents and seeing amazing matches. I met Muhammad Ali, and amazing people my dad coached. Sports was cool in the 80s wasn't it? It also developed my love for the Rocky films.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm BST13:49jasonaparkes asks:You collaborated with Scott Walker.

Guardian contributor NatashaKhan 29 June 2016 1:44pmI think we played the John Peel stage and it wasn't the biggest show because I haven't played for three or four years, and it did go out live on the BBC which is great. Sometimes it takes time to build things up - even for me!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
