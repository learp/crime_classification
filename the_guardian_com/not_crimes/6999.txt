At Rodarte, they called this SS17 trend “cuticle jewellery”, which is rather a nice idea, isn’t it? A little gold necklace for your nails, a luxurious gift to your deserving hands. Start with a layer of clear varnish, then very carefully line your cuticles with a dense glitter polish. This should be easy. Unfortunately, it’s not. If you have trouble, try a smaller brush. If you still have trouble, try a glitter pen, or dip a toothpick into your bottle, and dot it on with the tip.How to get the lookNailberry L’Oxygéné in Pink Sand £14.50 nailberry.co.ukOPI Champagne for Breakfast £12.50 opiuk.comGOSH Girls on Film £3.99 superdrug.comDolce & Gabbana Nail Lacquer in Beach Sand £21 harrods.comCiate Paint Pot in Confetti £7.20 ciatelondon.comTopshop Gel Nails in Pirate £8 topshop.comBarry M Glitter Nail Paint £3 marksandspencer.comOrly in Tiara £10.50 graftonsbeauty.co.ukEmail Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman
