10.09pm BST22:09And that’s your lot!Thanks all for reading. Hope you’re as pleased as I am with the result. Mercury blog and it’s shutdown. Off to sleep like a log and I’m shutdown. Going to leave my desk, forget all the rest, going home’s the best, and it’s shutdown. Have a very good night!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose10.05pm BST22:05So …Is anyone going to say that isn’t a grand win? Fair play: an album that sounds like modern Britain, made by someone whose music has the distinct hue of the underground, but with wide commercial appeal, who ACTUALLY SOUNDS EXCITING. God know there isn’t enough music that’s exciting at the moment, and Skepta’s someone who’s actually doing something that has an edge. Alexis Petridis will be offering his verdict soon. And I’ll be surprised if he’s upset – he liked Konnichiwa.

And he’s playing a song called Quintessence! I really liked that album last year. But, if I’m honest, I haven’t listened to it since. And if you want proof that winning the Mercury isn’t the passage to fortune that is sometimes thought, consuder this. His album At Least for Now peaked at No 37. Now, that’s a shame. But it’s not wholly surprising: florid, near-baroque balladry isn’t the easiest sell in the world.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.41pm BST21:41Kiwanuka BurgundyI went to the Mercury ceremony in 2012, when he was nominated for his first album. He played live that year, too. He had a jazz flute. I’d never seen jazz flute played live before.

With a live clip shot by Paul Thomas Anderson, maker of often unwatchably pretentious films (write your own joke). But they’re not in the room. So they’re not going to win. Serves them right. They might have to smile if they won, and they wouldn’t like that.  Radiohead … Do not approach these men. They are dangerous.

Admittedly, it was not a very popular theory. He’s really been working on his Bowie impersonation. I’d rather have had Michael J Fox, to be honest.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.25pm BST21:25Whatever happened?To the token jazzer? The A-Z is mentioning the token jazzers, but they don’t seem to bother with them any more. Nice to see mention of the Klaxons. That was a choice no one could regret. They proved to be here to stay, eh? And nice bit of taking the piss out of Tony Parsons and his insistence on the greatness of Mark Morrison.Updatedat 9.25pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.21pm BST21:21Next finalist …Is the 1975. Their fervent fanbase voted for them, so they’re the public vote inclusion. I’d better be quiet at this point, because anyone who ever looks at Guardian Music knows how much I love them. I must be honest, however, and admit that young Matthew’s voice isn’t sounding at its absolute best here. Because if I don’t, a load of people will tell me so. But bands rarely sound great on live TV, do they?  The 1975 … On the red carpet!
