Controversial plans to build a tourist resort at Victoria’s Hanging Rock have been scrapped after the state government committed $250,000 a year to maintain the landmark. The funding, announced on Friday, will fund the upkeep of trails and signs along the rock, as well as the nearby picnic areas, wetlands and protection of plant and animal life. Planning protections in the area would be strengthened to shield the area from “inappropriate development in the long-term”, the Victorian planning minister, Matthew Guy, said.Plans by the Macedon Ranges shire council to build a 100-room resort, eco-cabins, a “nature-focused adventure facility” and a day spa near the unique volcanic rock formation had divided the small community north-west of Melbourne.An eight-month protest campaign attracted the state government’s attention and led Guy to climb Hanging Rock himself in March and tell the local council he would be “watching” their consultations with local people over the plans.Alternatives to the resort development would now be developed in consultation with the council, Guy said.The Macedon Ranges mayor, Roger Jukes, told Guardian Australia in March that Hanging Rock urgently needed rejuvenation but that its reserve fund was nearly dry. Peter Weir’s 1975 film Picnic At Hanging Rock has ensured a steady stream of tourists, but rising maintenance costs and a slew of cancelled events at the rock – including this year’s Rolling Stones concert – have hit the bottom line hard.“The revenue that comes from those visitors doesn’t go back into anything other than the Hanging Rock precinct itself. But that revenue isn’t enough to sustain the rock,” he said at the time.On Friday, Jukes said he welcomed the money. “We’re pleased that the Victorian government has recognised the need for immediate funding to address the ageing of state-owned infrastructure, weed and pest problems at the rock,” he said.Local activists hailed the decision as a “win-win”.“The council’s fiscal concerns have been addressed, while our concerns for the conservation of some of the environmental and visual values of Hanging Rock have been satisfied in the long-term,” said Luke Spielvogel from the Hanging Rock Action Group.
