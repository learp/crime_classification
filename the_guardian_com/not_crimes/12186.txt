The centrepiece of this year’s Aldeburgh festival will be a day-long celebration of Messiaen’s Catalogue d’Oiseaux performed by Pierre-Laurent Aimard over four concerts, the first at sunrise, and the last finishing at midnight. Messiaen’s 13-movement work depicts 77 species of birds that he heard in his native Camargue region of south-west France. The solo piano piece will be animated as never before on Sunday 19 June with a concert on the outdoor BBC Springwatch stage of RSPB Minsmere, a nature reserve on the Suffolk coast, while the 4.30am sunrise performance will be in the Snape Maltings cafe overlooking the reed beds you can see in the video.
