JM Coetzee, Margaret Atwood, Malcolm Gladwell and Peter Carey are some of the major writers throwing their weight behind the US Authors Guild’s attempt to hold Google to account for its digitisation of millions of in-copyright works.The case dates back to 2005, when Google first began to digitise books without permission. In 2013, US circuit judge Denny Chin dismissed an authors’ lawsuit against Google, saying its scanning of the books, and the “snippets” of text it makes available to users, constituted fair use. “In my view, Google Books provide significant public benefits,” wrote Chin at the time. “Indeed, all society benefits.”Appeals court rules Google didn't violate copyrights with digital book copies An appeal by the Authors Guild against the decision was rejected in favour of Google in October 2015 by the US court of appeals for the second circuit. The American writers’ body is now asking the supreme court to hear its case, with a group of writers, publishers and copyright organisations backing its petition.The authors, who also include Thomas Keneally, Ursula K Le Guin, Tracy Chevalier, Yann Martel and Richard Flanagan, write in their filing that “copyright protection was included in the constitution to reward authors and provide incentives for them to continue writing”, and that the fair use doctrine was not intended “to permit a wealthy for-profit entity to digitise millions of works and to cut off authors’ licensing of their reproduction, distribution, and public display rights.“Although Google described its Books Library Project to the public as though it were a charitable endeavour … it was a vehicle to make searchable digital copies of over 20 million authors’ works (four million in copyright) available for searching,” write the authors. “Paying for licences for those copies was not part of Google’s business model … By creating a search project that would draw people repeatedly to new searches, as one consults a dictionary, Google created a vehicle for creating new, advertising-bearing web pages that would enrich its advertising revenue.”Libraries, they add, “had no right to authorise the copying of the physical copies of works in their collections that are still in copyright, unless they also own the copyrights”, and “Google had no right to distribute its infringing copies to the libraries”.The Authors Guild’s move for an appeal is also backed by publishers Elsevier and Hachette, the American Society of Journalists and Authors, the US Copyright Alliance and the Copyright Clearance Centre. Mary Rasenberger, executive director of the Authors Guild, said in a statement last week that the level of support “proves that this matter is critical to the future of fair use under copyright law – if not the future of publishing and authorship itself”.The guild said that the supreme court is expected to decide this spring whether it will hear the case or not.
