What’s the name of this show? Lethal WeaponWhen does it premiere? Wednesday 21 September at 8pm ET on Fox. Yes, right before Empire. What is this show about? Dude, it’s Lethal Weapon! You know the 80s (and early 90s) movies with Danny Glover and Mel Gibson before he was likely to go on alcohol-fueled tirades against police? Now, instead of waiting years between each one of their cases, you only have to wait a week. Who plays Glover and who plays Gibson? Damon Wayans is Roger Murtaugh, the “too old for this shit” cop who wants to do the right thing but is worried about getting home to his gorgeous, supportive wife (Keesha Sharp) at the end of every shift. Clayne Crawford is Martin Riggs, the suicidal rogue who lost his pregnant wife in a car crash and is now the reckless hero of the police force.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Are they any good? Wayans is an old pro and finds the perfect balance between action and laughs. Watching the man try to sit in an Eames chair turns into an inspired bit of physical comedy. Crawford, who is superb on Sundance TV’s Rectify, finds the pathos in Riggs but, dare I say it, the character is annoying. When he saunters into a bank robbery with a stack of pizzas or gets into a bar fight because that is the only way he can feel pain I just want to change the channel and watch someone whose personality seems more lifelike – for instance Daenerys Targaryen on Game of Thrones. But most importantly, the two have fantastic chemistry and by the end of the second episode Riggs’ sullen tics are a bit less ludicrous. How many times does their boss force them to turn in their badge and gun because they’ve gone too far? None yet, but their captain (Mad Men’s Kevin Rahm) yells at them at least three times an episode. In a nice hat tip to how unlikely all of their cases are, the captain keeps a running tally of how much the collateral damage to their escapades costs the city. It’s well in the millions.What happens in the first episode? You know the basics of the story: Riggs’ wife dies and he moves to LA and joins the police force where he’s partnered up with Murtaugh who is just returning to the force after heart surgery. They investigate what seems like an open-and-shut suicide, but it leads them to a cadre of drug runners. Car chases, explosions, shootouts and a few well-placed quips follow.Is it good? Well, it’s enjoyable. But this is the kind of show where an escaping killer steals not just a car but a propane truck. Why? So that Riggs and Murtaugh can shoot the tanker turning it into a fireball that rolls down the middle of a Hollywood street. Even more ridiculous is when a truck full of fireworks (why is there always a truck full of fireworks lying around?) that they set off to save them in a tense situation. Like the 80s movie it’s based on, everything is big, loud and extreme. However, when going for extreme it can also be extremely ridiculous. The real draw for viewers, just like in the original, is the relationship between the two main characters. Like I said, the state of that union is strong but it never quite captures the level of likability of the original. As long as watching these guys bro out and stop crime is entertaining, they should have a healthy show on their hands.Should I watch this show? Sure, if you have a yen for a throwback action movie. This is by no means must-see TV, but you can do a lot worse than this over-the-top procedural which would rather make things go boom than make sense.
