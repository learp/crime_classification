The week’s most ridiculous music news story just got more ridiculous: the rapper BoB’s insistent claim that the earth is actually flat now seems to be producing musical results. After prominent astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson questioned the rapper’s scientific rigour, he was met with a diss track from BoB called Flatline, which contains the line: “Neil Tyson need to loosen up his vest / They’ll probably write that man one hell of a cheque.” Now Tyson’s nephew has released his own track in response.'I didn't wanna believe it either': Rapper BoB insists the Earth is flat Flat to Fact by Stephen Tyson backs up his uncle, who promoted the track by tweeting: “As an astrophysicist I don’t rap, but I know people who do. This one has my back.”The song, which is reminiscent of Drake’s Meek Mill diss track Back to Back Freestyle, features the astrophysicist himself reciting two of his tweets to BoB. The lyrics include lines such as: “I’m in the Hayden Planetarium gettin’ shoulder rubs / I think it’s very clear, that Bobby didn’t read enough / And he’s believing all this conspiracy theory stuff / Are these all of your thoughts or is the loud talkin?” BoB has provoked much bemusement since he took to Twitter to post his flat-earth views. Tyson was one of the first scientists to publicly debunk the rapper’s claims, along with the memorable burn: “Being five centuries regressed in your reasoning doesn’t mean we all can’t still like your music.”BoB’s Flatline is a bizarre record that asks listeners to look up Holocaust denier David Irving and makes reference to the freemasons and “mirror lizards”. What can we expect next? Maybe a trap banger from Brian Cox?
