Your report (Spend more to ease flood misery, says climate chief, 6 January)underestimates what has to be done. In 2013 there were 60 railway landslips a day in February, four times the previous rate of coastal cliff falls, a 5% degradation of agricultural output through unseasonable weather, thousands of homes inundated with sewage and left without electricity for days, damage to business running into millions, coastal and localised flooding, and a colliery spoil tip slid into a railway line, the first such significant failure since Aberfan.Soon it simply won't be possible to move engineers and resources around the country to deal rapidly with the level of damage, repair and replacement. Many years of engineering investment are needed just to keep the present infrastructure working, never mind HS2.Public response to David King's broadcast was frighteningly negative. No doubt these were the same people who complained that it took hours to get Gatwick operational, days to get the railways working, weeks to restore power everywhere, and castigated the authorities for too little flood defence. Professor Peter GardinerEmeritus professor of civil engineering, University of Brighton• It is not true to say that 300 flood defence schemes that were ready to go have been halted by spending cuts (Editorial, 8 January). No schemes that were given a commitment to funding have been stopped. In fact, every economically viable project that was put forward for 2013-14 was given the go-ahead.It is also not true to say that many of the Pitt review recommendations are now on the back burner, or gone altogether. We reported back in January 2012 that the vast majority of the recommendations have been met or are being implemented. The government is on course to invest a record £2.3bn in capital improvement projects over a six-year period. Dan Rogerson MPEnvironment minister • Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that, as the planet warms, each degree of warming will increase rainfall intensity by 5%-10%.Any government with an ounce of sense would listen to these warnings and intensify action on flood defence and other adaptation measures.Instead, this government has cut spending on flood defences, despite its claims to the contrary (Report, 7 January). It has removed a requirement for local authorities to develop adaptation plans and cut Defra's adaptation team from 38 people to six. And its planning reforms make building on flood plains more likely, not less.Andy AtkinsExecutive director, Friends of the Earth• The answer to increased flooding may be to embrace it. According to the Smithsonian Environmental Research Centre, wetland plants can absorb up to 32% more CO2 than they do at the moment, which means that wetlands can work as a carbon sink, countering climate change.They also make a physical difference. Here in Norfolk, last month's tidal surge breached and swept away dunes and tidal defences, while salt marshes held firm, offering the best protection.Large areas of wetland have over the centuries been drained for agricultural use, so the rainwater they would once have held like a sponge is sent downhill at high speed into towns and cities. With swathes of southern and western Britain lying underwater, isn't it time to consider restoring our wetlands?Vicky WarrenHunstanton, Norfolk• The UK needs to accept that flooding is a recurring risk to our communities and make real, proactive change – even if it means tough decisions. We can no longer continue to defend at all costs, there is simply not enough money. However, due to population growth and housing demands, we cannot completely rule out building in the flood plain either. There are some excellent examples emerging of development taking place in areas of potential risk on the basis that investment is made in flood defences – not only for the development in question, but for the wider community as well – but this means that budget and staff cuts at the Environment Agency are of concern.Ola HolmstromHead of water UK, WSP consultancy• A coupled Ocean-Atmosphere model is run at the Met Office to provide warnings of coastal floods from high tides and storm surges. In order to validate the model, it is crucial to compare sea level observations from the National Tide Gauge Network with the model predictions. The network's Bournemouth tide gauge was damaged in an October storm but the Environment Agency has no money to repair it. Any cuts in the EA's budget will make the situation worse.Graham AlcockAuckland, New Zealand• The coastline of Lincolnshire is constantly under threat from flooding and, with the county providing over a third of our country's best arable land, extensive inundation from the sea could put this land out of action for many years, with all that would imply for our food supplies. Yet local taxpayers will have to foot most of the bill for our coastal defences. Surely, all taxpayers, if they really value their home grown fruit and veg, should be expected to contribute towards measures to ensure that we do not have to rely on costly food imports if severe coastal flooding does occur in the future.Cllr John MarriottLincolnshire county council
