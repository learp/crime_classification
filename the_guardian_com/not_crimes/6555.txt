The growth of Strictly’s overnight figures for the final could be due in part to its main rival The X Factor’s absence from the schedule as the ITV programme ended last weekend. Oduba, a BBC sports presenter, was crowned champion of the dance show after fending off competition from the actor Danny Mac and former singer Louise Redknapp. The final episode also saw Len Goodman bow out of the show after serving as head judge since it began over a decade ago. Strictly’s success in the ratings caps a memorable year for the BBC, which has seen bumper audiences for shows including The Great British Bake Off and Planet Earth II as well as its coverage of Euro 2016 and the Rio Olympics.
