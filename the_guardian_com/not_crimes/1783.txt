If Lena Dunham had her way, one episode of Girls would have featured a shot of freshly-ejaculated sperm looping through the air. This was brought up during a recent oral history of the show ahead of its last ever series – as well as the fact that HBO stepped in and stopped it from happening on the grounds of basic taste.With its money shot that never was, Girls has now entered the hallowed halls of censored TV shows. Here’s a potted history of the company it keeps.1956 – The Steve Allen Show   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest When Elvis Presley waggled his pelvis on the Milton Berle Show in 1956, an appalled New York Daily News described the performance as being “tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos”. So, when Elvis appeared on the Steve Allen Show some months later, nervous executives forced him to tone down his sexually suggestive dance moves by making him perform Hound Dog to a dog in a hat on a plinth.1960 – The Tonight Show    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest One evening, Tonight Show host Jack Paar told a long and rambling anecdote that contained several references to the term “WC” as a euphemism for “toilet”. NBC censors, outraged at the filth inherent in discussing water closets on television, cut the anecdote without informing Paar. The following night Paar – close to tears – walked off set mid-episode and refused to return for a month.1975 – Starsky and Hutch   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest An episode entitled The Fix saw Hutch get addicted to heroin, and the BBC refused to broadcast it. The episode would eventually air during a special Channel 4 Starsky and Hutch night 24 years later. Note: this video is a fan-made montage, although the original would have arguably been more traumatic had it also been soundtracked by How to Save a Life by The Fray.1977 – The Professionals    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest A first-series episode entitled The Klansmen has never been broadcast in the UK. This could be because it deals with a violent white power organisation and is therefore full of racial epithets. Or it could be because Bodie – one of the good guys, remember – repeatedly outs himself as a racist in fairly graphic terms. Or it could be down to its big reveal: the leader of the racist organisation … was black. Either way, ick.1992 – Sesame StreetNo footage from the episode Snuffy’s Parents Get a Divorce exists, because it has never been aired in any form. The story was meant to deal with the breakup of Mr Snuffleupagus’ family, but test screenings revealed the litany of unintentionally negative effects the episode had on children. Reports suggested that the kids who watched it “were in tears”, adding “They thought nobody loved Snuffy. They worried their own parents were going to get divorced”. As a result, the episode was canned forever.2001 – Everybody Loves Raymond    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Although it may appear placid to the point of tedium, an episode of the plodding American sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond entitled Marie’s Sculpture has never been broadcast on British television. Why? Perhaps because this is the episode where Raymond’s mother unwittingly creates a giant (and fairly graphic) statue of a female sexual organ. And, since Everybody Loves Raymond only airs at 8am in the UK, it’s likely the channel decided that a colossal ceramic vagina shouldn’t be the last thing kids see before they leave for school of a morning.2006 – South Park    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest When Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad in 2005, the outrage was such that South Park was bound to weigh in at some point. The episode Cartoon Wars Part II was initially supposed to show another depiction of Muhammad, but ended up running a black title card reading “Comedy Central has refused to broadcast an image of Mohammed on their network” in its place.Fear Factor – 2011    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Between 2001 and 2006, Fear Factor was a modestly diverting dare show, like I’m a Celebrity’s Bushtucker Trials stretched out over an hour. However, when NBC revived it in 2011, Fear Factor became a programme where girls in skimpy outfits drank donkey semen while men watched and vomited. After viewing the episode in question, NBC chose not to air it in America. Still, it’s good to know where the line of decency is. That line is donkey sperm.
