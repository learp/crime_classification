America’s first family has finally weighed in on the upcoming presidential election. No, not the Obamas, who made their feelings plain at the Democratic convention last week – the Simpsons.The long-running Fox comedy show released a short clip on YouTube late on Sunday night, showing Homer and Marge Simpson watching a political advertisement on late-night television in order to settle who they plan to vote for.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The ad in question follows the format of Hillary Clinton’s famous “3am” spot from the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, with a severe voiceover asking the animated couple “who [they] want answering the call”.In one version, the proverbial 3am call is answered by former president Bill Clinton, who is ruefully forced to admit that the call is for his wife.“From now on, it’s always for me,” the former secretary of state snaps at her husband.But the most scathing humor of the spot is saved for Donald Trump, portrayed as a pasty, bald autocrat reading a book of Adolf Hitler’s speeches when the call comes in.“Not now – I’m on Twitter!” Trump says, before mocking Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, whom he apparently has exiled from the United States. After instructing his lackeys to put his name on the Lincoln Memorial, disband Nato and “make Chris Christie eat a worm just for laughs”, Trump finally answers the phone call requesting his immediate presence in the Situation Room, but requires a pit crew of beauticians to attend to his appearance before he leaves.The Simpsons – live! A remarkable stunt that proves Homer will outlive us all Eight and a half hours later, after a spray tan, collagen injections, the application of large prosthetic hands and the placement of a small dog on his head, Trump is finally ready – but too late to stop the advance of Chinese military vessels.“Just build another wall!” Trump commands. “Yes, in the ocean – loser.”Following the ad, paid for by “Americans Who Are Really Starting to Miss Obama,” Homer and Marge both decide to vote for Clinton – although oafish Homer still has his doubts.
