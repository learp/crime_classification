What is it? A preschoolers’ introduction to musical theatre by Fräulein Maria herself.Why you’ll love it: What the world needs now is a cuddle, a milky drink and Julie Andrews. Eternal thanks to Netflix for providing this last in the form of Julie’s Greenroom. Although a show for the very small, who here can say they haven’t felt like thumb-sucking and clutching a blankie at recent world events? Andrews’ soothing tones and innate warmth combined with a cast of Henson Workshop puppet children has all the soothing qualities of a nice cup of tea.You know where you are when episode one begins with a cheerful song called Anything Can Happen in the Theatre. It sees Andrews launch, albeit gently, into song for the first time in years with co-star Giullian Yao Gioiello. She plays Miss Julie (not Strindberg, this is a family show), the owner of a kids’ theatre workshop and he is her young sidekick Gus, a former pupil who helps her run the little theatre built by her dad.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The kids, a happy gang of peppy puppets, are, of course, putting on a show. They were going to do The Wizard of Oz but a basement flood wiped out all but a few costumes and props. So they have to write a new musical from scratch. Who will help them come up with a story and songs and a dance routine and so on? Why, the weekly celebrity guest will! Idina Menzel kicks things off with a sing-a-long and some inspirational talk to help them come up with an idea.All “former students” of Julie’s Greenroom themselves, a different star each episode pitches up to help. It’s plain to see they’re all there for a chance to duet with Andrews. Can you imagine saying no thanks to Mary Poppins? But the script lacks the usual Henson mischief you’d expect from adult/puppet interaction, which feels like a missed opportunity.Things stay firmly on the side of saccharine with some dialogue really giving Barney the Dinosaur a run for his money. One of the kids, Spike, tries to cheer up Miss Julie after the basement flood. “When everything you care about goes down the drain, just remember, round the corner is a candy cane.” Spike is no Auden.When Julie Andrews says, “The show MUST go on” it’s like sun breaking the clouds. “Places everyone, please,” she adds, causing spontaneous rainbows to burst from your eyes and mouth.Josh Groban helps the kids write a song, Sara Bareilles likewise, Kimmy Schmidt’s Ellie Kemper teaches improv, Alec Baldwin does acting and ballet dancers assist with the moves while musicians rehearse the orchestra. It covers most aspects of live performance while threading it through with messages about trying your best and being kind to each other.And it’s all topped off with a Carol Burnett cameo in the final ep when the theatre group’s benefactor, Mrs Brightful, comes to see the big finale and join in the final number with Andrews. The two women are side-by-side on the sofa, Burnett belting, Andrews more careful with her voice now, but it’s joyful.It may be sweeter than a face-plant into a bag of Splenda, but it’s a great way to introduce wee ones to the world of theatre and clearly a passion project of Andrews who is co-exec producer and co-creator too. Fräulein Maria would 100% approve.Where: Netflix.Length: Thirteen half-hour episodes, all available to stream now.Stand-out episode: Episode 12 features David Hyde Pierce (Frasier) who gives it both thespy barrels as the directing coach, roaring his instructions across the footlights and providing much-needed comic zing for the grownups.If you liked Julie’s Greenroom watch: Yonderland (Sky Box Sets), The Furchester Hotel (iPlayer/Netflix).
