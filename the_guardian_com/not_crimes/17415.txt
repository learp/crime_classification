Radiohead’s world tour (whose headline shows take in Amsterdam, Paris, London, New York, LA and Mexico City), went on sale yesterday, including three dates at Camden’s Roundhouse (NW1, 26-28 May). Tickets are limited to two per person, and are non-transferable – so start ringing round your fastest-fingered friends to find out if you’ll ever hear the “Beatles Of The 21st Century” (so quoth the NME) in the flesh …The names for this year’s Summer Series At Somerset House (WC2, 7-17 Jul) have been announced, with reigning Mercury champ Benjamin Clementine, droll Australian Courtney Barnett and prog-poppers Everything Everything among those set to serenade The Strand in the sun …He has been accused of spreading tedium through the charts like a virus that affects you in absolutely no adverse way, but the unavoidable truth is that Jack Garratt is actually quite good at making music. If you can face up to that fact, go and see him on one of his very many upcoming tour dates (1-15 Apr, tour starts O2 ABC, Glasgow; 5-28 Nov, tour starts 02 Academy, Glasgow).
