Two years before he died, my father-in-law gave me a necklace he used to wear all the time. I was touched by this gift as I had always felt that my parents-in-law were never very enamoured with their son’s foreign bride: they are French, and we have always lived near them in France. A few days after the death, my mother-in-law demanded I return the necklace, saying that her husband never meant to give it to me. I am surprised at how much this hurt me. Twelve years on, both of my husband’s parents have passed away and I haven’t given this any thought for years. But lately my sister-in-law has started wearing the necklace. I am unnerved at how much it disturbs me. We don’t get on very well but I don’t know why I feel so bad. Am I jealous? Am I thinking of the previous hurt? How can I “let go”? I don’t particularly want the necklace, because of the memories associated with it, but fear that’s what she would think if I mention it.• When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
