2.49pm GMT14:49Ta-ta from JohnThat’s everything from John! He takes his organ out on the road this week, beginning in Swindon on 11 January and ending up in Sheffield on 30 March.  John Shuttleworth says goodbye. Photograph: Ben Beaumont-Thomas for the Guardian  Guardian contributor John Shuttleworth 09 January 2017 2:25pmThank you so much for sending your questions in. It's been an absolute delight. I feel a little bit sad about the questions I couldn't answer due to time constraints. I must go now as I have some pressing DIY duties. Ta-ta! Hope you can make it to one of my shows in the near future.Updatedat 2.49pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.46pm GMT14:46timetraveller09 asks:Wondering if you have been back to the Shetlands to see if they’re still ‘nice up north’. Also wondering if the disaffected youth are still there as my husband thinks they’ve moved into our street?  Guardian contributor John Shuttleworth 09 January 2017 2:22pmI did return a few years ago. Elma Johnson - the lovely lady in my film, It's Nice Up North, has sadly passed away. And Teg Stagg is no longer there. He was the nicest Shetlander I met, and he messed up my theory, hailing as he did from Devon!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.45pm GMT14:45ralphmilnefanclub asks:One question I’ve been wanting to ask for some minutes now - who is older, you or your good friend Graham Fellows - I’m thinking it must be a close-run thing...

Guardian contributor John Shuttleworth 09 January 2017 2:20pmI see he's doing the idents on BBC1 - very flashy! He was a bit posh for me, and couldn't hold the video camera steady.

I would say Leee John from Imagination. What a lovely chap.

I myself enjoy the west sides and the surrounds of the Etherow Valley, Wood’ed and Tintwistle. The East Is a bit Yorkshire for me  Guardian contributor John Shuttleworth 09 January 2017 2:15pmI have to say the east, because that's where Ladybower reservoir is, where I regularly check the level of. And I suggest you do the same.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.38pm GMT14:38Alan Fletcher asks:John, Bomtempi B9 - awesome or awful?

Guardian contributor John Shuttleworth 09 January 2017 2:12pmNo, you're not. And what's happened to the silver foil around a KitKat? And are we really happy with the plastic coated Penguin? As for the increased gaps in the Toblerone, it's an outrage, and I will be discussing it in the Tasty Mint show.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.26pm GMT14:26ID3996271  asks:Do you think Sheffield will be remembered as a place where trees are cut down, rather than managed, just to protect private profit?  Guardian contributor John Shuttleworth 09 January 2017 2:11pmOoh, that's a hot topic! Yes of course local trees need protecting. Having said that, I recently tarmac-ed over our lawn. No more muddy shoes when I go out to power wash the recycling bin.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.25pm GMT14:25MrTinks  asks:A lot of famous singers died in 2016, but I was saddened that I couldn’t find any obituaries or retrospectives of their work written by your friend Brian Appleton. Is he still working or has he had to get a proper job?  Guardian contributor John Shuttleworth 09 January 2017 2:10pmPerhaps Brian has himself died. But I sincerely hope not and that he will return at some point in the future. Celebrity deaths is a key topic in my new show, My Last Will and Tasty Mint, coming soon to a theatre near you! You see, I'm a little worried about my own mortality.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.24pm GMT14:24Paul Bryant asks:Could you advise a good place to purchase a fawn fleece? Most of my local shops don’t seem to stock said apparel.  Guardian contributor John Shuttleworth 09 January 2017 2:08pmObtaining fawn or beige clothing is increasingly a bit of a problem.

For example, I once saw you perform in Buxton and the audience wouldn’t stop laughing – even when you were singing about loneliness and bereavement.  Guardian contributor John Shuttleworth 09 January 2017 2:07pmI remember that show - there was a lunatic woman laughing inanely at everything, including all the sad bits. She asked me to sign her t-shirt at the end.

Guardian contributor John Shuttleworth 09 January 2017 2:04pmYou're referring to a lyric from my obscure but exceptionally good, in my humble view, rock ballad Scenes From South Yorkshire. No, I didn't know his name, but Shane rhymes with Elaine, which was in the previous line.
