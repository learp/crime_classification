Deluged homeowners in Tasmania’s north-west are not the only residents of the waterlogged area to seek higher ground.Vast translucent covers have formed above trees in towns such as Westbury in the wake of storms and the state’s worst floods in 40 years.Graham Milledge, the collection manager in arachnology at the Australian Museum, said the “mass ballooning event” was the result of tens of thousands of spiders converging on what little dry spots remain in parts of the region – their webs combining to form a thick netting.

He told Guardian Australia “the plague” had been seen in an area covering about 800 metres and that “while taking these photos my shoes, legs and arms became covered in webs and I had to brush a number of small spiders off”.
