A rollicking painting of peasants dancing in the open air at a boozy wedding immediately caught the eye of the new director of the Holburne Museum in Bath when she first toured the stores of her new kingdom. Her eye was keen: from under layers of grime and discoloured varnish, a previously unrecognised work by the 17th-century Flemish painter Pieter Brueghel the Younger has emerged.Wedding Dance in the Open Air had previously been catalogued not even as a studio work but as a lowly later copy. It has now been accepted by experts as a genuine work by the master, and will form the centrepiece of an exhibition next year at the museum on the Brueghel dynasty of artists, the first in the UK.“The more I looked at the panel, the better it seemed,” said Jennifer Scott, who was curator of the Royal Collection before taking over in Bath two years ago. “Even under the grime the detail and the colour seemed fantastic, far too good for a mere copy.“It helped that I had so recently been working on the Dutch and Flemish paintings in the Royal Collection. He is a wonderful painter, whose reputation has steadily been on the rise – even a few years ago people would have said: ‘Oh, bad luck, the Younger not the Elder,’ but now everyone is genuinely excited to hear of a new discovery of his work.”The attribution means the museum now has three paintings by the artist, more than in any other UK collection. The exhibition will bring together loans from many other collections – including what is regarded as his best painting, the Procession to Calvary, acquired in 2011 by Nostell Priory in West Yorkshire after a public appeal – with works by four generations of artists in his family, and several who married into it.Great dynasties of the world: The Brueghels The exhibition will attempt to disentangle the confusing tribe of painters across 150 years, including Pieter Bruegel the Elder, his sons Pieter Brueghel the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder – who added the h to their surname possibly because confusion already reigned – and their children Pieter Brueghel III and Jan Brueghel the Younger. Artists including David Teniers and Hieronymus van Kessel married in, and many had enormous families: Pieter Brueghel the Younger had seven children, and his nephew had 11, with at least five working as artists.“I can only keep track of them myself by constantly referring back to the family tree,” Scott said.Pieter Bruegel the Elder died when his two sons were toddlers, and though it was known his drawings remained in his studio for generations, it was not clear who taught them to paint. Scott, and her co-curator Amy Orrock, who has been poring over surviving records, now believe the credit goes to their grandmother Mayken Verhulst, who was married to a painter and was herself a noted miniaturist.The Wedding Dance came into the Holburne collection in the eclectic mass of works of art assembled by Sir William Holburne including paintings, furniture, silver, books, carved gemstones and Roman glass, all bequeathed to the people of Bath by his sister in 1882. The museum celebrates its centenary this year, having finally found a permanent home in a handsome converted Georgian hotel in 1916.“We have absolutely no idea where Sir William got the picture – as with most of his collection, we haven’t a scrap of documentation, but we suspect he probably bought the three pictures together, probably through a dealer from an English collection.”There has been much scholarly debate over whether the Brueghels were admiring or mocking in their peasant paintings, which tend to feature prominent codpieces, drink- and food-reddened faces, and background figures showing the consequences of overindulgence.“I think they were seen as harking back to something real, rooted in the open air and a more traditional lifestyle, and valued for that by a sophisticated audience,” Scott said. “I think he’s laughing with these people, not at them.”Bruegel: Defining a Dynasty is at the Holburne Museum in Bath from 11 February to 4 June 2017
