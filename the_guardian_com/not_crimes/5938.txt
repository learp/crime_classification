Time Inc is closing the UK print edition of its InStyle magazine and taking the brand digital-only.A number of jobs are under threat, but Time would not reveal how many would go while it carried out a consultation with staff. The UK edition of the fashion magazine – which celebrates its 15th anniversary this year – saw its circulation fall by almost 18% in the first six months of 2016 to 121,000 copies a month. Time Inc described the move as a bold shift into digital. “What we have achieved with InStyle over the last few years has been hugely rewarding and the team has, rightly, won numerous awards and nominations for their work across print and digital,” said editor Charlotte Moore. “But the fashion world is changing dramatically, the way our audience interacts with it is changing and we have to change to meet that challenge. With a focus on delivering the InStyle experience across all digital platforms, we can really give our audience 24-hour access to all the fashion and beauty looks, trends and brands they clearly have such a huge appetite for.”InStyle’s total monthly traffic is more than 10 million uniques according to ComScore data. Time Inc plans to double that audience over the course of 2017, in part by taking content from its US counterpart.Time Inc’s UK managing director for fashion and beauty Justine Southall said: “This new focus for InStyle means we can propel it to a leading position in the UK digital fashion space. InStyle’s authority combined with this significantly boosted content offering will make it a compelling destination for consumers and a very attractive proposition for our advertising partners.”
