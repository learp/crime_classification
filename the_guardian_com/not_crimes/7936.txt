An outspoken farmer’s recent suicide has been hijacked by some politicians, activists and journalists, Queensland’s peak mining body says.The Queensland Resources Council chief executive, Michael Roche, released a statement on Tuesday afternoon remembering late Chinchilla farmer George Bender, who vocally opposed coal seam gas before his death earlier this month.Q&A: George Bender's daughter accuses politicians of neglecting farmers On Monday night Bender’s daughter, Helen, used an appearance on the ABC’s Q&A program to condemn politicians for not listening to farmers.“Since George’s death that public debate has been hijacked by some people – professional anti-gas activists, certain politicians and a Sydney shock jock – who are far from pure in their motives,” Roche said.The Sydney broadcaster Alan Jones wrote to prime minister Malcolm Turnbull after Bender’s death.Malcolm Turnbull will 'look into' suicide of anti-CSG farmer George Bender “Some in the media have been happy to give these people free rein, unconstrained by facts,” Roche’s statement said.He expressed his condolences to the cotton farmer’s family and said the two had often sparred with each other over the phone.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Helen Bender recalled some of her father’s final words during her impassioned Q&A appeal.“One of the last things my father said: ‘No one is listening, why are you wasting my time?’” she said.“I don’t think anyone is listening ... I don’t think the nation is listening, I don’t think any one of you politicians care.”Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14
