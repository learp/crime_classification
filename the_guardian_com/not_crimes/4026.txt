Glam rock normally makes us think of platform heels and elaborate makeup, but the 1970s genre still stomps its way through popular music to this day. With the late passing of glam pioneer David Bowie, it was timely that the Guardian’s chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis celebrate the heydey of the glam rock genre on our Guardian Radio Hour. For the second show in the Guardian’s 10-week radio series on NTS, Alexis talked to the Guide’s Kate Hutchinson about glam’s early innovators, forgotten outliers and its modern descendants: T Rex to David Bowie and Iron Virgin to Perfume Genius. More than just ludicrous costumes and very big hair, glam was a statement of gender non-conformity and the source of a sound that’s subsequently influenced everything from techno to heavy metal.For full details of the show and the tracklist, head to the show page on NTS.
