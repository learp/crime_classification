I have never really thought of myself as the sort of cook who makes his own bits and pieces to serve with drinks. Too much fiddle and faff if you ask me. But then when I do, I realise I should have done so all along. Not just because what I’ve made often tastes better than anything I can buy, but because the effort is much more appreciated. Thoughtful drinks and homemade bits like the gin lemonade and bacon popcorn below aren’t a great deal of trouble and say Merry Christmas far more effectively than arranging something you’ve just picked up from the shops on a plate.With these drinks may I wish you all a happy and peaceful Christmas. See you in a couple of weeks.Gin lemonadeBright as the star in the east, a fresh, citrus-scented gin cocktail.Makes enough for 4-6 small glassesunwaxed lemons 2caster sugar 5 tbspstill mineral water 500mljuniper berries 8ice cubes gin (50ml to 250ml of lemonade)Cut the lemons into large pieces, pips and all peel, and place in a blender jug then add the sugar and water. Process to a thick creamy-yellow liquor, then tip into a jug. Crack the juniper berries lightly using a heavy weight or pestle and mortar. Add to the lemon syrup then refrigerate.Put ice into the glasses. Pour over the gin and top up with lemonade, and garnish with a slice of lemon.Fennel seed and pancetta popcornBacon fat works brilliantly with the fennel, lending a scent of porcetta.For 8-10bacon or pancetta 150g, sliced thinlybutter 125gfennel seeds 2 tbsppopping corn 125g These bits say Merry Christmas better than anything from the shops Lay the bacon or pancetta on a baking sheet and cook under a hot grill until crisp. Turn and cook the other side. You are after truly crisp flesh. Lift the rashers from the tray and place on kitchen paper. Reserve the fat in the tray, tipping it into a deep saucepan.Melt 95g of the butter in a small pan. While it melts, bash the fennel seed using a pestle and mortar, to release its fragrance, not to crush to a powder, then add to the butter and stir, letting it warm gently. Turn off the heat.Melt the remaining butter in the bacon fat over a moderate heat, then add the popping corn. Cover tightly with a lid, shaking the pan occasionally, until the kernels have popped. This will take anything between 3 and 5 minutes, depending on the heat and thickness of your pan.Crumble the bacon or pancetta into tiny pieces, add to the fennel-seed butter with a little sea salt then fold into the popcorn and serve.Pomegranate and prosecco      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Savoury and sweet: pomegranate and prosecco, with green olive pastries.

Remove the skin and pith with your fingers, then lay the segments on a tray and place in the freezer for a couple of hours.Crack the cardamom pods open with a heavy weight, such as a mortar, but don’t grind them to a powder.Divide the pomegranate juice between glasses, add two segments of frozen clementines to each glass, then a cardamom pod. Top up with prosecco and serve with ice.Green olive pastriesAbout the size of Danish pastries, these are best warm from the oven.Makes about 12green olives 200g (stoned weight 150g)garlic 2 clovesbasil 10gparsley leaves 5golive oil 120mlparmesan 60g, gratedpuff pastry 500g, ready madeegg a little beaten to glazeIf the olives have stones, remove them. Then put the olive flesh into the bowl of a food processor. Peel the garlic and add the cloves to the olives. Put the basil, leaves and stalks and the parsley leaves into the bowl of the food processor, then process, pouring in the olive oil as you go until you have a loose green paste. Stir in most of the grated parmesan, leaving a little to scatter over the finished pastries.Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.On a floured work surface, roll out the pastry to a rectangle of about 44 x 30cm. Spread the olive paste over the surface of the pastry leaving a 2cm rim of bare pastry on all sides. Brush the rim with egg wash.With the narrow edge towards you, roll the pastry up into a long thick sausage, pressing the edges tightly together to seal. Wrap the roll lightly in kitchen paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes. It will firm up a little, making it easier to slice.Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Cut the roll into finger- thick slices, placing them flat on the parchment. You will have about 12. Scatter a little of the remaining parmesan over the surface of each and bake for 12-15 minutes or until crisp, golden and puffed.Using a palette knife, remove the cooked pastries from the baking tray and serve warm.Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
