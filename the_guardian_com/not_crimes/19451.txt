The BBC News channel and the World News service face 10% cost cuts after the corporation decided against merging the two operations.BBC director general Tony Hall said the News Channel would remain as a standalone service earlier this week while unveiling the corporation’s annual report. In response to questions from journalists he said: “Yes, the News channel will stay. We all know the importance of being able to go over to your TV and see what is unfolding.”However, addressing staff on Thursday morning, BBC News boss James Harding said both channels would be expected to find significant savings. It’s understood the 10% will be made up from editorial budgets and does not refer to wider costs associated with the channels.A BBC spokeswoman said the corporation had concluded that maintaining two separate services was the best way to ensure UK and international audiences got the most relevant services.“We did detailed work on the proposal for a new single channel, including a financial model, and listened to what both audiences and BBC staff told us,” said the spokeswoman. “Although there are strong arguments in favour of running a single news channel, we concluded that this would not be the best way of offering a UK audience and global audiences the news agenda that is most directly relevant to them.”“During the work on all the options, including the proposal for a single channel, we recognised opportunities for working more efficiently, and we face tough financial challenges, so we will aim to make efficiency savings of up to 10% on both channels.”The Guardian reported in December that the corporation had shelved plans to shut the BBC News channel and replace it with digital services after coming to the conclusion that it would only save in the region of £16m. The BBC lists the cost of the channel as £62.3m and total associated costs are thought to exceed £110m, but much of its budget in areas such as newsgathering would have to be assigned to other parts of the corporation if it were to close. Proposals for merging the operation with the World News channel emerged in May. However, combining the two services would have been fraught with additional difficulty because the international service is run commercially and carries ads, while the UK version does not.
