The format of The Great British Bake Off “will stay exactly the same” following its move from the BBC to Channel 4, presenter Paul Hollywood has said. The Great British Bake Off disaster: why the BBC got burned The hit show made headlines earlier this year after Love Productions, the company that makes it, announced it was switching channels in a deal with Channel 4 in a three-year deal worth a reported £75m.Hollywood, the only member of the original team to follow the show to Channel 4 after Mary Berry, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins left after the move, told the Jonathan Ross Show that he had been given little warning over the move. “It was between the production company and the BBC and they then moved to Channel 4 and obviously it came down to ... my job was still there and I didn’t want to lose my job,” he said. “I love doing what I do.”He said he had been involved in “long talks” with Channel 4 and was “excited” about the show’s return. “The Bake Off won’t change in the sense that the format will stay exactly the same, the tent will stay the same, the challenges and really the bakers [will not change].“Ultimately, it comes down to when the bakers get in the tent next year, then it will be a special thing. I’m really excited about it and I think it will do a great job; I’m going to make sure that we keep it the same.” Last week, Hollywood said he was surprised by the vitriolic reaction his decision had elicited, saying the Yorkshire Ripper had received less negative press coverage.
