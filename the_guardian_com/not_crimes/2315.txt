Most of us are trapped in rectangular living, trying to retrofit eco-efficiency, but we could be enjoying life in a geodesic freedome. For starters, freedomes are inherently efficient: they need no intermediate columns or supporting walls. After all, a geodesic line is the shortest line between two points on the surface of a spheroid, and the sphere is nature’s most efficient shape.Buckminster “Bucky” Fuller, who created the Montreal Biosphère in 1967, was the foremost pioneer of geodesic domes, the master of tensegrity – tensile integrity – and the reason why geodesic structures are forever associated with eco living.Out of 90 pavillions built for Montreal’s 1967 World’s Fair, only two are standing. And one is Bucky’s famed geodome, now known as the Montreal Biosphère, minus its acrylic shading canopy (which was lost to fire in the 1970s).Intended to be built in the middle of nowhere by inexpert hippies (kits were sold through the Whole Earth Catalog) the domes were designed to be durable and able to withstand high winds. But “anticipatory architects”, designing after the oil shock for tough times ahead, loved their efficiency. Domes use a third less material in construction, and 33%-50% less energy than conventional houses, according to 1980s research. But this was probably the last time they were popular as residences. These days we are more familiar with them as showcase structures, such as the Eden project or Disney’s Epcot.Now it’s time to break out and rediscover the freedoms of freedomes. At Geo-dome you’ll find kits. Go to Blackleaf for a heimplanet geodesic inflatable tent £512.95. Or get a proper geodesic structure in the form of Bouf’s garden igloo (£629) that also comes with a shading canopy.For the pioneer designers and dwellers, dome living was about “ecosophy’” – a personal response to planetary crisis. Your geodome won’t provide all the answers, but it gives you a harmonious space in which to ponder the future.The big picture: Flood House      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Weather permitting: Flood House, the floating weather station.

I’ve certainly never seen anything like Flood House on Towie. A piece of nomadic architecture by Matthew Butcher, it’s a companion piece to his earlier design, Filter House. The structure asks how we might live through seasonal flooding and is a floating weather station.Well dressed: ethical handwoven bags      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   In the bag: a Basket Room x Jigsaw woven tote bag, £110After pursuing careers in the mainstream fashion industry, Camilla Sutton and Holly Dutton met while studying fashion design at art college.Determined to do fashion differently, in 2014 they set up the ethical lifestyle company the Basket Room. They specialise in handwoven baskets and accessories, working directly with weaving co-operatives in rural Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda and Swaziland, using traditional techniques.Now their first collaboration with high-street stalwart Jigsaw has just launched online and in selected stores. More than 100 women in rural Kenya have worked on the limited-edition collection, which includes a basket shopper bag in a choice of two colours and a curved clutch finished with black or brown leather. Both designs were handwoven using sisal grass. Available from £89 at thebasketroom.com and jigsaw-online.comEmail Lucy at lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @lucysiegle
