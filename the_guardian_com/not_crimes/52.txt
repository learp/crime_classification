Warning: this article contains spoilers about the season two finale of Better Call Saul. Don’t read on unless you’ve watched it.It’s never going to be Breaking Bad 2 – surely everyone must accept that by now. But Better Call Saul is a divisive show that continues to dictate its own terms, disappointing those who willed it to be the sketchy adventures of lawyer Saul Goodman, and delighting those who stick with the slowburn tale of the gradual moral erosion of Jimmy McGill. As it’s on Netflix, we have no idea of the numbers who fall into either camp – but after seeing the season two finale, there’s little credibility to the argument that this is a show in which nothing happens.The finale topped a fantastic second season, giving us a heartbreaking flashback to the death of Jimmy and Chuck’s mother, Chuck’s harrowing emergency room visit – the camera upside-down, locked on his face as he’s prodded and poked – and Mike’s silent sniper outing in the desert. That’s more than enough for viewers to chew over until it returns.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Silent sniper … Mike’s outing in the desert. Photograph: AMCIn showing the incremental changes that transform Jimmy into Saul, we’re getting a lot of story and not much plot. The scope is shrinking into a forensic character study of Jimmy. But people don’t change overnight; that only happens in the movies. In TV, we can see how gradual it can be, how someone can not even notice they’ve changed until it’s too late. There’s no grandstanding big moment, it’s slow and sad. Showrunner Vince Gilligan’s refreshing response to any pacing criticisms has been that he’s worried the show is moving too fast.Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould on Better Call Saul: 'It could have been a huge flop' A great example of the type of storytelling he’s trading in came in the first episode of this season. When Jimmy inspects his new office at Davis & Main, he finds a switch on the wall marked with a crude stickered warning: “Always Leave ON!!! Do NOT turn OFF!” Of course Jimmy flips it without a second thought. No alarms sound, nothing breaks, the world keeps turning – but we instantly see what his true nature is. There was some online theorising as to what the switch did, but there was no callback. The switch served its dramatic purpose and we moved on. Likewise the Sandpiper case, no longer front and centre after several weeks of Jimmy’s entertaining hucksterism, drumming up clients from the elderly community with his showmanship and advertising. Or the Mesa Verde contract, which was there to give Kim the strength to leave Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill and was then further reduced to the street numbers Jimmy doctored to get revenge on his brother.

It’s increasingly easy to see their story from both sides, and harder to settle on only one, as their past is slowly revealed. Chuck’s tale of how Jimmy continually pilfered cash from the till at their dad’s store until he died in poverty put much-needed emotion behind his relentless hounding of his little brother. But even if Chuck is right most of the time, it is too harsh that he always thinks the worst of Jimmy – especially after his sibling goes beyond the call of duty for him. Magic Mike: how Jonathan Banks became TV’s best-loved hitman That both Bob Odenkirk and Michael McKean come from comedy backgrounds is worth noting. Neither are playing to their natural performance instincts and both are delivering the dramatic goods – these are standout roles. Also impressive is Rhea Seehorn as Kim: the scene where she takes Jimmy’s side against Chuck’s accusations of file tampering (when she knows full well Jimmy is guilty) was a masterclass in layering a performance. The show also attracts some high-quality guest stars with Ed Begley Jr as Jimmy’s temporary boss Clifford Main, Clea DuVall returning as Chuck’s doctor and Jim Beaver as Lawson, Mike’s gun dealer.Speaking of Mike Ehrmantraut: while Jimmy and Chuck’s world shrinks, his is expanding in ways he cannot control. His plans of a boring retirement, with occasional jobs lending his ex-cop gravitas to minor criminal exchanges, are out the window now. His work with Nacho has led to unwanted involvement with Tucco and now Hector Salamanca, bringing him to his hilltop vigil with the sniper rifle after his perfect crime turned out to have lethal consequences. So who left the “DON’T” note on Mike’s windshield? Does it have something to do with the fact that if you take the first letter from each of this season’s episode title you get an anagram of FRING’S BACK? Not bad for a show where nothing ever happens.
