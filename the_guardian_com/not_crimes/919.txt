7.59pm GMT19:59So that’s it for another Strictly Week – only three more to go, which makes me feel a bit sad, but also mildly elated at the prospect of Christmas/getting my weekends back. Thank you all for joining in and sharing your thoughts and musings, you are very much the icing on my sponge, and it would all be a bit dry and tasteless without you. As if by magic, you can read my review of Ed’s best bits here, otherwise I’ll see you next week! Hx FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.57pm GMT19:57 Ed says lovely things about everyone, including being entirely charming about Katya, who has been the star of this year’s show as far as I’m concerned. Katya has a cry, and they take a final spin around the dancefloor to ‘That’s What Friends Are For’ by Dionne Warwick. Blub.

Craig saves Judge Rinder and Oksana, as does Darcey. Bruno does likewise, and Len would have done the same, even though his vote doesn’t matter. Oh Ed, I will miss you. You’ve been an unexpected ray of sunshine in a pretty bleak year. Please keep dancing, the nation needs you. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.53pm GMT19:53It’s time for Ed! He knows he’s going very likely going home, so I really want this to be entirely insane. But actually Ed is really trying, which I love about him – he’s giving it both barrels right to the end, and it’s actually a very decent Tango. Bit dusty in here.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.50pm GMT19:50So this is still a Ropey Rumba from Rinder, but considerably better than last night – more fluid and less spiky. His face still looks like he’s dancing on Lego in bare feet, but whatever.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.48pm GMT19:48Let’s face it, unless Judge Rinder comes out and does the Macarena with his pants on his head, Ed is going home. Actually even that probably wouldn’t stop the judges getting rid of Ed. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.45pm GMT19:45Craig has secretly enjoyed Ed’s dancing, we learn. Perhaps a little of that could have made it to his scoring paddle? Isn’t that how the show works?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.44pm GMT19:44So who is joining Judge Rinder an Oksana in the dance off? Ore and Joanne are safe, along with Claudia and AJ, which means ED AND KATYA in the dance-off. I’m focussing on the positive - we get to see both of their dances again, hooray!   It’s a Rinder v.

Face of an angel, voice of an angle grinder. Not sure about the underwear-as-outerwear plus feathery boots look either, she looks like a Flintstone.  Accompanying dance: barefoot contempo-wafting from Kevin and Karen. You’re welcome.

I had no idea. You should have said. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.32pm GMT19:32So who is in the dance off tonight, and who is safely through to next week’s quarter final? Oh lord, I’d forgotten next week’s show has a FEEM – it’s Musicals Week, so prepare yourself for a Strictly Come Bingo heavy on props. It’s also the last week of only one dance, so it’s only an hour long – we should probably plan an afterparty. Anyway Louise and Kevin are safe, along with Danny and Oti (obvs). First couple in tonight’s Dance Off: JUDGE RINDER AND OKSANA. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.28pm GMT19:28Last night on Strictly: six pretty entertaining performances, all told. Highlights: Danny and Oti’s OMG Samba, Ed giving it Blue Steel on the chaise longue, Louise’s starry dress, Rinder’s Cha Cha hips. Lowlights: Rinder’s Rumba music and Billy Elliot theming, Animal from The Muppets playing drums on Justin Timberlake’s Cry Me A River.Incidentally I watched both Ore’s Paso and Claudia’s Argentine Tango again today, and they both improved significantly with second viewing. Just don’t think I was feeling it last night.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.26pm GMT19:26Darcey appears to wearing frilly chaps. Stop it.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.25pm GMT19:25Tess and Claudia Dress Watch: Tess in a slashed-to-the-waist navy Aladdin pantsuit with one of the 7,000 metallic belts she owns, Claudia in a frilly lace lampshade. Both awful.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.24pm GMT19:24And we’re off! I love the point in the series where you’ve forgotten half the people in the credits ever existed. Like Anastacia. This week’s opening pro dance has a vintage sports day theme, with lots of slapstick Charleston action. Lovely to see Gorka back after the Blackpool incident. This is making me itch, but rather fabulous all the same.  Jolly good sports.

This week it’s the very handsome John Hammond, rocking the check shirt/jeans/brown belt combo. He has very manly forearms. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.06pm GMT19:06Countryfile is reminding me of the week I spent narrowboating on the Monmouth & Brecon Canal. The weather was so bad we moored up in Crickhowell and spent most of the week in the pub watching the Rugby World Cup. Happy days.
