Director Martin Scorsese, writer Paul Schrader, as well as stars Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster and Cybill Shepherd are set to attend the event on 21 April, and take part in an onstage conversation following the film.Released in 1976, Taxi Driver – best known as the film in which De Niro utters the immortal “You talking to me?” line – received four Academy Awards nominations, including best picture and best actor, and won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival. It’s since been dubbed by Time Magazine as one of the 100 best films of all time.Tribeca film festival: Tom Hanks and Michael Shannon in 2016 lineup “Taxi Driver is one of the most brilliantly disturbing movies ever made, and why I chose to go into film.
