Peter Morgan, the screenwriter whose credits include The Queen and The Crown, will be awarded the British Film Institute’s highest honour when he is given the BFI fellowship.Morgan, who also wrote Frost/Nixon, Rush and the screenplay for The Last King of Scotland will be honoured at the BFI’s annual chairman’s dinner on 21 February. He said he could not be more “surprised, thrilled or proud” to receive the honour, adding he would “look forward to being suitably teased and abused on the night”.Josh Berger, chairman of the BFI, will host the dinner at Claridge’s in London and said: “I am absolutely thrilled to be recognising Peter Morgan’s rare talent and enormous contribution to both the big and small screen with a BFI fellowship.“He is rightly one of our most feted and accomplished screenwriters, with a career spanning almost 30 years and delighting generations of audiences with his work. Peter has an uncanny knack for getting under the skin of prominent figures to portray an eclectic range of real-life personalities, retelling the most iconic moments in our recent history and the individuals at the heart of them, to make engaging, elegant and accessible stories.”Much of Morgan’s work has focused on the British establishment and real-life characters and he is responsible for a trio of films that starred Michael Sheen as former prime minister Tony Blair: The Deal, The Queen and The Special Relationship.He will join a prestigious list of fellows including Tim Burton, Clint Eastwood and Judi Dench but will be one of only three who are known principally for their writing, alongside Graham Greene and Lynda La Plante.
