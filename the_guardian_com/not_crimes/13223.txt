Sub Pop, the label that fomented the grunge revolution and launched Nirvana upon the world, is also a caring, sharing company, dedicated to ensuring that even those who have bypassed the traditional measures of success get a chance. In fact, it’s not willing to support winners in any way; instead it is offering college funding to those who have suffered failures.Sub Pop: 25 years of underground rock The label has been offering “loser scholarships” each year since 2007, and now this year’s loser scholarships have been unveiled. The good news: those eligible can secure thousands of dollars of financial help. The bad news: only high school seniors resident in the states of Washington and Oregon are eligible.Three scholarships – for $7,000, $5,000 and $3,000 – are open to applicants on their way to full-time studies at an accredited university or college, who are involved and/or interested in music and/or the creative arts, though they do not need to be studying an arts subject.Applicants need to submit an essay of one page or less, using the following questions as a guide:What are you doing in the arts/music field in your community?What does being a Sub Pop “loser” mean to you?What are your influences and/or who inspired you to become involved in the arts?Describe your biggest failure and explain how it has brought you closer to your goal(s).Discuss a special attribute or accomplishment that sets you apart.How has your family or community background affected the way you see the world?The deadline for applications is 20 March, and full details are available on the Sub Pop website.
