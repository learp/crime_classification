The Bold family are a very odd family compared to an ordinary one.Mrs Bold makes interesting hats out of egg boxes. Whilst Mr Bold likes rubbing his bottom against plants. Their children, Betty and Bobby, are always chewing on pencils at school! Can this wild, extraordinary family rescue Tony, a hyena, from Kenton Safari Park?I liked this book because it was funny and imaginative. You weren’t left thinking, ‘what happened to them?’ or ‘how did that happen?’ or other similar questions.
