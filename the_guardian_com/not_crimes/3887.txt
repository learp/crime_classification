The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with Mall Grab: I’ve Always Liked GrimeIt’s nice to start with a bang. When you’ve just arrived at a club and you’re trying to gauge what mood the crowd is in, sometimes it’s fun to whack on a proto-grime house banger.The track I always play to rescue a dance floor SE62: True ForceLast time I played it at a warehouse party in the Alps, a girl took her top off and was dancing on her friend’s shoulders!The track that currently gets the most rewinds Anil Aras: Dance MFBig track from Utrecht, one of the best places on Earth for house music right now.The track I wish I’d signed to my label Roman Flügel: More & More & MoreIt’s a fine line between Euro trash and a super-deep ghetto houz ass kicking! This is a super-fun track that whips up a storm on the floor.The track that should have been a crossover hit DJ Food: Blech TapeI remember when I first heard the Blech Tape, a classic Warp mix, years ago. It was given out on the front of Jockey Slut in the 90s, in the pre-internet days, and opened my eyes to electronic music. I thought: why is this sort of music so underground and hard to find? It should be popular!The track I’d play to show off my eclectic tastes AFX: Mashed Potatoes   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I don’t know if that’s what it’s called [It’s Children Talking – Ed] but it’s the one that goes “Why do you hate mashed potatoes?” over drill’n’bass.The track that got me out of bed this morning Iasos: Fire Dance   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It’s the first track on Bora Bora 2000; it sounds like the soundtrack to Mario Kart. I listen to it on headphones or in the kitchen when I’m making pancakes.The best track by my favourite new artist DJ Octopus: Throne Keen   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Throne Keen has such a weirdo freakout vibe: raw underwater club trax from the waters of Venice!The ideal festival track DJ Hyperactive: Wide Open (Len Faki edit) If I’m playing to a big crowd I’ll always drop this one. It sounds so “big main room bang!”.The track I’d play at sunset in Ibiza Pineapples: Come On CloserImagine this blasting from the Cafe Mambo speakers before you head into the night. Great times!DJ Haus plays La Cheetah Club, Glasgow, Friday 22 April
