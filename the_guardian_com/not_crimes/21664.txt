The BBC has axed its drama Dickensian after just one series, despite spending an estimated £10m on the show, including creating a purpose-built set.Despite its all-star cast, the series written by EastEnders veteran Tony Jordan using characters from Dickens novels failed to retain its audience after a successful launch on Boxing Day. Its opening episode attracting some 5 million viewers, but this is understood to have halved before the 10th of its 2o episodes. Despite the falling audience figures, the series’ demise was mourned on social media, with many fans blaming the BBC’s decision not to schedule a regular slot for the 30-minute episodes.The BBC’s dramatic about-face comes as it looks to cut £550m ahead of its charter renewal and after a huge reshuffle of the top team at the corporation. Three of the exercutives who either commissioned or produced the show – Danny Cohen, Ben Stephenson and Polly Hill – have since left the BBC.The BBC confirmed the story, which first appeared in the Sun. A spokeswoman said: “We are incredibly proud of Dickensian and would like to thank all those involved in such an ambitious series. “We sometimes have to make difficult decisions to make room for new shows and it won’t be returning for a second series.”Writer and executive producer Tony Jordan said: “I am disappointed that we will not be making a second series of Dickensian. We are hugely proud of what we achieved in the first series of Dickensian and would like to thank everyone who helped us create a truly special and unique drama.”The 20-episode run followed Inspector Bucket’s investigation into the murder of Jacob Marley, Scrooge’s business partner in A Christmas Carol. Stephen Rea starred as the inspector, and the cast also included War and Peace’s Tuppence Middleton and comedian Caroline Quentin.Despite a well-received launch following a press trip to the set in west London, by the eighth episode the Telegraph asked “the question of whether this is an interesting experiment or simply an expensive indulgence remains unresolved”.
