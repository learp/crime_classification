France’s ratings system is due to be overhauled to strengthen the country’s national film board, the CNC, in response to recent attacks by conservative pressure group Promouvoir.According to Variety, the recently installed culture minister Audrey Azoulay plans to scrap a recent amendment stating that any film showing unsimulated sex must automatically be given an 18 rating. She also wants to shorten the duration of legal appeals that can be brought against the board, a process that can see the rating of a film change during its run. ABC refuses to show Carol ad featuring lesbian love scene Promouvoir, a rightwing organisation that purports to strengthen “Judeo-Christian values”, recently achieved high-profile wins in their appeals against films by directors such as Gaspar Noé and Abdellatif Kechiche. Noé’s film, Love, which contains explicit 3D sex scenes, had its rating raised to an 18 certificate three weeks after release because of the pressure group’s campaign. Kechiche’s Palme d’Or-winning lesbian drama, Blue Is the Warmest Colour, had its 12 rating removed by a Paris court after another Promouvoir appeal, while Lars von Trier’s Antichrist, a psychological horror that includes scenes of genital mutilation, was recently banned in France, seven years after its release. Azoulay, who is working from a report from CNC president Jean-François Mary, plans to clarify France’s rating rules, potentially making it less easy for groups such as Promouvoir to appeal for tougher censorship. The daughter of an adviser to the Moroccan King Mohammed VI, she is the third culture minister to be appointed by the French president François Hollande since he took office in 2012.
