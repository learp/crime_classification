I’m a pale person and I spent my formative years turning red on the beach and laying the groundwork for an impressive selection of brown blotches and spots that could easily turn nasty at some point. I could have done with a tiny burkini to keep my skin safe from the sun’s burning rays. My teenage years were riven with angst and embarrassment as I sought to hide my imperfections from public gaze. How I would have welcomed a swimsuit that could have shielded my pale, skinny frame from the eyes of the world instead of having to suffer the worst of British design that incorporated armoured bra cups which soared skywards when I lay on my back.A trip to hotter climes saw me swathed head to foot in towels and sporting an impressive weight of greasy sunblock when I really needed a decent garment that didn’t leave my shoulders and thighs bare. Luckily these clothes are now available in the shape of swim tights and swim shirts so I can go to the beach covered head to foot in clothing that is designed to keep me safe in the sun and that works well as swimwear. If I want to add a swim hat to keep my hair from getting tangled in the water, I can do that … unless I am a Muslim woman (French minister for women’s rights defends burkini ban, 17 August). The burkini isn’t a million miles from some of the clothing sold to surfers or those who wish to stay safe in the sun, but because of the religious overtones, Muslim women are being denied the right to enjoy the beach and go swimming like any other person.Whatever your beliefs, there shouldn’t be rules about what people can and cannot wear on the beach. Semi-nudity or total cover-up, it should be up to the individual.Michelle GibsonCambridge• Haven’t noticed many nuns on the beaches during years of French holidays. Must be because their robes are “not compatible with the values of the French republic”.Bernard ClarkeOxford• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
