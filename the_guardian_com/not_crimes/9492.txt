Exhibition of the weekFergal StapletonIn Sheridan Le Fanu’s ghost story Schalcken the Painter, a 17th-century Dutch artist meets an undead corpse; the chiaroscuro, bloody tints, eerie phantoms and spectral lights in Stapleton’s new paintings mix old master echoes with a slice of gothic horror as if they were painted by Schalcken himself. Quotations from Rembrandt are seen through a glass, very darkly.

She suffers from night terrors, and uses her photography to tackle them. “My mother, who was a musician and artist, suggested I draw, paint or sculpt my dreams to understand them,” she told Edward Siddons. “She taught me to articulate them in a positive light and, in the process, free myself from their power. And that’s why I shoot: to create beauty out of trauma.”What we learned this weekPicasso used his daughter’s faeces as paintHis widow, meanwhile, may have hidden paintings from his familyThe National Maritime Museum’s Emma Hamilton exhibition is a five-star hitAlex Bartsch is on a mission to find the British locations on classic reggae LP coversAn Australian exhibition is contemplating why humans first made art – but the truth isn’t easily definedThe National Gallery is trying to buy this painting of WellingtonThe earthquake in Italy’s Norcia region devastated beautiful churches – and it’s hard to look atAgnes Martin paintings are embroiled in an authentication rowThere’s a new theory about why Van Gogh cut off his earWe meet collectors of the macabre, from ouija boards to papier-mache skeletonsGet involvedOur Beyond Caravaggio and Artist Rooms: Andy Warhol private view events are sold out, but book now for Night at the Museum at Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery on 29 November.Our A-Z of Art series continues – share your art with the theme ‘M for majesty’And check out the entries for the theme ‘L for London’Don’t forgetTo follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign
