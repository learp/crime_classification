An operatic collaboration between an American film-maker, an Italian haute couture king, and a British set designer will make its debut this weekend.Sofia Coppola’s La Traviata will open at the Opera of Rome on Sunday in a production featuring costumes made and designed by Valentino with backdrops created by Nathan Crowley, the set designer for the Batman films.Valentino, who sits on the opera house’s board, approached the American director after seeing her 2006 film Marie Antoinette, which he said showed she possesses “a distinctive sensitivity and musical aesthetic, balancing the classic and the modern”.Coppola, who was nominated for a best director Oscar for Lost in Translation, said: “I didn’t really know what to expect and I never could have had the courage to direct an opera, but then Valentino and Mr [Giancarlo] Giammetti [the designer’s artistic collaborator] asked me.

Speaking to the New York Times, Coppola said she wanted to “bring out the personal side of the French courtesan – the party girl used to the social scene. It’s a very feminine world that I love.”
