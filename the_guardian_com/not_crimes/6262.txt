It’s easy to look at someone’s life and think it’s more perfect than yours. And, with the advent of social media, it’s never been simpler to make comparisons. But what impact is this having?The tendency to feel inadequate largely affects females, according to some studies. A US survey in 2009 found that women are more likely than men to suffer feelings of inadequacy at home and at work, and a larger proportion felt they did not meet their own high standards.Some say this is an attitude that’s ingrained in us from childhood and Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code, has said: “We’re raising our girls to be perfect, and our boys to be brave.” Perfectionism can have serious implications, and there are growing concerns about the health and happiness of girls – in the UK, a Department for Education survey this week found that girls are increasingly experiencing anxiety and depression. Child psychologists have written about the anxiety girls experience due to academic pressures, with many feeling they are not good enough. Concern has also been raised about unattainable (and often Photoshopped) images on social media which lead girls to feel insecure. We want to look at the idea of perfectionism and young women and are keen to hear your stories (you need to be over 16 to submit). Is there now more pressure on women and girls to be perfect in all areas of life – education, work, looks and relationships – and to present a perfect image on social media?Do you worry about your academic performance, or your achievements in the workplace?
