I took this photograph at a Rock Against Racism gig in 1979. The Ruts were playing the West Runton Pavilion in Cromer, and it was rammed and really hot, but also really exciting. Everyone was pogoing and jumping up and down with their fists in the air – it was mayhem.I was near the front when I saw the girl climb up on to the stage and take up that reclining pose between two monitors. It was one of those adrenaline-driven moments when nothing matters apart from getting the shot. So I climbed over everyone’s heads and dragged myself on to the stage in front of the lead singer, Malcolm Owen. I had my two Nikons around my neck and a big old Norman flash and it just went pop. A second later I was in the air and then on my back in the middle of the audience. The bouncer had thrown me off the stage. I still have those cameras and one of them has a big dent from that night.Rock Against Racism: the Syd Shelton images that define an era I’d been involved with Rock Against Racism for several years at this point, taking photographs, doing graphic design for its zine, Temporary Hoarding, and working on the gigs. It was a wonderful mixture of creative types, and you never knew who’d show up for the weekly meetings. Sometimes you’d have the whole of Aswad, Tom Robinson and 30 others. This was the third gig of a tour called Militant Entertainment. The other bands playing were Gang of Four and Misty in Roots. After the success of the big RAR carnivals in London, we’d decided we wanted to do a sort of “circus comes to town” where we took a rogue show of bands all around the country to different venues. I had no idea where Cromer was, but I’d volunteered to drive one of the vans there. It was an old VW Kombi filled with copies of Temporary Hoarding, camera gear, lights and a load of other equipment. When we arrived all we could see was a massive shed on the beach – no houses, no people, no queue for tickets. We thought we’d arrived at the end of the earth. The bands started to arrive, we set up the PA and they did their sound checks but still there were no punters. Then suddenly it was like the cavalry had arrived – a fleet of at least 10 double-decker buses came round the headland with the entire audience.I took a lot of other photos that night, portraits of people and much more studied pictures, but for me this was the one that epitomised punk and in particular punk outside London. It wasn’t the Kings Road, Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren idea of punk – this was DIY punk. The woman in the photograph probably went back to wearing no makeup and normal clothes and maybe working in an office somewhere. I don’t know who she was or what happened to her, but the guy three faces to the left of her recently contacted me to ask for a print. I’d been involved with Rock Against Racism from the very start. I’d been working as a photographer in Australia for four years and when I came back to England I was appalled at the way racism was becoming normalised. There was the Black and White Minstrel Show on Saturday night prime time television; those awful signs were still in windows that said, “No Irish, no blacks, no dogs.” Black people were constantly used as the butt of dumb jokes on television and the National Front was becoming a serious electoral threat. We were lucky with Rock Against Racism because the chemistry was right. Punk and UK reggae were happening at exactly the same time, and they were both rebel music, which made it easy to put the two genres together. Before 1976 in the main black bands played to black audiences and white bands played to white audiences, but RAR changed all of that. And we had a lot of fun. Going to Steel Pulse and Clash gigs was all we wanted to do anyway.  Syd Shelton.
