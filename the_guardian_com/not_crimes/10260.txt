Tim Yeo, a senior Conservative MP, has scored an absolute blinder by asking the prime minister to prove whether he is a "man or a mouse" on the building of a third runway at Heathrow. By reducing such complex political deliberations to these absurdly simple and mildly offensive terms, Yeo has propelled a dying issue to the front page and had the transport secretary Justine Greening on the back foot all morning as she toured the studios at Millbank, looking flustered to say the least.As a rhetorical tactic, the "man or mouse" strategy is fantastic, through hardly new. There is a similarly great line from an ancient Roman satire by Petronius penned almost 2,000 years ago in Nero's day: "Mufrius, non magister", which translates roughly as "You're not a guru, you're a gorilla". The line has much in common with Yeo's: both are contrasts, both are alliterative, both are metaphorical, both are hyperbolical and both are short and simple. Crucially, both also come straight from the language of the playground.That, to me, is the most important point that emerges from Yeo's rhetorical victory today: that the British people all love playground politics. Though we all claim to aspire to a higher form of political debate, the truth is that nothing is guaranteed to get people talking more than a good old-fashioned taunt. It rouses an ancient primeval instinct that lies deep inside all of us: the same instinct that is roused when we hear the distant sound of "Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!" across the playground. Our attention is stolen. We follow the chants. We feel compelled to watch the battle that ensues. We just can't help ourselves.The best politicians know this. Many of the most memorable lines from political history were barely disguised playground taunts: Winston Churchill describing Clem Attlee as a "sheep in sheep's clothing"; Denis Healey saying debating with Geoffrey Howe was like being "savaged by a dead sheep"; Michael Foot, comparing Norman Tebbit with a "semi house-trained polecat". Think about the banter between political leaders in recent years: Blair famously condemning Hague's career with the withering: "You are the weakest link. Goodbye"; Hague's comeback at Blair, "I don't think I would have a reverse gear if I had Peter Mandelson behind me"; or Vince Cable's immortal observation of the remarkable transformation in Gordon Brown, "from Stalin to Mr Bean".We have had equally childish insults over the last year, particularly from Tories to other Tories – Simon Burns called the speaker a stupid, sanctimonious dwarf, while Nadine Dorries was described as "Mad Nad" after she came out and condemned Osborne and Cameron as "arrogant posh boys".One of the most famous episodes of the West Wing entitled Let Bartlet be Bartlet, sees chief of staff Leo McGarry appealing to his team: "We're gonna raise the level of public debate in this country, and let that be our legacy."It's extremely rousing and heartwarming stuff, but of course it's absolute twaddle. The truth is that in political debate there is a trade: the more you elevate debate, the more you exclude people from it.I'm no fan of Tim Yeo: I tend to think of him as everything that is worst about the Tory party – with his highly privileged upbringing, his intertwined business and political interests and his unconventional marital arrangements – but he has at least brought the debate about Heathrow to the masses and for that we should be grateful. Who knows – perhaps his own chief of staff made a McGarry-esque appeal behind the scenes: "Let's have more playground taunts in politics, let's have more puerility in politics, let's have more piss-taking in politics. Let that be our legacy." If it led to a greater interest in politics, it wouldn't be a bad legacy. At least it would get people talking.
