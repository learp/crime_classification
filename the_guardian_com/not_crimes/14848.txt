Samantha Bee has criticized Donald Trump’s first confirmed cabinet choices and rumored candidates as a “parade of misfits, deplorables, zealots and extremists”.On the latest episode of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, the comedian joked that “Donald Trump is assembling a White House staff after Barack Obama has told him that’s a thing presidents have to do.”John Oliver on Trump: 'A Klan-backed misogynist internet troll' is president She spoke about the reality TV star’s controversial choice to hire “white nationalist” Steve Bannon as his top adviser, referring to him as “the milkshake that brings all the deplorables to the yard”.Bee went on to criticize Paul Ryan for refusing to denounce Bannon, after he claimed he couldn’t speak on his extreme views because he didn’t know him.“I guess Paul Ryan’s vigorous vetting process for determining whether someone is bad consists of two questions: have I met them and do they have a private email server?” she said.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest She spoke about the mixture of career politicians and unlikely choices, wondering if this combination would appeal to his voters. “Trump’s so unpredictable, he’s just as likely to elect a rabid possum in hopes that it would bite Katy Tur,” she said. “Sure, the possum’s got zero qualifications but she’s loyal and that’s what matters when you’re staffing your Sopranos pork store on Pennsylvania Avenue.”She also brought up the decision to place many people in positions where they have little direct experience.“This cabinet list isn’t just a liberal’s nightmare – a liberal’s nightmare is running out of almond milk at a brunch party. This is a nightmare for anyone who thinks job candidates should have relevant experience and education beyond the qualification of being named Steve,” she said.There was also time to call out the retired brain surgeon Ben Carson, who is rumored for a high-ranking role in the government.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest “Good news, rocket scientists: Americans will no longer use brain surgeon as a cliche for smart,” she said. “From now on, when we call someone a real brain surgeon, it means semi-conscious political mouth-breather who’s only in the public eye because Republicans think liberals care only about identity politics and will be happy with any rapture-awaiting zombie who kind of looks like them.”She ended with the warning of a “parade of misfits, deplorables, zealots and extremists who, come January, could be packing their bags for the White House”.
