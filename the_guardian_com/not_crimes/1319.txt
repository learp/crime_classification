I read recently about a six-year-old girl falling to her death from a high building in Japan after watching a cartoon featuring children who could fly. It struck a chord because I too, at about the same age (after seeing Peter Pan), tottered on to a high ledge, trying to summon the courage to soar skywards. If I just believed it enough, I told myself, I would be able to fly.I chickened out and was thus more fortunate than the poor Japanese girl, whose belief in her imaginative powers was tragically greater than mine. But I read the news story – although horrified – faintly surprised that such misfortunes don’t happen more often. For, at home, many of us idealise the imaginative powers of our children tremendously and urge them on to ever more fantastical beliefs. We insist on Santa, and fairies and magic, and much more besides, being real. We have an investment in our children’s imaginations remaining fertile, for it is we who mourn when they wake up one Christmas and insist there is no Santa.Childhood was described by Rousseau as “the sleep of reason” and childhood imagination is part of that. We all use imagination, but when we are infants, we are often unable to tell what is real and what is not. This trait rarely has such awful consequences – but the imagination, although charming, has long been held to be dangerous.Thomas Gradgrind in Hard Times put poor Cissy Jupe right about the real nature of horses, about which she entertained romantic thoughts: “Quadruped. Graminivorous. Forty teeth, namely twenty-four grinders, four eye-teeth, and twelve incisive.” Heinrich Hoffmann’s Johnny Head-in-air ended up nearly drowning, a cautionary tale for those who daydream too much. Plato, on whose teaching the English school system was built, thought imagination – eikasia – the lowest function of the soul. Imagination threatens the status quo and pulls mind away from reality.Nowadays we tend, in theory, to value imagination, at least in its creative sense – one of the great vanities we all have about our children is that they are “imaginative” and “creative” (especially, no doubt, in the homes of Guardian readers). At school, however, the authorities seem to be slowly bleeding the imaginative elements out of schooling, pace Plato and Gradgrind: “NOW, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts.” Preferably facts that can be measured and detected and approved by school inspectors and recorded in school league tables. Our fantasies must be snuffed out, certainly by year seven lest they destroy us or distract us from the “real business” of life. For what was the Japanese girl but a real life, fatal version of Johnny Head-in-air?Of course, an excessive imagination can be dangerous. Hitler certainly had one. Whatever the case, we cannot help but lose much of our powers for fantasy as we grow up, replacing them with more adult forms of imagination – imagining the solution to problems, the way other people might react to this or that, even mathematical theorem and possible futures for ourselves. Imagination never reaches a full stop, for to imagine is to be human – but that imagination is, as we grow up, restrained, sharpened, qualified, given direction.The case of the Japanese girl is heartbreaking, but it is also moving in a way beyond that of simple misfortune, rather like the story of Icarus flying too close to the sun. It is a tribute to the strange powers of the human mind, and, despite all its hazards, and efforts of modern educational practice to try to squeeze it out of our children (while, in the modern fashion, paying it lip service) it is a power we must cherish and protect.For imagination, despite all its hazards, is the mind functioning at its most human – or, as perhaps might once have been imagined, most divine.@timlottwriter
