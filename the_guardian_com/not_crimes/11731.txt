The Killers have been announced as the sixth and final headliner for this year’s unwieldily named Barclaycard Presents British Summer Time Hyde Park festival in London.The Las Vegas quartet headline the event on Saturday 8 July, in their only UK festival appearance of the summer. It is four years since their last album, Battle Born, and given they entered the studio last year, it seems likely their fifth album will be out before the festival.Elbow and White Lies will also be on the bill, but perhaps the most intriguing name on the line-up is the return to the London stage of Tears for Fears, playing their first show in the capital for 12 years.Tickets go on general sale on Friday 27 January, with presale dates for fan club members and Barclaycard customers. General admission is £59.50, with assorted ticket packages at six different prices, topping out at £299.90 for “the Ultimate Bar Experience”, which gives you access to a bar serving “Quality Beverages and Cocktails” (their capitals) and assorted other baubles, for those who can’t live without a “commemorative VIP Laminate and Lanyard” (again, their capitals).This year’s other headliners are Phil Collins (30 June), Green Day (1 July), Justin Bieber (2 July), Kings of Leon (6 July) and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (9 July).
