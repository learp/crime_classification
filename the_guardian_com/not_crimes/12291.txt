All the Bright Places by Jennifer Niven is told from the point of view of two characters: Finch and Violet. Violet is still recovering from her sister Eleanor’s death and only acts out the motions of living. Finch falls ‘asleep’ for long periods of time, and has some very suicidal thoughts. They meet on the bell tower where Finch talks Violet away from the ledge, and then Violet does the same for Finch. They are then together for their class Geography project, which is Violet’s first step into living again. The book then follows Finch leading Violet into a new life, while Finch continues to struggle with his own.This book may seem very stereotypical as a romance based on illness, and it is. However, out of all the books I have read with similar plots, this is one hundred percent the best. To start with, I found it much more believable than some others, and it was very well written, covering both points of view very well. I also feel that it covered the topic of mental illness well; displaying the effect of the stigma about it, whilst not letting it dominate the story. In the end, although its plot seems very stereotypical, it is also very original in its own right and so if you enjoy books similar to this, I would thoroughly recommend it.
