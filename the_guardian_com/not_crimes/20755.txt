Can you recommend any service providers?  Guardian staff Adam Croft 13 June 2016 2:05pmHello. I'd recommend any of the editors I've worked with, but it really depends on your style and genre. Some editors prefer to work in particular genres or have specific strengths that would work best for your book. I'd advise finding books similar to yours (ones that are well edited!) and approach whoever the editor and proofreader were.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.08pm BST14:08Adam: 'I set myself daily word counts, and work out a rough estimation of the completion date'Freentglty1 has another question:About the writing itself. Do u have a target time to finish the first draft in? Stephen King once mentioned ‘length of a football season’ as his thumb rule for finish the first draft. Do u have similar time lines?  Guardian staff Adam Croft 13 June 2016 2:04pmYes, I do have my own target times but it's certainly a lot shorter than a football season! I tend to write very quickly and get frustrated if a book takes me too long to complete, so I tend to write quite a lot each day. I set myself daily word counts, and work out a rough estimation of the completion date for the first draft from there. I spend quite a bit of time planning before then, which reduces the editing time dramatically, particularly the self-edit. The finished draft which then goes to my editors is more or less finished from my point of view.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.05pm BST14:05Rachel has also replied to ChloeDawson’s question:   ChloeDawson 13 June 2016 1:29pmDo you think that anybody can be successful with self publishing with only one book, or do you have to have multiple books out?

I was successful with my first book but I think it's getting harder.In general, I would say that sales will get better as you build your followers - but remember to build a mailing list so you can let people know when you have something new.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.04pm BST14:04Freentglty1 says:When I tried self publishing two years ago I found maintaining quality in edit and proofreading to be a big problem. Even when u r willing to spend money finding genuine pros r difficult for these work. Ur advice?  Guardian staff Adam Croft 13 June 2016 1:53pmMy advice would be to look at who those people have worked with before. Find self-published books (or even traditional ones) that are well edited, find out who edited them (the acknowledgements page is a good place to start) and approach them. Remember that anyone can set themselves up as a professional editor: there are no qualifications or standards.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.02pm BST14:02Rachel: 'Independent publishing is a lonely job - my agent is a life-saver'carolynmahony has a question for Rachel:I’ve self published my first novel Cry From The Grave and have two more that I hope to get out this year. I’d love to get some professional help with feedback for structure etc., but it’s so hard to get an agent. How did you get your agent and what do they do if they’re not trying to find you a publisher! Did you get your agent after you’d self published and did that make it easier? What would you suggest I do?  Guardian staff RachelAbbottAuthor 13 June 2016 1:57pmFinding an agent either comes from writing them a query letter and submitting part of your novel (as per all the online instructions) or writing a novel that does extremely well and then approaching (or being approached) by an agent.My agent is a life-saver. Independent publishing is a lonely job - and she provides the support that I need (probably too often). But more than anything she is the person who tells me if my book is good enough to publisher, and reads everything that I write, every idea that I have, etc. She tells me when the pace drops, when my characters are weak - the list is endless. Oh - and the agency has sold translation rights to my book in 20 different languages.Don't knock the idea of having an agent - I think it's the best decision I ever made.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.00pm BST14:00Rachel has also replied to HunkyPants’s question about the difference between going it alone and working with a publisher:  Guardian staff RachelAbbottAuthor 13 June 2016 1:54pmI don't know if Adam has ever worked with a publisher, but I have. I worked with a publisher in the US for my first two books, and it was a pleasure. They were helpful and supportive, and in many ways made life much easier. However, they wanted world rights for the next book, and I wanted to retain my independence in the UK - because it's working for me, and I was very nervous about fixing something that wasn't broken. But it is undoubtedly very hard work.I will always say that for some people - many people, in fact - a traditional deal is the right route. For some it's not. I think it's brilliant for you that you have been picked up, and I wish you ever success with your novel.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.59pm BST13:59Adam: 'You can be successful with just one book — but it's definitely advisable to write more'ChloeDawson asks:Do you think that anybody can be successful with self publishing with only one book, or do you have to have multiple books out? And on that, do sales overall get better every time new books come out?  Guardian staff Adam Croft 13 June 2016 1:46pmHello. You can be successful with just one book — my first one was quite successful — but it's definitely advisable to write more. Yes, sales of other books peak nicely when a new one comes out. Every new book will not only be seen by your existing readers but will also attract a new readership of its own, who'll (hopefully!) go back and read your back catalogue.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.58pm BST13:58DotGumbi has a question for Rachel, who has an agent:How did you acquire your agent? Did they approach you after your book was a hit? Or did you approach them? Was there more than one?  Guardian staff RachelAbbottAuthor 13 June 2016 1:51pmHi - thanks for the question. I was approached by a few agents, but the one that I am now with - Lizzy Kremer of David Higham Associates - is somebody that was recommended to me. I liked her best of all of them because she was perfectly honest. Whilst others were telling me how wonderful my writing was, she told me I could do better - and that suited me just fine. She then edited my first book - which had already sold well over a hundred thousand. And she was right. It was hugely better.I only managed to get an agent after publishing my first book, and its success brought the interest.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.57pm BST13:57A question from Damian Connolly (@divillysausages) on Twitter:Damian Connolly (@divillysausages)@GuardianBooks @adamcroft @RachelAbbott What mainstream newspapers/sites should we cover when getting books reviewed/publicised? tksJune 13, 2016  Guardian staff Adam Croft 13 June 2016 1:50pmI don't bother chasing reviews from newspapers and websites. Many papers and sites do review my books, but they do that entirely off their own bat. Again, it's a case of thinking whether or not the juice is worth the squeeze. For me, reviews don't lead to anywhere near the level of sales I'm looking for so aren't something I actively chase.Adam adds:  Guardian staff Adam Croft 13 June 2016 1:51pmI would add, though, that they're ideal — if not vital — for literary fiction.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.53pm BST13:53Adam: 'I just don't think the vast majority of creative writing courses are the way to go'DasgoodYa asks:Have you completed a creative writing course? If so, would you recommend it?  Guardian staff Adam Croft 13 June 2016 1:49pmI haven't, and I don't recommend them either. I'm sure there are some good ones out there, but most of the ones I've seen are being taught by people who've never had any success in writing (except, perhaps, for their obscure dystopian fiction novel that had a print run of 3,000 copies in 1993) and need to top up the income by teaching. Their methods then box you into their method of writing, which probably isn't all that successful as if it was that good they'd be making their money from writing rather than teaching. I'm generalising, of course, but it does seem to cover 90% of creative writing courses as far as I can see.That's not to say that you don't need to learn the craft. There are some fantastic books and resources out there, and I spend a great deal of time learning the craft. With writing, you're never the polished article. You're always learning and always need to be learning. I just don't think the vast majority of creative writing courses are the way to go.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.51pm BST13:51Rachel has also replied to albertclack’s question:  Guardian staff RachelAbbottAuthor 13 June 2016 1:49pmHi Albert - and that's a really interesting question. It is certainly the case that the number of books 'borrowed' or downloaded as part of Kindle Unlimited is growing. In the early days of this programme, authors got paid 'per borrow or download' but some writers got wise to this and were publishing several short books instead of one long one. Four short books brought four times the income on KU! Amazon changed this to payment according to pages read (yes - Amazon know how many pages you have read of each book!). You are absolutely right that if people are hooked by your book, you will probably now do better with one standard length novel than four short ones - because sales and downloads of full length books are better I believe. The important thing, as always, is writing something that people want to read.The income from borrows or KU is increasing all the time - so you should write what you believe in, and make your books unputdownable.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.50pm BST13:50HunkyPants says:I self-published my first novel last year and it changed my life. Not fiscally, but just my confidence and belief. My 2nd novel has now been picked up by a publisher and will be out in the shops in October.I was just wondering, how did you find the difference between working with a publisher and doing everything yourself?  Guardian staff Adam Croft 13 June 2016 1:45pmHello. I've never worked with a traditional publisher so I can't really say. The closest I've come is my deal with Thomas & Mercer (Amazon), but their model is completely different from a traditional publisher. They're extremely author- and reader-centric, which is a breath of fresh air. It's much closer to the self-published model, with the added bonus that you've got the marketing clout of the world's biggest book-related company behind you.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm BST13:49keithyd says:Adam, fellow Mark Dawson graduate, can you give me a hint how you chose your Audience on FB? I tried the usual Lee Child and James Patterson readers but got nowhere (their audiences are too huge) so I’d be interested to know who you used in your targeting.  Guardian staff Adam Croft 13 June 2016 1:43pmHello. I've used an enormous range of audiences. I've spent six figures on Facebook advertising over the past few months and have something like 20 or 30 audiences running at any given time. I've done everything from tiny audiences to huge ones. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. I'd say experiment and see what works best for you. Don't be afraid to try something different, either. You might be surprised. Good luck!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.47pm BST13:47Adam: 'Don't think 'I need to make this longer so it'll sell better' - think of the reader'albertclack asks:On my tiny scale, I am now earning more from ‘pages read’ by Kindle Unlimited customers of Amazon than from Kindle unit sales. Before this change, it seemed to make sense to aim to write more, shorter books in a series, so that they might cross-sell each other as units. But the KU payment model suggests that, if one’s book is good enough for readers to continue to the end, fewer and longer might pay off. My first one is 500 Kindle adjusted pages. I haven’t even finished writing the second one yet, so admittedly I’m getting a bit ahead of myself! But do you have a view on this, please?  Guardian staff Adam Croft 13 June 2016 1:42pmMy only view is to write your book to its natural length. That's one of the big advantages of self-publishing — there's no publisher asking you to write a specific number of words or pages so it's cheaper for them to print.When you're planning and writing your book, ONLY think of the reader. Don't get down the 'I need to make this longer so it'll sell better', and certainly don't try gaming Kindle Unlimited. You might get a bit more money per download, but you'll get far fewer downloads as you'll be strangling the quality of your book.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.45pm BST13:45madmick53 has a question about adaptations:Is it a good idea to try and market your book to film/TV production companies in the hope that it could be made into a TV series/film?  Guardian staff Adam Croft 13 June 2016 1:38pmHello. A very interesting question. This is a bit of a double-edged sword as it can take up your entire life if you let it. I've had a lot of interest from film and TV companies, but I'd definitely advise getting an agent to handle this for you. I'm always wary of agents and people wanting to take a cut for not doing very much, but on the film and TV side it's vital. If you're thinking of adaptations, there's very little chance they'll pick it up unless your book has already had considerable success and a strongly marketable hook (think elevator pitch!) to work with. I wouldn't say it's necessarily something that should be your priority in terms of a focus for your time and energy, but definitely something to keep brewing in the background as the potential gains to be had are enormous.Rachel says:  Guardian staff RachelAbbottAuthor 13 June 2016 1:42pmI would second Adam's comment that this is something which is far better coming from an agent. I know Adam says he's wary of agents - but my agent is AMAZING and I wouldn't be without her. She adds so much and is the first person to give me her (very) honest opinion on any new work, and she reads and comments several times in the drafting process. But not all agents are the same, I fear. However, if you do have an agent with a film and TV department, they have all the contacts and it's definitely the way to go.Updatedat 1.45pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.43pm BST13:43Christine Gasbjerg, who recently attended a workshop with Rachel in Jersey, asks:How many Facebook ads are you running a day, and for how long? What’s your demographic spread, and how many people will you target for each ad? And how/which people are you targeting?  Guardian staff RachelAbbottAuthor 13 June 2016 1:39pmGood to meet you too, Christine, and thank you for coming all the way from Denmark to my workshop in Jersey! I thought you might have made it home faster than I did – I was stuck for 24 hours because of fog! I think Adam is probably much better placed to answer this than I am, because he has become a bit of a Facebook ads expert, I believe. In my case, I don’t target a specific number of users. I target readers dependent on the types of books they buy, authors they like and where they live (if I have a country-specific promotion). But it’s an area of marketing that I am hoping to learn more about, and will be avidly checking out Mark Dawson’s course on Facebook advertising. Over to Adam, I think!Adam says:  Guardian staff Adam Croft 13 June 2016 1:35pmHi Christine. This changes all the time. At the moment, I'm running very few, but that's because I'm experimenting with some other approaches and need to keep a consistent baseline of sales to measure against. I'm also working on a 'calm before the storm' effect before the release of my next book ;-)In terms of the ads I run when I do run them, they're always changing. I do some to very small, niche groups and some to absolutely enormous ones. Each has its own benefits and disadvantages, and the benefits to you will likely be completely different. I'd say experiment and see what works best for you.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
