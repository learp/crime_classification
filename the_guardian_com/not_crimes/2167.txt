Today sees the launch of the debut collection for Kent & Curwen under the creative direction of Daniel Kearns and in partnership with David Beckham. It’s a heritage brand – and has been for 90 years – but with athleisure dominating menswear, it’s nice to have something a little more … real. Here is our standout piece – a vintage-look sports jersey (which happens to be Beckham’s choice piece).
