Warship 8pm, Channel 4It is little wonder that the world’s navies now seem to be carrying almost as many documentary-makers as they do sailors. Warships are pre-loaded with everything that a reality TV producer usually has to contrive: disparate cast, confined circumstances, difficult and/or peculiar and/or dangerous tasks to accomplish. This three-part series, debuting tonight, puts to sea with the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, the Royal Navy’s current fleet flagship. Andrew MuellerUniversity Challenge 8pm, BBC2The magnificent spectacle of Eric Monkman versus Bobby Seagull was a battle that, in an ideal world, would have been saved for the climax of this quiz. But sadly, this town wasn’t big enough for the both of them. With Seagull dispatched, tonight’s final sees glowering Canadian brainbox Monkman leading his Wolfson College colleagues into battle against Balliol. Cambridge versus Oxford, then. Less David and Goliath, more normal service resumed. Phil Harrison Devon and Cornwall Cops 8pm, ITVTheir two counties form the largest police force area in England, but it’s easier to cover such an expanse when there’s not too much serious crime. The first part of a sunny doc series, filmed last summer, follows the south-west’s crack law enforcers as they deal with the fallout from chaotic road congestion caused by holiday-makers and, on the picturesque Isles of Scilly, prepare for a crucial, top-level royal visit. Jack SealeBroadchurch 9pm, ITVBroadchurch has much to achieve in its penultimate episode, but hurls in yet more dangling loose ends. In fact, it’s starting to interfere with the quality of the narrative, which now feels like a disjointed and rather tawdry game of Guess the Rapist. It’s a shame, because there are still some great moments of drama on offer, notably a show of touching solidarity among the townsfolk in support of Trish Winterman. More of this and fewer red herrings would do it the world of good. Ben Arnold24 Hours in A&E 9pm, Channel 4Another day in London’s busy St George’s Hospital brings a new set of challenges in the superlative fly-on-the-wall documentary. Healthcare play specialist Tracy tries to distract children who’ve been brought in, including eight-year-old Billy, who’s been crushed by falling bricks and Luther, six, who has a washer stuck on his finger. Over in the adult department, Audrey, who’s in her 80s, has hurt her wrist in a fall on holiday. As moving and sensitive as ever. Hannah VerdierPrison Break 9pm, FoxReheated porridge: Prison Break was the surprise global TV hit of 2005 that offered catastrophically diminishing returns before conking out in 2009. Now it’s back, with big lunk Linc (Dominic Purcell) tipped off that his dead brother Michael (Wentworth Miller) is alive but banged up in Yemen. Devious lag T-Bag also returns and, judging by his OTT performance, Robert Knepper is the only one treating this rehash with the disrespect it deserves. Graeme VirtueDetroiters 11pm, Comedy CentralIf Mad Men was a stylised, uneasy window into the world of advertising, then Detroiters is the other extreme – a lewd-yet-breezy buddy comedy about two ad men whose successes are decidedly more modest. Sam Richardson (Veep) and Tim Robinson (Saturday Night Live) find themselves in more ridiculous quandaries this week: the former is mistaken for a prostitute, while the latter continues to sabotage his friend’s chances at love. Hannah J DaviesFilm choice      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   An eerie teenage-rebel horror movie … A Girl Walks Home at Night.A Girl Walks Home at Night (Ana Lily Amirpour, 2014) 11.35pm, Film4A complex and moody tale of teenage vampiric romance, like Tomas Alfredson’s Let the Right One In and Neil Jordan’s Byzantium. But this is set in a fictional Iranian netherworld called Bad City, is shot in cool monochrome and has a macabre sense of humour. Sheila Vand is the girl of the title, given to haunting this near-deserted twilight zone, seemingly in search of blood and love. The latter she finds with Arash Marandi’s wannabe James Dean in an eerie, intelligent, teenage-rebel horror movie.Bloody Sunday (Paul Greengrass, 2002) 10.55pm, Movies4MenMade in the days before he became the Bourne king, this is Greengrass’s vivid, unflinching account of the events of 30 January 1972, when 13 Derry protest marchers were shot dead by members of the Parachute Regiment. The gritty, handheld camerawork and brilliant editing – put to such effective use in the Bourne films – capture the febrile tensions and the carnage of the day.
