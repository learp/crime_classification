The winner: ZootropolisThe Huntsman: Winter’s War may claim bragging rights as the official No 1 movie in the comScore chart, but that’s only down to four days of previews boosting the fairytale adventure’s box office into what is in fact a seven-day opening “weekend”. That leaves Zootropolis as winner over the Friday-to-Sunday period, with £2.37m.Zootropolis review – elegance, wit and first-rate animation With a cumulative total of £18.61m, the Disney animation added £6m over the past seven days, successfully capitalising on the second week of the school Easter holiday. Over the same seven-day period, Winter’s War managed just over £3m – half the Zootropolis box office.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Now that kids are back at school, Zootropolis should slow down in UK cinemas, but it should nevertheless sail past £20m. Last year, Disney Animation’s Big Hero 6 maxed out at £20.7m. In 2011, Tangled scored a comparable £20.5m. Zootropolis should easily overtake, but will of course fall short of Disney’s Frozen, which reached an amazing £40m. Anecdotally, Zootropolis is scoring with adult couples, especially ones in their 20s and 30s, ie not just with family groups – a helpful factor for a strong sustain.The loser: Batman v Superman   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Batman v Superman trailerBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice review – Ben Affleck earns his batwings While Zootropolis fell just 14% from the previous weekend, and Eddie the Eagle just 18%, the drop for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was a steep 51%. That’s a better result than the horrifying 68% fall that the vigilante team-up experienced in its second session, but third-weekend takings of £2.28m compare rather unfavourably with third-frame box office for previous comic-book films. Last year, Avengers: Age of Ultron, which experienced some rather dramatic falls over the course of its run, took £3.51m in its third session. The equivalent number for Avengers Assemble was £4.17m. For The Dark Knight, it was £4.09m, and for The Dark Knight Rises, £4.29m.Batman v Superman has reached £33.3m so far, which is by no means a dismal result. However, relative to expectation, and especially relative to the film’s £14.62m debut, it’s a little underpowered. The question now is whether Zack Snyder’s franchise extension can match Tim Miller’s 15-certificate Deadpool, currently at £37.8m. That’s a topic nobody was pondering at the start of the year, given the perceived value of the second-tier Marvel character compared to the mighty combo of DC’s Batman and Superman.The brand extension: Winter’s War   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Huntsman: Winter’s War trailer - videoThe Huntsman: Winter's War review: dud follow-up to a film no one liked Is it a prequel, sequel or spinoff? Whatever you call The Huntsman: Winter’s War, it’s not clear that audiences were exactly calling for a follow-up to 2012 fairytale exploitation Snow White and the Huntsman. That film debuted in June 2012 with £2.61m, with previews of £976,000 taking the opening tally to £3.59m. This time, the weekend number is £1.58m, with extensive previews of £1.45m taking the opening to £3.03m.Comparing like-for-like weekend periods, Winter’s War has opened 39% below its predecessor, which eventually wound up with £15.8m in UK cinemas. One concern is that box office for sequels is usually more front-loaded, as fans of the first film prove nimble customers for the follow-up, and the burn rate for Winter’s War is likely to be higher than was the case with Snow White and the Huntsman. Strong word-of-mouth, of course, would produce a rosier outcome.The arthouse challenger: Dheepan   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Dheepan star Jesuthasan Antonythasan: ‘I went through 50% of this experience’ – video interviewFor the second weekend in a row, an arthouse foreign-language film has debuted in the UK with a six-figure sum – in this instance, Jacques Audiard’s Dheepan. This follows the Berlin-set, mixed-language Victoria achieving the same feat last weekend, albeit thanks to the boost of preview takings. Dheepan opens here with £108,000 from 48 cinemas, yielding a decent average of £2,255. Previews of £31,000 boost Dheepan’s opening tally to £139,500.Dheepan review – a crime drama packed with epiphanic grandeur While Dheepan’s debut is well down on the UK starts for Audiard’s A Prophet (£312,000 including previews of £22,500) and Rust and Bone (£252,000 including previews of £25,700), both those films opened significantly wider. With Dheepan, distributor StudioCanal faced the challenge that the film’s three lead characters are played by Tamil actors – Jesuthasan Antonythasan, Kalieaswari Srinivasan and Claudine Vinasithamby – who have no profile in the UK. With A Prophet, relatively unknown Tahar Rahim was successfully positioned as a breakthrough star, and he had already earned a Bafta Rising Star award nomination by the time A Prophet opened in UK cinemas. Rust and Bone benefited from a similar narrative around Belgian heart-throb Matthias Schoenaerts, plus Marion Cotillard.Despite the challenge of Audiard’s Cannes Palme d’Or winner for the arthouse audience, Victoria put up a very spirited fight in its second frame, declining just 8% at the box office, albeit with a modest expansion from 34 to 44 cinemas. Takings after 10 days are £266,000.Victoria is certain, and Dheepan highly likely, to crack £300,000 in the UK – a feat achieved last year by only three non-Bollywood foreign language films (Wild Tales, Force Majeure, Timbuktu). With a Pedro Almodóvar picture, Julieta, arriving late summer, and also Oscar winner Son of Saul later this month, commercial prospects for foreign language are looking up here, after a weak 2015.The also-rans   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Midnight Special star Michael Shannon: ‘The US is a desperate environment right now’Distributor eOne will probably be disappointed with the achieved result on Midnight Special, the latest from Jeff Nichols (Take Shelter, Mud). Aiming for crossover success from the indie and smart genre audiences, and with an admired cast including Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton, Kirsten Dunst and Adam Driver, the film was released into a broad 400 cinemas. Debut box office is £466,000, with previews taking the total up to £497,000. Comparisons are hard to make. Mud was a much smaller release here, debuting in May 2013 with £239,000 from 71 cinemas. Take Shelter kicked off with £81,000 from 55 cinemas back in November 2011.Just scraping into the top 10, Hardcore Henry has debuted with £202,000 from 314 cinemas, delivering a weak site average of £643. UK distributor Entertainment Films tends to view the contribution of newspaper and magazine critics rather sceptically when it comes to genre titles, preferring paid marketing communication. So it proved with Hardcore Henry, which screened only to targeted press – presumably calculating that the typical film critic would fail to appreciate a movie that aims to put the viewer inside a shoot-’em-up video game.Given positive-tending reviews in US trade papers the Hollywood Reporter and Variety, as well as a five-star endorsement in Time Out from a New York-based critic, the UK press strategy seems overly cautious in this particular instance. On the other hand, reviews that did appear in the Guardian and Telegraph were negative.The future   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Jungle Book: the trailer – videoDespite those seven days’ takings for The Huntsman, box office overall is 15% down on the previous frame, and 10% down on the equivalent session from a year ago, when Fast & Furious 7 held on at the top spot, and The Duff was the top new release. Cinemas should bounce back this weekend with the arrival of Disney’s The Jungle Book, a seamless blend of live-action and CGI animals, with a few songs from the animated classic thrown in for good measure. Complementing nicely is drone thriller Eye in the Sky, starring Helen Mirren, and action thriller Criminal, with Kevin Costner. Arthouse alternatives include Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Our Little Sister and Jaco van Dormael’s The Brand New Testament, plus Rebecca Ferguson in Despite the Falling Snow.Top 10 films, 8-10 April 1.
