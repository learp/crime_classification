I have to be at work for 4.30am every weekday, so I set the alarm for 10 past four. I’ll have showered and set out my clothes the night before. I have to dress presentably because, straight after the early breakfast show on Radio 2, I do the Radio London breakfast show with guests, and I may be interviewing someone like the prime minister.I always wear matching underwear and a dress, because it’s simple and smart. Ideally, it will have a bit of forgiving Lycra, and it won’t be too high around the neck because, as women of a certain age will confirm, you get too hot most of the time.I leave my house at 4.15am, having put on earrings, perfume and a little makeup. Then, about half past five, while I am talking to the lovely listener or playing a record, I do the rest of the makeup, so that when I arrive at the breakfast show, ready to go on air at 7am, I am properly made up. Looking at my face in the bathroom mirror at 10 past four is enough to make anyone projectile vomit.My hair looks great, though. It has taken many millions of pounds, plus hours of salon time, to achieve what Ulrika Jonsson has naturally. I am spiritually blond. I am the most evangelical fan of the permanent blow-dry, and have it done every seven weeks.How I get ready: David Harewood, actor At night, the earliest I can slope off to bed is about half past 11. I used to crawl into bed at half past six and go to sleep but, because I have a fiance who is 10 years younger and stunningly handsome, I have to be frolicsome every moment of the day!• Vanessa Feltz is on BBC Radio 2 show from 5-6.30am and BBC Radio London from 7-10am every weekday.
