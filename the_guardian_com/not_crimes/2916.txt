The largest annual survey into the views of the UK’s girls and young women has revealed that 36% of seven- to 10-year-old girls say people make them feel like the most important thing about them is the way they look. The Girlguiding Girls’ Attitudes Survey, which saw over 1,500 young people surveyed, also revealed that almost 40% of the same group feel they are not pretty enough, and 25% feel they need to be “perfect”. One in six feel ashamed or embarrassed of how they look.The findings suggest that the problem may be getting worse, with the survey reflecting a five-year decline in girls’ body confidence. Almost 40% of girls aged seven to 21 do not feel happy with how they look in 2016, compared with 27% in 2011.

When I visit schools around the country as part of my work with the Everyday Sexism Project, I am constantly struck by the emphasis on girls’ body image in conversations with young women. Even at the age of just 12 or 13, girls already know that we live in a world where women are judged, first and foremost, not on their abilities or achievements, but how closely they match up to an unrealistic, media-mandated beauty standard. They feel, deeply, that they must strive to emulate the tall, thin, white, large-breasted, long-legged, glossy-haired, perfect-skinned models they see everywhere in adverts and magazines. They specifically reference the women they have seen online, from the unrealistic body shapes of pornography to “perfect Instagram girls”. Dieting and slimming tablets frequently crop up in conversation.At one school, I handed out worksheets to a group of 12- to 14-year-old boys and girls, asking them to draw two pictures: “me now” and “me if I could change anything”. The worksheets that came back from the boys were varied, with some showing that boys, too, are clearly affected by pressures around idealised male body image. But the responses demonstrated that boys also had a wide variety of other ideas for improving their lives – from money to magical powers. The responses from the girls, however, were heartbreaking. The same picture came back again and again – a sausage-like drawing of a girl in the first box, and a stick figure in the second. They just wanted to be thinner.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘Body image dissatisfaction certainly has an impact on mental health … It impacts girls’ careers and long-term view of themselves.’It is striking that the Girlguiding report comes just days after the release of another inquiry, which found that over 12% of young women aged 16-24 screen positive for post-traumatic stress disorder, 20% for self-harm, and that almost 30% have some kind of mental health condition. While it would be over-simplistic to draw a direct line between the two studies, social media, with all its attendant body-image pressure and appearance-based abuse, was again cited by the mental health inquiry as a potentially major contributing factor. Evelyn Greeves, a 17-year-old Girlguiding advocate, told me: “[Body image] certainly has an impact on mental health … It impacts girls’ careers and long-term view of themselves, because we’re saying to girls the most important thing about them is that they’re pretty – not that they’re clever or creative or good at sports, but that they’re pretty. I think it does hold a lot of girls back.” She, too, believes that social media has a major impact, because: “It’s all about putting up pictures of yourself and people can like and comment on those pictures. It encourages people to think about themselves solely in terms of looks and how many Likes – it’s a way of rating themselves almost.” And, says Greeves, the online world magnifies the wider objectification of women “into something that’s constantly present. The internet isn’t something you can just turn off and not look at – especially for young people.”
