Whereas next month’s Oscars are expected to see a procession of white heterosexual men collecting statuettes as 2015’s films are feted, not one has been spotted on a podium picking up a major British award for fiction or poetry in a year when diversity, for once, ruled. As well as concluding the 2015 literary prize season, Frances Hardinge’s success (see interview, page 15) this week in winning the Costa book of the year award confirmed its status as a bad one for men.Frances Hardinge: 'To be following in the footsteps of Philip Pullman is pretty amazing' Only Marlon James’s victory in the Man Booker prize prevented a female clean sweep in the top prizes for imaginative writing, with the others going to Ali Smith (Baileys prize for women’s fiction), Claudia Rankine (Forward poetry prize for best collection), Sarah Howe (TS Eliot poetry prize) and Hardinge.Ian McKellen observed this week that “no openly gay man has won an Oscar”. If Steve Silberman, who won the Samuel Johnson prize for non-fiction, is added, three of the six – also including James and Smith – are gay. Howe is mixed race (“half-Chinese, half-English”), while James and Rankine are both African-Caribbean.Anyone looking for further pointers for the 2016 season may note that living or working in the US seems to be auspicious (true of Silberman, Howe, James and Rankine, the latter trio having academic posts there).TS Eliot prize row: is winner too young, beautiful - and Chinese? Where betting on their prizes was possible, the winning authors were invariably underrated. James’s A Brief History of Seven Killings was a 4/1 shot, third-placed after the short-odds favourite, Hanya Yanagihara’s A Little Life. Silberman’s Neurotribes similarly lagged behind shortlisted books by Robert Macfarlane and Emma Sky. Sarah Waters was odds-on to take the Baileys prize, relegating Smith’s How to Be Both to 3/1 second favourite.Only Hardinge, though, was an outsider: of the five Costa category winners vying for the overall award, her children’s novel The Lie Tree was – perhaps precisely because it was a children’s novel, the genre having last won in 2002 – the joint back-marker on 5/1.
