Few musicians of his generation recorded more prolifically than Neville Marriner. He made his first discs as an orchestral player in the 1950s, first with the Philharmonia and then as principal second violin of the London Symphony Orchestra, under conductors such as Herbert von Karajan and Pierre Monteux. But it was after he founded the Academy of St Martin in the Fields in 1959, initially with the musicologist and harpsichordist Thurston Dart, that Marriner’s recording career really took off. Here’s a brief chronological sample of some of the best of them – my personal choice, and by no means definitive!Neville Marriner: The Early Recordings (1961-63)Marriner and Dart founded ASMF primarily to explore the baroque repertoire, long before it was colonised by the period-instrument movement. Their first discs, with Marriner conducting and leading the orchestra, appeared on the L’Oiseau-Lyre label and were mirrors of their early concerts, with concerti grossi by Albinoni, Locatelli and Corelli, as well as Telemann and Handel.Stravinsky: Pulcinella; Apollon Musagète (1968)By the end of the 1960s Marriner was gradually giving up his playing role in the ASMF to concentrate on conducting. This change of emphasis allowed him and his orchestra the freedom to tackle an ever widening range of chamber-orchestra repertoire. This wonderfully recorded Stravinsky collection, together with the Tippett disc below, were early examples of how versatile they had become.Vivaldi: The Four Seasons (1969)Neville Marriner and ASMF: Vivaldi’s Four SeasonsPerhaps the ASMF’s most successful recording commercially, with Alan Loveday as the solo violinist in Vivaldi’s best known work, it sold over half a million copies, and has hardly been out of the catalogue since. Even now, almost half a century later, it remains one of the finest recorded versions of The Four Seasons on modern instruments.Tippett: Concerto for Double String Orchestra; Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, etc (1972)It was Peter Hall’s famous film of Ronald Blythe’s Akenfield that really established Tippett’s Corelli Fantasia as one of the classics of the string-orchestra repertoire. Marriner’s recording was used on the soundtrack; few versions of the fantasia since have come close to matching its richness and eloquence.Mozart: Piano Concertos (1971-1978)Alfred Brendel forged a close partnership with Marriner and the ASMF for the cycle of the Mozart piano concertos he recorded for Philips in the 1970s. Their unobtrusively stylish accompaniments provide the perfect foil to Brendel’s typically direct performances.Rossini: Overtures (1975)Even today many of Rossini’s operas are rarely performed, but in the 1970s, when Marriner recorded the overtures to all of them in a box set for Philips, they were even less often heard. It remains a real treat, with familiar pieces, such as the overtures to William Tell and The Thieving Magpie, juxtaposed with sparky performances of music that no one but Rossini freaks are likely to have heard before.Maw: Life Studies (1978)Now reissued alongside Marriner’s later recording with the Philharmonia of Richard Rodney Bennett’s cantata Spells, on texts by Kathleen Raine, Nicholas Maw’s set of eight studies for 15 solo strings was composed for ASMF, who gave the first performance of these unashamedly neo-romantic pieces in 1973.Così fan Tutte (1990)Neville Marriner/Mozart’s Cosi fan Tutte (1990)Marriner made relatively few complete opera recordings, but in the 1980s he did record a Mozart cycle for Philips. The Così, perhaps, stands out; it has a superbly matched cast, headed by Karita Mattila and Anne Sofie von Otter, Francisco Araiza and Thomas Allen, and underpinned by Marriner’s thoroughly traditional but always crisp and attentive conducting.Mendelssohn and Bruch: Violin Concertos (1988)Joshua Bell became music director of ASMF in 2011, only the second in the ensemble’s history. But the link between Marriner and his successor had been forged more than 20 years earlier when Bell made his first recording of the two most popular violin concertos in the repertory with Marriner conducting.Elgar: Symphony No 1; In the South (1991)Marriner was always a great champion of 20th-century British music, and as well as the Tippett and Maw releases listed above, he made some treasurable discs of Butterworth, Vaughan Williams and their contemporaries. The Elgar symphony, performed with a heftily expanded ASMF, is a bit of a surprise, it’s a wonderfully rich, expansive account, often underrated.
