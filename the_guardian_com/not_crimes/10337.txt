The theatre designer Tom Piper, who created the field of scarlet poppies at the Tower of London in 2014 with the ceramic artist Paul Cummins, will this week commemorate the strangest chapter in the history of the Brighton Pavilion, when it became a hospital for Indian soldiers wounded in the first world war.It is Piper’s first major outdoor commission since he and Cummins installed thousands of ceramic poppies at the Tower, each marking a casualty in the first world war. Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red became a public sensation, with thousands of people queueing for hours to see it and a petition launched to keep it in place for longer than originally planned. Parts of the installation have been on tour ever since, most recently in Orkney.

The gardens will also be filled with music, soundscapes, actors reciting words written by some of the soldiers to their faraway homes, and a film projected nightly on to the walls of the pavilion. There will also be linked concerts of Indian music and of western music performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra.The installation has been created by Piper together with Ajay Chhabra, artistic director of the performing arts company Nutkhut. Chhabra’s grandfather came from the Punjab, home to many of the Indian soldiers. Between 1914 and 1916 more than 2,000 Indian soldiers who were wounded on the western front were brought to the temporary hospital in the pavilion.

What is entirely missing from the record is the wives, sisters and sweethearts the men were writing back to. We have tried to put all of these voices back into the narrative.”Piper said the event was free and open every evening to everyone, allowing visitors to wander in for five minutes or stay for hours and immerse themselves in the experience. “We hope we will encourage visitors to make the human link across the century with these nameless men who found themselves so far from home in such strange surroundings.”The world premiere of Dr Blighty runs from 24 to 28 May, 2pm to 10pm, at the Royal Pavilion Gardens, Brighton.
