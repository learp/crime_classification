But the two become involved in a nefarious kidnapping plot.It’s from director Jonathan Levine, who was behind Seth Rogen’s Christmas comedy The Night Before, and scripted by Katie Dippold, whose work includes The Heat and Ghostbusters.

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Schumer said that she was focused on getting her in the movie.“I met [Hawn] on an airplane a couple of years ago and told her there’s a movie I really want to make with her,” she said. “And she was very nice. ‘OK, honey.’ She probably thought I was a psycho. ‘OK, crazy person.’ Then I’d meet her at different things, saying, ‘We’re making this movie together,’ and I think, eventually, some people got in her ear and told her I wasn’t crazy, that I make things.”The film’s already received some negative publicity after the pair released a tribute to Beyoncé’s Formation video earlier this year. Some claimed they were guilty of cultural reappropriation, which Schumer denied. “If you watched it and it made you feel anything other than good, please know that was not my intention,” she said. “The movie we made is fun and the women in it are strong and want to help each other. That’s what it was about for me.”The film was fast-tracked after Schumer’s first lead role in Trainwreck was a surprise hit, with the film making $140m worldwide from a $35m budget.
