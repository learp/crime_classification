Matt Haig: 'As therapy shows, words can be medicine' Is it strange that an author who has been very open about his experiences with depression (and, indeed, wrote an entire book about them) should have written one of the most beautiful, most hopeful books of recent years? Well, no – if there’s one thing you need buckets of to plough through depression, it’s hope. And Matt Haig is an expert on both.His novel The Humans looks at our species through the eyes of an alien, sent to Earth to possess a mathematician who has proved the Riemann hypothesis, and destroy all evidence of his discovery. The advanced alien race believes it is safest for the universe at large if advanced mathematical knowledge is kept out of human hands. Really, given our track record with ever bigger bombs, it isn’t a silly argument. It​ is easy to forget just how wonderful we can be ... Haig dwells on this wonder While the book hinges on the belief that humanity is irresponsible, violent and a bit stupid, bear with me: we’re getting to the hopeful part. The unnamed alien, disguised as mathematician Andrew Martin, learns that there is more to us than a broad brush can show. He discovers, through interactions with Martin’s unfulfilled wife, Isobel and his troubled teenage son, Gulliver, that individual humans are capable of wonders.In the current political climate, it is easy to feel enormously unhopeful about the state of the human race. We buy into fear-mongering far too quickly. We are possessive and defensive and reluctant to share whatever power we manage to scavenge. We let the planet slowly boil while obsessing over selfies and celebrity gossip. We can be infinitely frustrating. Truly, as the alien discovers, dogs – a “hairy domestic deity”, as he calls them – are a far nicer species than humans.It is easy, under the weight of overwhelming evidence that we are terrible, to forget just how wonderful we can be, as can the universe. Haig dwells on this wonder, marvelling at how unlikely life is, both in the broader sense and on an individual level. Everyone on Earth is the result of ever-dwindling odds through thousands of generations – and yet here we all are, sharing a planet together.Haig doesn’t obscure the flaws of humans or dress them up as something pretty: we are all a mess of strengths, weaknesses and contradictions that form a (mostly) complete person. In becoming a human himself, the alien at the heart of The Humans begins to appreciate our complexities, perhaps better than we do, with the luxury of perspective. And our privileges, too: the alien has no knowledge of love.At its heart, The Humans is a love story but it isn’t a romance. The alien begins to fall in love with Martin’s wife, which is captured by Haig in a way that makes love – something we’re all so used to that we barely notice it any more – seem like magic. But the alien also comes to love Martin’s son, Gulliver, and his dog, Newton, and peanut butter, and the poems of Emily Dickinson, and the Beach Boys. Love is not always a last-minute airport dash; it can be something more normal, less noticeable. But The Humans notices it, and forces the reader to recognise it in themselves and the world around them.In a recurring motif in the book, Haig reminds us that the average human life is 30,000 days long. In a bravura list of advice towards the end of the book, he tells us how to make the most of these days: through love, creation, curiosity, beauty and generosity, to yourself and others. That was the moment for me; after tackling the book in one sitting, I finished it in a flood of tears, feeling a swell of gratitude and hope. If you don’t feel an emotional tug at your heartstrings when you’re reminded of all the remarkable possibilities of humanity, then you’ve read this book incorrectly. Or you’ve never owned a dog.
