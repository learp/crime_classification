It would be an understatement to say rapper MIA is no stranger to controversy. But her strikingly transparent candidness is part of her global appeal. Perhaps a little too transparent sometimes, as is the case with her latest PR snafu in the Evening Standard, when a reporter asked her for her thoughts on Beyoncé’s black power salute during the 2016 Super Bowl half-time show. She replied: “It’s interesting that in America the problem you’re allowed to talk about is Black Lives Matter … Is Beyoncé or Kendrick Lamar going to say Muslim Lives Matter? Or Syrian Lives Matter? Or this kid in Pakistan matters? That’s a more interesting question.”Singer MIA faces criticism for comments on Beyoncé and Black Lives Matter  Cue backlash now. And rightfully so – what she said is clumsy, misdirected and shows a deeper lack of understanding of the nuances of both black identity and Muslim identity. The binary she uses to pit Muslims and African Americans against each other is nothing new, but rather a tired trope that effectively sidelines two marginalized communities from both the national discourse and the narrative of their own struggle. The truth is, the struggle of blacks in America and the struggle of Muslims in the Middle East are not as disparate as one might think, and the place where some of the most vibrant intersections and dialogues between the two are taking place right now is in MIA’s own musical genre, hip-hop.There’s no denying Islam’s pivotal role in the formation of hip-hop, which was born out of New York in the early 70s as an artistic and socio-political movement. Its timing came right at the heels of the civil rights movement, during a huge push to reclaim racial identity. Islam not only played a vital role in politicizing hip-hop and shaping its culture, its language was infused into prominent themes within rap lyrics – such as anger at government indifference, urgency for creating your own cultural-political space, and challenging power dynamics and structures of domination. The binary she uses to pit Muslims and African Americans against each other is nothing new, but rather a tired trope Hip-hop was raised in the Bronx, but it came of age when its influence extended beyond New York. Its spread isn’t so much a result of American commercialism, but a product of its collaborative and transnational themes of social justice and identity politics. Rap is currently the fastest growing music genre in the Middle East – an area where frustrated youth have become a disaffected majority. For them, hip-hop – and its roots of African American struggles – is an accessible yet multicultural vernacular: one where beats and rhyme flow as both nonviolent resistance against dictatorship and a globalized call for unity and action.“Hip-hop ain’t dead, it never died,” according to Egyptian hip-hop trio Arabian Knightz. “It just moved to the Middle East where the struggle’s still alive.” And with that, a subversive dialogue – one that includes Tupac Shakur, Langston Hughes and Malcolm X as integral nuances within the poetic and oral traditions of Arab culture. It’s “street journalism”, as Syrian rapper Omar Offendum puts it. In the Middle East, hip-hop is not seen as Arabic tradition versus black tradition; it’s seen as one global tradition, unified through the common cause of fighting against structural injustice. People tend to rally around issues rather than ideology. The same issues of police brutality, racial profiling and minority oppression that Public Enemy and NWA rapped about in the 80s aren’t only happening in America. Since its inception, Black Lives Matter has aligned itself in solidarity with struggles of Muslims in the Middle East, particularly Palestine, where activists in Gaza aligned themselves in solidarity with protesters in Ferguson.Throughout the world, marginalized communities look to the African American struggle as a role model in how to demand equality, freedom, justice and self-determination. And they look to its messages as guidance for effecting change by resisting the status quo. It’s in this light that we can expand on Black Lives Matter as not just a movement against the litany of oppression directed at a singular American population – but as a living account of social resistance against arbitrary political control and economic exploitation. Which is why you can’t take the reductive route and question why Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar support blacks over Muslims. That value judgment is not MIA’s or anyone else’s to make. Otherwise, you play right into the hands of the systematic oppression you claim to be fighting in the first place. Saying “black lives matter” doesn’t devalue Muslims’ struggles; it opens the door for meaningful cultural exchange – one where globalization can help redraft identity and reclaim self-determination in a community’s own nuanced terms.
