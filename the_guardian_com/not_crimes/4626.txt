Here are a few:1) Why is it so difficult for you to have an edit button on comments?One of our moderators explained the answer to this one, saying: “If users were able to edit each comment it would create an unmanageable workload as we would either have to recheck everything or leave comments edited comments unmoderated. “2) Why do couples on Blind Date always say at the end “We might meet but perhaps as friends, or something to that effect”?The Opinion section’s Toby Moses had some rather novel views on that. He said: “Because Guardian readers participating on Blind Dates are too polite to just say: ‘lolz, of course not, I don’t fancy them at all, they eat like a pig, and anyway, I’ve got a boyfriend’.” Make of that what you will.

Government, business etc have moved on from the science bit. We're now into strategy and the what to do part. Having a climate change sceptic opinion on a show now just turns it into a comedy. Broadcasters and the media won't want to not be taken seriously so will increasingly stop giving voice to climate change sceptic views unless they're after comedy.   Richard E A Smith 19 August 2016 3:05pmIt's miserable realising that our behaviour is destroying billions of years of life on earth. However at least we can poke fun at cretins like Roberts. Cox is particularly good at it. He tore the idiot apart. It doesn't make me feel any better though to think that these lizards will no doubt be the first to run off to Canada and Scandinavia once it all hits the fan. With characters such as these no doubt it'll never be women and children first. They've made selfishness an art form.   kumano 19 August 2016 2:52pmIn the future, as Roberts continues to make demonstrably false claims, the Guardian and other media outlets will need to think carefully about how much attention to give him.You'd normally say give him enough rope and he'll hang himself, but it's become a tenet of faith for denialists and every story that features one, no matter how ludicrous and demonstrably false, reinforces their prejudicesThe BBC faces the same problem. Despite 97% agreement in the scientific community, they still give 50/50 airtime to deniers in the name of 'balance' Sadly you can't argue against faith with facts, see the Brexit debate for that with its sneering dismissal of 'so-called experts'Updatedat 3.11pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.40pm BST14:40Brian Cox v climate change denierMichael SlezakFrom Australia, Michael Slezak writes about an interjection from British scientist Brian Cox this week that got you talking – and the ethics of reporting on climate change denial. ‘I brought the graph’: Brian Cox refutes claims of climage change denier on Q&AHaving Malcolm Roberts in the Australian parliament creates a challenging situation. He espouses views that are both potentially dangerous and demonstrably false. For example, as we reported in this story, Roberts continues to argue that Nasa has manipulated temperature data in collaboration with every other relevant science agency including the UK Met Office and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Normally, these views would simply not be reported. But as an elected parliamentarian, it is important that he is scrutinised and understood by the public. The ABC put him on the panel, but had Brian Cox on as well, who was well-equipped to refute some of what Roberts said. In the future, as Roberts continues to make demonstrably false claims, the Guardian and other media outlets will need to think carefully about how much attention to give him. The outrageousness of what he says makes for entertaining and very highly read stories. But is it a mistake to give him more air time than sensible (and potentially boring) politicians, just because he says such outrageous things?What do you think of Cox’s interjection?Updatedat 2.47pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.23pm BST14:23More comments on the night tube and its implications.   John O'Donnell 19 August 2016 2:17pmShift workers will be pleased, no more sitting with nutters on the night bus.I got on a night bus at 4:00am once, early work start. What amazed me was, there is a community of people, in all different jobs, that all know each other, because they all get the same bus, every day, to work.It was rather refreshing, these wildly different people all chatting away, asking about each other's kids.   SnowyJohn 19 August 2016 2:28pmI think it will help get rid of the late night rush you suddenly get when everyone in central London realises it's about 12:30am and they need to get to a Tube Station, fast.Also, the fact it's the Victoria Line and Central Line to start with seems sensible - it means an awful lot of Londoners from all compass points can get to one of the other compass points pretty well, even if they have to add on a Nightbus journey at the other end.I will still never forget the joys of a 3am journey home on the N29, though.Updatedat 2.31pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.15pm BST14:15'Night time is not all about London you know'Matthew Holmes   mirrorman53 19 August 2016 7:22amLondon,always London,is there nowhere else in the UK?We hear you, mirrorman (and others)!

But what’s worth staying up for?1) Mirth, Marvel and Maud in Walthamstow (Victoria line): a first-rate restaurant and cocktail bar, open until 2am at weekends.2) Oval Space sister venue The Pickle Factory near Bethnal Green (Central line): for fans of leftfield electronica and discerning ravers. 3) The Dogstar, Brixton (Victoria line): Tonight’s event MAGICROBOT features hip-hop, house and “your terrible requests”.If you are in London or visit often, what are you most looking forward to doing now there’s a night tube?

Here are some of my favourite stories:Anoosh Chakelian at the New Statesman on the horror of the Olympics marriage proposal.The Atlantic about the dark side of being an Olympic championThis response from the (female) Swedish women’s football coach who was asked if she would be capable of coaching the male team is worth remembering.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.29pm BST13:29One reader's picks of the weekAfter referencing the discussion about airline food, this comment speaks for itself:   Tenthred 19 August 2016 1:23pmI haven't been on a plane for over fifteen years, so - though I agreed with the article that it's a useful distraction and also a fun thing in the context - that wasn't my favourite story this week on the Guardian.My two favourites this week were:The Lost Cities . Everyone BTL was praising this whole series, and sad that this (excellent) one was the last. More of this kind of thing, please, Graun!And the picture essay, That's Yer Lot, was wonderful too. It was much discussed at our allotments, where we were very impressed by their plots. Just a pity this wasn't a Guardian Witness thing, or even with a comment thread - the other times there have been articles on allotment sites, the comments have added hugely to the whole thing. And allotments brings me to sheds. I know this thread is about the news that has been already this week, but the Shed of the Year is on the allotment-friendly budget category on C4 tonight (8pm) and I think the winner is announced this evening as well. The Guardian had a picture piece as usual at the start of the competition, and I hope there'll be an article on the winner and any hints we can get from this year's entries. In politics news, I'm still reeling from Owen Smith's idea of getting IS round the table. Corbyn sitting on the floor on a train pales into insignificance beside that, although I think Corbyn gets points from me for that - as for anything else in comparison with the entirely redacted Owen Smith.Do you agree?

Karaka 19 August 2016 12:42pmPlane food is not free, the cost is included in the ticket. I know it's ironic to talk about environmental impact when you are on a plane, but airline food must cause a huge amount of waste. How much can be recycled? Taking your own food on-board is also quite complicated flying long haul to places like Australia and NZ which have very strict bio-security laws concerning bringing any food item into the country.And here’s another reason to welcome it ... the distraction.   leoates 19 August 2016 12:44pmFlying long haul I enjoy the distraction, the expectation, the examination, the tasting, and the rejection wanting rid of it so you can do something else such as read your book or play solitaire until something else occurs if anything breaks up the long hours spent in an ever warming thin tube while you and others share viruses and bacteria.
