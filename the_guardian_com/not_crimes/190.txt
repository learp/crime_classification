We’re back for one last ‘Wake up with the Guardian’ broadcast from the GameCity festival in Nottingham. All this week games editor Keith Stuart and writer Jordan Erica Webber have been broadcasting chat shows from the National Videogame Archive, interviewing developers and industry veterans and generally getting up too early. For the final show we’re joined by Molly Carroll from Chucklefish Games, the creators of Starbound – and Lucy and Shaun from Dangerous Kitchen, creators of De Mambo. We’re live on Twitch from 9am(ish)!
