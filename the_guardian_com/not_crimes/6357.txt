The French website behind a 46-second video recipe for carbonara lambasted as a “horror show” in Italy is an editorial partner of Italian pasta maker Barilla, which paid the site to use its products.Days after Carbonaragate first broke, Barilla said it asked Demotivateur to remove the offending video, saying the website had gone “too far” in its interpretation of the classic Roman dish.Carbonara wars: why Italy is right to be mad about a French farfalle travesty The controversy began when Demotivateur published a video for a one pot carbonara on its YouTube channel that clearly used Barilla’s farfalle pasta. Apart from the use of farfalle – Italians only use spaghetti or rigatoni when they make carbonara – the idea of cooking carbonara in one pot is in itself a major faux pas, because it means the critical ingredient of guanciale (a variety of bacon) is being boiled, instead of sauteed in a pan. The recipe also used onions and creme fraiche – each a no-no for a true Roman – and the dish was topped with a single raw egg yolk. While carbonara does call for raw egg yolk, the egg is essentially cooked when it is vigorously stirred into the hot pasta dish moments before it is served. As with many seemingly simple Italian dishes, the trick with carbonara is perfecting the sauce – made of egg, pecorino, pepper and just the right amount of water – in order to avoid making the dish look like a plate of scrambled eggs with spaghetti.When the video was first published, Barilla commented directly on Demotivateur, saying it was open to various interpretations of carbonara but that the version in question was going “too far”. The company seemed especially offended that the recipe used boiled bacon, noting its displeasure with an emoticon of a disgusted face.The video has since been taken down, but featured in newspaper articles including a front page column in Italian daily La Repubblica, accusing the French of destroying in just 46 seconds a dish that symbolised Italian traditions. In a full-page spread inside, Repubblica then published its own recipe – requiring a separate bowl, a pan and a pot for the spaghetti – a list of eight “secrets” on how to perfect the dish, an interview with a Tunisian chef from Roscioli restaurant in Rome on how to make the dish and another article about the true origins of carbonara, which are disputed.Barilla insisted that the video was not a paid advertisement, but acknowledged that Demotivateur was an editorial partner. It said such partners agree to use a company’s products in exchange for money, but have leeway to be creative with the types of dishes they make. In this case, Barilla said, Demotivateur was “just not right”. “This is why we had it removed and published what is the video of a correct carbonara,” said Luca Di Leo, a spokesman for Barilla.
