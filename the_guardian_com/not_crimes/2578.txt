Angelika, 61 ‘Loneliness is a state of mind: it means there’s something empty in yourself’Loneliness is something I reflect on a lot. I have no children, I’ve never married, and I chose that because I was inspired by the independent life. I often suffer from loneliness; today for instance, I’ve come to the park because I was feeling lonely. Also, there have been times in my life when I’ve experienced grief and loss and I’ve been more in touch with loneliness – when my mother died, when some of my friends moved away.But loneliness is really a state of mind and it doesn’t depend on other people: it means there’s something empty in yourself. Many people are surrounded by friends and still feel lonely, but if your mind is clear and you’re positive about life, you’re not lonely. I think it’s important to connect with your own feelings; we all have times of feeling lonely and we’re scared of those feelings, so we watch telly or we drink or do anything to swallow it down.I’m not alone, but I’ve chosen not to have a family, to grow old alone, to deal with myself. I wanted to explore an inner stillness, the simplicity of just being. From a Buddhist perspective, we would say our true nature is within us, not outside us. I’m a meditation teacher, so I’ve explored that for 35 years and I’m still a beginner.Vilhelm, 52: ‘In a city, loneliness can be quite a disease’       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’m a writer, which is a solitary job, but I love being alone and I’ve come to understand how to live with it. Years ago, when I first moved here, I suffered from depression; I was diagnosed with HIV in 1995 and I dealt with it by packing my bags and moving from South Africa to London, quite suddenly. Since the end of apartheid, I haven’t found it easy to write, but I hope to release 20 books this year – I’m getting it all down. In a big city like London, loneliness can become quite a disease. The answer is to try to make your peace with it – I sometimes don’t understand why people can’t work out how to be alone. I’ve got many lonely friends; they’re always asking me to go 10-pin bowling, to the cinema, the theatre. If anything, I have too many; I’m always trying to get away from them.Anonymous: ‘When I moved to London it was a heavy time’In the past, when I was under a lot of pressure from what I call “the storm of life”, I was often lonely. I come from Morocco and I’ve lived all over Europe, but when I moved to this country in 2005 it was a heavy time. I was getting involved in things, and when I was released from jail my house had no roof. I was squatting, living in a tent. Homelessness causes depression, and when you’re homeless you see loneliness everywhere. I’ve been mistreated, attacked with dogs, handcuffed – I was put in a secure unit for 11 months and on enforced medication. Nowadays, when I spend the day on my own, everything is peace. Sometimes I’m thinking being alone is the best way to survive, because people don’t give you shit. AnonymousSonja, 27: ‘I had to force myself to meet people, talk to people, but I’m glad I did’       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’ve lived in four countries and of all the places I’ve lived, London is the most isolating. There are so many exhausted people, everyone is carrying their own parcel of pressure and everyone is so busy. That includes me – I’m interning at Amnesty International, studying for an MA in international development in the evenings and I work as a receptionist at a pilates studio. It’s hard to learn to come out of hedgehog mode, to arrange things with people, but you need little lights in the dark tunnel ahead.When I first moved here, I came with my boyfriend, but we broke up and that was very tricky; I only knew two people here and they were always working. I had to learn to force myself to meet people, talk to people, but I’m glad I did. One of my tricks was to always make myself go out, see new places, still do activities I’d do with friends. Then at least you’re not sitting alone, waiting for someone on a white horse to come by. Social media can be helpful, but not all social media. WhatsApp and Skype are great: Facebook is terrible – it makes you lonelier. It is really difficult to move to a new place with a new language, but it teaches you to be resourceful and independent, and you’re so much stronger after you’ve done it. That’s a strength that nobody can take away from me.Maria (not her real name): ‘Look at yourself and focus on the things that really make you happy. You have to work at it’       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I used to be lonely, but I didn’t realise that what I was going through wasn’t loneliness caused by not having other people around me – it was about myself, about my own fulfilment. After the recession, I had a lot less money, and generally speaking it takes a lot of money to enjoy yourself in London, but because of those changes in my life I came to realise things about my own ambition and drive.So I have started to live my life differently, more authentically. I’m trying to develop good habits and only do things that truly make me happy. This has been during the past few months and since I started I have felt much less alone, like I’m finally going somewhere.That’s the advice I’d give to anyone who was feeling lonely: look at yourself, focus on the things that are really going to make you happy. You have to work at it.Andrea, 39: ‘I spend a lot of time with my loneliness; I’ve learnt to sit with it… trying to escape it makes it worse’      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’ve lived on my own for six or seven years now and it has its advantages. The energy that you would spend on others, you spend on yourself, but the longer you live alone, the harder it is to live with other people. The other disadvantage is loneliness and loneliness is undeniable. People feel vulnerable admitting that they feel lonely, but I don’t see the term lonely as an insult. I experience it and I imagine it’s the norm, especially here in London. It’s not that I don’t have friends – I am proud of my friends and satisfied with my social life. I have good friends and I feel lonely. It’s a general state.I spend quite a lot of time with my loneliness; I’ve learned to sit with it. In the past, when I’ve tried to escape it by going out and socialising, I usually make things worse and I feel even more lonely, so paradoxically it’s better to be alone.I watched a David Attenborough documentary the other day and there was a polar bear on the ice, searching for a mate. The aerial camera zoomed out and there were miles of ice in every direction. This top predator suddenly didn’t seem so strong anymore. Animals spend so much of their lives alone and I think it’s a part of the human condition as well.Jessie, 36: ‘Most people only ever ask you about your baby’        Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Having a baby can be very isolating, especially if you’re a busy professional. I’m the director of a PR consultancy, so I’m used to working hard, being surrounded by lots of people, schmoozing. Becoming a mother and going on maternity leave is a dramatic transition – your appearance changes, people view you differently and you almost stop seeing yourself as an independent person. Most people only ever ask you about your baby.I had an emergency C-section, so I wasn’t very mobile after having Finn, and we live up three flights of stairs. I remember thinking: “Oh my God, where am I? What am I doing?” Going on NCT [National Childbirth Trust] courses has been a huge help because you get to meet other mothers. It costs a fortune and it’s a running joke that no one learns anything – you’re just there to get each other’s email addresses.Generally, I’ve enjoyed maternity leave, but I know some who have really missed work or found themselves wandering around aimlessly, feeling totally alone. A generation ago, east London had very established communities, which helped when you were raising a family. My mum’s a Hackney girl and she talks often about the breakdown of those communities.Marion, 72, and Lynne, 62: ‘It’s much easier in the city, there are care centres, dial-a-bus, meals on wheels, and so on’      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Marian, left, with Lynne.Marion: Lynne and I have known each other for a couple of years now and it makes a big difference to have people around you. I’m lucky enough to have a family, but some people don’t – there are so many people who are stuck at home with nothing to do and no one to help them. You don’t want to get isolated. It’s much easier in London of course, there’s care centres, dial-a-bus, meals on wheels and so on, but if you live in the country it’s much lonelier.Lynne: I have been helping to look after the elderly for a long time, and it can be very difficult for them when they don’t have support. I used to visit a lady in Maida Vale. I’d go around to see her every weekend, and her family simply weren’t looking after her at all. That’s why I volunteer at the Walter Newby centre in Bethnal Green, teaching the over-50s how to use the internet so they can stay in touch and talk to their families on Skype.Laura: ‘It can be a huge strain on relatives’Of course being a lonely person is difficult, but it can also be a huge strain on the relatives who feel solely responsible for that person. My mother lives in the middle of nowhere in Wales, which was her own decision, as she’s always sought out isolated places. She’s completely alone and she’s depressed, which makes her angry and paranoid, and she’s fallen out with everyone in her life. She won’t reach out to people and I’m the only person in the world she speaks to – her sister would talk to her, and so would mine, but she puts walls up around herself and she won’task for help. I do her shopping for her online and I’ve convinced her to go to an art class in Swansea, but it’s hard. Luckily I haven’t suffered from those things myself, but that may be because I’ve always been very conscious of that risk, conscious of making careful friendships and being a bit thicker-skinned. LauraOmar, 43: ‘If you don’t turn up for work, you get fired. It should be the same with friendship’      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The way I see it, there are different kinds of loneliness. Some people are happy to be alone and I’m like that. If I’m alone, I enjoy my loneliness, I fill it. I can go outdoors, listen to music, talk to strangers. I speak Arabic, Turkish and French, just from talking to people. When I was young, I did struggle with loneliness more, when my elders left me – the adults around me and my older brothers – and I was alone. But I learned to find myself.There’s another kind of loneliness that’s fed to you and that’s what’s happening to the youth of today through social media. They see the internet as their salvation, but they don’t know yet how to integrate it into their lives in a healthy way. They haven’t found a balance with real human relationships. If someone writes “love you lots” on Facebook, but they haven’t seen you in 10 years, what does that mean? Is that love? Are they your friends? Or do they just exist on the phone? If you don’t turn up at work, you get fired. It should be the same with friendship.Avril, 61: ‘Without something to look forward to a weekend can seem like a lifetime’       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest At my time of life, it gets harder to socialise and feel part of things. It’s especially hard for single people, when everyone else is in a couple. I married quite late, by which time I’d learned that you need to have something to look forward to, otherwise a weekend can seem like a lifetime. The other hard thing about growing older is losing people. When my best friend died it was an awful time. It sticks with you and you don’t want to be older.Does city life make us more or less lonely? Share your stories A great antidote to loneliness in my life has been sport. I’ve always played a lot of tennis and squash, and I’ve always cycled, but in 2008 I took up running and it’s been huge. I have friends who told me off, said I’d damage my legs, but I’ve run quite a few marathons now and I train people with my local club, the Mornington Chasers.It’s introduced me to a whole lot of new people who are very important to me; they’re younger than me, but it doesn’t matter. It’s great to meet people while doing some kind of activity – you have this thing in common, regardless of your other challenges. If you’re low and lonely, it’s a great thing to do and it helps you realise that if you want something enough, you can find a way to do it.
