7.57pm GMT19:57Their final dance is to Cher‚Äôs ‚ÄúIf I Could Turn Back Time‚Äù, and Daisy takes the opportunity to wrap her endless legs around Aljaz one last time. And who can blame her?So that‚Äôs it for Strictly Week 8 ‚Äì I‚Äôll be back for next week‚Äôs fun-packed jaunt to the Tower Ballroom, complete with a Booze-filled Bumper Blackpool Bingo. Since it‚Äôs a Seaside Special, feel free to make your suggestions in the comment box below, and I‚Äôll pick my favourite five. Thank you everyone for joining in ‚Äì have a wonderful week and I‚Äôll see you next Saturday!

Darcey saves them too, but Bruno saves Daisy and Aljaz! Ooh, TENSION.So it‚Äôs down to Len, and he chooses brain over heart and saves GREG AND NATALIE! Goodness, that was close.So DAISY AND ALJAZ are going home tonight, and take the opportunity to say lovely things about each other. Ah Daisy, you‚Äôve been delightful. But in a year packed with big personalities, being perfectly charming and nice and wasn‚Äôt going to cut it I‚Äôm afraid. Such is the way of Strictly.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.52pm GMT19:52Greg, meanwhile, is Paso-ing like his life depends on it. He knows he‚Äôs on the ropes, and isn‚Äôt going down without a fight. But has Greg done enough?? I really hope so.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.50pm GMT19:50So, Daisy and Aljaz‚Äôs Salsa once again. Daisy has incredible legs, but this is still a bit like she‚Äôs sober in a nightclub and kind of wishing she‚Äôd gone home two hours ago. We‚Äôve all been there.

But not nearly as sad as I am about the return of the comedy VTs; the respite was clearly brief.

Ed and Katya are off to Blackpool (YAAAAAAAAS), along with Louise and Kevin and Judge Rinder and Oksana!Which means GREG AND NATALIE in the bottom two! Oooh, this could definitely go either way.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.39pm GMT19:39Lovely to see Brendan and Natalie doing some proper dancing ‚Äì I‚Äôve seen enough barefoot contempo-wafting this year to last a lifetime.Meanwhile, the cut of those strapless ballgowns mean the cellists look naked, which is unfortunate. Or, you know, Hallelujah.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.36pm GMT19:36Ah, I love the Poppy Appeal kick-off in Covent Garden. My RAF sister was there last year, but she did Paddington Station this year. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Andre Rieu and his Amazing Technicolour Orchestra singing Hallelujah, aka the only Leonard Cohen song everyone knows.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.31pm GMT19:31So who has bagsied seats on the Funbus to Blackpool next week, and who is in tonight‚Äôs dance-off? Ore and Joanne are safe (hooray! But also SHUSH, Joanne), along with Danny and Oti and Claudia and AJ.First couple in tonight‚Äôs Dance Off ‚Äì DAISY AND ALJAZ! Ah, there it is.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.29pm GMT19:29From down below:  Tess isn‚Äôt in a stingray costume - it‚Äôs a manta ray costume. Also  Salmon are pink. Darcey is more of a trout. This is going to be a very long night.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.26pm GMT19:26Last night on Strictly ‚Äì a really good show, I thought. Highlights for me included the return of the mythical training VT (oh lord how we‚Äôve missed you), Ed‚Äôs amazing Gangnam Salsa, from brilliant turns from the Dave Archer Singers, Claudia and AJ‚Äôs Viennese and Judge Rinder and Oksana‚Äôs Foxtrot. Lowlights: Daisy and Aljaz‚Äôs Salsa (bad night to do a Salsa, Daijaz), Ore and Joanne‚Äôs frigid Rumba, and the absence of Chaz and Dave.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
