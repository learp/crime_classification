In Buried Thunder by Tim Bowler, Maya finds two corpses, a man and a woman, in the woods near her parents’ hotel.When she tells her parents and they call the police, the policewoman who turns up at the door is the woman whose corpse she found. When she and her boyfriend come for a romantic dinner at the hotel, he turns out to be the man, and when she meets a girl called Bonny and her introvert friend Mo, Maya’s life becomes even weirder. I don’t normally choose to read horror novels like Buried Thunder, but this was an exception. I liked the book but I wouldn’t say I loved it. However there were parts that I really did enjoy as the description is very good, and Bowler creates and uses suspense well.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
