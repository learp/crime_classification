Photograph: Paul BrobenLawson says he’s excited to play one of his heroes and is thrilled that he gets to tell Hogan’s “incredible” story.“He’s such an iconic figure. Everyone loves Hoges and one of his great gifts was making audiences feel like we really knew him,” Lawson said.Hogan was working as a labourer on Sydney’s Harbour Bridge when he broke into Australian television in the early 1970s, earning the nickname “Hoges”.He became an international star through his role as Mick “Crocodile” Dundee in the 1986 film Crocodile Dundee, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay and a Golden Globe award for his performance as the loveable Aussie outback adventurer.It was on the set of this film that Hogan met Kozlowski, whom he married less than a year after his divorce from his first wife, Noelene Hogan.

Often when we think of successful people it’s as a lone person but there are so many people who help lift them; that’s the story that I’m interested in,” Clarke said.
