The Great British Bake Off would not be worthy of its name when it moves to Channel 4, according to one of the show’s previous winners.Frances Quinn, who won the show in 2013, said retaining the name after it switches to Channel 4 would be like “making a loaf of bread and calling it cake”.She told the Radio Times: “Now it’s going to C4, I honestly don’t think it can really be called The Great British Bake Off, can it? So many ingredients are missing.”Channel 4 scooped up Bake Off in a £75m three-year deal last month after creators Love Productions were unable to agree a new deal with the BBC.The contract, which initially looked like a huge coup for the commercially run broadcaster, has since lost some of its shine after presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins said they would not leave the BBC, soon followed by judge Mary Berry. Only Berry’s fellow judge Paul Hollywood has said he will follow the show to Channel 4. Last week, 2015 winner Nadiya Hussain, who had been tipped as a possible replacement judge, released a statement saying she had signed a deal with the BBC to work on new projects, and was making the corporation her home. Edd Kimber, who won in 2010, said the loss of the three presenters would be a huge blow. “I think taking away Mary, Mel and Sue will change it a lot,” he said. “Sue and Mel attract people who don’t want to watch a baking show, and Paul and Mary have a very special relationship.”However, 2011 winner Jo Whatley predicted the show would go from strength to strength. “Nobody likes change, but there will be familiarity with Paul Hollywood still on it. It’s a good show and I think it will carry on being good.”
