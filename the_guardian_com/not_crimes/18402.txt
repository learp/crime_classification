Wow. This is the first book I’ve actually shed a tear over. It’s so funny how nowadays people fail to acknowledge disfigured faces as human. I felt so angry and guilty after reading this book, both negative emotions. But personally, this is my favourite book that I’ve come across.August ‘Auggie’ Pullman is a ten-year-old boy much like many other boys of his age, except that he was born with facial disfigurements.People are frightfully scared of him which makes them bully him. And it’s true, that when we humans are scared, we do things that are so disgusting we cannot believe that it’s really US doing it.August starts school and makes lovely friends, but also enemies who hate him. This story is about love, betrayal, friendship and a phrase that we have all heard before: Don’t judge a book by its cover. This story totally touched me. I really loved it. August’s parents also made me cry. When you give birth to a baby that’s not exactly like others, it is really heartbreaking, but soon enough August’s family love him to bits and accept him for how he is. However, I sometimes found that August felt his parents and sister were being over–protective and that he wanted to be treated like a normal 10 year old. This story had some events that were really upsetting. I love it just the way it is though. My favourite character was of course August, but I also loved Summer, who instantly became friends with August, not only because of pity and sympathy but because she saw him differently – as a normal kid.This book is aimed at anyone and everyone. Please read it if you’re aged 10 and above as it is quite disturbing and confusing. How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
