There are few artists who can get five-star reviews of an album before it’s even been made. Recording her record in full view of the public in a specially constructed basement studio in Somerset House, London, a year ago, PJ Harvey’s Recording in Progress was lauded by critics as a brave artistic endeavour – and now the fruits of that very public labour have arrived. The double Mercury winner’s ninth album, The Hope Six Demolition Project, is released on 15 April by Island Records. While 2011’s Let England Shake was in part an exploration of war and Englishness, the new album documents her experiences travelling in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Washington, DC, over a four-year period. “When I’m writing a song I visualise the entire scene. I can see the colours, I can tell the time of day, I can sense the mood, I can see the light changing, the shadows moving, everything in that picture. Gathering information from secondary sources felt too far removed for what I was trying to write about. I wanted to smell the air, feel the soil and meet the people of the countries I was fascinated with,” says Harvey.The Wheel is fans’ first taste of the musician’s return. It opens with a defiant energy, instruments collide and hands clap as Harvey morosely describes the “tableau of the missing”. Underpinning the song is a squall of saxophone – which goes some way to explaining this peculiar stance captured during her Recording In Progress campaign.
