In New Orleans on Friday, thousands turned out to honor Carrie Fisher, the actor famous for her role as Princess Leia in the Star Wars movies.My time with Carrie Fisher, a hurricane of energy, charisma and foul language Fisher, whose tough-talking princess defied Empire generals while tossing off one-liners such as “into the garbage chute, flyboy”, died on Tuesday.In New Orleans, where death is marked by both mourning and merriment, a Mardi Gras group called the Intergalactic Krewe of Chewbacchus organized a parade in honor of the woman they consider royalty.“This is a public demonstration of our love for Princess Leia,” said Brooke Ethridge, one of the founders of the Leijorettes, a dancing group made up of fans who dress like Princess Leia. “Our first instinct was to hit the streets and parade and celebrate Princess Leia and Carrie Fisher.”Chewbacchus is dedicated to all things sci-fi and fantasy related and has always drawn inspiration from the Star Wars movies. The group’s logo features the head of Chewbacca, the furry Wookiee who was Han Solo’s close friend and co-pilot.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A small Darth Vader and a small Leia.

One day after Fisher’s death, her actor mother, 84-year-old Debbie Reynolds, died too. A joint funeral for the two women has been announced.In New Orleans, the parade was led by the Leijorettes, followed by a brass band playing the Star Wars theme as hundreds of people – many in costume or carrying lightsabers – walked behind them. Fans lined the road, taking photos.“I didn’t know her. But as [she was] an iconic character and as a person, a writer and a smart, funny, fantastic woman and role model, I was heartbroken and devastated,” Dale Hrebrik said.

One marcher in the crowd held a sign calling Fisher, who spoke openly about her struggles with bipolar disorder, a mental health advocate.Jacquelyn Ryan came with her husband and two children. Her hair was wrapped in the two side buns Fisher wore in the first movie, but Ryan said she was more impressed with Fisher’s other contributions.“Probably my first introduction to her was Star Wars, but she as a person was really important. Her activism, her mental health awareness, her activism for women, her unapologetic attitude about youth and beauty in Hollywood really spoke to me,” Ryan said.
