Fox News host Megyn Kelly has lent her name to a new show that will follow reporters embedded on the presidential campaign trail, inspired by 2016’s bizarre election cycle.According to Variety, the show, titled Embeds, will be a political comedy following five young reporters on the campaign trail, and will feature cameos from prominent politicians. An insider said it will appeal to political junkies as well as people who don’t keep tabs on politics.It was co-created and will be scripted by two former political journalists, Scott Conroy and Peter Hamby. Conroy, who co-wrote the Sarah Palin biography Sarah from Alaska, and worked for Huffington Post, will leave Vice on HBO to work on the show, while Hamby, a former CNN correspondent, will continue his role as head of Snapchat’s news and host of Good Luck America.The Fox News host joins Fifty Shades of Grey producer Michael De Luca in producing the show. Kelly is one of Fox’s leading personalities and came into the spotlight during this year’s campaign when Donald Trump implied she was on her period after she asked tough questions during a debate. She later came under scrutiny for conducting a soft interview with the Republican presidential nominee during a special primetime interview on Fox. Embeds will add to the continually growing number of shows about DC politics that have enjoyed success over the past few years. Shows such as House of Cards, Scandal and Veep have managed to draw viewers as well as accolades. It will appear on Verizon’s millennial-targeted streaming channel, Go90. The now almost one-year-old streaming service provides subscribers with original content but has yet to have a hit show. Verizon has purchased six episodes of the show and is hoping the first will air by election day.
