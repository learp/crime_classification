We’re looking for you to recommend songs on the theme of ‘spying/watching’ after a reader suggested the topic for next week’s playlist. DoorsOfPerception notes you can’t have Pulp’s I Spy because it was chosen in a previous list – back in 2008 – but this week’s guru Andrew Morrissey (aka Makinavaja) will be listening to other suggestions we’re sure you can come up with. You have until 11pm on Monday 2 May to post your nomination and make your justification in the comments. You can find a list of all songs previously picked and so ineligible here.If you would like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions – and potentially blog about the process/selection for the Guardian – please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com, or make yourself known in the comments.Here’s a reminder of the guidelines for RR:Tell us why it’s a worthy contender.Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of a song’s words.Provide a link to the song. We prefer Muzu or YouTube, but Spotify or Soundcloud are fine.Listen to others people’s suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist.If you have a good theme, or if you’d like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com.There’s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are “zedded”, at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of “zedded” (picked for a previous playlist so ineligible), “donds” and other strange words used by RR regulars.Many RR regulars also congregate at the ’Spill blog. We’d like to learn a bit more about you and what you love. Each week, alongside RR, we’ll be asking you to tell us more about the songs you’ve nominated through our GuardianWitness page. We want to hear the stories, see the photos – of gigs, of moments, of your record sleeves – that you associate with the songs you have nominated. You can also share your theme ideas.
