Amazon, which has shows including The Man in the High Castle as well as Jeremy Clarkson’s The Grand Tour, is estimated to have attracted 2.3 million regular users of to its UK video service since its launch in 2014, according to Ampere Analysis.Sky had more than 3 million customers to its Sky Store in the year to the end of June, while its “buy and keep” service – where by customers download a film and get a DVD posted out – grew by 80%.Despite the digital revolution, Bayley said that it was too soon to ring the death knell of the DVD, with physical sales of music, TV shows, films and computer games still worth £2.2bn annually. “Physical entertainment retailing is clearly off its peak,” she said. “A multichannel economy is going to exist for some years to come. The strength of the DVD and CD formats over the Christmas period shows that physical still dominates when it comes to gifting, for instance.”Music: digital, Adele and compilationsThe digital onslaught is also continuing in the music market, with subscription revenues increasing by 65% to £418m, driven by services such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music and Deezer.Physical sales of CDs fell by 13%, a steep decline after a 3.7% fall in 2015.

Digital sales from online and mobile grew by 12% to £2.2bn, while physical sales of games fell 16% to £776m.The biggest selling game of the year was Fifa 17, with sales of 2.5m. This was almost the same number as its chart-topping predecessor Fifa 2016.Almost three-quarters (74%) of the UK games market is now accounted for by digital revenues.Last year marks the second in a row that the UK entertainment industry has seen growth after almost a decade of declining sales as businesses struggled to take advantage of the digital revolution.“The music, video and games industries were understandably nervous about the advent of new digital services, but these figures provide resounding evidence of the benefits of our members’ investment in innovation,” said Bayley. “Take away today’s digital services and the entertainment market would be barely a third the size it is today.”
