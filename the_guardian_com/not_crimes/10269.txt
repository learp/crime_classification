In the shadow of downtown Los Angeles, adjacent to artsy enclaves of Silver Lake and Echo Park, is a rundown area called Historic Filipinotown, named for its once thriving post-war immigrant community. Until recently, it was gang territory, with tags wallpapering alleys where homeless people slept. But now the homeless people are gone and gang tags have been painted over by colorful murals – more than 110 of them by roughly 80 local and international artists. The gangs are still there, but they leave the art alone.Balloons project takes off as Los Angeles neighbourhoods resist gentrification “One night, I get a knock on the door and there’s this big guy with tattoos all over his face and his arms,” remembers Jason Ostro, owner of Gabba Gallery, which sits on the corner of Beverly and Dillon. “You the guys doing them murals?” he asked. Ostro hesitantly responded, “Yeah.” “I just want to tell you this is beautiful,” said the man who had lived in the neighborhood for 47 years. He told Ostro that he had always wanted to leave, but now he thought he’d stay and see what happened. For Ostro, it was an epiphany: “I was like, ‘This is the right thing I’m doing, then.’”What he was doing was curating the neighborhood. A street art connoisseur, he went door to door asking local residents if he could paint on their fences and garage walls in the back alley. Most said no, but when they saw the results at their neighbors’ homes, they began to change their minds. Pretty soon images were springing up by artists like the French-Spanish duo Dourone, who painted a black-and-white masked face staring provocatively from the side of a garage, and Swiss-born Raphael Grischa, who adorned the façade of the Beverly Boulevard building with an eagle in flight. Stormie Mills came all the way from Australia to paint a pair of cartoon skeletal figures playing dice amid murals by artists including Clinton Bopp, Skid Robot and perhaps even the legendary Invader, although Ostro doubts the authenticity of the mosaic artwork.Using money he earned in music licensing and wardrobe, Ostro opened Gabba Gallery in 2013 just as the city lifted a 10-year ban on murals. As he built his artist network through social media, he spent money from his own pocket in addition to securing a five-figure contribution from the art supply store Blick. Another sponsor was the real estate developer Light Space & Shadow, which was renovating a building in the neighborhood. No one makes any money from the murals, but each gets free promotion, the artists get free space to paint, and the neighborhood moves from blight to bright, as Ostro is fond of saying.

Real estate prices are climbing and new businesses are springing up, such as the soon-to-open café across the street, and the interior design store next to it. One of Ostro’s new neighbors is Alissa Walker, a journalist for Gizmodo who recently moved from Silver Lake with her husband and two kids, drawn to the area in part by the artwork. “The mural movement that is happening in a lot of different cities makes people feel like they should take care of their own cities. It gives you a sense of pride and a sense of neighborhood belonging.”Talk of a movement is premature, though Ostro is eyeballing a fourth alley in the neighborhood and has plans for one in the San Fernando Valley as well as the West Adams district. He’s currently in discussions with like-minded people in other cities about taking “blight to bright” coast to coast and beyond. It may sound idealistic, but Ostro has no qualms about doubling down on humankind’s better nature. “I found there are a lot of people out there that really do want to see the betterment of man. They don’t need to be the richest, most successful person in the world so they can buy and sell you 10 times over. There are a lot of people who want happiness from seeing happiness.”
