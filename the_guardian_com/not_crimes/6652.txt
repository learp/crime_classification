When Kate Middleton recycled her sherbet yellow Roksanda at Wimbledon earlier this week (she had previously worn it at the Sydney Opera House in 2014), she was having one of her biggest fashion moments so far: stepping out in the colour of the season. Shades of yellow – lemon, canary and gold – have dominated most of 2016.In the same week, Rihanna wore a wallpaper patterned boho-style dress from Vetements, while last month Victoria Beckham was pictured in a butter coloured two-piece from her own collection.Yellow is no longer a riff on summer and happiness: it has become the new alpha colour, indicating confidence and importance. Beyoncé even twinned it with righteous feminist anger when she wore a mustard coloured Roberto Cavalli gown in Hold Up, a video in which she smashes up a car with a baseball bat after being betrayed by her beloved.

Others followed suit. At Cannes Anna Kendrick wore a custom-made canary yellow Stella McCartney dress, Jessica Chastain wore a golden corn-hued Armani Prive ball gown and Kirsten Dunst was pictured in 1950s-style dress from Dior. Online searches for yellow dresses have increased too, “They were up 9% in the UK and 14% in the US year on year for the month of May 2016,” says editorial director at Lyst, Katherine Ormerod.

Natalie Kingham, buying director at Matchesfashion.com, thinks its appeal is universal. “Skin-brightening, mood-lifting citrus shades runs the scale from chartreuse to tangerine this season,” she says. “The optimistic colour has universal appeal.”
