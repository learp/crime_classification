Undone is the heartfelt story of Jem, who, after years of being in love with her gay best friend, is suddenly left in a world without him. Kai’s suicide effects Jem in many ways, most of all leaving her in doubt that she can go on without ever seeing him smile or hearing him laugh again.Though she becomes almost catatonic, Jem’s desire to take down the group responsible for Kai’s death becomes the priority. That, and being given 12 letters to open for every month without him, give her the motivation to carry on living. When carrying out her plot for revenge on the popular kids at school, things become complicated, and Jem is left not knowing what she wants anymore, if anything.This being the third book I’ve read from the amazing author Cat Clarke; there are no words to describe how she manages to capture so much heartbreak in all of her books, but she somehow does. Though I did find it difficult to tackle through the middle of the book, as I felt like there was a lot set up for the ending, I am 100% glad that I stuck through it to the end. I remember bringing this on holiday and not being able to form a cohesive thought about it until someone snapped me out of my trance. Cat Clarke, alongside a few other authors, manage to get you assessing the meaning of life and where you fit into the bigger picture of things, whilst also crying your heart out.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest With emotions and the struggle to wait a whole 4 weeks before reading Kai’s next words catching up with her, will Jem be able to make it a year and to letter 12 without falling apart, or coming undone?• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
