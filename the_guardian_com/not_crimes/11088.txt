Glastonbury organisers will pay tribute to David Bowie and Prince at this year’s festival. Plans to decorate the Pyramid stage with a giant metal lightning flash in homage to Bowie’s Aladdin Sane album cover have been approved.Footage of his headline appearance on the Pyramid stage in 2000 will be broadcast around the site, while the Park stage will host an “intimate” tribute to his Heroes LP, Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC.“We’re going to do an incredible light show which will go on for the whole show and beyond, into the night,” Eavis said. She added: “There’s talk of late-night Prince parties and things.”Bowie died aged 69 in January, while Prince died last month aged 57 having never played the festival. Earlier this year, Eavis told the Press Association regrettably that she did not think the Purple Rain singer “will ever” play the festival. She told the BBC: “It’s been so close to happening for the last three years. A couple of times it’s been confirmed and then not happened.“It’s really disappointing that he hasn’t played here but it’s also, obviously, a huge loss to music because he was an incredible force.” Glastonbury will be held from 22 to 26 June, with bands expected to incorporate Bowie and Prince cover versions in their sets.
