In the heart of east London, a short stroll from Mile End tube, there lies 31 acres of urban woodland. Nestled in the city-fringe borough of Tower Hamlets, it’s not what you expect in Zone 2. “The day-to-day experience for most people in Tower Hamlets is tower blocks and traffic,” says Kenneth Greenway, site manager of the Cemetery Park. “But when you come here you forget all that. The dominant sounds become the birds, the wind through the trees. You don’t smell the concrete.”Greenway has been working at the nature reserve since 2002, but the history of how it came to be goes back to 1966, when the Greater London Council attempted to convert what was one of London’s largest Victorian cemeteries into a public park. “They wanted a green desert-like space with lollipop trees,” explains Greenway, “but there was no privilege given to the existing site at all.” After closing the cemetery to burials, the council set about removing gravestones and human remains – some of which had been there since the cemetery opened in 1841. By the time work was halted due to public protests, they had cleared 0.7 acres of monuments.The site that exists today – a public park, cemetery and habitat for more than 100 species of wildlife – is testament to a band of volunteers, the Friends of Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park, who came together after the protests to shape the site’s future. “Some people come for the park, others to see the monuments – our volunteers have recorded 20,000 monuments, and people come to trace family history,” says Greenway. The 3,000 volunteers also run more than 200 events a year – ranging from minibeast safaris to the annual Shuffle festival, curated by filmer director Danny Boyle – and educational workshops for more than 7,500 local primary-school children. “Things are really starting to happen for us,” says Greenway, “and in a borough like Tower Hamlets, it’s fantastic to see.”Runner-up: Dartmoor Pony Training Centre
