The golden plover stood plaintively whistling, its black breast towards us; the curlew changed its sweet wild calls to an angry bark as it flew over our heads, and the dunlin purred in alarm as it rose from the cotton-grass and crowberry. The water trickling from the spongy moss feeds the noisy becks which rush down cloughs to our Manchester river; a few hundred feet below these wild moorland birds were the mills and sheds, forests of chimneys, thousands of houses, and all the stir and activity of the busy Irwell Valley. The dunlin, mostly associated in our minds with wild tidal mud-flats and beaches, is as much a native of this Lancashire cotton district as any operative in the valley or quarryman on the hill. The bird's home is the place in which it nests; and in the long rough grass, little sullied in the clean, sweet mountain air by the smoke of the chimneys in the valley, were the young birds which were causing their parents so much anxiety.
