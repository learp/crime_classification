There has been a surprising upset this week over the male and female seating arrangements on the BBC Breakfast sofa. Apparently the new arrangement flies in the face of hierarchical norms, and the elders on the programme are not getting the respect they deserve.What has caused the furore? The doyen of breakfast television Bill Turnbull recently retired and a younger presenter, Dan Walker, has taken his place. The problem here is that Bill’s spot on the sofa was seen as the senior position, something which keen-eyed Radio Times readers were quick to point out, and so should have been given to Walker’s more experienced co-presenter, Louise Minchin. Was this a clear case of sexism at work?BBC Breakfast seating bias due to 'misogyny', says ex-Countryfile host As a former BBC Breakfast broadcaster I love the fact that this is being talked about at all. Most viewers never clock the left-right seating, since the usual arrangement is a greyish haired authority figure next to a much younger co-presenter in a dress. Not always, but quite often the case. This sofa row questions the older man/younger woman pairing tradition that we’re so used to, and since things don’t change that often in TV, any challenge to the old ways gets a big fat tick from me. When I presented the business news on the show, I was desperate to disrupt the bouffant hair, trowelled on makeup and body-con dress situation, but was given little wriggle room. I know – what a maverick!I’ve never understood why the presenters don’t swap seats every day. It would keep it fresh for them, and make for more lively viewing for the audience. But risks are rarely taken with successful formats and televisual norms, and you only have to look at breakfast TV news programmes over the last three decades to see that editors and producers never set out to frighten the horses – or viewers, as they’re known.Some will say that this seating arrangement is pure coincidence, that men sitting on the left on television isn’t a tactic at all. But just as most in the western world read text from left to right, we apparently read images in the same way. According to The Gutenberg rule, the left-hand side of a page or screen is the dominant position, the one we look at most. For others, the sofa roles can be explained by the overuse of televisual “grammar” – the (older) man on the left position has been repeated ad infinitum and so has just become convention. So should we be concerned that the new bloke on BBC Breakfast sits in “pole position” on the left-hand side of the screen, and that the more experienced female presenter stays on the right? Well, yes and no.Do male breakfast TV presenters always sit on the left? - in pictures Yes, because if we do acknowledge dominance in this setup, then it’s a bit boring for all of us who are keen to see more women on TV being brilliant. And no, because there are many other important things to be concerned about – like getting more women into broadcast media in general, and taken seriously as expert voices, not just presenters.For me, the location of bums on seats isn’t all that relevant. BBC Breakfast is just one programme out of hundreds, and actually doesn’t do too badly in terms of diversity, both in its pick of presenters and its selection of experts to be interviewed on the sofa. In many other programmes, you can’t see where the presenters are sitting, but there is no doubt they’re mostly white men.Women do appear on the radio, of course, but mainly to read out the traffic and travel news, or form part of the “posse”. Or they broadcast at lunchtime, often doing the “consumer” show, or they’re working the graveyard shift between the hours of midnight and 7am. If people really want to complain about misogyny in presenting roles, they’d do well to scrutinise the very fabric of our aural lives, the life-long radio backdrop we both endure and enjoy, complain about and commend – playing out loud in the cars and kitchens of the land.Thankfully small movements, seemingly glacial, are being made in this area, but the glory of sitting on the left of the screen is absolutely nothing in comparison to the position of being centre stage on the radio.
