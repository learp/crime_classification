I love a bath, and if I am putting my hair up it’s better if it’s a bit dirty, so I won’t wash it. I backcomb and make a big bird’s nest of a hairdo, and spray it with Tresemmé Salon Finish hairspray. Then I pull it into place with hair pins and smooth it over. People think it takes a long time, but five minutes is standard.Next, my base – Nars foundation and By Terry Touche Veloutée under my eyes. Then, powder – Studio Fix by Mac, Guerlain bronzer and Nars blusher. I like Nars eyeshadows or a Mac palette called Dusky Rose Times Nine. I enjoy doing makeup – even on photoshoots, I insist on doing my own brows and eyeliner. I always do a flick and I use two pen liners: I do a line in Revlon, then go over it with Eyeko. I like a thick brow – I have a little dent in one of them so I make them neater using a brown brow pencil. Yves Saint Laurent Faux Cils is a good, thick mascara, and if I am going to an event I put on individual lashes, too. I’ve started using a green lipstick by Lipstick Queen, from the 70s. It adapts to your lip colour, going whatever pinky-red your lips should be naturally.Gemma Cairney: ‘I have tried to refine the clown element to my outfits’ I have a few go-to outfits I dress up or down in. If I’m going somewhere really gorgeous, I’ll go to William Vintage for haute couture, and I am a fan of Net-a-Porter and Browns. That said, one of my favourite dresses is black velvet and semi-fitted with three-quarter sleeves. It’s from the 80s, but looks 60s, and I’ve added a vintage white lace crochet bib. I bought it for pennies in Beyond Retro 10 years ago and the bib was £3 on eBay.• Gizzi’s Season’s Eatings: Feasts & Celebrations From Halloween To Happy New Year is published next week by Mitchell Beazley at £25.
