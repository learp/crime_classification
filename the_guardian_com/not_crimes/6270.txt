Your editorial “The immorality of the hunt” (31 July) alluded to the “sinister side” of Walter the dentist. It’s a profession that never fares well in the press or literature. Sitting opposite me is my kindly, Guardian-reading, be-sandalled, vegetarian husband. A classic of the kind. And a retired dentist! When he puts the paper down, he will probably pick up the jumper that lies beside him and darn a hole made by one of the ravening hordes of clothes moths living hereabouts, none of which he can morally justify swatting. Just so you know they’re all different.Louise SummersOxford• “Heartwarming” though it may be that Jeremy Corbyn would have the oldest starting age for a prime minister if elected in 2020 (Letters, 4 August), I recall the ageism that Michael Foot experienced when fighting the 1983 election – and at 69 he was younger than Corbyn will be. More recently, Ming Campbell was regularly ridiculed for being too old when leader of the Liberal Democrats, and he was only in his mid-60s. Chris ParkinsStanmore, Middlesex• This is a true story (Letters, passim). An Australian walked into a bar in Edinburgh and asked for a scotch and soda. The barmaid asked him to repeat his request, which he did. The revolting drink he was served turned out to be scotch and cider.Denis LenihanLondon• With respect to Peter Jones (Letters, 4 August), the average is not “nonsense”. Mean, median and mode are all types of average with clear, objective meanings. Only when used loosely by those who don’t understand them do they make nonsense.Paul MichellBristol
