Students at Kent University have flushed away their toilet troubles by plunging into the world of eco loos.Kent Union has installed a set of waterless urinals that could save the university £3,081 each year, by cutting water use by around 960,000 litres.Helen Close, Kent Union's facilities manager, says: "They are far less smelly that their predecessors and we're looking forward to making considerable savings on our water bills, too."And with advertising space on each urinal, the students' union is hoping to cash in on the green gents room. David Porter, managing director of Eco Ad, says: "We will sell the advertising space to local and national advertisers and will then pay a percentage of the revenue back to the university."Kent is among the first UK universities to get environmental in the lavatory. But fancy urinals may soon become commonplace for students – the company behind them says it's in talks with several other universities.Introducing waterless toilets could make life easier for misbehaving Cambridge students. A college last year defended its decision make students carry out manual labour - including cleaning bathrooms - if they behave badly.Last year, a scheme billed as the world's biggest eco-toilet experiment had to be scrapped after problems with bad smells, maggots and health issues. Residents of an apartment complex in Mongolia were relieved when their new waterless toilets were abandoned. One said: "I could hardly eat at home, and felt miserable on my way back after work."
