It’s totally unprecedented.”Wright said he wanted to see the results from the tagging before supporting a cull.“It’s no use culling if you don’t know why they’re there,” he said.Wright has offered to provide help to the Port Macquarie Hastings council.“It definitely looks like there’s quite a problem if it was a (great) white down there,” he said.Tourism numbers haven’t suffered despite the obvious deterrence to swimmers and surfers, Wright said.
