Prince Charles and Waitrose have been criticised by health campaigners for the high level of sugar in Waitrose Duchy Organic ice cream.The ice cream – sold exclusively at Waitrose – contains almost twice as much sugar as some other brands.It was singled out by researchers as an example of the differing levels of sugar in exactly the same kinds of foods which appeal to children. Action on Sugar is urging companies to support Public Health England’s voluntary reformulation programme to help tackle the childhood obesity epidemic, which it claims is the biggest public health crisis facing the UK. The survey of foods commonly consumed by children including breakfast cereals, yoghurts, biscuits, cakes, confectionery, pastries, ice creams and chocolate spreads shows that products containing less sugar are in plentiful supply. More than two sugary drinks a day greatly increases diabetes risk, study shows For example, Duchy Organic vanilla ice cream, with 14.5g of sugar per 100g, was found to have 84% more sugar than Asda’s “smart price” vanilla ice cream, with 7.9g sugar.Duchy Organic is a partnership between Waitrose and Duchy Originals, founded by the Prince of Wales. Waitrose is the owner of the brand licence and is responsible for product formulation under that licensing agreement.Data was collected by visiting Aldi, Asda, Co-operative, Lidl, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose using the FoodSwitch app to collect data on nutritional information. The survey was carried out during August and products were checked again during September. Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum and an expert advisory team member of Action on Sugar, said: “George Osborne’s sugar levy announcement in March must be regarded as his swansong as chancellor.“At a stroke, he concentrated the mind of sugar-happy soft drink manufacturers seriously to consider reformulating their products to an acceptable level. “As Action on Sugar’s research shows, many food manufacturers got the message, too. All, and Prince Charles in particular, should now follow their lead. The added bonus is that they will have dramatically aided the health of millions of people, let alone the NHS.”A spokesperson for Waitrose said the Duchy Organic vanilla ice cream was an “indulgent” treat not aimed at children, adding: “The sugar content is clearly labelled and we sell a range of vanilla ice creams with a significantly lower sugar content, which our customers can choose if they want a healthier option. “Reducing sugar is a top priority and we have an extensive reformulation programme to achieve this, which has already included significantly reducing sugar in chilled juices, cereals, yoghurts, soups, cordials and fizzy drinks.”Kawther Hashem, a nutritionist and researcher at Action on Sugar, said: “Unhealthy foods are the biggest cause of death and disability in the UK and it is time the food industry took their responsibility for this seriously.Young children copy parents' sugary drinks habits, study suggests “They now need to make this a priority and ensure children are not eating three times their daily maximum intake of sugar.”Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chair of Action on Sugar, said reformulation was one of the most effective ways of reducing sugar and, if done properly, meant the UK could lead the world in this area. “We therefore urge the prime minister, Theresa May, to fully support it and commit the government to both fat reformulation, as it’s the biggest source of calories than sugar, and to start restrictions of marketing, advertising and promotion of unhealthy foods.”In August, leading retailers criticised the government’s watered-down childhood obesity strategy just days after its publication, arguing it would be better if ministers imposed mandatory cuts to sugar levels in food rather than leaving it up to voluntary initiatives by manufacturers.• This article and the headline were amended on 25 October 2016 to clarify that Duchy Organic is a partnership between Waitrose and Duchy Originals, founded by the Prince of Wales. Waitrose owns the brand licence and is responsible for product formulation.
