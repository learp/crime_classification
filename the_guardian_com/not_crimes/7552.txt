It seems bizarre that not long ago, fashion was cradling the idea of the older woman. The august figures of Joan Didion, Joni Mitchell and Grace Coddington featured in ad campaigns (for Céline, Saint Laurent and Calvin Klein respectively), while the first generation of supermodels appeared in group adverts (Cindy, Claudia and Naomi for Balmain and Eva, Yasmin, Stella and Nadja for Armani).

In fact, in 2016, it seemed like fashion had traded a grey pound in for a neon one. Even the thirtysomething consumer has been ignored, according to a recent article in Racked, which suggested Generation X have been forgotten about in favour of Generation Z.Fashion’s thirst for eternal youth has been seen more keenly through the teaming up of the Instafamous with fashion houses; Cameron Dallas with Calvin Klein, Gigi Hadid with Tommy Hilfiger, Zayn Malik with Versace, Alexa Chung with Marks & Spencer and Coco Gordon Moore with X-Girl. There’s common-sense economic logic to this: millennials are now the largest generational demographic in the US, according to the Pew Research Centre. So, goes the thinking, their spending power is huge.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Cameron Dallas for Calvin Klein.

Meanwhile, beauty products are even a bigger deal. A Tabs Analytics report from 2015 found that women aged between 18 and 34 made up the biggest proportion of the £11m makeup market. This is partly thanks to Instagram-led trends such as strobing, contouring and colour correcting, while Kylie Jenner has made a career out of her lip makeup technique.

No, according to other research, the robustness of the millennial pound is an unsteady one, not particularly loyal andwithout a strong foundation behind it. Perhaps then it’s better to court a wider demographic of clothes buyers than just those who use hashtags?
