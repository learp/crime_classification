Name: FroséAge: Just a couple of months.Appearance: Pink and fluffy.What is it? Look at the name and see if you can work it out.Erm … an improbable celebrity romance between Freddie Flintoff and José Mourinho? You’re overthinking this. It’s frozen rosé.That was going to be my second guess. In that case, congratulations. Frosé is everywhere this summer.Don’t I just know it! You feel like a glass of wine, but the bottle is all warm, so you put it in the freezer for 10 minutes … Then the next day there’s broken glass and frosé all over the place. Nightmare. Actually, this is a less disastrous version. Indeed frosé is now being made in London and New York.On purpose? I believe so. You freeze it solid, then blitz the ice into slush. It was reportedly invented by Justin Sievers at Bar Primi in New York earlier this year, and has since caught on everywhere. Beaufort House in west London only added frosé to its menu at the beginning of the month, but it is now the most popular drink it sells.Seriously? Just frozen rosé? Pretty much. It’s usually mixed with some lemon juice and sugar, or with vermouth and strawberries. You can make it at home quite easily. It’s like a wine Slush Puppie. Frosé Fridaze | Would it be wrong to have this for breakfast today? I cannot take this NYC humidity anymore. 🌹🍓 . . . . . . #nyc #manhattan #nycsummer #cityliving #lincolnandholland #mixology #mixologist #cocktails #roseallday #roséallday #frosé #froséallday #rose #nycdrinks #nyccocktails #310bowerybar #basic #basicbetch #basicbitch #superbasicA photo posted by LAUREN PERENCHIO HERSH (@lincolnandholland) on Aug 26, 2016 at 6:09am PDTI think I prefer picking broken glass out of my freezer. Your loss. Chilled rosé has become a much-loved summer drink in the past decade, and this takes it to the next level. The sweetness and the slushiness make it an almost childlike pleasure.Like mashed potatoes and ketchup? I guess. Or like kalimotxo, the mixture of Coke and cheap red wine that’s popular with European youngsters.Ugh … Maybe Brexit was for the best. There are some oenophiles who share your feelings.Excuse me? Oenophiles. Wine lovers. “Wine cocktails have a long and noble history,” said Elizabeth Gabay, a master of wine. “But if seen as another way to sell cheap rosé, I think [frosé] lowers the image.”How about if it’s seen as a way to get drunk in warm weather? I imagine that’s fine.Do say: “People should be free to enjoy any drink they like without being judged.”Don’t say: “Make mine a hot cham.”
