My kitchen is … small, but functional, and unabashedly filled with my favourite cooking things. Little to no natural light reaches the narrow space, and, if there’s more than one person in it at once, elbows inevitably bump, but I’ve grown very fond of my little urban kitchen. Making do with less space forces me to really consider what I need on a daily basis.My favourite kitchen tool is … my hands. I’ve always used my hands to make doughs for dumpling wrappings or pie crusts, and I can’t imagine using anything else. Nothing compares to being able to feel the texture and nature of the dough to judge its state.My storecupboard staple is ... scallions. I will eat them in any way you can imagine – raw, cooked, pickled. Raw and thinly sliced, they are great on top of savoury dishes, such as steamed fish or avocado toast; cooked, they make a wonderful aromatic oil that can become the flavour base to a dish; pickled, scallions can be wonderful in homemade kimchi or just pickled by itself. Plus, they’re great as a garnish! I use these almost every day and are always in my shopping list.When I’m starving I ... make some kind of toast, usually something savoury on top of crisped-up sourdough bread. Avocado toast is a classic, but fruit over quark (curd cheese) over toast is also a great contender, as is mushroom toast.My culinary inspiration is ... my mom. Everything my blog is about can be traced to learning how to cook with my mother. Since I moved away from home, I’ve sorely missed my mom’s homestyle Chinese cooking, and my desire to recreate these dishes for myself spurred the impulse to document these dishes. Some of my most inspired and popular posts are traditional Shanghai treats that I’ve eaten since childhood: Shanghai shumai, zongzi and chive boxes. Whenever I am home and my mom cooks for me, I am inspired all over again.‘I can’t imagine a better space in which to write a cookbook’ | Kitchen encounters My best-kept kitchen secret is ... that simple is best. I used to want to make everything perfect, fancy, with a million components to each dish. The first time I hosted Thanksgiving, I planned every dish to be a special, fancier version than the traditional counterpart, but that was a headache. Since then, I’ve forced myself to keep things simple, to let ingredients shine, and tell myself that not every dish has to be super complicated.When I’m invited to dinner I always take ... pie or a galette.Everything tastes better with ... miso. I’ve used miso in both savoury and also sweet dishes, and let me tell you, miso ice-cream and miso apple pie is definitely something to try!When I go shopping I ... have a core list, but usually I wander through the market and select what appeals to me that day. I’m constantly inspired by what’s in season and delicious-looking at the market.For dinner tonight ... I’m probably making mushroom toast. With spring onions, of course.Betty Liu is a food photographer and blogger based in Boston, MA. bettysliu.com; Instagram: @bliu07
