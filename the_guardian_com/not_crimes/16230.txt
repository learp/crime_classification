Ava DuVernay backs 'DuVernay test' to monitor racial diversity in Hollywood Oscars organisers have lined up a diverse group of presenters to take the stage next month, as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences continues to respond to accusations that its glitzy annual awards ceremony is an all-white closed club.As well as the previously announced host Chris Rock, the body on Monday revealed that the musician, composer and producer Quincy Jones, the Django Unchained star Kerry Washington, Indian-born actor Priyanka Chopra, and South Korea’s Byung-hun Lee, will present awards. Whoopi Goldberg, Kevin Hart, Benicio del Toro and Pharrell Williams are also expected to attend.All the fun of the Vanity Fair cover and the Pope plays himself - the Dailies film podcast Jones, who served as musical director of the 1971 Oscars, has previously said that he will use the opportunity to speak about diversity. “They called me to go present with Pharrell and Common,” the musician, 82, said earlier this month. “When I’m back [in Los Angeles], I’m going to ask [them] to let me speak for five minutes on the lack of diversity. If not, I’m not going to [present].”Spike Lee, Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith and Tyrese Gibson are among the African American stars to have called for a boycott or signalled that they will not be attending this year’s ceremony. Academy voters failed to nominate an actor from black or ethnic minority backgrounds for a second year running on 14 January, sparking a storm of protest. Just over a week later, the organisation announced radical rule changes aimed at doubling voting representation among female and ethnic minority demographics by 2020 – though these changes also faced criticism from some longstanding members.Why Vanity Fair's Hollywood diversity cover fails to conceal industry prejudice While none of the major voices calling for a boycott have signalled a change of heart, the Academy’s move towards reform appears to have allayed fears of a coordinated campaign against the Oscars by well-known Hollywood figures. It remains unclear whether civil rights leader and White House adviser Al Sharpton will carry out his threat to organise a “nationwide tune-out” among supporters: he released a statement last week dismissing the Academy’s proposals and demanding a “clear and specific blueprint for moving forward”.The 88th Academy Awards ceremony will be held on 28 February at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles.
