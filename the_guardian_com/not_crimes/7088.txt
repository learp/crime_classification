Iran’s president rounded off his trip to Italy with a tour of the Colosseum on Wednesday. But as Hassan Rouhani made his way to France for the second leg of his first European visit in decades, he left behind a mystery: who asked for the nude statues in the Capitoline museum to be covered up?On Tuesday Rouhani’s meeting with Pope Francis in the Vatican was almost overshadowed by photographs appearing to show Roman-era statues in the museum covered up to avoid causing offence to the visiting president during his press conference with the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi.Rome spares Iranian president's blushes by covering nude statues The images caused widespread incredulity, and both Italy and Iran said on Wednesday that neither government had asked for the wooden panels. Dario Franceschini, the Italian culture minister, said the “incomprehensible” move had not been authorised by either him or Renzi.Franceschini said: “I think there easily would have been other ways to not offend an important foreign guest without this incomprehensible choice of covering up the statues.”Some Italian politicians have denounced the cover-up as “cultural submission”.Rouhani said Iran had not contacted Italian officials about the issue, and he had appreciated the welcome he had received.“I know that Italians are a very hospitable people, a people who try to do the most to put their guests at ease, and I thank you for this,” he said.
