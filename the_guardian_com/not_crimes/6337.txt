The last time I saw the cabaret performer Fancy Chance, AKA Veronica Thompson, she was hanging by her hair from the rafters of Soho theatre in London. The show was Dr Carnesky’s Incredible Bleeding Woman, which explored taboos around menstruation with a mix of po-faced seriousness and comic glee. Apparently, hair-hanging hurts like hell. But Thompson has every intention of still doing it when she’s 60. “If the white hairs will allow it,” she says. “Why not? Why limit your options?”Her first full-length solo show, Flights of Fancy, opens at Soho this month and marks a coming of age for a performer who is always ready to take risks. Thompson, a small woman who likes to give people hugs, has had to invent herself because she knows so little about her past. As a baby, she was found abandoned in a bag outside a South Korean police station in 1974.“It was a known place where mothers could leave a child,” she says. “I can’t help thinking about the woman who was my mother, and what she must have gone through. She had this child growing inside her for months, she gave birth to me and then she gave me up. What must she have felt? How desperate might she have been?” Thompson has tried on two occasions to find out more about her origins, but without success. There is no paper trail, which is a source of angst – “we all want to know who we are” – but also an opportunity for her to become exactly who she wants to be.

Photograph: Linda Nylind for the GuardianIn Flights of Fancy, directed by Nathan Evans, she is doing the next best thing, setting up imaginary conversations with her birth mother and tracing her journey from the steps of a police station, through adoption and childhood with an all-white family who live in a town near Seattle, to her arrival in the early 2000s in the UK, where she found a home in east London’s neo-burlesque world. Thompson was one of the many performers who helped inject a healthy dose of political satire into an artform that was in danger of becoming about nothing more than nipple tassels and stripping. “It was a great time. It was amateur and DIY, but it was also fun and political,” recalls the “accidental performer” who having, fallen into this world, seized the opportunity to get skilled up. “The fact I was a bit of an exhibitionist helped, but I really schooled myself in performing,” says Thompson who has worked with everyone from Scottee to David Hoyle, and who was crowned the Alternative Miss World in 2009. The burgeoning cabaret scene provided Thompson with the alternative family she had always craved. “Whether you are born into a family or adopted, it’s always a bit of a lottery. I was lucky with my adopted family, thank goodness. I love them. But I was also just enough outside of my family, just enough of a minority – and not only because I am Asian but also personality-wise – that I realised I could create my own mythology and be anyone I wanted. I’ve changed my name, the country in which I live, and I have a new family. If you come to live in London, like I did, you need a substitute family. Otherwise you don’t survive but die of loneliness.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘I’d be a complete loser not to take a chance on a solo show.’ Photograph: Linda Nylind for the GuardianFlights of Fancy, which explores notions of belonging, identity politics and migration, began as a short piece in 2012 called I Love You But We Have Only Fourteen Minutes to Save the World.“When I had done it I thought, well I’ve already got 14 minutes of material, I’ve got a collaborator, in Nathan, who knows my capabilities, and I’d be a complete loser not to take the chance to make a solo show. But it would be folly to have a big ego over it. I look upon Flights of Fancy as the start of my PhD in cabaret and performing. I’ve always taken things slowly because I knew I needed to school myself and learn by creating within other people’s projects.”It has sometimes been hard to deal with the emotions that arise from creating such a personal story. “It is sad, because everything in the show is so close to home for me. It does make it difficult to perform. But it’s a journey for both me and the audience, and there’s comedy along the way. They aren’t going to be splitting their sides the whole way through, but it is funny and I don’t think anyone could hear this story without feeling sympathy. With stories of migration, we are inundated with statistics. But this makes it personal.”If by any miracle she did finally locate her birth mother and get to talk to her, what would Thompson ask her? She pauses for a moment and then says: “I’d ask her if she was happy. I’d want it to be about her, not about me.”Fancy Chance: Flights of Fancy is at Soho theatre, London, 25-29 April.
