We are devasted to report that the amazing Louise Rennison, known as Lou to her friends, has died at the age of 63. One of the funniest, if not THE funniest, teen writers in the world, she first wowed us with her ground-breaking Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging, which was published back in 1999. It was just the first of 10 stories about Georgia Nicolson, who was surely based on Louise‚Äôs wild and wonderful self. The first two books in the series were adapted into a film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging (read this to find out about that revised title).Louise was crowned Queen of Teen in 2008, and she won the Roald Dahl funny prize in 2010 with Withering Tights, the tale of Georgia Nicolson‚Äôs gawky younger cousin Tallulah Casey, beating David Walliams‚Äôs Mr Stink, illustrated by Quentin Blake, to the title.One thing is for sure, the world is a less glittering place without Louise Rennison, and we will miss her terribly. Here are some of our favourite quotes from the books she gave us: He who laughs last laughs the laughiest.‚Äï Dancing in My Nuddy-Pants (book four in the Confessions of Georgia Nicolson series) ‚ÄúHe says we should take it easy and that maybe he overreacted a bit.‚ÄùDave said, ‚ÄúA bit? That‚Äôs like Hitler saying, ‚ÄòOooh, I just meant to go for a little walk, but then I accidentally invaded Poland.‚Äù ‚Äï Are These My Basoomas I See Before Me? (the 10th and final Confessions of Georgia Nicolson story) My inspiration: Pamela Butchart on Louise Rennison  I am soooo excited, I am over-excited. I‚Äôm hysterical, I may have to slap my own face in a minute at this rate. ‚Äï Withering Tights (the first book in Louise‚Äôs series about the misadventures of Tallulah Casey, Georgia Nicolson‚Äôs younger cousin) Honestly, what planet do these people live on? And why isn‚Äôt it farther away? ‚Äï It‚Äôs OK, I‚Äôm Wearing Really Big Knickers (published as On the Bright Side, I‚Äôm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God in the US where people don‚Äôt wear knickers as people in the UK wear knickers, book two in the Georgia Nicolson series). I am going to become a writer for Cosmo - you don‚Äôt have to make any sense at all. Or maybe I‚Äôll be a bloke, they don‚Äôt have to make sense either.‚Äï Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging As she left my room I knew I should shut up. But you know when you should shut up because you really should just shut up‚Ä¶ but you keep on and on anyway? Well, I had that. ‚Äï Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal SnoggingKnickers? Snogging? Can we really transport humour across the pond?  I can already feel myself getting fed up with boys and I haven‚Äôt had anything to do with them yet ‚Äï Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging He had everything a dream boy should have. Back, front, sides, Everything. A head. ‚Äï Withering Tights  I will not have him in my brain; there is no room for anyone else in the cakeshop of agony. It‚Äôs crowded enough in there already. ‚Äï Startled by His Furry Shorts (book seven in the Georgia Nicholson series)There are far too many hilarious quotes to share from Louise Rennison‚Äôs books. We could easily give you 100 more. A great lady who will be much missed. Thank you Louise Rennison. There‚Äôs an outpouring of quotes and tributes for Louise Rennison on Twitter @GdnChildrensBks.
