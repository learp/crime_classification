It’s been a bad year already for the loss of likeable celebrities, but the death of Victoria Wood at the age of 62 has led to an outpouring of love and affection across the Guardian. Lucy Mangan’s lovely tribute received hundreds of comments paying tribute to the comedian and actor.“She was just one of us, like Rik Mayall was,” said Reggie Blue. “She understood the struggle and the minutiae of every day living.”   Lollypants 20 April 2016 8:20pmLovely tribute. I remember first seeing her on TV when I was about ten and thinking - oh! She's like my mum. They let normal people on telly! It was important to me. And of course she was funny. Maybe there wouldn't be a Dinnerladies without Fawlty Towers but the former is by far the superior to me. She'll be sorely missed.One theme that emerged among the tributes was the impossibility of writing about her without quoting a line, or a scene, or a reference.   maxon 20 April 2016 9:29pmI've been reading the tributes trying to feel sad but I can't stop laughing at all the clips people have linked to and the lines that have been quoted.Me neither.So without further ado, here are a selection of the best quotes and tributes we’ve received from the comments and via GuardianWitness.Victoria Wood’s school playVictoria Wood's first playThis play was written and produced by Vicky, aged 15, at Bury Grammar School for Girls in 1968 after O levels were finished. The play was called "Pearl a Melodrama" and was presented to the whole school. Vicky wrote the script and all the songs and music. She played the piano and sang along with all of us.Sent via Guardian Witness By ID4093543  20 April 2016, 19:48 “Vicky was a wonderful person, shy and clever and witty and most of all modest. She’s sadly missed,” says Ann Mark, then Ann Shilco, who shared the picture above. The chorus of the play: With a Cupid’s kiss corn plasterYou’ll have feet like alabasterBe a Mrs not a MissWith a Cupid’s kissA comedic polymath   superbarnsley 21 April 2016 2:56amAs good a comedic polymath as there ever was. Great writer, hilarious stand up, brilliant songwriter and musician an actress of real, real quality. Vastly, vastly underrated   zuftawov943 20 April 2016 10:56pmShe was sharp and learned even when slotting into others' comedic formats. When she appeared on Radio 4, on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, she offered this memorable addition to the stream there of new definitions of words:châtelaine - couldn't make it to the farmhouse in time.At this point, we were deluged with quotes. So many quotes.Don’t have the prawns   Midsummer 20 April 2016 7:43pm"Don't have the prawns, they hang around sewage outlet pipes treading water with their mouths open."Farewell to a comic genius.

But just something as simple as the lryics she wrote for Dinnerladies used to bring me to tears....and today is even more poignant.Getting up, getting out, getting on, getting going,Wears away at the dreams that you hold in your heart,All the scared little choices you make without knowing,Take away from the thing that you had at the start.Chorus:Day by day, drops of water wear the stone away,Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, FridayWhat a brilliant talent.   middleyouth 20 April 2016 10:05pmOh, another brilliant bit: Dinnerladies, Anne Reid's character reading about a programme called 'Regrets' and imagining what it might be about. Then adjusting glasses and realising that it's 'Rugrats'. Wonderful.
