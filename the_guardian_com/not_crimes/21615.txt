To commemorate International Women’s Day on 8 March, I’m thrilled to present the following poem by award-winning Portuguese poet, Ana Luísa Amaral, translated by the brilliant Margaret Jull Costa. Addressed to the narrator’s daughter (and, it seems, the daughter of that daughter), these words celebrate the hidden potentiality inside every woman—and the spontaneity of life itself, even in its contemplation of sudden death.—Lee Yew Leong, Editor-in-Chief, AsymptoteTestamentI’m about to fly off somewhereand my fear of heights plus myselffinds me resorting to tranquillisersand having confused dreamsIf I should dieI want my daughter always to remember mefor someone to sing to her even if they can’t hold a tuneto offer her pure dreamsrather than a fixed timetableor a well-made bedTo give her love and the abilityto look inside thingsto dream of blue suns and brilliant skiesinstead of teaching her how to add upand how to peel potatoesTo prepare my daughterfor lifeif I should die on a planeand be separated from my bodyand become a free-floating atom in the skyLet my daughterremember meand later on say to her own daughterthat I flew off into the skyand was all dazzle and contentmentto see that in her house none of the sums added upand the potatoes were still in their sack forgottenentireTranslated from the Portuguese by Margaret Jull CostaAna Luísa Amaral published her first volume of poetry, ‘Minha Senhora de Quê’ in 1990 and has since published 15 collections.
