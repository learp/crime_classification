Weiner review: an unsparing portrait of politics and a gift that keeps giving A name of a man is a mind-numbing blow from which he never recovers,” says a prefatory title from Marshall McLuhan as this vertiginous political documentary begins. That was not always true for awkwardly named seven-term US congressman Anthony Weiner. He always grasped the issue of his penile-soundalike surname, so to speak, with both hands. “Who does John Boehner think he’s fooling?” he’d often ask audiences. Weiner was a gifted street fighter, a loudmouth, at a time when Democrats had assumed a collective defensive crouch, and you have to think that name was among the things that toughened him up.But there was always a glibness, a narcissism, an excess of amour propre, to Weiner. And people called him “cocky” not knowing the half of it. His fall came in 2011, when his many sexts and sub-belt selfies came to light, and the more he denied it, the more women came forward bearing their damning, nocturnally emitted contradictory proof.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg’s Weiner could be subtitled Tragedy Of A Ridiculous Man, so heartbreaking and so grimly funny is its portrait of Weiner’s failed attempt at a comeback in the New York mayoral race of 2013. It’s a tragedy, certainly, for his stoic wife Huma Abedin, senior aide/surrogate daughter to Hillary Clinton, who abides her husband’s serial idiocies, but looks fit to burst at some moments. The ridiculous part? Well, start with the name and it snowballs from there. As many dick jokes as I am capable of conjuring, I’m no match for the Murdoch-owned New York Post, which outdid itself with, among other things, “WEINER: I’LL STICK IT OUT!” and “OBAMA BEATS WEINER”.Weiner: 10 political lessons from the warts-and-all documentary As the campaign escalates, and as surprisingly appreciative crowds turn out for Weiner, the local and then the national media feasts on every nuance and fresh disgrace. It’s toe-curlingly funny, and then it’s just horrible. What you realise is how much of Weiner’s problem is down to the obverse of that thick hide – a lack of self-awareness and introspection. Asked by the film-makers why it’s hard to talk about his emotions, Weiner glacially asserts that, by definition, the “fly-on-the-wall” doesn’t talk to its subject. After a flaming, flailing exchange on MSNBC, he constantly rewatches his performance to cheer himself up, even as Abedin tells him it’s a campaign-killing meltdown.The final proof of this is Weiner itself, the full-access doc, which shows Weiner is addicted to any attention he can get – even the most ruinous kind.
