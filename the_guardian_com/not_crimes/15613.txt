Benedict Mason’s Meld was given its world premiere at a late-night prom in August 2014. Hailed by critics as strange, beautiful, audacious and “a happening of epic zaniness”, Mason wrote his piece specifically for the Royal Albert Hall, and the visual element of the performance was as important as the music.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest With the musicians of Aurora Orchestra and the choir Chantage roaming around the famous hall’s spaces – including the arena itself (floor cleared, for this performance only, of prommers), this was a unique and unforgettable experience for audience and players alike. It had beenthree years in the planning.Benedict Mason on Meld: Viewing my work through different eyes   Members of the Aurora orchestra wearing with GoPro cameras for their performance of Benedict Mason’s Meld at the Proms, August 2014.

The end result places the audience at the heart of the experience, giving a vivid sense of the movements and interactions of the musicians and singers with the space.
