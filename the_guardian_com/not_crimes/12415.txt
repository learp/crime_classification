For our final show of 2016, we were joined by Surrey batsman Arun Harinath and Felix White, guitarist in The Maccabees, cricket nut, Surrey member and all-round top man.We discussed England’s travails – or not? – in India, whether Alastair Cook should remain Test captain and whether the national team’s year has had more highs than lows.We picked through the year in cricket, spoke about our hopes for 2017 and, most importantly, do a cricketing secret Santa – what on earth is Felix buying for Haseeb Hameed?Somehow, somewhere along the way, Harinath reveals that his mate Kumar Sangakkara regularly turns up to play cricket without his (much-needed) spectacles – cue a mad dash home – and they pick through why the break-up of cricket teams is invariably even more bitter than the break up of bands. Happy Christmas.You can subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, listen on Soundcloud, follow on Twitter, or just look out for episodes here on the Guardian Sport Network.
