Though the instinct to preserve the religious origins of our seasonal festivals can be overdone, I am sympathetic to the suggestion that a vernal egg hunt should be labelled “Easter” (Great secular Easter egg hunt: confected row or spiritual affront?, 5 April). We should be mindful that eggs and bunnies are not merely tasty fertility symbols, but are also sacred to the goddess Eostre.It’s also nice to see holy people, such as the Archbishop of York, sticking up for other people’s religion for a change. Christianity especially has a history of selfishness with religious rights. This generous intervention on behalf of Germanic paganism shows that even in the Church of England some people have joined the rest of us in the 21st century.Andrew MainLondon• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
