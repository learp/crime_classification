Just like the concept of the cocktail itself, Halloween is not technically speaking an American invention, but also like the cocktail, you can’t deny that American culture perfected it.Halloween and mixed drinks therefore go together like the peanut butter and chocolate in a Reese’s cup – especially after the neighbourhood’s children have slipped into a diabetic coma from eating the spoils of their trick or treating. In the spirit of the holiday, here are four tricks that will help make your adult libations a real treat this Halloween. 1. Put an eyeball in your highball As the old bartender’s saw goes, you take your first sip of a drink with your eyes – which is usually just another way to say that visual presentation is important. But you can make this saying somewhat more literal by garnishing your Halloween drinks with edible “eyeballs”, which can be made either sweet or savoury to match your drink.  For sweet eyeballs, you’ll need tinned and pitted lychees, fresh blueberries and some strawberry or raspberry jam. Drain the lychees, then stuff a little jam into each lychee’s pitting hole until they’re half-filled. Place a blueberry in at the front of each hole, which will become the eyeball’s iris and pupil. If you like, you can paint some more jam around the exterior of the eyeball for an extra-grisly “freshly plucked” effect.

Wash the radishes and trim their tails, then lightly peel them, leaving flecks of the red skin behind. Slice the top off each radish, leaving a flat surface. Slice the olives in half to create a green iris and red pupil. Then, with a paring knife, carefully carve a small divot in the flat surface of each radish for the halved olives to sit in.  If you really want to camp up the horror quotient, pair them with one of these two bloodthirsty classic cocktails: the blood and sand (sweet) or the bloody Mary (savoury).Make it at home: blood and sand22.5ml scotch whisky22.5ml sweet red vermouth22.5ml cherry brandy (preferably Cherry Heering)22.5ml freshly squeezed orange juice (or blood orange juice) Build all ingredients in shaker. Add ice and shake to chill. Double strain into a chilled cocktail coupe. Garnish with a sweet lychee eyeball on a skewer.Make it at home: bloody Mary 60ml vodka90ml tomato juice10ml lemon juice5ml Worcestershire sauceCelery salt, pepper and chilli sauce to taste Build all ingredients in a tall collins glass. Stir to mix well and top with ice. Garnish with a savoury radish eyeball on a skewer, alongside anything else you might want to chuck in there. Pair it with a film: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom – just for the goofy ‘eyes in soup” scene.2. Make a shimmering witch’s potion Whoever came up with the idea of Viniq liqueur was really on to something, at least as far as presentation goes. This shimmering, swirling liqueur might be a little bit, ahem, de trop for most bars, but it’s perfect for adding a bit of supernatural sparkle to your Halloween cocktails. The only problem? It’s not to everyone’s taste. You can get around that, though, by cutting out the middleman and going straight to the source of the shimmer: lustre dust (also known as pearl dust). Without this flavourless, edible powder (readily available in cake decorating specialty stores), Viniq would simply be a plain old mixture of flavoured vodka and moscato. Which means that you can apply the same shimmer to just about any translucent drink. Just add a tiny pinch of the powder (a little goes a long way) and stir until the lustre dust is fully incorporated, and your drink is as sparkly as unicorn poop.

This will work best with any number of beverages. For maximum impact, choose a brightly coloured drink. The hot-red tones of Campari and sweet vermouth make the boulevardier cocktail an excellent candidate for shimmering up. Make it at home: witch’s potion boulevardier 45ml bourbon30ml Campari30ml sweet red vermouth Build all ingredients in a mixing glass. Add ice and stir to chill. Strain into a bottle and add a small pinch of lustre dust. Seal the bottle and gently swirl until the lustre dust is incorporated into the drink. Pour into a rocks glass and garnish with a twist of orange zest. Pair it with a film: Nicholas Roeg’s The Witches, in which a magical potion transforms the protagonist into a rat.3. Make a billowing pumpkin punch cauldron You wanna hear something real spooky? A woman who took a liquid nitrogen shot at a bar in Lancaster, England, was so badly effected by the cryogen inside it that her stomach had to be removed and her oesophagus directly connected to her small bowel. She later sued the bar for £100,000, which doesn’t seem like a radical figure given that her lack of a stomach has basically ruined her life.Wine bar fined after woman's stomach removed following liquid nitrogen shot  Cryogens are a serious health hazard, which is why I’m amazed that a number of recipes still encourage readers to chuck a piece of dry ice in their cocktails to create a cool smoking effect. The gas itself (carbon dioxide) is harmless, but if any of that dry ice gets inside you or your guests, your night of spooky revelry could be cut short by a real horror show: a trip to the emergency room. The safer way to achieve that cool effect is to create a multilayered punch bowl that keeps the dry ice separate from the actual drink. Start by carving the top off a large pumpkin, and hollow it out to fit a large metal kitchen bowl. (Don’t use glass – it could break from the extreme cold of the dry ice.) Using tongs or thermal gloves, place small chunks of dry ice inside this bowl, then place another, slightly smaller, metal kitchen bowl on top. Fill this bowl with a punch of your choosing, and when you’re ready to serve, pour a small quantity of warm water in between the rims of the two bowls to activate the dry ice. If your cauldron stops smoking, add some more warm water or dry ice. (If you have small children at your Halloween party, keep the smoking cauldron out of their reach.)

It’s easy to scale up simple mixed drinks such as the spritz Veneziano or Pimm’s cup to punchbowl sizes: for “part”, simply read “bottle”. But if you’re after something a little more fancy (but nonetheless easy), whip up a pisco punch – the famed drink of pre-prohibition San Francisco, with which Rudyard Kipling was so taken that he claimed it was “compounded of the shavings of cherub’s wings, the glory of a tropical dawn, the red clouds of sunset and the fragments of lost epics by dead masters”. Make it at home: pisco punch 700ml (one bottle) Peruvian pisco480ml still or sparkling mineral water360ml freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice (strained)240ml pineapple syrup (see below)120ml Lillet rouge or Dubonnet (optional) To make the pineapple syrup, peel a whole fresh pineapple and cut it into small (one inch) chunks. Place these chunks in a bowl and cover with a simple syrup made from two parts raw sugar to one part hot water. Place overnight in the refrigerator. Strain the syrup from the pineapple and keep the pineapple chunks for garnishing individual cups of punch. To make the punch, simply combine the ingredients in the punch bowl just before your guests arrive. For the pisco, look for a high-quality Peruvian one – Campo de Encanto is a recent entrant on the market and is now widely available. Make sure the lemon or lime juice is squeezed just before mixing into the punch – it can develop off flavours if prepared too far in advance. The mineral water is traditionally still, but can be sparkling if you’d like a few bubbles. San Francisco bartender Duggan McDonnell adds a splash of Lillet rouge to his pisco punches to imitate the long-lost secret ingredient and red hue of Duncan Nicol’s original pisco punch (the very one that inspired Kipling’s reveries on the subject). If you can’t find Lillet rouge, Dubonnet will perform the same trick, just a little less admirably. Pair it with a film: Justin Kurzel’s 2015 adaptation of Macbeth – even if the Weird Sisters of Kurzel’s film never actually say the famous “Double, double, toil and trouble” line. 4. Sip on a paloma We’re not just headed towards Halloween this weekend – it’s also just before the Día de Muertos, Mexico’s Day of the Dead. While the growing love affair with the Día de Muertos has become somewhat, ahem, problematic, nobody will begrudge you if you raise a small salute to Mexico’s unique religious traditions in the form of a delicious beverage. While the margarita might be the best-known of all Mexican mixed drinks, the most popular one inside Mexico is undoubtedly the paloma – a simple blend of tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda, with an optional salt rim. If you want to add a slightly goth air to your salt rim (it is Halloween, after all), pick up some black lava salt. After a really long Monday, I am dreaming of a Strawberry Paloma Cocktail.

Fill a shallow saucer with your salt – black lava salt or some other coarse sea salt – and roll the glass’s rim around the saucer until it picks up a nice coating of salt flakes. (If the flakes are very large, lightly crush them beforehand – you want them to be about the consistency of coarse sugar.) To make the drink, mix the tequila and lime in a tall collins or highball glass, then add the soda. Top with ice cubes and garnish with a wedge of lime, fresh grapefruit and/or an eyeball. Pair it with a video game: Grim Fandango, one of the best puzzle games of the 1990s, is set in a world based on Dìa de Muertos imagery – and it’s now available for iOS.
