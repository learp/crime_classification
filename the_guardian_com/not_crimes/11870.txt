I’m sitting beneath the bentlive oak, wishing the plane blinking above mewas a satellite that would shoot imagesof my older brother back down into my brainso I could print them outand paste them on the wall. I have tokeep looking at this one picture of himto remember how his jaw was and which side of the moonhe parted his hair. He’s alwaysaway from me now, some animal or constellationthat walked out of the world but for rumorsand half skeletons found in the Congo, drawingsof what they might have looked like. My brain dreamsabout cities from outer space, a place with a namelike Kilimanjaro where he might still be walking around in his VisionStreet Wear high tops, or even a shadow like my fatherwho talked about Costco the night of my brother’s cremation and howpumpkiny the pumpkin pie wasthough he bought it in a frozen pack of twenty. Just like a real bakery, he said, you just throw it in the oven,he kept saying that, you just throw it in the oven, you just throw it in the oven.• From Brother by Matthew and Michael Dickman (Faber, £10.99).
