Joe Ramirez does not do things by halves. He has in his time made a chair with 112 joints, lacquered a car 17 times, and once spent five years restoring frescos in a Benedictine chapel in Chicago. So it comes as no surprise to learn that the California artist has been working on The Gold Projections since 2005. It is the latest instance of him being possessed by what he calls an “irresistible urge to master a craft”.The Gold Projections – in which he projects slow-motion films or single images on to gilded convex discs – emerged from years spent studying everything from medieval gilding techniques to 16th-century books of magic. But the project is also linked, inextricably, to the blue-collar work ethic instilled in him by his plumber father.The 58-year-old has some influential fans: Wim Wenders, the film director, has described how The Gold Projections “take us back to the marvel provided by the first moving images”. The world premiere, happening on Sunday at the Kulturforum as part of the Berlin film festival, will take the form of a “screening” of Somnium, his two-hour-long film painting.

The windows are draped in black, which feels more protective than gloomy. Hanging from the ceiling is a giant golden orb, across which images silently drift and quiver – shaped and textured by the brush-stroked finish of the gilded surface.Red camellias in the rain, a floating ladder, a barefoot woman clutching a bowl – the dreamlike images tell a tale loosely based on Johannes Kepler’s 1608 novella Somnium, sometimes called the first sci-fi story, in which the German astronomer describes a dream journey to the moon. It also dramatises Kepler’s real-life attempts to absolve his mother from charges of witchcraft.The Gold Projections were also influenced by The Sacrifice, a film by the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. “I was blown back when I saw the dream sequence,” says Ramirez, who also cites the Spanish baroque, William Blake, Andy Warhol’s Screen Tests, Albrecht Dürer and Cimabue as influences.

It was information overload, like a composer being handed the notebooks of Mozart. To have that intimacy was profound.”Seeing The Last Judgment scene by scene as he was hoisted up was like experiencing painting as film, he says, and it gave him the inspiration for this “fresco cinema”, a way of marrying the two art forms. He even spent years and several thousand dollars securing a patent. “I wanted to protect it,” he says, “like Yves Klein did with his blue.”The legalese used to describe his technique probably captures it better than any art critic has so far managed. According to US patent number 20140355112, it is a “gold-coated projection-receiving surface” in which “a light, or a portion thereof, passes through each of the multiple ordered layers (gold, clay, adhesive, chalk) and reflects back a lustrous, iridescent image that has motion and depth qualities with transmuted colour characteristics”.Ramirez knew he needed a big space – the discs weigh 200kg and have a diameter of 2.5 metres. Hearing that Berlin was cheap compared with other cities, he came to see it for himself, eventually finding the red-brick gymnasium, which he bought eight years ago. He met Wenders through a mutual friend, the photographer Jim Rakete, and recalls how, one evening at the director’s house, the photographer started singing the Patti Smith song My Blakean Year.

Sight unseen, she agreed. She jumped in a cab when she was next in Berlin and came by for soup, and we talked and talked.” As a result, Smith is now the “silent narrator” who appears at regular intervals in Somnium.Ramirez, who studied painting and film at the Art Institute of Chicago and sculpture at the Royal College of Art in London, says his workspace reminds him of his childhood home, which was “full of materials like wood, pipes, paints – the expectation was that you made things, that you strove to be fast and perfect”.Surrounded by boxes of pigments, rabbit-skin glues, coloured clays, storyboards hung up or packed into shoeboxes and ideas scribbled on the back of U-Bahn tickets, Ramirez applies the final layers of gold to his discs, a prayerful process in which he rubs the end of a squirrel-hair paintbrush against his scalp to create static, which he then uses to lift a leaf of gold – a hundred times thinner than a cigarette paper – from a cushion of deerskin suede and move it on to the wetted wooden disc. It flickers into place like the wings of a moth and he presses it down with an agate stone, which is like “crushing the light”. The delicate indentations make the forms subsequently cast on to it seem hesitant and chimerical, like slow-paced animations.“We’re so visually sophisticated these days, we’re dead,” he says. “Often, watching films is no different to flipping through magazines in a dental office. It’s no surprise there’s been an erosion of what people once felt was certain – that they’re not even sure man was on the moon. What I want to do is bring back the wonder.”• The Gold Projections are at Berlin’s Kulturforum until 19 February.
