Local activists in Flint, Michigan, were joined on Monday by actor Mark Ruffalo and billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer to amplify calls for long-term solutions in addressing the city’s water-contamination crisis.Less than 24 hours after the Democratic presidential candidates left Flint to continue campaigning ahead of Michigan’s primary on Tuesday, the environmental advocates joined local organizers inside a downtown church to demand accountability and approval of a disaster declaration for the cash-strapped city, which would release additional resources. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton spar in fierce debate in Flint But even with an outpouring of support from celebrities and massive donations of water resources, the reality in the city remains stark: months after Michigan governor Rick Snyder announced that Flint was deep into a protracted water crisis, officials said the water is still unsafe to drink, with no definitive timeline on when the prognosis may change. Last week, officials announced nearly 10% of tested sites in Flint still have excessive levels of contamination. “What happened here is a crisis of credibility from the government,” said Ruffalo, his voice rising. “From the federal government and the state government. What’s happening here is a national emergency.”Though the US government denied a request last month to declare Flint a disaster zone, Ruffalo said the decision should be reversed.“I’m imploring President Obama to consider Flint, Michigan, a national disaster starting today,” he said.The Michigan legislature has, so far, appropriated $70m to address the myriad issues in Flint, and Obama’s approval of an emergency declaration sent an additional $5m in aid. But residents have said the aid doesn’t go far enough – and Republican lawmakers have stymied further efforts to send additional resources in recent weeks.Van Jones, CNN commentator and founder of Green For All, said the response to Flint’s crisis hasn’t gone far enough.“The prolonged, protracted failure of the state to act – at some point – goes from being an emergency to a disaster,” Jones said, adding: “This has to now be declared a disaster area so the federal government can get here to do its job.”The city of 100,000 has been grappling with a water crisis since April 2014, after a state-appointed emergency manager switched Flint’s drinking water source to a local river. The switch, made as an interim measure until a new water system Flint planned to join was operational, left the city reeling, as the Michigan department of environmental quality (DEQ) did not require the city to treat the river water with anti-corrosion agents, allowing lead to leach off pipes and taint household tap water.“We need to be repaid 100% of what we’ve paid for toxic water since 2014,” said resident Desiree Duell. The Michigan legislature has appropriated $30m to Flint’s water utility, but the money is expected to be used as a partial credit, dating back to April 2014, and is expected to only cover 65% of a resident’s bill.Earlier on Monday, organizers from Green for All – a national initiative launched to highlight environmental issues in low-income communities – ferried Ruffalo, Steyer, and residents around Flint on a bus to highlight chief demands from local activists: water bill reimbursements, a full replacement of lead service lines in the city, and infrastructure investments to address long-term financial impacts in wake of the crisis.The bus stopped at Hurley Medical Center, where pediatrician Dr Mona Hanna-Attisha first raised alarm about the number of Flint children experiencing elevated blood levels of lead.“We wanted to make sure that the whole country was paying attention to what was happening in Flint,” Vien Truong, Green For All director, told the Guardian.Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton focused on Flint’s crisis for nearly 20 minutes in the opening of Monday’s debate, but Truong said they failed to address how to accelerate toward “the solution”.“Right now,” she said, “this is a disaster.” Nakiya Wakes, resident and activist with local group Flint rising, said both of her sons have tested positive for lead poisoning.“Not everyone in Flint has been impacted by this manmade crisis like I have,” Wakes said. “But we have all been impacted in some way – physically, mentally, or both. But what has happened to our community has not broken us – it’s brought us together.”
