Kanye West has said he will release a new album this summer, announcing the plans on Twitter.KANYE WEST (@kanyewest)New album coming this summerFebruary 24, 2016The announcement could mean anything. West just released his album The Life Of Pablo, after announcing in January via Twitter that the album, then named Swish, would be released 11 February. That day, he released it at an elaborate album/fashion launch in Madison Square Garden, but the album was not available for purchase until 14 February – and West is still tinkering with it.West’s album tease came in the middle of a Wednesday tweet storm, in which the rapper spent the afternoon commenting on the Grammys, his personal debt, mental and economic freedom and more. West called the Grammys “way off and completely out of touch”.“Hi Grammys this is the most important living artist talking,” he declared. West said he wants to fix the annual awards show for other black artists, proclaiming ASAP Rocky’s LSD video the best one of the year. “You like your black people a certain way also,” West wrote. “You wouldn’t have Future perform and that man owned the clubs last summer.”KANYE WEST (@kanyewest)You like your black people a certain way also.

The rapper reacted angrily to criticism from record producer Bob Ezrin, who said West’s music would not stand the test of time, unlike that of “other creators in his genre”. West retaliated in a series of tweets, telling Ezrin to “please never speak in public again … you are everything that is wrong with the old guard”.
