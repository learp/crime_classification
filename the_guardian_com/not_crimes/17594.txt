Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty has come under fire for advocating the use of George Orwell’s Animal Farm as a teaching aid to promote care for animals amongst children.Shetty, whose fame was amplified in the UK after she appeared on reality show Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, was speaking to the Times of India and giving her reaction to the news that JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series will be required reading for Indian schoolchildren.“I think having books like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter as part of the syllabus is a great move because it cultivates imagination and creativity at a young age,” she said.Shetty continued: “I think books like Little Women would also encourage respect towards women at a young age. Even a book like Animal Farm can teach the little ones to love and care for animals.”Although Shetty’s recommendation – which appears to confuse a dystopian fable with something somewhat fluffier – has since been removed from the online version of the article, users on Twitter have posted photographs of the print version. They have also been responsible for trending hashtag #shilpashettyreviews, in which users suggest other literary misapprehensions which could be attributed to the actor.
