Welcome to this week’s blog, and our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.I know that this is kind of the point of our whole enterprise here, but I still love the way Tips, Links and Suggestions makes me find out about things that I would entirely miss otherwise. This recommendation from from JamesLibTech is a case in point: Well, because I generally make rash decisions, I picked up one of the last copies I could find of David Ireland’s World Repair Video Game (shipped all the way to California from the shores of Australia) and it arrived yesterday afternoon.I didn’t know the plot going into it and about 20 pages in (before I nodded off in my chair last night) I still don’t exactly know what it’s going to be about. I, of course, picked it up based 90% on the fact that they only made 350 copies, 5% for the cover, and 5% because it was on the PM Literary awards shortlist.I had to look up a couple Australian terms I didn’t know, but otherwise it’s going smoothly in the early going. That said, I feel like there’s going to be some dark shit at the core and I’m curious to see if I’m right. Any time someone’s grinding up bones... well, it usually means it didn’t end well for SOMEone.So of course I’ve put down everything else I’m in the middle of to read this. If I don’t start clearing the stack on the couch-side table, my wife may grind up MY bones...I enjoy the jokes too, and the wonderful descriptions. I know exactly what Vieuxtemps means about Dickens and his Warts And All Sprawly Big Hot Messes, for instance: I finished up “The Uncommercial Traveler” by Charles Dickens, a book I’ve been occasionally picking through for a long time. Some of the essays and stories were a second or third go-around, but most were new, and I enjoyed it very much. I do love Dickens, including his Warts And All Sprawly Big Hot Messes, but his shorter pieces seems to concentrate him down to a more personal and direct voice. They are different from the novels, and yet still so familiar. Recommended for Dickens fans, or perhaps the Dickens Curious.And who wouldn’t be Dickens Curious? Meanwhile, on the subject of novelists’ non-fiction writings, Vesca has a good tip relating to George Orwell: The last few days I’ve been reading George Orwell’s Letters (Or rather A Life in Letters, which is mostly letters written by him but with the occasional one to him, or from his wife Eileen to someone else). I went in expecting them to be gloomy (this is probably an assumption I got from reading his novels) but actually they’re quite chatty and amusing. Eileen is also very funny, inveigling her way to Spain and lending money to his comrades in arms because they’ve not been paid yet. Elsewhere, a topical warning from Robert Rudolph:  I’ve finished Masha Gessen’s The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin. It is well-written journalism, concentrating on Putin’s domestic policies, all of which are outrageous or depressing. Unsolved murders, unexplained poisonings, a hostage-rescue operation of the old doctor joke type - the operation was declared a success but most of the patients died - all against the backdrop of a presidency for life.Finally, Sara Richards has been enjoying the wonderful James Salter: I’ve just read All That Is by James Salter which came well recommended and didn’t disappoint. It feels very much - and I really hesitate to say this - a man’s book, but that isn’t in any way a criticism.Bowman, the protagonist amidst a host of other bit players is a sinned against sinner. The description of his seduction and betrayal of Anet was heartbreaking and I’m afraid I shouted at him at that point. But the writing is beautiful, spare and luminous with some wonderful descriptions of the world that Bowman and those around him live in. Every life is considered in what could really be used as a masterclass in writing, as Salter manages to say so much in so few words. A rare skill.Interesting links about books and readingThe New Yorker has published a lost F.
