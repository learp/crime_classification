When aliens make contact with humanity, Cara Sweeney learns that she will be sharing her house and family with one: Aelyx. Most humans, however, are dead set against the L’eihrs, even though their DNA is nearly identical to humans. Aelyx experiences discrimination against his kind, and so does Cara for assisting him.At first Cara is slightly repulsed by Aelyx, because he is admittedly strange, not just because he is an alien, but because he can’t stomach human food either. However when Cara’s school becomes infected with paranoia over Aelyx being ‘welcomed’ into the community by officials, the school and town aren’t safe anymore.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The book brings a good mix of romance and little sprinkles of humour here and there. It was an easy to read book and had an interesting plot. Aelyx’s perspective was interesting and allowed readers to see our normal culture through his eyes. The protagonist Cara wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to Aelyx about how strange she found him; she did not only voice this to Aelyx, but also on her blog and in interviews. However the relationship development was incredible and was interesting to experience. At first Aeylx had a repulsive opinion of each other and the varying cultures, but you could clearly see that Aeylx was trying to blend and experience society. But Aeylx does come across as slightly annoying at first because he seems to be a caring person who feels.Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop
