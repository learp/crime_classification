As we press on along the ridge above the wood, on the north side of the path we find ponies raising the browse line as they stretch high into the hollies. A large white one strains every muscle in its neck to get at the most tender branch-end leaves. Forest ponies eat a huge quantity of holly during the cold weather. People often cut branches to make life easier for them, but this group don’t need any help.On the other side, we spot one of the woodland’s giants that has come to grief. Possibly dating from the origins of Red Shoot Wood in the 17th and 18th centuries, this huge oak has been caught by some vortex-wind, and lifted enough to break the myriad of cable-like roots anchoring it into the shallow clay that coats the underlying gravels. Its fall was not long ago in forest time, yet far enough back for the first bracket fungi to form along the shattered boughs, and for the creamy powder from the holes of tiny woodboring beetles to hang in balls on the spider-webs below, as though nature has created seasonal baubles.

In summer, water lilies add colour; now their decaying leaves paint an oily sheen on its surface. We cut back across the heart of the wood, following a route that appears clearly marked on the Ordnance Survey sheet. We feel confident for a while, but then unease creeps in. Just where are we? We have become completely lost in a confusing maze of footpaths. With my GPS still at home, and two smartphones that cannot agree where north is, we have to work by instinct. As we make slow progress, we notice that we are being watched with interest by a roe buck. He doesn’t move as we study each other for several minutes, nor when we go on. If we hadn’t got lost, we wouldn’t have seen him. Something positive to ease our embarrassment. Follow Country diary on Twitter: @gdncountrydiary
