Tiny sap-sucking bugs are being unleashed to fight a destructive cactus infesting parts of western Queensland.The cochineal insect was bred in Queensland specifically to target coral cactus, which is wreaking havoc on graziers’ properties. The bug feeds only on the cactus by sucking its sap.Locust plague causes nightmare for Queensland graziers It was trialled in a Brisbane laboratory last year and will be released into the wild on Wednesday.Last year, one farmer in the region reported a 500ha area of his property was infested by the weed, which is closely related to the prickly pear.The sharp spines of the cactus make it difficult for livestock to reach food.“It is hoped [the bug] will provide much-needed relief to land managers who are experiencing major infestations on their properties in Queensland,” Biosecurity Queensland’s senior entomologist, Michael Day, said.Graziers must use herbicides or physically remove the weed, which is time-consuming and costly.The first bug release will happen near Longreach. Further releases are scheduled around Charleville, Hebel, Emerald and Cloncurry in the coming months.Similar coral cactus control measures have been successful in South Africa and Zimbabwe.
