 It is being dubbed “frenzied Friday” and is set to be the busiest food shopping day of the year in the UK, with an estimated 10 million people expected to hit supermarket aisles on 23 December.After a year of grocery pricing offensives, this Friday is when the key commercial battle will be fought – and fought well into the evening, to cater for shoppers who are still working.The Centre for Retail Research has calculated that shopping is set to peak on the Friday before Christmas – the day when many will receive their December pay cheque. It estimates that shoppers will spend £894m – or £865,158 a minute – on food, drink and gifts that day. Spending in Britain is set to make up 25% of total expenditure that Friday across Europe. The average British family spends £800 on its Christmas shopping (including food, drink and gifts) – almost double the European average.The day on which Christmas Day – this year on a Sunday – and subsequent bank holidays fall affects shopping patterns. “I think this year shoppers will start buying their fresh produce from Wednesday onwards, to make sure it’s in tip-top condition,” said Joshua Bamfield, an analyst with CRR. “Friday is definitely going to be the busiest day and convenience stores will benefit from people ‘topping up’ at the last minute.”Bosses at Asda and Waitrose expect Friday to be the most frenetic day, with the latter anticipating its till takings will be three and a half times higher than normal Friday trading. The UK’s largest retailer, Tesco, along with Sainsbury’s, expects shopping to be more spread out over the week while the Co-op convenience store chain, which has 2,800 shops across the UK, has earmarked its busiest day as Christmas Eve.For those hoping to steer clear of jammed aisles, the hour from 11am on 23 December is traditionally the busiest of the year for grocery shopping.Many retailers make more than half of their sales and profits in the three months before Christmas, and despite the marked shift in Britons’ shopping habits to “little and often” and online, the festive fresh-food shop still tends to be a large one, done in person at the supermarket. Waitrose opened the Christmas delivery slots for online shopping on 22 September this year due to customer demand – 93 days before the day itself.

The retailer expects to sell more than 6.5 million pigs in blankets and over 720 tonnes of stuffing. M&S was the first retailer to launch ready-made fresh gravy 20 years ago and expects to sell 500,000 litres in December, easing the stress of struggling with chicken stock. Despite shoppers having the chance to stock up in advance with wine, beers and spirits, Asda says that on Friday alone it expects to sell more than 620,000 litres of Budweiser.Aldi has prepared for peak shopping on Friday by organising 1,000 extra trucks on the road to meet increased demand. Tony Baines, Aldi’s joint managing director of corporate buying, said: “We’re gearing up for our busiest week of the year as shoppers stock up on festive treats ahead of the big day.”But this year environmental charities are urging shoppers to exercise restraint and not buy food they don’t need – or ensure they use up their leftovers. According to the government’s waste advisory body, Wrap, in the UK an estimated two million turkeys, five million Christmas puddings and 74 million mince pies are thrown away each year. It is also estimated that, three-quarters of us struggle to eat all of the food we buy for the festive season.“It can be so easy to get carried away at the supermarket in the run-up to Christmas, as none of us want to run out of food,” said Trewin Restorick, chief executive and founder of environmental charity Hubbub.“Unfortunately that can often lead to food going to waste as we buy more than we need. The best way to avoid this is to plan ahead before you go shopping and if you do overbuy don’t forget to freeze what you can.”
