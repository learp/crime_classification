A £7.1m appeal has been launched to buy hundreds of historic and personal objects that belonged to Sir Winston Churchill at his country home.The National Trust is looking to acquire hundreds of heirlooms that have been on long-term loan at Grade-I listed Chartwell, near Sevenoaks in Kent.Just over half of the collection at Churchill’s much-loved family home is already owned by the trust, which was given the property in 1946 by a consortium of his friends and colleagues.With views across the Weald of Kent, Chartwell offered Churchill an escape from the pressures of political life. And it is the only place where his objects can be seen in their original domestic setting.Now, on the 50th anniversary of Chartwell opening to the public, his great-grandson Randolph Churchill has offered the trust the chance to buy some of the most significant loaned items.These include Churchill’s library of inscribed books, medallions, gifts and awards, including his Nobel prize for literature, along with personal mementos such as a wooden box where he stored his rousing speeches.
