Neighbours stars Kylie Minogue and Guy Pearce are reuniting for a film by The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert director Stephan Elliott, marking their first time working together since their Ramsay Street days.The duo will be taken back to suburban Australia in the production Flammable Children: a comic feature film set in Australia in 1975. The film will also star Radha Mitchell.According to Screen Australia, the film takes place “as the sexual revolution is in full swing: Saigon will fall; the first sounds of 2JJ are hitting the airwaves; Australia is in constitutional crisis; and in a sleepy beachside suburb an extraordinary event will set in motion a crucial, comical and revelatory week for a teenage boy and girl. Something is about to go spectacularly wrong, and their lives will change forever.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Guy Pearce and Kylie Minogue in 1990.

Composer Guy Gross and editor Sue Blainey, also from Priscilla, join the crew.The chief executive of Screen Australia, Graeme Mason, said: “We are so excited to be able to support Flammable Children. In Kylie, Guy and Radha, the team has been able to secure some of Australia’s most established and iconic talents. The powerhouse in front of the camera is matched by the award-winning team behind it, who will bring our memories of 1970s Australia to life.”Flammable Children starts production in south-east Queensland in October this year.
