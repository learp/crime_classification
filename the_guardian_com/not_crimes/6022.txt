Once you’ve flown the nest, and set up home elsewhere, the last thing you expect is to end up back with your parents.But according to a new survey this happens more often than you might imagine. What’s more, people in this situation have been given a name: doomerangers.Unlike the boomerang generation – who return to the family home not long after flying the nest – doomerangers left the family home many years before, and return due to financial circumstances, or the sudden loss of their home due to a break-up. A survey of 505 people in this situation, conducted for Churchill Insurance, found that a quarter of people who moved back had done so after a relationship fell apart. The research revealed men were more likely to become a doomeranger after a divorce or separation. Financial pressure is the main reason, according to 55% of respondents. We want to hear from so-called doomerangers about moving back in with their parents in later life. Share your experiences with us below.
