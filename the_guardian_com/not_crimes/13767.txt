I had never read a Morgan Matson book so I decided to venture out of my comfort zone and find out what makes this author so well loved.The Unexpected Everything follows a girl named Andie who always sticks to plans and doesn’t get on with her dad like she used to. When her summer programme gets cancelled the unexpected happens and she has to spend the summer at home with her dad.From dogs to family and love interests, there seems to be everything in the book. I loved all the characters in this book because they are quite diverse in the sense that they could resemble anyone, so readers will be able to relate to at least one of the characters. Andie (the main character) is such a loveable character and Morgan writes her in way that meant I was able to understand all her decisions. Her thoughts and emotions were so relatable and I could see myself in her.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I loved how this book had multiple of things happening; for example, Andie has to find a way to get to know her dad again whilst she has to solve her friendship problems. The reason why I loved this is because it represented what an actual teenager has to face in her life.This book was a quick read, because there were so many things happening that you constantly feel the need to be on the edge of your seat and flipping the pages quickly. The writing of this book was really easy to read and so I didn’t have any problems. I also found that I went through a series of emotions: I was happy at one part then I had tears in my eyes at another part. Matson has a way of keeping the reader focused.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? Overall I really loved this book and I will definitely be reading more of Matson’s books in the future. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a YA contemporary or a summer read for the holidays.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
