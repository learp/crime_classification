Cherries are, for me, the most exciting of all the stone fruits. Their season is rather short, but decidedly sweet. Like apricots, the stone contains a kernel with a bitter almond flavour called a noyau (French for kernel or pit).I learned about noyaux while working at Chez Panisse. It was mainly the apricot pits we bothered to crack open, but I vividly remember making a cherry fruit soup and taking the time to get the noyaux from the cherries. It was a revelation: there is so much flavour in this little stone, but it is usually just tossed away.The classic clafoutis is made with whole cherries with their stones left in, but I like to make it easier for those eating the dessert by pitting them, cracking open the shells and pulling out the precious cores to sprinkle into the pudding. I just use a tea towel and a regular old hammer to prise them out.Cherries are also great with dark chocolate. Some chocolates have hints of cherry in their flavour profiles, so taste a couple and see which ones you like and think would go well with sour cherry flavours. My cake this week is a take on the classic Black Forest gateau. I’ve made it toweringly tall, and for the topping, I’ve used fresh cherries, cooked down and softened, instead of jarred ones.Look for plump, smooth fruits free from pock marks or bruises. The stems should be fresh and green, never dried-up or brown.Cherry chocolate cream cakeMakes a 20cm cakeFor the sponge200g dark chocolate (70%-85%)185g plain flour60g cocoa½ tsp bicarbonate of sodaA pinch of salt4 eggs300g caster sugar150g vegetable oil250g plain yoghurt For the filling600g fresh red or black cherries (keep 100g aside for the topping)4 tbsp brown sugar4 tbsp maraschino or kirsch500g double cream2 tbsp caster sugar2 tsp vanilla For the topping80g double cream100g dark chocolate (70%-85% cocoa), chopped100g cherries1 Preheat your oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a 20cm/8 inch loose-bottomed tin with baking paper.2 Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pot of barely simmering water, then leave to cool slightly. Meanwhile, in another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder and bicarbonate of soda.3 On a stand mixer, whisk the salt, eggs and sugar until very light and fluffy. Drizzle in the oil on medium-slow speed as you would for a mayonnaise, until all is incorporated and smooth and shiny. Fold in the cooled, melted chocolate. Fold in half the dry ingredients then half the yoghurt, and repeat again until all the dry ingredients and yoghurt have been added.4 Pour the mix into the tin, then bake it for 55-60 minutes. Allow it to cool completely, then remove from the tin and split the cake into three layers with a serrated knife. Wash the cake tin and line it with clingfilm.5 To make the filling, pit and halve the cherries. Put 500g of these into a small saucepan along with 4 tbsp brown sugar and 4 tbsp cherry liqueur of your choice. Bring to a simmer and cook until most of the liquid is reduced and the cherries soften (about 10 minutes). Set this aside to cool. Meanwhile, loosely whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla and set aside.6 Put one layer of the sponge into the bottom of the clingfilm-lined cake tin. Cover with half the cooked cherries and half of any juice. Cover with half the whipped cream. Put another layer of sponge over this and repeat the layers. Top with the remaining layer and press gently to bring it all together. Chill for 30 minutes to 3 hours.7 For the topping, heat the cream in a small saucepan and then pour it over the chopped chocolate. Let the mixture rest for five minutes before stirring until smooth. Pit and halve the remaining 100g of fresh cherries.8 To finish, push the cake out from below. Discard the clingfilm. Put on a nice plate or cake stand and top with the chocolate, smooth it over the top and sprinkle with the fresh cherries.ClafoutisServes 650g butter600g cherries, pitted (save about 6 pits for extracting noyaux)70g flour½ tsp cinnamon150g caster sugarA pinch of salt3 eggs300g milkIcing sugar, for dusting (optional)1 Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Spread 25g of the butter inside an oval baking dish of about 23cm. Fill with the pitted cherries in a single layer.2 Put a clean tea towel on a sturdy surface (sometimes an outdoor table is best) with the short side closest to you. About 6 or 7cm down from the top of the cloth, put a single row of the cherry pits about 6cm apart. Fold the cloth over the pits and use a hammer to carefully crack the shells open. Separate the noyaux from the shells and sprinkle it over the cherries. Set aside.3 Whisk together the flour, cinnamon, salt and 100g of the sugar. Whisk in the eggs one by one and then the milk, then pour this mixture over the cherries.4 Sprinkle with the remaining 50g sugar. Cut the remaining 25g butter into tiny pieces and scatter on the top.5 Bake for 40-45 minutes until puffed and lightly golden. Let it cool completely before cutting. Can be sprinkled with icing sugar if desired.Claire Ptak is an author and food stylist and owns Violet Bakery in London.
