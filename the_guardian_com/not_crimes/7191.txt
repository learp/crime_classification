9.06pm BST21:06Yowzabungeroonie. Thanks everyone, that was a ride. Feeling a bit odd about Benjamina’s departure. But Selasi was more entertaining than ever tonight. I love him so much. I almost wish I didn’t.Until next week, my dears. See you for Patisserie, despite the absence of Valerie.Come say hello on twitter or instagram or in the real world if you happen upon me by chance and it isn’t weird. Also if you see me eating out of a bin, not then either.Bye! Be good.xFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.01pm BST21:01MrsVictoria I would chuck anyone under the bus for Selasi too, but am starting to feel guilty about that. Man is chancing his arm. He’s like an RAF pilot stuck behind enemy lines, relying on sheer ingenuity and his moustache to keep him from capture. He better raise his game next week or he’s out for sure.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose9.00pm BST21:00I feel very guilty that Selasi is still there. Benjamina is probably...the better baker? Definitely more consistent. He’s like a wave machine. Fun, but of variable depth.

What a good baker.‘She’s a sister to me.’ Okay Selasi settles the sibling debate. I concede.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.57pm BST20:57Candice wins!Candice wins! Honestly thought she might caw in jane’s face.BENJAMINA? Did NOT see that coming. Did Paul say he loved her? I’ve seen no evidence of that.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.56pm BST20:56That wasn’t too bad from Selasi? Has he clawed it back? Yes yes we all love the peacock, Mary. Oh god they know.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.54pm BST20:54Oh Selasi. That looks like the paper crowns they give children who have their birthday at Burger King. Woeful. Two different types of marzipan, though, which is … good?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.54pm BST20:54I would pay to see that in real life. Bird Wars. Is that too similar to monkey tennis? FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.54pm BST20:54Candice peacocking with her peacock. But come on, a lot of that centerpiece is just leaves. The heart of blueberries was an exquisite touch though, and she nails lemon and mint sponges, which I can’t even imagine. Peacock defeats swan, surely?
