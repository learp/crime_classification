In the latest of Kanye West’s GOOD Friday releases, the artist also known as Yeezus has marked Easter Sunday with an alternate version of his song Ultralight Beam.Ultralight Prayer includes an extended cameo by the gospel singer Kirk Franklin, who was featured on the original version of the song. While Ultralight Beam was about West’s faith in God – including lyrics such as “I’m tryna keep my faith / But I’m looking for more / Somewhere I can feel safe / And end my holy war” – the new version is solely centred around an impassioned prayer by the gospel musician and author, and reads as below: Father,This prayer is for everyone that feels they’re not good enough This prayer’s for everybody that feels they’re too messed upFor everyone that feels they’ve said ‘I’m sorry’ too many timesLet them know that’s why you took the nailSo we could have eternal lifeIf all God’s children would get down on their knees and prayAnd give up all of those things that pull our hearts awayYou will forgive all of our wrong and make us brand new againBut I won’t make it, God, if you let go of my handThat’s why we need more faithYes, I’m searching for you, I’m looking for moreYes I am, in your arms is where I feel safeThey’re killing our babies in the streets, I call out for warI need just a little bit more of some faithJust a mustard seed, I’m looking for you, for morePrayer for our homes and our familiesWe just wanna be safeCan’t you hear the trumpet sound, I think I hear warIt’s just the latest extension of West’s new album, The Life of Pablo. The rapper has primarily been using Jay Z’s streaming service Tidal to upload variations of songs on the record (the song below is also available on Soundcloud). West has described the album as “a living, breathing, changing creative expression”, and has periodically added edits of songs such as Wolves and Famous.
