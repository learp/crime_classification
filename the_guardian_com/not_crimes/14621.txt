One Direction’s Louis Tomlinson is not expected to face charges over an alleged assault on a photographer at Los Angeles international airport, according to prosecutors.The 25-year-old singer was arrested on 3 March when he was travelling with his girlfriend, Eleanor Calder. Lawyers for the singer said he was “provoked” by the paparazzi during the incident. Calder is believed to have argued with onlookers who began filming the row.The Los Angeles city attorney’s office said Tomlinson will be called to a hearing before the authority later this month. A spokesman said: “Each of the parties will be interviewed regarding the incident and advised of the law and ways to avoid similar incidences in the future.“Typically, there is no further action taken by our office after the hearing, though we do reserve the right to file charges up to one year from the date of the original incident should additional information or future actions require additional measures.” An arrest record showed Tomlinson was held under citizen’s arrest, and the alleged offence was classed as a misdemeanour. Bail was set at $20,000 (£16,000) at the time of Tomlinson’s arrest.
