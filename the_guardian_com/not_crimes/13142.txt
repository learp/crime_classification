The US supreme court largely upheld Barack Obama's plans to cut carbon pollution from power plants on Monday, delivering critical support for his climate action plan.The court reaffirmed the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, which is the pillar of Obama's climate plan.The court did rule 5-4 to trim the scope of those rules, but the justices said the overall result was weighted in favour of the EPA.“EPA is getting almost everything it wanted in this case,” Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his opinion. “It sought to regulate sources it said were responsible for 86% of all the greenhouse gases emitted from stationary sources nationwide. Under our holdings, EPA will be able to regulate sources responsible for 83% of those emissions.”The decision was the third time the supreme court has reaffirmed the EPA's authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions – and the justices have indicated they will not entertain further challenges to that broad question.That reduces the prospects for success of the anticipated flurry of legal challenges to the EPA's new power plant rules from industry, conservative groups, and the attorney generals of Republican states.The EPA as well as environmental groups described the decision as a big win.“Today is a good day for all supporters of clean air and public health and those concerned with creating a better environment for future generations,” the EPA said in a statement.“The supreme court’s decision is a win for our efforts to reduce carbon pollution because it allows EPA, states and other permitting authorities to continue to require carbon pollution limits in permits for the largest pollution sources.”However Richard Faulk, of the law and economics centre of George Mason University, argued the supreme court decision represented “a stinging and devastating rebuke to EPA's grand design of regulating the entire economy”.At issue on Monday was whether new industrial facilities – oil refineries, factories and the power plants covered by Obama's climate plan – could be compelled to limit their carbon dioxide emissions.The court ruled that facilities that were already required to obtain permits for other air pollutants could also be compelled to limit greenhouse emissions.The justices agreed with the EPA's rationale that it was regulating those industries for greenhouse gas emissions just as it did with earlier rules for cars.But the court said the EPA rules for industry as originally written were too sweeping and could corral churches and schools which are not already covered under existing air quality laws.Instead, Scalia said the new rules should be limited to the biggest sources of carbon dioxide emissions such as power plants, industrial facilities and refineries."To permit the extra 3%, however, we would have to recognise a power in EPA and other government agencies to revise clear statutory terms," he said.Campaign groups saw the decision as a big win for Obama's climate plan, because it once again endorsed the EPA's authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions.In a conference call with reporters, the Environmental Defense Fund also suggested that the original rule would have been too cumbersome for the EPA to administer.More importantly, they said Monday's decision would make it easier for the EPA to withstand future challenges from industry and conservative groups as it puts Obama's climate plan into force.
