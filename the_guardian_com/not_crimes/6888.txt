Harper Lee slammed Donald Trump’s Taj Mahal casino after a visit in 1990, writing that spending time there was “the worst punishment God can devise”, in a letter up for auction this week.Writing to her friend Doris Leapard that year, Lee begins with a quote from Edward VIII’s 1936 abdication speech: “’At last I am able to say a few words ... (and I wish they were coming from Windsor Castle)”. Informing Leapard that “the last set of visitors departed today”, Lee writes that “the worst punishment God can devise for this sinner is to make her spirit reside eternally at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City”.The casino had been opened by Trump himself earlier in 1990. “It’s just what Atlantic City needs,” he said at the time. Trump is no longer associated with the casino, which was taken over by the billionaire Carl Icahn in February 2016 after emerging from bankruptcy, according to the Associated Press.

The letters see the reclusive author, who was known for fiercely guarding her privacy, tackling topics from her own degenerating eyesight (“can’t see, drat it”) to the death of a friend. She also gives her opinion on literature, praising W Glasgow Phillips’s novel Tuscaloosa and the Alabama writer Elise Sanguinetti in different letters.Now out of print, Tuscaloosa is set in Alabama in 1972, and sees a young man fall in love with an inmate from his father’s mental institution. “As you know, I’d given up on novels written after Jane Austen’s time, and had lapsed with contentment into old fogeydom – there’s so much more to read; adolescents forever clawing at cosmic hickies is not my line of country,” she tells Bill Leapard in 1994, thanking him for sending her a copy of Tuscaloosa. “Nowadays there’s so damn little to praise, my heart leaps up when I behold a beautiful English sentence.”Author Sanguinetti, whose works are also out of print today, wrote novels set in America’s south. Lee called Sanguinetti “the finest” of Alabama’s writers”, writing that she was “funny as hell”, with “a laser-beam eye” and an “ear for Alabama speech [which] amounts to perfect pitch”.

Thanksgiving weekend was such hell that it got on [her sister] Alice’s nerves as well – they came in VANS,” wrote the novelist.Three years earlier, in a letter dated 1990, she complains to Leapard about how she is repeatedly asked for favours from strangers. “You will never believe what people take it into their heads to ask for: everything from, ‘Send two autographed first editions of Mockingbird’ to ‘Send $850 to help me get a new TV-VCR machine so I can look at the movie.’ They don’t even say please ...’’ she told Leapard.By 2003, the author’s eyesight was declining fast. She writes that year to fan and friend Don Salter, with whom she corresponded for ten years, that “I have fetched up with macular degeneration that seems to be galloping”, informing him that she is due to “have more cataract surgery”. “Please don’t put this on the internet or anything -- I’d dread for it to bring more mail! (She’s going blind, so I’ll send her a chatty letter...),” she writes to Salter.The bidding for the collection of letters opens at $750 (£525). Lee died in February at the age of 89, leaving behind her the Pulitzer-winning novel To Kill a Mockingbird, published in 1961, and Go Set a Watchman, a sequel of sorts that was written by the author before her bestselling debut, but only published last year.Lee was laid to rest in a small ceremony attended by only a few dozen people, a reflection of the private manner in which she had lived. In March, an Alabama judge signed an order to seal Lee’s will from public view after lawyers for Lee’s personal representative and attorney, Tonja Carter, had asked for it to remain private.“As the Court is no doubt aware, Ms Lee highly valued her privacy,” the lawyers wrote. “She did not wish for her private financial affairs to be matters of public discussion. Ms Lee left a considerable legacy for the public in her published works; it is not the public’s business what private legacy she left for the beneficiaries of her will.”
