Kendall Jenner backstage at a show, selfie-ready, with her feet up on the makeup table. Anna Wintour, arms folded, waiting on the front row. And Cara Delevingne, posing in Saint Laurent. All are familiar to the fashion news cycle – and, since Monday morning, to slightly confused tourists at Madame Tussauds in London.

It is just after the bit with Tom Cruise, Brangelina and Kate Winslet, past Kim and Kanye mid-selfie, and before the Star Wars section, which includes the opportunity to play Han Solo co-piloted by Chewbacca. It is done out to include a backstage area complete with rails of clothes and model polaroids (including “Karlie”, “Miranda”, “Jourdan” and even “Kate”), while front of house features a catwalk ready for aspiring models, watched by Anna Wintour on the front row on one side, and a host of slightly less fashion people in hats and suchlike stuck on a hoarding on the other side (I think we know which side is alpha there, don’t we?).Visitors are encouraged to have their catwalk moment, hang out with Kendall and sit next to Anna. And not only sit next to her, but put their arm around her and take a selfie – behaviour that would get you escorted out of a real fashion show. To maintain the illusion, there is also a collection of quite frankly terrifying actors playing fashion show producers in character, accosting members of the public and telling them to “get into hair and makeup”. Watch out, introverts, it’s all part of fun in 2016.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Lauren Cochrane and ‘Anna’ at Madame Tussauds.

Each waxwork here takes four months to make and costs about £150,000. Fashion was identified as an interest of the teenagers often dragged around the exhibit by parents and, indeed, after announcing the inclusion of Cara and Kendall, the museum’s following on Instagram went up, surely a sign of approval by Generation Z. Judging by the four-year-old spotted strutting down the catwalk on Monday, it might have a fanbase in the future, too.
