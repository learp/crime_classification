Number 10 Downing Street took delivery of its Christmas tree yesterday, just a few days after Michelle Obama unveiled her last-ever festive decorations for the White House. Meanwhile, radio and TV adverts implore us to pop down to our local garden centre this weekend as the eight million firs and spruces that Brits will buy this season are lined up for the first major rush. But is buying a tree on 3 December too early – and also a tad vulgar?If you think they appear to have arrived early this year, you’re right. Normally the second and third weekends of December are the major selling points. But as Christmas falls on a weekend, major retailers reckon that families will be buying this weekend, or on the weekend of the 10th, rather than waiting until the 17th.Bah humbug? Lots of people may think so. “Flogging Christmas trees in November, or the first few days of December, is just another example of tinsel-coated crass consumerism,” says Simon Birch, a writer for Ethical Consumer magazine. “The truth is that corporate-fuelled pressure on shoppers to buy, buy, buy is both driving people into debt and putting the environment under unsustainable pressure.”Others will say 3 December is too early because the needles will start dropping well before Christmas Day. All trees are cut at roughly the same time. The sooner you put yours in water the better, otherwise they dry out Retailers – and maybe it’s not surprising that they would say this – are spinning a different line: according to Wyevale Garden Centres’ tree buyer, David Mitchell, who has sourced more than 100,000 trees for the chain this year, buying in the first week of December is actually better than leaving it until later.“All the trees are cut in the fields at roughly the same time, in the last two weeks of November.” His argument is that the sooner you buy your tree and put it into some water at home, the better. Otherwise they are just sat in stores drying out. By his logic, trees bought in early December are less likely to shed their needles by Christmas Day than ones bought later.So what should you be buying, where, and at what price?Aim to pay the same or less than last year The British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA) says prices should be roughly the same as last year. Wyevale has held its prices for the third year, with the average 5ft-6ft tree costing around £35. But on Sunday 4 December, Aldi launches its 5ft-6ft Nordmann fir for £19.99, while Ikea is again selling its trees for £25, but you also get a £20 voucher redeemable in-store if you return between 16 January and 12 February, making the tree effectively just £5.Taller trees, meanwhile, go for tall prices: upmarket Clifton Nursery in Maida Vale, London, is selling a 10ft Nordmann fir for £235, while John Lewis is offering a free in-store “treetorial” for those aiming to make their tree a “showstopper”. For another £200 you can buy its “full festive works” tree decorating service. Someone evidently forgot the memo about austerity Britain.Brexit means British trees this year Oslo famously donates the big tree in Trafalgar Square as a grateful thank you for British support to Norway during the second world war. But according to the BCTGA, around 75% of Christmas trees are now home grown. Cheap imports from Scandinavian countries (Denmark is actually a much bigger supplier than Norway) have been hit by the falling pound, it says.Wyevale’s Mitchell says it gets the majority of its trees from Ireland, but claims to have seen Brexit coming, so did some hedging. We don’t think he was joking. Others, however, say that massive planting of trees six to eight years ago in Denmark means it will be flooding the UK this year with cheap trees, irrespective of sterling’s decline.Recent early frosts have been a bonus Last autumn was wet and mild. This year has been ideal, say growers, with early frosts in Scotland helping to send trees into semi-hibernation. This is a good thing, experts say, as it means the trees last longer after being cut down. Frosts bring out a waxy resin on the needles that helps keep the moisture in.Spindly tops are a rip-off Most buyers want something between 5ft and 6ft high. A four-foot-sixer can be passed off as 6ft if it has grown a long spindle, but that’s unfair on buyers, says Mitchell, who talks darkly of rival chains’ behaviour. It’s a viciously competitive market out there.

They make up 80% of trees bought by British households, says Harry Brightwell of the BCTGA. Norway spruces, once the most popular, account for just 15% of sales.The “new-style Swedes” are Nordmann firs that have been specially cultivated to have thinned-out branches and a lighter frame, making them easier to carry home and with more space for gifts. Other varieties such as the Fraser fir are a little pricier, but growers claim they have better “needle retention”. The Korean fir is also catching on, noted for its two-tone green and silver needles and “refreshing aroma”.The fragrance of a real tree is why many people say they prefer them, but keep an eye out for that hardy annual tabloid headline, “Could YOU be allergic to your Christmas tree?”. Moulds that grow on trees can, it seems, trigger asthma attacks, sneezing and a runny nose, say researchers, some of whom are not even sponsored by manufacturers of hay fever remedies. It even has a name: Christmas Tree Syndrome.Saw a half-inch off when you get home Experts say that cutting half an inch off the base of your tree is a good trick to keep it looking healthy for longer. Brightwell at the BCTGA says you should ideally leave it outdoors in a large bucket filled with water for a day or two before bringing it inside. Once inside, keep it watered and place it away from radiators and open fires, which somewhat destroys the Christmas card look many try to achieve.Recycle it Most councils now offer free collection in early January so that trees are recycled. But are real Christmas trees simply a decadent waste of resources that are bad for the environment?The Guardian wrestled with this question in 2008 pointing out that most trees are intensively farmed on an industrial scale and are typically sprayed with potent fertilisers and herbicides. As such they are hardly a haven for biodiversity.But we also pointed out that artificial trees aren’t necessarily an eco-alternative, and are usually plastic tat produced thousands of miles away and shipped around the planet for our seasonal gratification. They will, of course, last longer, but when thrown out are not biodegradable.Our advice was to find a tree that has been farmed sustainably – look at the Soil Association and Forest Stewardship Council sites for guidance. And try to find a tree grown close to home rather than imported from overseas.
