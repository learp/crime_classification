‘I haven’t spoken to my mother-in-law for 18 months – I don’t like to interrupt her.” Ken Dodd’s old joke rings hollow for me; I speak often to mine. It’s a pleasure, though, to quote newly knighted Sir Ken, for once a childhood hero who is in the news for something lovely. Above me now, the Rolf Harris signature screams out from a painting. It was a birthday present to Helen long ago; my love for her winning hands down against the bad taste of it still being up.My easy use of “love for her” carries the conviction of more than 25 years together. Before Helen died, I had thought myself tough. It seems I was more like toughened glass, such was the way that grief shattered me, deeply embedding its blunt pieces to cause future pain when least expected. Yet, for all this, I’m certain there’s a sharper-edged grief whose shattering leaves more painful shards than mine. A grief I can only imagine and, please God, will never know.I suspect there’s a whole planet of pain in the death of a child that is so appalling, so damaging and so alien that unless you’ve been there you can never understand. I think of this while reading tales of in-law angst on bereavement forums – “they hate me”, “behaving badly”, “asking too much”, “interfering” etc. It must indeed be awful to have your spouse/partner die and feel that the in-laws are unsupportive but maybe their behaviour is because they’re in a tunnel even darker than your own, and no less badly signposted. Being older, they don’t even have the distraction of young children to lean on, and less life left to rebuild. The death of your loved-one-in-common kills the natural bonds between you and it will take time to form new ones. In that position I would think twice about burning the bridges one may wish to cross again in future. But what the hell do I know?I’ve been lucky with my in-laws. In their 70s, when Helen first fell ill to fucking cancer, Ray and Barbara made a big decision to move more than 200 miles closer; their daughter’s diagnosis lending a terrible unspoken momentum to the move. They have been retired for many years but with full, active lives, supporting Helen, Millie, Matt and me They live very close, seeing more of Helen in her last 12 months than in the previous 12 years. Helen worried at first: “They’re doing this just for me aren’t they?” To which the answer was: “Bleeding right. Wouldn’t you?” And she had understood and basked in their proximity if not the reason for it.They have been retired for many years but with full, active lives, supporting Helen, Millie, Matt and me during Helen’s illness and after her death. I genuinely love them and remain so grateful that they’re here. Even though I don’t call on them too often, the knowledge that I can is like a backbone to hold me rigid against incoming storms.A while ago, I saw that their proximity means that, whatever their expectation of appropriate widowed son-in-law behaviour, I was bound to confound it in full view and maybe hurt them in a way Helen would hate. So I made a pre-emptive strike, sat them down, sherries in hand as liquid defibrillation if it was all too much, and started to share heartfelt truths:‘In time I will do stuff that may make you raise your eyebrows and wonder just for a second: ‘How could he?’ I’ve no idea what ‘stuff’ means either but it will include behaving in a way that I would never have done had Helen been here. When this happens please remember that I never loved Helen more than the day she died. That love and my grief will always be there, but to stay sane and be the person I promised Helen I could be for Millie and Matt, I need to build a new life around us. Helen encouraged me, but I want you to know too.” I drained my own sherry and waited.Ray and Barbara didn’t react. Shock? Upset? Rage? Hearing aids off?Then, wonderfully, I realise it’s a silence of understanding. They say little but speak volumes: they get it and, once again, I foresaw storms where there are only warm eddies.This matters, meaning the soundtrack to my howling at the moon or toasting the dawn full of life and libido, is more likely to be Ken Dodd’s hit Happiness, not his No 1, Tears.
