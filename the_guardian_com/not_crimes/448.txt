Jason Calacanis is having his makeup done backstage at his annual Launch Festival, a huge gathering of entrepreneurs in San Francisco and, claims his website, “the largest startup event in the world”.Calacanis, a battle-scarred veteran of the tech world, is Silicon Valley’s belligerent comedian. Now a wealthy man thanks to his early investment in the ride-hailing firm Uber, he is quick to remind people that his investments are mostly dumb luck. That kind of bawdy, bellicose, self-deprecating persona puts him in stark contrast with most Silicon Valley investors like Paul Graham or Marc Andreessen – two very serious men who recently argued in favor of inequality and British colonialism of India, respectively.Legendary Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has taken a shine to Calacanis, and recently signed him up for a reality show that’s rumored to be headed to NBC. Presumably, those who haven’t heard his name will start hearing it.“I’m not the Snooki,” Calacanis says of his place in the reality TV firmament. Snooki, fans of now defunct MTV reality show Jersey Shore will know, was the character who marched around tossing out sassy barbs, and quickly gained a cult following.“Harvey Weinstein came to me two years ago and he said, it’ll be six judges and six startups, and I said, Harvey, that’s a terrible idea,” said Calacanis with a Brooklyn accent. (He’s from Bay Ridge before it was fancy, he insists.) “The more successful you are, the less you want to be on TV. Can you imagine Mary Meeker on a reality show?”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Harvey Weinstein arrives at the 2016 Oscars. Photograph: Al Powers/Invision/APHe took a second to imagine Meeker, a successful and extremely serious venture capitalist who presents an agenda-setting annual report about internet trends. No, he could not imagine it. “I said I have a better idea,” he said. “Fire all of them and just hire me.”His reality show will involve 12 startups who compete for funding. Calacanis eliminates one each week until the end, when one winning startup will get a first round of funding. “A million dollars, maybe two or three. It’ll be the biggest prize in the history of television,” Calacanis said, sounding more Donald Trump than Snooki.Tech reality shows have always failed. Bravo’s startup reality show Startups: Silicon Valley with Randi Zuckerberg, sister-of-Mark, was a disaster (“particularly appalling”, Calacanis said). Angel investor Dave McClure’s show “Bazillion Dollar Club” on SyFy about his incubator 500 Startups was canceled after a few episodes. Billionaire Tim Draper tried to stoke viewer numbers for his reality show Startup U by promising to give away $1m if he got to a million viewers (it didn’t happen).Why does Calacanis think this one will work? “None of them had me,” he said. “You can quote me on that. ‘Jason Calacanis, in typical humble fashion, said …’” He says the show will increase deals and help him reach his goal of being 'the greatest angel investor in history'Jason Calacanis As a young blogger, Calacanis rose to fame founding one of the first major blogging networks, Weblogs Inc, before selling it to AOL and becoming a central figure in New York’s “Silicon Alley” effort. He’s not known for diplomacy; he recently tweeted jokes about social justice warriors – a term for activists who feel tech doesn’t do enough to include women – and says things like: “No one liked me till I got rich.” That may or may not be true, but he is beloved by young founders who tune in religiously to his weekly This Week in Startups podcast.His brothers Jamie and Josh Calacanis, two sturdy, gruff guys with earpieces in, work security at his launch festival every year. Approached for comment one brother frowned, shrugged, and kept walking.Calacanis says the reality show will increase his deal flow and help him reach his ultimate goal. “I want to be the greatest angel investor in history,” he said. “Right now Ron Conway and [Chris] Sacca are ahead of me. It’s great to be in the top 10 NBA players, but I want to be Steph Curry.”He seems to think it won’t be too hard. “Either I find four unicorns or one more decacorn,” he said, referring to billion-dollar ‘unicorn’ companies and ten-billion-dollar ‘decacorn’ companies. Uber is currently valued at $62.5bn.Calacanis won’t say how rich he is (though he has made seven-, eight- and nine-figure investments) and won’t say how much the TV show will pay either. “If it goes to air, I’ll be better paid than Heidi Klum, but it’s insignificant compared to Uber or Thumbtack,” he said. “Nothing I ever do in my life will compare to those.”So what comes next? “Well if America loves me, which I think they will, then who knows,” he said. “Maybe when Charlie Rose retires I take his seat. Maybe Howard Stern.”His makeup was finished. He looked about the same. “Journalism is fun, but you’ll be a VC one day too,” he said, nodding toward a reporter’s notebook. “Once you realize how dumb and easy it all is.”
