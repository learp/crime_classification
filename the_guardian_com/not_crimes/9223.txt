Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker/Rosas: Golden Hours (As You Like It), LondonIn the past, De Keersmaeker has taken music as her main source of inspiration, but in Golden Hours she turns to Shakespeare. Rather than telling the story, De Keersmaeker and her 11 dancers create a choreographic parallel to As You Like It, finding dance equivalents for its rhythms, imagery and themes of seduction, repulsion, misunderstanding and harmony. Set to Brian Eno’s 1975 Another Green World, her movement attempts to capture the sensuality, elegance and experimental mischief of the play.Sadler’s Wells, EC1, Tue & WedProtein Dance: May Contain Food, On tourLuca Silvestrini’s latest work explores the first world’s obsession with food and, in the process, takes the concept of immersive dance-theatre to promising extremes. May Contain Food is set in a dining environment where the audience are invited to sit at a table and enjoy a tasting menu specially created for the show. Meanwhile, eight singers and dancers combine to perform Silvestrini’s choreography and Orlando Gough’s a cappella score, both of which are likely to embrace fad diets, eating disorders and gourmandising greed.Warwick Arts Centre, Wed & Thu; touring to 9 Jun
