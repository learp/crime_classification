Multi-award-winning Israeli actor-director Ronit Elkabetz has died aged 51 from cancer, it has been announced. The daughter of Moroccan immigrants, Elkabetz’s most successful film was also her most recent: Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem, in which she starred as an orthodox Jewish woman attempting to obtain a religious divorce; she also co-directed and wrote it with her brother Shlomi. The film won numerous awards, and was nominated for the best foreign language film Golden Globe in 2015. News of Elkabetz’s death was greeted with dismay across the Israeli film industry, with fellow director Amos Gitai saying: “It’s no wonder she captivated the world’s attention, she was loved by everyone ... she was simply spectacular.” Former president Shimon Peres said in a statement that Elkabetz was “an extraordinary cultural ambassador for the state of Israel” and that “on the various stages of the world, Ronit represented the citizens of Israel and the state of Israel with great pride, creativity and beauty”.Elkabetz’s breakthrough role, internationally, was The Band’s Visit, the 2007 culture-clash comedy about an Egyptian police band who are stuck in a restaurant overnight while attempting to reach an Arab cultural centre in Israel. Directed by Eran Kolirin, Elkabetz played the restaurant owner, and the film screened at the Cannes film festival before a successful release in Europe and the US.
