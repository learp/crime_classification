The author of this book may be by one of your most loved YouTubers, Zoe Sugg. However she isn’t mine. I don’t adore Zoe because of her YouTube videos but because of her amazing techniques to write bestselling books, the Girl Online series.If you are put off by girly, pink book covers then don’t be surprised when you read this book and suddenly are confronted with heartbreak, humour, love, dreams, surprises and shocks. Penny Porter is a 16-year-old, dramatic, friendly, humorous and talented teenager who is also a Girl Online, who has a blog of her own. The second book really touched my heart and to me, is better than the first. Penny is shown as quite an understanding girlfriend to rock star boyfriend Noah Flynn. But with his tight schedules, let downs, unwelcoming friends and heartbreaks, Penny suddenly starts to feel like an outsider.This story has many twists and turns and it really filled my heart with amazement! I loved the fact that this story shows a moral that we all have heard before: don’t give up. I recommend this book to girls and BOYS, any age. The book is aimed at an audience of 11 and over.
