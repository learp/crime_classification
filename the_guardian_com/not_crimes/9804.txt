Let’s Sing and Dance for Comic Relief 6.45pm, BBC1Continuing our nation’s tradition of resurrecting old telly here’s a Stars in Their Eyes-ish contest that last aired in 2013. The premise is simple: familiar-ish faces perform chart hits, largely miming but putting much effort into garb and dance moves. It’s all in the name of charidee, at least. Keepers of 90% of the BBC’s primetime output Mel and Sue host, while Russell Grant and Sara Pascoe are among those competing. Hannah J DaviesAnt & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway 7pm, ITVThe live extravaganza isn’t likely to be knocked off balance by last week’s mildly disastrous series opener: a competition contestant swearing and a stunt where Stephen Mulhern visibly wasn’t shot out of a cannon only underlined that the show is much more fun than the singing contests that have clogged Saturday nights this year so far. Tonight’s guests include Robbie Williams and, in character as Mrs Brown, Brendan O’Carroll. Jack SealeFollow the Money 9pm, BBC4Set 18 months after the first series, the Danish financial crime drama returns. We rejoin corporate lawyer Claudia as she’s released from jail; career in tatters, she’s working in a coffee shop. Elsewhere, investigators Mads and Alf retain an interest in the Energreen scandal, while mechanic Nicky is running errands for the Swede, a development that surely can’t end well. Tonight’s tightly plotted double bill sets up an overarching plot involving a bank takeover. Jonathan WrightMartin Scorsese: True Confessions 10pm, BBC2Armed with a canon varied enough to encompass Goodfellas, Hugo and the video for Michael Jackson’s Bad, it almost feels unfair expecting anyone to cover the entire career of Martin Scorsese in just one interview. Film critic Nick James quizzes the celebrated director on the themes and fascinations shared by his landmark films, stylistic crampons such as masculinity, religion and crime, along with the changing face of life in New York. Mark Gibbings-JonesThis Country 11.45pm, BBC1Launched on BBC3, this mockumentary about disaffected, unemployed twentysomethings in a Cotswolds village thoroughly deserves its mainstream airing. Creators Charlie and Daisy May Cooper star as cousins Kurtan and Kerry, who this week embark on a pyramid scheme selling “Eternal Vitality” products door to door, which goes as abysmally as might be expected. Matters aren’t helped when Kurtan befriends two lads he meets at a yard sale. David StubbsThe Trip to Italy 9pm, GoldGold’s Weekend Box Set classic comedy strand continues with another chance to gorge heartily on Michael Winterbottom’s exquisite meta-sitcom of middle-aged male manners. In this second series, Messrs Coogan and Brydon are undertaking a gustatory tour of Italy. Steve is on the wagon while Rob is off the family leash. Cue gentle oneupmanship, mild lechery and the kind of intuitive, improvised repartee that threatens to give banter a good name. Phil HarrisonBST Hyde Park Concerts 2016 2pm, Sky ArtsIt was one of the high points of a year that desperately needed a few of them: the July concerts in Hyde Park of 2016 witnessed the likes of Stevie Wonder and Carole King performing entire albums (albeit not necessarily in song order) – 1976’s Songs In The Key Of Life and the ever-majestic Tapestry. Mumford & Sons and Florence And The Machine played too but you can’t have everything. Here are the highlights. Ali CatterallFilm choice      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A terrific caper … Monsters Vs Aliens.Monsters Vs Aliens, (Rob Letterman, Conrad Vernon, 2009), 2.45pm, BBC1This terrific DreamWorks animated caper pits a bunch of heroic monsters – led by the Reese Witherspoon-voiced 50ft woman, Susan (AKA Ginormica) – against an alien invasion fleet. A feisty blend of eye-boggling action scenes and witty references to Dr Strangelove and any number of sci-fi classics, including ET and Men in Black. Paul HowlettMean Streets, (Martin Scorsese, 1973), 10.30pm, BBC2Scorsese returns to the New York streets of his youth, all small-time crookery and prowling mafiosi, in a sharply naturalistic view of Little Italy. There’s muscular acting from Robert De Niro as porkpie-hatted punk Johnny Boy and Harvey Keitel as his more measured, more dangerous friend, Charlie. It crackles with energy and a great rock soundtrack: a Scorsese masterpiece. PHPapadopoulos & Sons, (Marcus Markou, 2013), 12.10am, BBC1A nice north London-set comedy in which Anglo-Greek multi-millionaire Harry (Stephen Dillane), ruined by the recession, tries to rebuild his fortunes by restarting the family’s chippy business. Georges Corraface is an ebullient force of nature providing comic energy and sibling rivalry as his older brother Spiros, in a warm feelgood movie that sizzles away gently.
