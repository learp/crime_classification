Ruthlessly my granddaughter has parked Charlie, her sole surviving gerbil, in my kitchen for a week while she is in France with her parents. Except for Charlie, who goes nowhere except in his rattling wheel, the whole bunch of them, as I write this, are chugging along somewhere in their Range Rover.As the sole climate sceptic in my entire family structure I have been known to harbour satirical thoughts about global warmists who ride in large FWD vehicles, but as a doting grandfather I make an exception in this case because my granddaughter, though unusually fleet of foot, has a top speed of far less than 154mph. She would thus be ill-equipped to step out of the way if she were walking at the edge of an open road and encountered the young man who was recently clocked at that speed in Suffolk. And if, by good luck, she was in a car when he hit her, I would prefer it to be as big and strong as a Range Rover at least. A Chieftain tank would be even better.After the young man’s appearance in court, even the spokesman for a road safety charity seemed to have as much trouble as the judge at getting the point. “Drivers at a reckless speed not only put their own lives, but those of other road users, at severe risk.” I myself would rephrase that. “A driver at a reckless speed puts the lives of other road users at severe risk while encouraging the rest of us to wish him dead as soon as possible.”Anyway, the young man now faces the remainder of a full 56 days’ suspension before he is free again to get out there and do his racing driver impersonation. I would like to say I wish him no harm while he frets at home, but in fact I wish that he would step out of the shower, tread on a slick cake of soap, dive naked out of the bathroom window and fall at least three storeys into the street, there to be driven over by a municipal steamroller.Clive James: ‘It's Boris Johnson's personality that makes him look as if he's been rolled on by a horse’ Scratch that thought: he could just as easily dive through the roof of a Range Rover containing my granddaughter as she returned from France, and such an impact might put a crimp in any plans she has to dance.She might have no such plans, of course. To me, when she dances around my kitchen, she looks like Alessandra Ferri as Juliet, but her own deepest and most secret wish might be to drive fast cars. It makes me almost glad that by the time she chooses her career I will be gone. Meanwhile Charlie is making another bid for my attention. Speed mad, the gerbils of today.
