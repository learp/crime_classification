This is one great example of truly honest, beautiful writing. My stomach goes all wobbly just thinking about it. I am not kidding. I can’t even tell you exactly how much I want to just live inside those pages. Seriously.So basically, Alba, a girl who has just left high school, is just figuring it out. She used to know exactly what she wanted to be (a comic artist; there are so many superhero references, I can’t even...) but now she isn’t so sure. When a random internet nobody strikes up a storm, saying that Eden Valley (her home – a little, desolate town in Australia) is going to be the only surviving place after the apocalypse, which is apparently just around the corner, people flock for the biggest party ever. And it is chaos.I think that this book is really, really well thought-out and planned; the characters have more layers than Shrek. God, would I kill to meet Alba. She is just so awesome. It was a completely original plot, one that I couldn’t have thought up in a million years. You’ll see when you read it. Because you will.I give this book 5 stars out of 5 stars and a pat on the back. Melissa Keil is just such an insanely talented writer. I loved it – it really was beautiful. Maybe for ages 13 and up, but I don’t really care, anyone should be able to experience the gorgeous arrangement of words that is The Incredible Adventures of Cinnamon Girl.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
