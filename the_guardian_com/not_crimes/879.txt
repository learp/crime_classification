Customers of three of Australia’s four big banks will not have access to Apple’s electronic payment system, after the competition watchdog refused their application to bargain collectively.Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank applied in July to negotiate as a collective over the use of Apple Pay, which allows touch-and-go payments on iPhones.The banks had argued that Apple Pay prevented them from developing their own integrated digital wallets for iPhones, which they said would increase competition and consumer choice in Australia.Apple Pay to launch in China despite stiff competition in mobile payment Restrictions on passing fees associated with Apple Pay onto customers were also a sticking point.But the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has rejected the application, meaning each bank will have to reach an individual agreement with Apple before its customers can use Apple Pay.The ACCC said it accepted that allowing the banks to negotiate collectively and potentially boycott Apple Pay would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, but that the benefits for customers were “currently uncertain and may be limited”.Rod Sims, the ACCC chairman, said digital wallets and mobile payments were in their infancy and subject to rapid change.“It is therefore uncertain how competition may develop with the availability of mobile payments and possible future innovations.“Apple Wallet and other non-bank digital wallets could represent a disruptive technology that may increase competition between the banks by making it easier for consumers to switch between card providers and limiting any ‘lock in’ effect bank digital wallets may cause.”In an emailed statement provided by Apple to the ABC, it said the ACCC’s decision was “great for Australians”.The ACCC’s ruling is a draft decision with a final outcome expected in March 2017.The banks seemed to take heart from Sims’ description of the ruling as “finely balanced”, vowing to continue to work with the ACCC in a statement published on the Bendigo and Adelaide Bank’s website.Lance Blockley, the spokesperson for the applicants, said a ruling against them would mean “effectively … no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone”.“The application has never been about preventing Apple Pay from coming to Australia or reducing competition between wallets. It has always been about providing consumer choice and innovation.”ANZ, American Express and Cuscal, which represents 13 issuers, have reached agreements with Apple over Apple Pay in Australia.
