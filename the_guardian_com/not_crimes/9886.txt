Red alert – the robots are coming closer, and they’re coming for us, the old people. I used to think the worst that could happen to me would be life in a care home, but this is an even scarier option – life alone with laminate floors and a bossy robot (robots need smooth surfaces). I thought we were safe from robot “carers” – that they only had them in Japan or Singapore, but now they’re planning to have them in Kensington and Hertfordshire.MiRo, by Sebastian Conran Associates, is a “biomimetic companion robot” dog that will transmit news of any problems to a hub, remind us to take our medicine, and of our visitors’ names. What visitors? If you had any, you wouldn’t need a robot.Try thinking yourselves into our possible future lives, robot-inventors. Do you not see the horror? No human voice or touch, a blank, white RoBear (from Japan), lifting you from bed to wheelchair, a legless, furless dog robot monitoring your every move. Can the RoBear wipe your bum? Can the MiRo dog lick your hand?      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Biomimetic companion dog, MiRo.No. They are machines. And it is frightening to be handled by a machine. My very elderly mother had to be pulled out of bed, dangled in the air and lowered on to the commode by a hoist, like a sack of potatoes. She screamed with fright, even with me, her human daughter, working the ghastly thing and reassuring her. Imagine no human presence, for days or weeks. Just robots, omnidirectional cameras and sensors, linked to hubs, linked to a live person somewhere.And who is going to pay for all this equipment, and these adapted or purpose-built homes? Our generous social services? Or are they only for the wealthy? Couldn’t they afford to hire a live person instead? What about trying that excellent idea from the Netherlands instead, where students live rent-free, and care for their elderly neighbours a few hours a week?“Any elderly human with half a brain left will realise that robots don’t give a shit about them,” says Fielding. Crudely put, but true. With robots in charge, the elderly will realise that humans don’t give a toss either.
