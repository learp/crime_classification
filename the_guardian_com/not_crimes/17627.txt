What I recall is this; it was autumn,And there had been an eclipse during whichI stood with my dad in the gardenAnd we watched as the street grew darkerThan it should have, than it ever did.Now it was at least one day laterAnd my dad walked in with a mushroomThat had illustrated the lawn’s green canvasSince the eclipse turned the sky’s toneA dirty colour. He passed the mushroom over.It felt like the skin of someone who livedIn a place where no light gleamed. WhateverI write now, all these long years after Can never describe the mushroom’s scentAs I held it to my nose: earth and water,And freshness, beauty. I held it to my lipsAnd bit it, much to my dad’s horror.It tasted like the stillness of a fading eclipse.• From To Fold the Evening Star, New and Selected Poems by Ian McMillan (Carcanet, £9.99).
