Tall towers started out as celebrated feats of engineering, but by the second half of the 20th century, they were often associated with high-rise council housing estates that were blamed for antisocial behaviour and social isolation – or bland office blocks of business. Tellingly, in 1975, J G Ballard saw high-rise housing as the perfect setting for his dystopian novel. Now, it seems, a tall building or skyscraper will inevitably be a block of luxury apartments no one can afford or a shiny new project from a “starchitect” that houses offices, hotels, restaurants and homes for those with money on their side.But the full picture is far more complex, and we want to hear from you. If you live or work in a tall building anywhere in the world, or even helped build one, share your experiences and stories with us. What do you like or dislike about high-rise living? What are the strangest or best things about tall tower life?Simon Usborne spoke to residents of tall buildings around the world and heard stories of everything from sunburn to vertigo.
