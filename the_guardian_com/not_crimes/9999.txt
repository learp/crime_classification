For many, Christmas means movies. For the analog generation, who grew up before the home-entertainment revolution, iTunes, DVDs or even VHS rental, Christmas was that super-special time when you could see top films on television and drawing a red circle around the 5pm James Bond slot in your festive double-issue of the Radio Times. The standing joke used to be that the top Christmas film on other less important days was The Great Escape, because that always seemed to be on TV about that time; a Hollywoodised but not-especially-Christmassy story of a mass PoW breakout during the second world war.Films actually about Christmas are prized for comfort-food verities: picturesque fantasy, sentimentality, optimism, images imported from northern Europe via the Coca-Cola Santa ads of the 20th century. They also have a fierce streak of sadness, as if to contrast our childhood memories of wonder with the disillusionment of adulthood. There is a sharp pang of loneliness and desperation amid the tinsel – otherwise how could we appreciate the dramatised comforts of family? Just as the freezing snow of bleak midwinter is best enjoyed from behind a window, with a lovely open fire, so the sadness of a Christmas movie tends to come with a crackle of sentimental human warmth. All these things have hyperevolved into the annual John Lewis TV ad, but a Christmas film comes with more humour.

It is no accident that the most famous Christmas film is Frank Capra’s 1946 picture It’s a Wonderful Life, which has an overtly Dickensian fantasy theme: James Stewart’s suicidal family man is assigned a guardian angel who shows him how everything would be different if he did not exist.The two other great Christmas films are Billy Wilder’s The Apartment (1960) and John Landis’s Trading Places (1983). In The Apartment, poor, pathetic office worker Bud (Jack Lemmon) is bullied into letting his boss use his apartment for extramarital liaisons. He falls in love with elevator operator Fran (Shirley MacLaine), whose heart is being broken in this very apartment by the same sleazy boss. Bud and Fran reach their crises of loneliness and humiliation at the Christmas party, but it is here, with the catastrophe that Christmas precipitated, that their lives are turned around.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Trading PlacesLandis’s Trading Places is Dickensian in spirit and Shavian in form. Two malign old billionaires, played by Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy, have a bet that money is everything: a rich man deprived of money will degenerate into a feral bum; a poor man elevated to the plutocracy will become a respectable defender of ruling-class privilege. They conspire to swap the roles of Dan Aykroyd’s yuppie Louis and Eddie Murphy’s street hustler Billy Ray. Poor Louis’s nadir comes at Christmas time, but everyone realises that Christmas is precisely the time to realise their common humanity and take action against these horrible old bores.Christmas movies, then, are partly about comedy, but with a strong taste of sadness and emotional catharsis. Laughter has to dry the tears. There are obviously great Christmas comedies – and by this I mean Jon Favreau’s Elf and Terry Zwigoff’s Bad Santa – both of which came out in 2003. In Elf, Will Ferrell plays a bizarrely big man in an elf costume accidentally carried back to the north pole, where he has grown up in the elves’ ranks since infancy. In Bad Santa, Billy Bob Thornton gives the performance of his career as a drunk, depressive department store Santa obsessed with anal sex who conspires to rob the outlets where he is employed. However entertaining these two are, there is an argument that they are not truly Christmas films – they don’t have the glassy-eyed note of serious sentimental exaltation.Richard Curtis’s heartwarmingly soppy Love Actually is a very Christmassy film that came out the same year as Elf and Bad Santa. An ensemble piece about different people preparing for Christmas, I didn’t care for this much when I saw it first, but its sheer corniness has grown on me. Love Actually is like the awful Christmas jumper that Mark Darcy is forced to wear in Bridget Jones; self-conscious silliness is a distinct part of the Christmas film.In real life, it is Christmas morning and Christmas Day that provide the anticlimactic ending to our experience of the festive season; the placid conclusion to all the organisational build-up and retail foreplay. In the Christmas film, it is gentle snowy daylight, rather than the night-time mystery of Christmas Eve that denotes the happy ever after. Having said that, my favourite Christmas movie ending runs absolutely counter to this: the cult noir 40s classic Christmas Holiday, directed by Robert Siodmak, written by Herman Mankiewicz stars Gene Kelly as Robert Manette, who is – of all things – a vicious killer. The climax comes on Christmas night when Robert’s wife realises she has been freed from the abusive emotional hold he had on her. The clouds miraculously part to reveal a lovely starry sky. Is it a reference to the Christmas star? Who knows? But it is a great Christmas film ending.
