In other words, do you think the ideology of either Conservative or Social Democracy is placed to allow technology to be used in its most efficient way for the benefit of all? Indeed, do you think Capitalism (free market, or what we have now) has a future to play in an increasingly automated society, or is it no longer (and perhaps never was) the most efficient way to provide for humanity?  Guardian contributor JohnPilger 24 February 2016 11:21amTechnology is a means, not an end, no matter how brilliant it appears. How we use digital technology, exploit it and benefit from it depends on old-fashioned political concepts of how we treat each other: how we approach class, race, gender and war and peace. Nothing has changed in that regard. At present, we are ruled by an extreme version of capitalism called 'neoliberalism'. Technology in the service of any extremism has a catastrophic history.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.19am GMT11:19'Trump's views on immigration are not more gross than David Cameron's'frenchview asks:What is your take on the reasons Trump is winning the Republican nomination race? What is going on over there in the US?  Guardian contributor JohnPilger 24 February 2016 11:18amTrump is speaking straight to ordinary Americans, not through the usual media/liberal filter. He is making sense to a lot of people. They like his absence of hypocrisy and the fact that he's prepared to say George W. Bush committed a war crime in invading Iraq. Apart from his gross views on immigration - though no more gross in essence than, say, David Cameron's - he is not planning to invade anywhere, he doesn't hate the Russians or the Chinese, he is not beholden to Israel. People like this lack of cant, and when the so-called liberal media deride him, they like him even more.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.16am GMT11:16ramous asks:Is NATO trying to start a war with the Russians?

Every remaining option appears to have negative consequences, but given that we can’t turn the clock back, what should we do now?  Guardian contributor JohnPilger 24 February 2016 11:15amFirst, I would demand that my government - let's say the British government - stop fuelling the violence and wars in the Middle East, notably Syria. That is to say, they should withdraw - get out. That would help immeasurably.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.14am GMT11:14Themediaspoonfedlad asks:Have you any opinion on media ownership. It seems neither elected govt nor corporate/shareholder are models which ensure effective media. In the last general election there wasn’t a single column inch devoted to the Snowden/NSA/GCHQ debate nor were any of the political parties drawn into giving the electorate a clear manifesto pledge on what they intend to do about it. I view this an example of a failing media system.  Guardian contributor JohnPilger 24 February 2016 11:13amThe media system is not 'failing'. In its present form - dominated by corporations and oligarchs like Murdoch - it is succeeding in what it was set up to do: reflect the interests of its owners. This, of course, has nothing to do with a free press.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.11am GMT11:1120reeds asks:Do you see an endgame in the neoconservative/corporate experiment - is it going to end badly in dysfunction or might the world turn away for an alternative?

He was focusing on their news output. As such the Corporation must be under immense pressure. Do you think the BBC should be diminished in its scope or should be funded to appropriate levels in order to remain impartial to those commercial interests who seek it to be less influential?  Guardian contributor JohnPilger 24 February 2016 11:09amThe BBC has never been impartial - not since its founder, Lord Reith, broadcast propaganda for the Baldwin government against the millions taking part in the general strike in the 1920s. Why Osborne should complain about BBC News is beyond me; apart from a few irritations, I would have thought he'd be delighted.Updatedat 11.11am GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.09am GMT11:09Ali Slimas asks:Going back to a question on Mainstream Media, what are the best/ most reliable news outlets that you would recommend?

I mean, how do you manage that? PS - I felt such cynicism came through in your latest film Utopia, & I understood it. How do you not give up??  Guardian contributor JohnPilger 24 February 2016 11:05amUtopia was, above all, a celebration of Australian Indigenous resistance and resilience. The cynicism you refer to belongs to those in Canberra whose primitive policies and indifference mean that Australia now has the distinction of having been called out for its racism by the UN more than any other country.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.03am GMT11:03'Compared with Obama, Cameron and the rest, Putin is the most intelligent by far'armsordyl asks:What are your views about the Russian leader Putin?

Guardian contributor JohnPilger 24 February 2016 10:59amThe great number of victims of terrorism - mostly western-initiated terrorism - are Muslims. In Iraq. Libya. Yemen.

Guardian contributor JohnPilger 24 February 2016 10:56amRe your question on Assange. No, you can't 'make' any government do anything, but you can take direct action that makes them listen, at least, and perhaps act. Without direct (militant) action, there would be none of the freedoms you have today, if tenuously.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
