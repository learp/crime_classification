I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book by Veronica Roth. I loved the main plot of the book having the fractured society, splitting people by their traits; I felt it was was very relatable, recognising the split in the society of today by groups of friends containing people of similar personalities. The escalating violence that emerges throughout the book left me as a reader on the edge of my seat, waiting to find out what was going to happen next. Not only that but the element of romance that seemed to seep its way into the book created a softer tone, meaning the read was not harsh full of action, and it was enjoyable.The deep messages that are conveyed from the book were one of the main things that made me want to continue reading the series. The messages conveyed about the main character having to find her identity and fight her way through a corrupt society made me not able to put the book down for the entire time I was reading it.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a new read, especially if they are fans of the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins. Both books have a similar flow and each focuses on a strong female protagonist, shown as a figure image for any reader, giving them positive messages to just be themselves and stay strong through tough times.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
