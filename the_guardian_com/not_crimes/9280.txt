The title Confess says it all. Compact with secrets and lies, Colleen Hoover is both discrete and reveals the truth. Owen is an artist who gains inspiration from anonymous confessions (which happen to be real life confessions).I think this concept is amazing. There are some secrets that people just want to let go of, but let’s face it, guilt that runs deep cannot disappear. The idea of them existing through paintings and how something negative can be turned into something positive is inspirational in itself. It’s brilliant if you think about it. Moving on, Auburn has some secrets of her own which clash with Owen’s, preventing them from having their happy ever after. Auburn is still clinging on to a part of Adam that remains alive after his death 5 years ago. But with Owen’s situation, he cannot give Auburn what she desperately needs and deserves.As Auburn realises this, she becomes determined to seek what she needs and that apparently does not involve Owen. But what she doesn’t know is that Owen and Auburns past is already intwined. Either way, neither of them can shake each other.Confess is romantically sweet and clingy. Colleen Hoover’s books are typically directed towards the older teens, probably going more into the twenties. But I think Confess is suitable to some mature teens. I was pretty much left in suspense waiting to find out how Owen knew Auburn. How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? By the end my stomach was clenched as I hoped fate really existed despite how cheesy fiction makes it out to be. Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
