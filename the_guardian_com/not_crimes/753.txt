Jilly Cooper has promised there will be “lots of human nookie” in her new novel Mount!, which is due out this autumn.Cooper’s publisher Transworld said that Mount! would be set “in the glamorous and fiercely competitive world of flat racing”, and that Cooper’s dashingly handsome former playboy Rupert Campbell-Black would once again be “centre-stage”. Campbell-Black was the star of Cooper’s first “bonkbuster”, Riders, and found love in her second, Rivals, with the raven-haired Taggie. Although he has played a large part in her other novels, and has gone on to have a family with Taggie, he has not been the centre of a novel since.“Rupert’s ambition is to be Champion Trainer of the year and for his favourite stallion, Love Rat, to be named Leading Sire,” said Transworld, which ran into controversy last year over its decision to make the iconic cover of Cooper’s Riders slightly less raunchy. “But sabotage, skulduggery and bad behaviour – of every conceivable variety – mean that Rupert’s ambitious plans are thwarted at every turn before the novel reaches its glorious conclusion.”Cooper explained that the “Leading Sire of the year is the horse whose progeny or offspring have won the most races OR more importantly, clocked up the most prize money”.“Rupert is raging round the world taking Love Rat’s progeny to compete in the richest races and it’s beginning to endanger his marriage,” said Cooper. “Lots of human nookie goes on in the book but I was almost more fascinated by the equine nookie. One stallion only fancies greys so a white sheet has to be put over any coloured mares.”
