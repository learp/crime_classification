We may know the trees but rarely wood.Elm was the workhorse, daily tree,pale handle, for your fork and spade,a chair as low as a bent kneecut down for each uneven floor.Women leaned into its curved backas the milk pulsed, as birds once pressedits crowded leaf, before storm’s black.The elms died fast, of one disease.Is that a sapling, in the hedge?No, hazel with its rose-flushed budsthen young lime with its heart-shaped edge.Its step-grandchild must be the ash,sprung on street corners, on stone hills,until the lightning cracks the wind,the crest is split, the fine twig spills.But now ash has its own disease,what can I still recall of elm?Its seeds were white, softer than coins,whose lack, or glut, would overwhelm.On other paths, by other trees,I stand, still in that storm of snow.From park, low hedge, your elms still rise.Look at them well, before they go.• From Skies by Alison Brackenbury (Carcanet, £9.99).
