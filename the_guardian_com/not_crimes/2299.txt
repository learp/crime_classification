For as long as I can remember, going for dim sum at the weekend has felt as comfortingly routine as popping to the pub for a pint. Like Chinese tapas, dim sum are small plates of morsels served in multiples that are ideal for sharing. Thanks to the tentacular spread of the Chinese diaspora, I have sampled dim sum far and wide, from the little family-run joints in New Zealand where I grew up, to the birthplace of the culinary tradition itself in southern China. There, dim sum is almost a religion, where the best restaurants are advertised by long morning queues. I have also tasted authentic dim sum in the seemingly far-flung corners of Belize, Rome and Lisbon, and delighted in the abundance of choices in Chinatowns around the world. No matter where I am, the scene is always reassuringly familiar, with the welcoming glow of red and gold decor, the hurried nature of staff, and the glorious racket created when busy chopsticks mingle with lively discussion.But of course, it’s the food that really thrills. In London, I can eat a steamerful of delicate soupy xiaolongbao at Beijing Dumpling in Chinatown, and the scallop-topped siu mai at The Duck and Rice is a particularly luxurious mouthful. Meanwhile, the shimmering crystal-prawn-and-chive dumplings at Royal China on Baker Street are almost too pretty to eat, and the lightly battered squid at Chung Ying, Birmingham’s oldest Chinese restaurant, is an exemplary take on the Cantonese answer to calamari.In 2013, I started blogging about Chinese food with my sister Amy. We called ourselves the Dumpling Sisters, and it was when we started developing recipes for our cookbook that I came to truly appreciate dim sum as little handmade bites of edible art. If you’re already a devotee, you are likely to have burned your tongue on many a pork bun and dumpling. But you may also wonder what other treasures hide within the tall stacks of bamboo steamers. While you can’t go wrong with the big hitters, the greatest joy of dim sum comes from exploring an extensive range of dishes. Make it your (Chinese) New Year resolution to expand your dim sum horizons, starting with these five lesser-known varieties.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A taro puff ball.

These rugby-ball-shaped dumplings boast a trio of textures: a saucy pork filling is cradled by creamy taro mash, which is surrounded by an airy, crispy, flash-fried nest. A mere speck of the old-school raising agent ammonium bicarbonate is added to the taro mash, causing the outermost layer to explode into a latticed crown in the hot oil.

The silky sheets are rolled up and bathed in a sweet soy sauce. King prawn rolls are my favourite as the crisp pink prawns contrast boldly against the slippery and soft blanket folds of the noodle.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Turnip cake.

Contrary to the name, it is actually made from daikon radish combined with rice flour, water and petite fragments of Chinese sausage, shiitake mushrooms and umami-rich dried shrimps. The mixture is steamed until just firm enough to push back when jabbed with a chopstick, then sliced and pan-fried. The result is peppery and tender on the inside, with a crispy caramelised jacket on the outside.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Congee with abalone and chicken.

With its subtle, nutty aroma, plain congee is the ideal vehicle for a raft of flavoursome additions, including spicy pickled mustard stem and crunchy fried peanuts.

Think of it as the custardy cousin of salted caramel, created when sweet, creamy custard is enriched by the briny kick of salt-preserved egg yolks. And it’s not just the flavour that arrests the taste buds. Liu sha translates as “flowing sands” – an exquisitely evocative description for a canary yellow custard that is molten like lava, with a fine graininess that melts on the tongue like Scottish tablet. Outside Asia, this bun is like the unicorn of the dim sum universe – hard to find, but rather dazzling if you manage to come across one.Julie and Amy Zhang run the Dumpling Sisters blog
