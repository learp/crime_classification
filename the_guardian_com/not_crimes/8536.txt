On one of the streams which I occasionally visit there is an otter â€“ I am told a family of otters, - but I dare not reveal the locality. I do not wish it to be shot or trapped by those interested in the preservation of fish, but I would much rather that it should be slain this way than that it should be marked down as quarry for a hunt. Mr. Joseph Collinson has again sent me some pamphlets against the "noble sport of otter hunting," one being a reprint of an excellent review by the late Andrew Lang. Hysterical attacks on sport in general are foolish and defeat their own purpose, but I entirely support every effort of Mr. Collinson and his friends to put an end to the cruel methods of slaughtering the otter. One of my friends, a good shot, an enthusiastic angler, and a keen sportsman, told me only a few days ago that he would never go to another otter hunt; he said that it was not sport but cruelty. I have heard other real sportsmen express similar opinions. They realise that the best way to preserve sport is to keep it clean; to get rid of all cruel or savage methods; to give the quarry a "sporting" chance, and where killing is necessary to let death come suddenly and painlessly. Wearying an animal out by hunting it for seven hours, as in one of the instances quoted from a sporting paper, is not sport.
