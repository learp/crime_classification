The scribbled note on the ice-cream parlour's door thanks holidaymakers for their custom and promises to return after the winter. It is a sign of the abrupt change that has taken place in the town over the past couple of days, not least on the beach, which, stripped of families and picnics, has regained its natural melancholy tone.Even the sea seems to recognise that its role as a playground is at an end, the cool north-easterly wind causing choppier waves to break on the foreshore. No more does it play host to the lazy daytime swimmers of August; now only determined women of considerable age brave the waters before breakfast, collecting their papers on the way home, dressed in thick towelling robes.The deep shingle shelf and sharp gullies that were created by the winter storms have been flattened by a thousand feet, being a blurred picture of what existed before. Soft round depressions, filled with shade in the morning light, are all that remain of excited feet that now dangle under school desks or labour under the morning commute. Those above the waterline could persist for some considerable time, until disturbed by a brave winter walker, wrapped in coat and scarf and munching hastily on a bag of chips.For me this is the beach's golden time, the sun strong enough still to warm the skin, yet with that wind that stops it being comfortable to laze too long. The rhythm of the crashing waves, undisturbed by the cheerful squeals of delight as each one catches up with running children. To sit almost at the water's edge and look along the vast expanse of shingle that stretches out either side and to be hardly able to pick out another soul. Time and custom has ordained that this is no longer the place to be and so once again it is abandoned to the few that call it home.
