My route through the beech woods was chosen to avoid the worst of the cold northerly wind that was cutting across the valley. Though the majority of leaves were still to open, the trees broke up the breeze and let me slacken the pace I’d needed to keep warm.The acoustic of this woodland is softened by its deep, moist leaf litter; outside sounds are dramatically attenuated, letting you focus on the spring birdsong and the occasional creak of high branches stirring in the wind.As I do every year, I was looking for the patches of wild garlic flowers that characterise this season for me. Blooming later here than the primroses and celandines, their flush of white flowers comes just at the point where spring activity goes into overdrive, the unfurling beech leaves splashing colour across the woodland canopy.A woodland walk The first group of wild garlic plants I came across were still developing, with the flowers sheathed and their white petals just starting to emerge, and I began to wonder whether I had made the trip a week too early. I wandered on, deeper into the wood, noting the way that moss and lichen have begun to colonise the stumps of those trees that were thinned out a few years ago.Then, turning aside from the main track, I found what I was looking for. A dense layer of firm, curved leaves and flower stems that reached to my ankles almost covered the narrower path ahead. Moving on further meant brushing against them, releasing the characteristically delicate scent of the spring plant. As the woodland warms and the wild garlic matures, this odour will grow to become fragrant, then strong and eventually overpowering – hanging over the woods like a miasma.

In my own case, the spring scent of Allium ursinum never fails to make me feel hungry – and it tends to cling long after you have left the plants behind. A small price to pay for the sight of the frail-looking globes of white flowers that do so much to brighten the floor of the woodland.Follow Country diary on Twitter: @gdncountrydiary
