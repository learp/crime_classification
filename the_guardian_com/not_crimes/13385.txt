David Cameron battled to justify his claim that money will be no object in the government's flood relief effort as he unveiled a very modest short-term package to help victims of flooding.Critics also warned that millions of houses and small businesses in flood-hit areas are set to be excluded from affordable insurance, potentially lowering property prices for those affected.The prime minister gave a commitment that houses suffering from flooding will be offered up to £5,000 to make their homes more resilient to floods in the future.The £5,000 grant, not designed to replace damaged property, will be available to all income groups and so far will be available to 5,800 homes.He also repeated plans, first announced a year ago, to give £31m to help rebuild damaged railway infrastructure, as well as £10m to help farmers with clean-up and a three-month business rate relief for damaged businesses.But reverting to the chaos that marked Whitehall's performance over the weekend, the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, refused to say whether new funding was being made available and insisted Cameron's comments did not amount to a "blank cheque".The environment department also confirmed: "There will be no government scheme to compensate for uninsured losses due to flooding for farmers or other businesses and individuals."There are growing fears that the government's specially developed insurance scheme for flood-hit areas – Flood Re – will exclude as many as 5m residential properties as well as small businesses.The scheme, due to come into force next year, was negotiated with the insurance industry by the minister for policy, Oliver Letwin, and is designed to subsidise the cost of premiums in high-flood-risk areas.But a cross-party alliance is voicing anger at the number of homes being excluded from the scheme, including any home built after 2009, leasehold properties, all large properties that are council tax band H and small businesses.Peers discussing the details of the scheme, set out in the water bill, have been told by chartered surveyors that the scale of climate change hitting Britain means affected properties could face a writedown as big as 30%.Philip Wilbourn, an expert in valuation and environmental risk, has told peers that if rising ground water and surface water are fully considered, then up to 10.9m homes are at risk of flooding, about 4m more than previous figures published by the Environment Agency.He argued: "If it's uneconomic to buy insurance and, say, 20% of the housing stock don't buy or can't buy, the loss of value could reach £4.3tn."Simon Douglas, director of AA Insurance, also warned that the recent fall in house insurance premiums is likely to be wiped out. He suggested thousands of homes at lower flood risk, falling outside Flood Re provisions, "could still find affordable insurance difficult to find and more costly than those at much greater risk".Cameron admitted that some fundamental assumptions about flood risk will need to be rethought. He said: "As the waters recede it will be important for the Environment Agency, for local authorities all to look again at the flood patterns we have seen, at the models they have and work out what fresh flood defences will be necessary."Labour focused on the absence of substantial new cash and the threat to the jobs of 500 Environment Agency staff, claiming that Cameron's promise on Tuesday that "money is no object in the relief effort" were now unravelling.After the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, demanded clarity on the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, Cameron again insisted: "Money is no object in this relief effort."He added: "I want communities who are suffering and people who see water lapping at their doors to know that when it comes to the military, when it comes to sandbags, when it comes to the emergency services, when it comes to restoring broken flood defences, all of those things, money is no object."Cameron again said he believed the floods and storms were likely to reoccur, but tried to avoid the debate on whether this was caused by man-made climate change.The prime minister also scrapped Thursday's planned cabinet to convene a special new committee to look at the government's long-term plans for flood resilience.
