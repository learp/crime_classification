Nobel prize-winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, as well as Dave Eggers and Eimear McBride, are among a group of international authors travelling to Israel and Palestine to research and contribute to a book of essays about “50 years of Israeli occupation” that will be edited by Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman.The book, which will be published in 2017 by HarperCollins in the US and Books in the Attic (Sifrey Aliyat Hagag) in Israel, is part of an initiative organised by Chabon, Waldman, Vargas Llosa and NGO Breaking the Silence to mark 50 years since the six-day war in 1967, when Israel first entered the Palestinian territories: the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, and until 1982, the Sinai Peninsula.Throughout 2016, delegations of authors will visit Israel and the West Bank for a week and meet with Israeli and Palestinian “activists, community organisers, legal scholars and artists” before writing their contributions. Each author will elect a focus for their work and may make additional visits for research.Executive director of Breaking the Silence, Yuli Novak, said: “I’m excited about the first upcoming writers’ delegation, and am proud of the opportunity we’ve been given to share what soldiers experience in the occupied territories with extremely talented individuals from the literary world. I am sure that the unique artistic point of view will address the occupation in a sense that will touch the hearts of many people, both in Israel and internationally, in convincing them of the necessity to end it.”The first delegation of writers arriving at the end of February include novelists Eimear McBride, Hari Kunzru and writer and photographer Taiye Selasi. Other writers travelling include Rachel Kushner, Colm Tóibín, Geraldine Brooks, as well as Israeli writers Ala Hlehel, Assaf Gavron and Nir Baram.Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman on the secrets of married and writing life In their announcement about the new book, husband and wife Chabon and Waldman recalled a trip they made to Israel in 1992, “during the period of giddy optimism around the time of the Oslo Accords”, but said they had become “horrified by the violence of the rhetoric on both sides, [so] we have done what so many others in the ambivalent middle have done: opted out of the debate and stayed away from the country.” Waldman later made a trip to Israel and Palestine in 2014 and met members of Breaking the Silence, which has been subject to legal challenges and scrutiny by Israel’s government for publishing accounts by soldiers in Israel’s military about their time serving in the Palestinian territories.Chabon and Waldman write: “We decided to mark the 50th anniversary of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank by editing a volume of essays by notable international writers on topics involving life in the Palestinian territories, free of cant. We have gathered together a remarkable array of acclaimed storytellers to bring to life the situation on the ground. Their essays will allow readers to understand the situation in Palestine-Israel in a new way, through human narrative, rather than the litany of grim destruction we see on the news.“International legitimacy is critical to protecting the important work of NGOs like Breaking the Silence and Youth Against Settlements. Having unimpeachably credible voices like those of the writers in this anthology might, we hope, make a difference in the work these organisations do and the goals they seek to achieve.”
