A 2016 survey in the US found that 78% of the workforce were female, but 40% of senior and executive positions were held by men. While there has yet to be a industry-wide survey of UK publishing, men also seem to dominate the top echelons of the sector here, with the pay gap between British men and women in publishing currently estimated to be 16%.Anecdotal evidence shared with the Guardian by people currently working in the industry suggests that more men are working in senior positions due to factors including maternity leave, institutional sexism and the amalgamation of the big publishing houses, which has left fewer senior positions to fill.With no UK-wide data currently available, we’d like to hear whether those who work or have worked in publishing feel there is a glass ceiling for women in the industry. We want to hear from both women and men with their experiences and observations from big houses and independents.Whether you’re working in publishing now or have done in the past, please send us your stories via the form below.
