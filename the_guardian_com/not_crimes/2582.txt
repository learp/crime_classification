Cut the beetroot into wedges.Rub the five-spice powder into the skin and flesh of the duck breasts and place them skin-side down in a cold frying pan. Turn on the heat and cook the duck for 6 minutes on one side to release the fat and to crisp and brown the breast.

Place on a baking tray and cook in the oven for about 20 minutes, turning over occasionally so that they are evenly browned and crisp. Remove and drain on kitchen paper.Whisk together the dressing ingredients and check the seasoning.
