After a six second teaser yesterday, the full trailer for Hugh Jackman’s latest – and apparently last – outing as Wolverine has hit the internet.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Logan is the third in the standalone series of Wolverine films (preceded by X-Men Origins: Wolverine and The Wolverine in 2009 and 2013 respectively), and is set a year after the time-travelling X-Men: Days of Future Past.This trailer, scored by Johnny Cash’s Hurt, shows us an aging, pain-wracked Logan, in a society where mutants appear to have “gone”. Much of it focusses on a Logan in a state of intense misery, but there are also glimpses of Patrick Stewart’s Charles Xavier and Caliban (Stephen Merchant). But it’s Logan’s clone/daughter Laura (played by Dafne Keen) who gets the biggest share of the trailer; on the strength of this footage, the Logan/Laura relationship will play a big part here.The trailer also contains an unusually gruesome shot – towards the end, involving Wolverine’s claws – which has led to it being classified a 15 by the BBFC.Logan is due for release on 2 March in the UK and 3 March in the US.
