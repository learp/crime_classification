The summer of 1976 was Britain’s hottest since records began, with a fortnight of temperatures over 30C. While 2016’s July has been chilly in comparison, there is something in common with 40 years ago: clogs. With the 70s still in style focus, it’s not much of a surprise that the unmistakable clomp of clogs has been heard on the streets this summer. The clog – chunky, a bit homemade and the kind of thing that looks great with muslin blouses and sun-bleached denim – is as 70s as disco, Starsky & Hutch and space hoppers. Abba even designed their own line of them.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Clogs on the Gucci catwalk, for autumn/winter 2015.

Fur-lined clogs with horse-bit detailing were in his first womenswear collection for the brand and are now a classic, a move on from the equally fur-lined backless loafers that also came out of Michele’s Mr Magorium’s Wonder Emporium brain.

Suki Waterhouse wore a pair of similar ones at Wimbledon last weekend, with that other 70s signifier, a maxi dress by Stella McCartney.

Photograph: PRMichele’s mule styles are a way to move the clog on – if you’re willing to practise walking before taking to the streets. Rather than a toe-heel action, the key is to place your whole foot down with each step (hence the clog clomp). Swedish Hasbeens also have a pair of mules that are so popular they have sold out. This may be a blessing in disguise for those considering a clog mule. With a wooden sole and no support around the ankle, even with clog-clomp walking, falling over is still a distinct possibility. And that’s never been fashionable – not 40 years ago, or now.
