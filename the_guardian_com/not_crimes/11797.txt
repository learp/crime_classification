1.28pm GMT13:28That's everything from Neil!Thanks to Neil for answering so many of your questions. He’s signing off:  Guardian contributor NeilGaiman 14 February 2017 1:25pm263 Questions, and I managed as many as I could in the time we had, and stole more time from the next thing. They are now about to pry the computer from my fingers and send me back on the road.Thank you to everyone who asked the questions. They were all so good. Thanks to the Guardian for hosting this. Right. I'm back on the road. I'll see if Odin has organised a goat-pulled chariot to the BBC, or if we are back to using taxis. (See Tom Gauld's glorious cartoon for more details of this unusual book tour.)THANK YOU ALL!  Tom Gauld imagines Neil’s current press tour.

Situation being what it is.  Guardian contributor NeilGaiman 14 February 2017 1:19pmI don't think of good and evil as being distinct free-floating things. I think there are people, doing what people do, sometimes selfishly, sometimes short-sightedly, sometimes even monstrously. (For me, one of the finest evil characters in fiction is the sweet family man torturer played by Michael Palin in Terry Gilliam's Brazil. Because he's nice when he's not torturing people to death. Because he does what he does because he thinks it's the right thing to do.)And I am with Crowley and Aziraphale in Good Omens: the triumphs and the tragedies of humanity are caused, not be people being basically good, or by them being basically evil, but by them being basically people.Still, I persist in hoping and believing that individuals can make a difference in the dark times. And that things that seem self evident to me (help those fleeing persecution and war, safeguard the planet's natural resources, do not exploit the weak and defenseless, and so forth) may one day become so to everyone...FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.15pm GMT13:15Phillymonster asks:As a US citizen... what do you make of Donald Trump??  Guardian contributor NeilGaiman 14 February 2017 1:13pmI'm a UK citizen. Which means Donald Trump is the reason I worry that the next time I return to the US I'll be taken into a small office in immigration, where they will ask me about this webchat, and I'll not be seen again.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.14pm GMT13:14With original fiction nobody can tell you that you completely messed something up'CateEvans32 asks:How would you compare the challenges of writing something completely original and a retelling?  Guardian contributor NeilGaiman 14 February 2017 1:10pmWith original fiction nobody can tell you you got the details wrong or completely messed something up. With a retelling, you have to work to make sure that the scholars are going to be as happy as the new readers, but you never have the feeling of staring at a blank page going "What happens next? What does he do? How do I get her out of this situation? What am I doing?" Perhaps one day I'll write a book of retellings of completely invented myths, and do both.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.10pm GMT13:10Rinheartw asks:Spend more time writing or reading?

Knowing that many authors choose not to voice their own work, I wondered what it was that motivated you to go through the process?  Guardian contributor NeilGaiman 14 February 2017 1:05pmI love doing Audio Books. And do them, unless the accents are too intimidating. When I started out, I was told authors didn't do their own audio books, and I wanted to, so I did made a CD of me reading my own work, Warning Contains Language. It sold well enough that I was able eventually to persuade my publishers to let me do my own audiobooks, beginning with CORALINE. (But it was a different audiobook world back then.)FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.04pm GMT13:04Obsidianaura asks:Who are some good fantasy writers who aren’t being read enough?

I don’t read many comics, but I know you’ve explored some sci-fi ideas there too! Have you ever considered writing a science fiction novel? I know I’d lap it up.  Guardian contributor NeilGaiman 14 February 2017 1:00pmI expected to be a hard science fiction writer when I grew up. I was slightly surprised when I realised that I had to all intents grown up but I didn't seem to have become the hard SF writer I expected.I'd love to write an SF novel, if ever I come up with an idea that excites me.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.01pm GMT13:01verbalrob asks:How much, if any, of The Facts in the Case of the Departure of Miss Finch is true?

Photograph: James Dimmock/2017 Starz Entertainment, LLCdavefalse asks:When an adaptation of your work is produced (or is due to be produced) how much input do you like to have?I only ask as sometimes I think the more slavishly something adheres to the original the weaker it can be. Are you happy to let a fellow creator play with your creation or do you want to retain some ownership?  Guardian contributor NeilGaiman 14 February 2017 12:56pmI like to have a lot of input, and I like the other creators to have a lot of input too.GOOD OMENS is my adaptation of our novel, and it's very very faithful, except for the new stuff, some of which Terry and I had discussed 30 years ago and some of which I made up when I was writing it. (BBC and Amazon are making it for next year. 6 hour long episodes.)AMERICAN GODS is an opening up of the novel: the first 8 episodes (the first season) get us barely a quarter of the way through. (It ends just before they get to House on the Rock). But Bryan Fuller and Michael Green expand, create, fill in and play -- they want people who know and love the book to be surprised as well as people who don't.The movie of HOW TO TALK TO GIRLS AT PARTIES, at my suggestion, used the short story as the first act of the film, and then went its own way. I suggested the shape of the plot, but it was written by Philippa Goslett and John Cameron Mitchell, and they went their own wonderful way with it. (I can't wait until people see it.)FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.53pm GMT12:53LynnSpin asks:I still have some Space Voyager magazines in a cupboard at home - didn’t you contribute to this publication at some point?

Guardian contributor NeilGaiman 14 February 2017 12:49pmI need to sit down with Dirk Maggs and Heather Larmour, who codirected the BBC adaptations so far, and plot and plan, and decide what's next.
