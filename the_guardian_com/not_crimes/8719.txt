What?Sous Vide Multi Cooker (£149.99, Lakeland). Thermostatic heating element and lidded tub. Airtight food parcels are cooked underwater, retaining nutrients and moisture.Why?Basically, it’s a boil-in-the-bag meal that fancies itself.Well?

Photograph: Sarah Lee for the GuardianSous vide, French for “massive hassle”, is the cooking technique of show-offs. It’s a dog-and-pony show. Fur coat and no trousers, all mouth and knickers. The only reasons for cooking sous vide are because you are someone who routinely undercooks chicken and need a justificatory smokescreen, or are going on MasterChef. (All MasterChef applications have to be sous-vided.)If you don’t know, the technique involves cooking your ingredients, sealed inside vacuum pouches, in a precision-controlled water bath held at low temperature for geological epochs. Trying out Lakeland’s multi-cooker, it is this care and attention I resent. I don’t like my food to be more pampered than I am. “Take as long as you need,” I tell my spoilt rhubarb as I slip it in. “Is the temperature OK?” I murmur to the salmon fillets, as if we’ll be following up with a head massage, balayage and blowdry. Here, at Sous Vidal Sassoon, it’s my first time, and a little too gentle for me.

The temperatures involved are so low, it is impossible to judge when the bath is still preheating or in full swing. I already struggle with an innate suspicion of sous vide: everything cooked this way ends up so wet. Many practitioners sear their results afterwards for appearance, which seems self-defeating. Which isn’t to say it’s bad. I cooked chicken fillets – possibly twice, as I didn’t understand the display. When I got my breasts out, they were the most succulent I’ve ever had, the marinade given deep penetration, and no moisture lost. Delicious. But the faff of it, my God. Vacuum-packing, long cooking, optional pan finish – it’s like popping to the shops and finding yourself caught up in a half marathon. In fact, cooking underwater is like running underwater – better for you precisely because it is a pain in the arse. I know when I’m out of my depth.Redeeming features?Resembles a spa treatment for lamb chops, but lets you to cook moist meals from cheaper cuts. Sorry for saying “moist” so much.
