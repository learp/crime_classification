The Amazing Book is Not On Fire stands up to its name; it was not only amazing but it wasn’t on fire either– how convenient! The Amazing Book is Not On Fire is a compilation of the lives of some of the most famous British Youtubers: Dan Howell and Phil Lester. These two YouTubers have achieved a lot more than the average Youtuber; Dan and Phil have taken over the radio with their own radio show, have hosted the Brit Awards almost every year now, have had sold–out tours, were a part of the movie Big Hero 6 and have now published a book.Released on 20 October 2015, this book is killing the vlogger book charts. It has been at first position on various websites since before its release date so I can confidently say that this is a successful vlogger book.I think that it’s the first time in vlogger book history that two vloggers have published a book together. The reason behind this is perhaps their supportive fan-base, which allows them to publish one book between them.The book is narrated through their two different perspectives. It is a dialogue conversation between Dan and Phil themselves, represented by different colours. However the content varies; for example, their birth is a common topic which they interviewed their mums about, so there are separate pages for each of them. I think that the book is really well organised and isn’t confusing to the reader. I was easily able to get through the book without getting confused. On the cover of the book is the phrase ‘The world of Dan and Phil’ which might give a non-viewer the impression of it being a fan-only book. But according to me, if you do not know who Dan and Phil are, but are interested in getting to know them, I suggest you pick up a copy of this. It is a summary of all of their major videos, excluding collaborations with other YouTubers, and summarises from when they started up until now. If you don’t have all the time in the world to watch Dan and Phil’s videos from their original channel, their gaming channel and their second channels, then this book is what you should read. I don’t think this book is emotional unless you cry with happiness or laughter, which is good for readers who are tired or do not like getting emotional over a book. It radiates positivity and reality to a great extent. For a great laugh and friendship lessons please do read this book.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
