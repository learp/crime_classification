One of the reasons it is considered such a privilege to sit on a Man Booker jury is because it is famously rigorous. The judging is not a gig for lightweights. Not only are all five judges expected to have read all 155 books from beginning to end, but they have to be able to talk fluently about every book at length.The 2016 Man Booker jury has been meeting every month since December. What has struck us during our discussions is just how healthy the publishing world remains. Despite the ever-increasing financial pressures experienced by writers, and the ever-decreasing space afforded by the media to books, writers are still willing to aim for quality and to take risks.Man Booker prize judges reveal 2016 longlist The jury was impressed by the freshness and energy of the books under consideration. Political correctness may make for smooth edges, but it does little for the imagination and nothing for the arts. Writers work best when they are exploring at the outer limits of what is traditional, acceptable or conventional. It is truly heartening to see that freedom of expression remains a core value: respected by publishers and joyously – even anarchically – explored by writers.If I had to use one word to characterise this year, it would be “confidence”. The books on the longlist stand out for their full-throttled commitment to a diverse range of themes and subjects. Some of the novels are sharply satirical such as Paul Beatty’s The Sellout, or set in an alternate reality like David Means’s Hystopia, or tragic like Virginia Reeves’s Work Like Any Other. Some are magical or mythical (Deborah Levy’s Hot Milk, JM Coetzee’s The Schooldays of Jesus and Wyl Menmuir’s The Many); or historical, (Ian McGuire’s The North Water and Graeme Macrae Burnet’s His Bloody Project). Even when the novels feature everyday, contemporary settings such as Elizabeth Strout’s My Name Is Lucy Barton, AL Kennedy's Serious Sweet or David Szalay’s All that Man Is, there is nothing simplistic or ordinary about them. What unites the longlisted books is their passionate celebration of the craft of writing.It isn’t enough for a book to be transporting or entertaining, it must also come from a place of knowledge and an understanding of aesthetics. Even where a longlisted book wears its craftsmanship lightly, the power of the writing shines through. The 2016 Man Booker jury made no compromises and took no shortcuts. This is a longlist born of a love of books and a passion for great literature.• Amanda Foreman is chair of the judging panel for the 2016 Man Booker prize.
