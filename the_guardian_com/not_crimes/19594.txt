Ted and Black Swan star Mila Kunis has attacked presidential candidate Donald Trump over his anti-immigrant and anti-refugee stance, saying it saddens her.Kunis, who was born in the Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi and emigrated to the US as a seven-year-old in 1991, made the comments in an interview with Glamour magazine, in which she also described her parents’ decision to start from scratch in Los Angeles. “They came to America with suitcases and a family of seven and $250, and that’s it.”Asked about the “anti-­Mexican-immigrant and anti-Muslim-immigrant fears” stoked by Trump’s rhetoric, Kunis, whose family is Jewish, said: “We came here on a religious-refugee visa, and I’m not going to blow this country up. I’m clearly paying taxes. I’m not taking anything away. So the fact that people look at what’s happening and are like, ‘Pfft, they’re going to blow shit up’? It saddens me how much fear we’ve instilled in ourselves.”She also addressed Trump’s notorious proposal to build a wall along the US border with Mexico, adding: “I don’t even have to answer that one. There’s no point. It’s a really great soundbite. And it got him far. Nobody should be mad at him; we did it to ourselves.”Trump is currently under fire for posting an image accusing Hillary Clinton of corruption that has been described as antisemitic and was culled from a white supremacist website.
