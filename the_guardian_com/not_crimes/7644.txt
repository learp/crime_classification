Daisy Ridley, star of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, has poured scorn on a fan theory that Jyn Erso the female lead character in forthcoming spin-off Rogue One, could be the mother of her own character, Rey.Rogue One, which hits cinemas worldwide in December, is set three decades prior to the events of The Force Awakens. Erso, played by Felicity Jones, has been revealed in the teaser trailer as a battling, maverick space scoundrel, perhaps in the mould of Han Solo, who is recruited by the Rebel Alliance to help steal the plans for the first Death Star. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story – five things learned from the first trailer Noting Star War’s traditional focus on family connections, some fans have suggested she might be the mother of Rey, the Force-sensitive young woman portrayed by Ridley in JJ Abrams’s blockbuster sequel. However, the actor told MTV News to take nothing for granted when it came to the mysterious space scavenger’s background or apparent Jedi powers.“I’m not being funny you guys, but just because [Erso’s] white and got brown hair … it doesn’t mean she’s my mom,” she said, adding that she did not believe Rey’s parentage was such a big deal.“I think the amazing thing about [The Force Awakens] is that Finn and Rey don’t come from anywhere, and they find a place,” said Ridley, who is currently shooting Star Wars: Episode VIII. “So to me, it’s funny that people think it’s so important because I don’t really think it is.”While the young British actor is said to be aware of Rey’s parentage, she is not sure how the staff-wielding warrior fits into Star Wars’ traditional Force denominations. “I don’t know if I am a Jedi,” she said. “I don’t think I am.”She added: “We’ve had this debate as to whether [Carrie Fisher’s] Leia is because she uses her Force powers. Just because she’s not like, ‘Oh, I’m going on an adventure like Luke’ doesn’t make her any less Forceful.”
