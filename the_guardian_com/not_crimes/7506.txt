You’ll be at your desk when the apocalypse comes. Of course you will – it’s where you live. So perhaps it’s time you made use of the kitchen, and explored the gourmet menu you can prepare with just a kettle, a toaster and a microwave.All the recipes in Rachel Maylor’s new cookbook, Made in the Office, from chorizo linguine to chilli poached salmon, can be made with these three basic appliances. It’s supposed to help budding office chefs make nutritious meals.“I really like cooking, but when I moved to London to start a new job, I stopped,” says the 27-year-old architect.We are chopping vegetables together for our own homemade office lunch, a sort of super-healthy DIY pot noodle assembled in a jar.“In the mornings, I was always really tired, so I got into a bad habit of picking up granola bars every day on my way in,” she says. “I’d get a sugar high and then crash. Then for lunch I’d just grab something, anything, from the corner shop.”Disappointed by eating the same wraps and salads for days on end, and too exhausted in the evenings to prepare a packed lunch for the next day, Maylor decided to make full use of her office kitchen. “I can feed myself for lunch for £6 or £7 a week, if I just think of buying the ingredients in advance,” she says.We attract a few curious glances as we scrape our carrots, pepper and sugar snap peas from the chopping board into a mug we find by the sink, waiting for boiling water to soften the dried noodles in a jam jar. But by the time we’ve mixed it all together with curry paste and a stock cube, I’m starting to feel infused with the smug virtue of those who make everything from scratch. The end result is a little crunchy, but filling and wholesome.Next, we turn our hand to eggs florentine, which Maylor makes in the morning as she waits for her computer to boot up. Poached eggs, she tells me, like chicken, sweet potato and fresh tomato sauce, are great cooked in the microwave.Fortunately, like Maylor, I find cooking relaxing. “It’s quite low maintenance – at most there are two bowls that you rinse as you go,” she says. That’s what I call a meal deal.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Fancy a jar?: One pot noodles.
