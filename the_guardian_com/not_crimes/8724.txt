I hate horror films. I saw the 1996 classic Scream under duress: in a media studies class where critiquing it was integral to my final grade. I have a terminal case of the scaredy-cats, and I do not generally enjoy paying to be terrified. But as I heard more about new film Get Out, about a black man meeting his white girlfriend’s family, I knew I’d have to bite the bullet. And listen: it was utterly, spine-chillingly worth it. One of the top reasons? Its magnetic lead, British actor Daniel Kaluuya.Kaluuya, 27, was born in London to Ugandan parents. I remember first seeing him in Skins, playing charming idiot Posh Kenneth. It was a thinly-drawn character elevated by Kaluuya who went on to become a writer on the show. His acting CV reads like a British TV greatest hits: Doctor Who, Silent Witness, Lewis… and then more inventive fare, such as BBC3 ghost drama The Fades (he was excellent), Psychoville and Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror. Kaluuya’s face is distinctive; here’s what I like about it, in order: his smooth, dark brown complexion that glistens in all lights; his smile, which can flash from sardonic to warm; and, of course, those soulful, expressive eyes – so well used in Get Out. As the film’s director, Jordan Peele, said, “Why has he not been the lead of a movie so far? He’s a star.”Why I love… DJ and singer-songwriter Syd Get Out has made a staggering $100m so far, and attracted comments about who gets to play African Americans from Samuel L Jackson (Kaluuya’s response was understated: “I resent that I have to prove I’m black”). He’s currently filming Marvel’s Black Panther, and will be in Steve McQueen’s new project. All eyes on him.
