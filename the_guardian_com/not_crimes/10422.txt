Slated. How would you feel? Your mind swiped like your thoughts: memories, feelings didn’t even exist. Why? Because you’re a terrorist, a criminal who has been given a second chance, a second life. But is it worth living in a world full of lies?Given a second chance, her slate wiped clean by the Central Coalition, Kyla – a perceived criminal of the state – is reborn into her sixteen year old body with no memories. She is given a new life, with a new family and a new friend. Settling in, she meets 16-year-old Ben, who is also a Slated, and the two discover a bonding love between them both which makes Kyla begin to feel like she is a someone. This story has many twists and turns but in the end you discover don’t believe in anything. A wonderful dystopian and well-written novel that touched my heart. I practically digged into this book and I just couldn’t put it down. It is one of my favorite books and after reading the rest of the series and other books by Teri Terry she is my role model! This book appeals to all ages, boy and girl, however the suitable age for reading this book is a 12+. It’s amazing. • Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
