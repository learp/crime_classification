Zadie Smith’s novel NW has four narrative centres, two women and two men. In BBC2’s 90-minute adaptation tonight, however, the latter are reduced to fleetingly glimpsed plot devices in the story of Leah (Phoebe Fox) and Natalie (Nikki Amuka-Bird, below left, with Smith), childhood friends who fall out as each jeopardises her marriage and wellbeing in a city zone where privilege and poverty collide.NW by Zadie Smith – review Felix and Nathan aren’t the only casualties of the screen version’s brevity and need for a Hollywood-style narrative arc: Smith’s evocation of urban interconnectedness becomes more a parable of sisterhood, mutual respect, authenticity and getting involved in the community.NW the movie exemplifies what happens when cinema or television get their hands on contemporary literary novels, which typically end up shortened, simplified, possibly sentimentalised and with some characters shed or shrunk. Last autumn’s BBC1 series Capital (which crunched a 600-page, multi-centred novel down to three parts) might have been a British Short Cuts, but instead it cut out one of John Lanchester’s focal figures, a Senegalese footballer, completely and curbed the book’s polyphonic tendencies by plumping like NW for a central pairing – Toby Jones’s banker and Rachael Stirling’s shopaholic – around whom the others revolved.

Photograph: Hal Shinnie/PRAs a novel helpfully seen from a single viewpoint, Alan Hollinghurst’s Man Booker-winning The Line of Beauty required less brutal treatment when adapted (by Andrew Davies) for BBC2 in 2006. Yet the series left the same sense of puzzlement about the feted book it was based on: was that (one stealthy gay life in the 1980s, plus the umpteenth portrayal of a dysfunctional upper-middle-class family) all it amounted to? And if so, why adapt it? While literary adaptations tend to enhance actors’ reputations – playing Hollinghurst’s hero Nick was Dan Stevens’ Downton Abbey audition – whether they do the same for novels and authors is less clear.What also connects these TV versions, besides a sense of radical loss or distortion, is that all three unfold in the capital. And they share that London setting or storyline with a strikingly high proportion of the books picked out by film and TV since 2000: historical fiction such as Atonement, Tipping the Velvet, Small Island, Wolf Hall, Any Human Heart, The Night Watch; Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell; classy contemporary offerings such as White Teeth, Notes on a Scandal, Brick Lane and Love, Nina; commercial smash hits such as One Day Before I Go to Sleep; The Girl on the Train. The wider south-east will do, too, as with forthcoming adaptations of On Chesil Beach and The Sense of an Ending.On British producers’ slates, such projects increasingly coexist with versions of novels located overseas, such as Ben Fountain’s Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk (due in January) and Eleanor Catton’s The Luminaries (in production for the BBC). Much harder to find are adaptations set anywhere else in the UK – with Trainspotting and its sequel the exception that proves the rule, non-London British movies and dramas are likely to be original screenplays. Could it be that metropolitan film-makers (and before them sniffy metropolitan publishers and prize judges) are biased towards what they know?
