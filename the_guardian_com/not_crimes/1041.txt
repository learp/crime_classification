Singer and Prince protege Judith Hill says she was on a plane with Prince when it made an emergency landing in Illinois after the superstar lost consciousness less than a week before his death.Hill told the New York Times for a story posted online on Tuesday that she was “very freaked out” when Prince lost consciousness in the middle of a conversation, as they were having dinner. She said his eyes fixed before he nodded off. “Thankfully, I happened to be looking into his face,” she said, adding that she might have thought he had simply fallen asleep if she hadn’t been looking at him.

Hill told the newspaper she shook Prince and called his name while the plane descended to Moline, Illinois. “We knew it was only a matter of time; we had to get down,” Hill said. “We didn’t have anything on the plane to help him.” According to medical and emergency response records released in May, the plane rapidly descended 45,000 feet in 17 minutes. Upon landing, a bodyguard carried an unconscious Prince down from the plane.It was the first time Hill had ever seen him in distress, but she said Prince was awake and talking by the time they arrived at a hospital.Prince “was quick on his feet”, she said. “Never said anything, that this is hurting, never a sign of struggle. That’s why it’s all very shocking.” In the hospital room, she said he was like his old self. “He wasn’t dreary or drowsy, or anything,” she said. Prince died of an accidental overdose of the opioid fentanyl six days later. Hill said she woke up to texts from friends that day. “That was definitely the worst day of my life,” she said.
