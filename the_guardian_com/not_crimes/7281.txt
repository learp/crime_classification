Mollie Evans, who has died aged 94, was one of the most influential British antique dealers of the latter part of the 20th century. With her innate “eye”, she discerned whole areas others had missed or failed to appreciate. These, at the end of the 1960s, when Evans began dealing, included things “primitive” and humble in origin, naive and folk art, provincial furniture, and farm and kitchen paraphernalia, which trickled from her small Surrey shop into appreciative homes, the pages of interior decoration and “lifestyle” publications, and the storyboards of television producers. By the 1990s, what Mollie had started from enthusiasm and love had surged into a flood of “country” style.She was born Mary Isobel Simpson, at Eamont Bridge, Cumberland, to a large family long-established in farming. Mollie grew up there and in nearby Penrith, bright and curious, a bit of a rebel against her pretty, conventional mother, Mary, and close to a sensitive father, Robert, isolated by wounds and deafness contracted in the first world war.Mollie’s failure to pass the entrance exam for admission to the local grammar school was a blow she felt deeply, as she longed for its opportunities and a life beyond her small market town. These were afforded by a Carlisle secretarial course leading to a civil service appointment at the Admiralty in London, where the quick and spontaneous “northern lass” thrived.In 1946, she married Claude Delves, and left the Admiralty for employment at £2 a week by a chaotic Fulham Road antique dealer. She experienced the muddle of frames and stretchers, continental porcelain and odd bits of furniture with a growing sense of recognition and joy. In between giving birth to two sons, Clive and Simon, she learned voraciously, sitting in at auctions, haunting the then raffish Portobello Road, and picking up sizeable oddities for trifling sums.Mollie endured the misery of a nervous breakdown, left her marriage and was helped to recover by Robin Evans, a book dealer, who in 1959 became her second husband. In 1968, with £100 from her parents, she joined three other women to open a tiny antiques business on Hill Rise in the London suburb of Richmond, near the Evans home, and, the next year, dared to buy the lease of the former Sudbrook Park Dairy and Creamery at No 84, which became Mollie Evans, Antique Furniture, Books, and Interesting Items.“You don’t really learn,” she said, “until you start dealing.” She bought at London auctions and rural house sales, in Cumberland, on drives with Robin to Wales, trips to Spain and visits to France. She bought what she liked and what touched her heart, always seeking quality, rarity and age. At first a “purist” for the primitive – a large Basque carving cheekily dubbed “St Cecilia”, a small naive painting of a French soldier – she soon found interest everywhere, embracing Georgian furniture, 18th- and 19th-century French pine, and eventually, decorative objects such as the gilded bronzes and painted mistletoe lights that echoed her increasing regard for the designers and sculptors of art nouveau, whose work, she thought, blended well with “gentle” country pieces.To customers of the late 1960s and early 70s, her shop was a revelation. Contemporary English antique shops marshalled genteel “brown furniture or pedestrian inlaid Victorian”, said one early convert, who discovered her “scrubbed” selections with “a sense of recognition of something really special”. Admirers flocked to her door, and other dealers moved to be near her on Hill Rise. Her 1980 sale of Dairy Bygones was a first and a sell-out, as was her 1982 exhibition of what she called “infantile nostalgia”.Having poured so much of herself into finding, Mollie was often reluctant to sell, signing one receipt, for a pure primitive chair, “paid with thanks, sold with sadness”. But many of her clients became friends, their conversations spiralling from the small shop through the succession of Evans houses at Ham, Esher and Richmond, where Mollie’s good cooking, generous nature and talent for mingling disparate folk, made for memorable times.During the 1990s, Mollie developed heart trouble, and she ceased business in 1995.Robin died in 2000. Mollie is survived by her sons and six grandchildren.• Mollie (Mary Isobel) Evans, antiques dealer, born 8 April 1922; died 1 July 2016
