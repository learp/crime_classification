Phillip Toyne, the Australian environmentalist, lawyer and co-founder of the national Landcare program, has died aged 67.In online tributes Toyne was remembered for his influence in the environmental movement, his ability to be a bridge between farmers, green groups and government, and as a life-long advocate for Aboriginal land rights.The former Greens leader Bob Brown told Guardian Australia, “the map of Australia is much greener these days because of Phillip Toyne”.This was not only the case because Toyne raised environmental awareness in Australia, but also because he had a working relationship with cabinet ministers that had been “unprecedented” for an environmentalist, Brown said.“It was a high point of environmental action and gains in history. And it’s been much harder going since that period, I can tell you.”As the head of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) from 1986 to 1992, Toyne led successful campaigns for the protection of Kakadu national park in the Northern Territory, the Daintree rainforests of Queensland and the Antarctic.During that period, along with Rick Farley of the National Farmers Federation, he elevated an emerging Landcare movement, which aimed to reverse the degradation of farmland, public land and waterways, to the national stage.Following successfully lobbying of the Hawke government, Landcare became a national program in July 1989.Brown said: “I have a particularly fond recollection of leaning against the blade of a bulldozer and talking tactics with Phillip in Tasmania’s misty Lemonthyme forest, near Cradle Mountain, in the 1980s. “That forest is now an important part of Cradle Mountain, [called] Lake St Clair national park.”ACF CEO Kelly O’Shanassy said with Toyne’s passing, “Australia has lost a man who contributed hugely to conservation and Indigenous rights.”She said during his time as director he ensured all ACF conservation work in northern Australia was done in collaboration with Indigenous groups. “This principle remains absolutely central to ACF’s work.”The National Landcare Network tweeted that Toyne and Farley “bridged the divide between farmers and conservationists” and by transforming land conservation attitudes in Australia, transformed the country’s landscape.NationalLandcare (@NationaLandcare)The Aust #Landcare movement's visionary co-founder Phillip Toyne has died.

After that he represented the traditional owners of Uluru – then called Ayers Rock – in a successful native title case.In 2012 he described to ABC radio a trip he took in his early 20s that would prove formative to his future work in Aboriginal affairs.“The really significant thing for me was stopping off at this little ramshackle collection of humpys alongside a roadhouse and realising quite dramatically that there were people who were obviously ancient Australians who I couldn’t communicate with at all,” he said.The experience inspired Toyne to teach in a remote Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory where he witnessed first hand the gap between how elders there viewed land rights and the attitudes of the Australian government.During the mid-90s Toyne was deputy secretary for the national department of environment, before which he taught environmental law and policy at the Australian National University.While president of the Bush Heritage Australia board, the organisation became one of the world’s top private land conservation organisations.Toyne died after a long battle with bowel cancer and is survived by his wife Molly Olson and three children. A public memorial service will be held in July.
