I’m drinking coffee wearing an invisibility suit, so remain unseen by the three Lycra-clad ladies talking at the next table. Unfortunately, their topic is me. “He’s coping well. The kids seem fine.” At this point, I should leave, but hesitate as her friend replies: “He’s getting over it but having what’s either a midlife crisis or a second childhood.”I’m wearing my stained-glass work overalls so should stand out a mile in a middle England “CostBucks” with its mums and pushchairs, white-collar workers and post-exercise ladies in Lycra. Yet my workwear is like a disguise – I am a tradesman occupying a different social strata, and therefore invisible.I recognise one of them without knowing her name or having spoken to her. She probably had a child in Millie’s year at primary school. The second knowing voice is unknown to me. The third woman guzzles coffee silently, no doubt enjoying the briefing. I sip my Americano, head turned away, and tune out; despite this, a few keywords slip through: “No job”, “new house”, “girlfriends”, “stained-glass windows”, “Porsche!”, “Jo Wales”.Hearing my sister-in-loss Jo’s name is too much. I had suspected that our very platonic friendship so soon after Helen’s death might cause rumours but never believed it would still be a conversational currency. How the buggery do they know? Does being a small-town widower bring macabre celebrity?Unnoticed, I change tables, pondering this unintended but hurtful gossip. Midlife crisis? No shit, Sherlock. How much more of a midlife crisis can you have than your beautiful wife/kids’ mother dying before your eyes of a rare fucking cancer? As for “over it” – deep breaths required writing on what would have been Helen’s birthday.However, “second childhood” resonates with something I have read and liked. Until recently, it was believed that adults, unlike children, could not develop new brain cells. Now it’s thought that in certain circumstances new neurons can grow (neurogenesis).The neuroscientist Dr Sandrine Thuret identifies neurogenesis as a natural state but one undermined by stress, lack of sleep, alcohol, diet and, of course, ageing. This lack of new cells can anchor people in depression – cancer patients whose medication prevented neuron growth would remain depressed even after the “all clear”.Hence stress related to bereavement undermines neurogenesis and, while grieving is important, it should not be too deep or too long lest it becomes hardwired. The battleground is the brain’s hippocampus, linked to moods and emotions. The upside is anyone can provoke neuron growth through three key areas – bodies, minds and heart. The road back from grief might include exercise, learning new things and close physical and emotional contact – love being the gold standard.It’s probably why kids cope so well with bereavement. Millie and Matt’s fast-growing lives mean they are maxing out on all three dimensions, with the importance of love vindicating my continual presence by packing up my job. It’s better still for bereaved adults, according to Thuret. She presents neurogenesis as a “target of choice” if we want to “improve decline associated with ageing and stress”.Specifically, she throws in positive growth factors such as running, diet, red wine, chocolate and sex, where the latter “will increase production of neurons … but you don’t want a situation with too much sex leading to sleep deprivation”. Fat chance.But my Lycra-clad accidental tormentors are not entitled to gossip about me. I drain my coffee and go to the counter for a refill. There, waiting to be served, I theatrically start unbuttoning my overalls like some superannuated stripogram, albeit clothed underneath.It’s enough to guarantee the eyeballs of the room upon me as I gaze at Lycra lady No 1’s emerging consternation. Her own neural network has made the connection who I am and is wondering whether I overheard them. Our eyes lock together, then, oh so slowly, I wink, so causing her hand to lift to her mouth in horror as the penny drops that I had overheard them behaving like the witches in Macbeth, minus cauldron and plus caffeine.Childish? Let’s hope so.Adam Golightly is a pseudonym@MrAdamGolightly
