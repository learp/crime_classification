A website that hosted sexually explicit images of Australian schoolgirls is back online, with more schools added to users’ lists of desired targets.Earlier this month news broke of a ring that was targeting pupils of more than 70 Australian schools, with users sometimes requesting images of specific individuals.Federal, state and territory police were reported to be investigating the site, which was temporarily pulled down. But on Tuesday New Corp Australia reported that a further 19 schools had been added to the list since the site had been restored late last week.Police investigate claims schoolgirls across Australia targeted by site hosting explicit images Nine of the additional schools are in New South Wales, six in Queensland, two in Victoria and one each in South Australia and Tasmania.Multiples girls’ names and dozens more photos of young women have been added to the site, which is hosted by a platform outside of Australia.In a statement released on Monday afternoon, the Australian Federal Police acknowledged that the website had re-emerged and said it was continuing to work with state and territory police, relevant government agencies and international law enforcement partners to “evaluate this offshore website and determine the appropriate course of action”.“Websites hosted overseas create jurisdictional difficulties and investigations of this nature are complex.”The statement urged victims of the website to come forward to their local police and reiterated Australian police’s commitment to “following all avenues of inquiry”“Should offences within Australia be identified, action will be taken.”The AFP has been contacted for clarification as to whether an investigation is under way in the interim and whether any offences have been identified.Even self-taken images of children under the age of 18 constitute the creation of child abuse material, a federal offence in Australia that carries a maximum of 15 years’ imprisonment.The statement reminded parents, caregivers and teachers to inform their children about “the importance of respectful relationships, both on and offline”, noting that many were unaware of the legal and ethical consequences of sharing sexually explicit or suggestive images. Experts criticise ‘paternalistic’ response to schoolgirls sharing explicit images Police and schools’ response to the ring has been criticised by some – experts and parents included – as paternalistic, putting the burden for the ring on the young women pictured.A parent of a student at Kambrya College in Melbourne’s south-east wrote in a viral Facebook post that the school had held a special assembly for female students, at which they were told to “check the length of their skirts ... to ‘protect their integrity’” and refuse requests for selfies.The principal, Michael Muscat, said this week there had been a misunderstanding, and that pupils had been warned to be “mindful of their digital footprint” and reminded of the school’s uniform policy separately but during the same meeting.“I want to be clear here and say that in no way did we suggest that what girls wear makes harassment or abuse accepted. This is never the case,” he told Fairfax Media.“The enforcement of our uniform policy and the abuse and the recent exploitation of girls online are separate issues and should be treated as such.“In public discussion about these two issues at Kambrya College they have, however, become linked. We regret this. It was never our intention that this should occur.”Muscat said as far as the school was aware none of its students had been pictured in the website or involved in posting to it.
