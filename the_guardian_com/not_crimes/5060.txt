Calls for electricity rationing are being renewed in Tasmania as hydro dam levels fall further and with repairs to the broken Bass Strait cable still some time away.In the seven days to Monday dams across the state’s hydro scheme lost 0.3% capacity and stand at 13.6%, with further drops forecast.One major storage, Lake Gordon, is at just 5.9%.Record low rainfall is to blame for the shortages, which coincide with a broken and inoperable Basslink cable which would normally be able to send in power from the mainland grid.Plans to log Tasmania's world heritage forests dropped after UN criticism Tasmania’s energy minister, Matthew Groom, said the state government had a back-up plan in place, including using diesel generators costing scores of millions of dollars to hire and install.“We have invested heavily in and are bringing online over 500MW of additional generation, so small businesses and households won’t need to cut back or purchase additional generation themselves,” Groom said.“However, it’s going to take time to replenish our dams.”Levels are projected to reach 12% by early May and remain at that level as a result of low April rainfall.Labor opposition leader Bryan Green said the dam levels should sound alarm bells that it was time for the government to start conveying the critical need to conserve power.Tasmanian power crisis reveals urgent need for more renewable energy “Dam levels are now at 13.6%, which was previously the government’s predicted low at the end of May,” Green said.“It’s very concerning that we have reached that level almost two months ahead of schedule.”
