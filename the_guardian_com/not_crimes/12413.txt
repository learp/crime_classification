1 I, Daniel Blake (15) (Ken Loach, 2016, UK/Fra/Bel) 100 mins   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  I, Daniel Blake: the trailer for Ken Loach’s Palme d’Or-winnerFew film-makers seem to possess the will and the wherewithal to tackle Austerity Britain, so thank God for Ken. This is one of his strongest, following a laid-off carpenter (Dave Johns), cast into the soul-sapping labyrinth of state support, but who finds a friend in Hayley Squires’ even more desperate single mum. Authentic, relevant and achingly moving, it’s a tale of institutional heartlessness and human warmth that would move even a secretary of state for Work and Pensions.2 American Honey (15) (Andrea Arnold, 2016, UK/US) 164 mins   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This dreamy road trip across the US interior is so naturalistically acted and gorgeously filmed, it barely feels like a movie at all. Newcomer Sasha Lane excels as Star, an unkempt teen who’s lured onto the open road by charming Shia LaBeouf and his van-load of hedonistic magazine-sellers.3 In Pursuit Of Silence (PG) (Patrick Shen, 2015, US/Bel/Chi/Ger/HK/Ind/Jap/Tai/UK) 82 mins   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This minimalist documentary proves its own point: our world is filled with so much noise that silence is something rare, precious and slightly unsettling. It quietly follows various silence-seekers – a hitchhiker, Trappist monks, audio specialists – but also finds room for soothing images and even music. The experience is almost spiritual.4 Sonita (PG) (Rokhsareh Ghaemmaghami, 2015, Ger/Swi/Ira) 91 mins   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This extraordinary documentary could almost be a work of fiction. Sonita Alizadeh is a spirited Afghan teen, living illegally in Tehran, whose dreams of becoming a rapper are threatened by her mother’s plans to marry her off. She initially resists in rhyme, but the story’s outcome is grippingly unpredictable.5 Queen Of Katwe (PG) (Mira Nair, 2016, US) 124 mins   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Lupita Nyong’o in the trailer for Disney’s Queen of KatweA Ugandan girl’s chess skills take her from the slums to the championships, making for a different type of feelgood sports movie. Newcomer Madina Nalwanga is supported by David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong’o.
