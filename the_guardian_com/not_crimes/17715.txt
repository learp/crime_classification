A seemingly-psychic Twitter account has appeared, apparently predicting Brexit, the Trump presidency and Beyonc√©‚Äôs baby news.dex (@DexterAlex_)@beyoncefan666 Who are you and why has everything you've said come true.. pic.twitter.com/QMGZxxKdROFebruary 1, 2017The account @BeyonceFan666 gained a lot of attention on Wednesday night after Beyonc√© announced she was expecting twins.Days before the announcement, the account tweeted:. (@beyoncefan666)Beyonc√© is pregnant. She told me.January 28, 2017Tweets which seem to predict the future go viral all the time. For example, one teen accurately predicted Kanye West and Kim Kardashian would name their second child Saint.But what got the internet excited about @BeyonceFan666 was its apparent ability to predict other events too. For example, the account was accurate about Trump:. (@beyoncefan666)Unfortunately Donald Trump will be elected president :(June 14, 2016. (@beyoncefan666)I would tell you all to go and vote for Hillary but it doesn't matter because I already know that trump has wonNovember 7, 2016. (@beyoncefan666)hello from the futureüëãüèΩ just to let you know america is currently crashing and burning under trumps leadershipJuly 24, 2016And it also predicted Brexit, down to the percentage won by the Leave campaign:. (@beyoncefan666)Haha referendum coming up. Just a heads up: we leave the EU lolJune 22, 2016. (@beyoncefan666)In the referendum 52% vote leaveJune 22, 2016Because we‚Äôve got too much time on our hands, here‚Äôs our theory how they did it.‚ÄòPsychic‚Äô Twitter accounts regularly crop up on the web. Back in 2014, an account called Fifa Corruption appeared to predict key moments in the World Cup final, down to Germany‚Äôs G√∂tze scoring the winning goal in the 113th minute.However, making it appear as though you magically predict sports results is actually quite easy. You just need to tweet different possibilities before the fact, and delete the ones which don‚Äôt go your way. That‚Äôs how @FifNdhs got caught out. Suresh Nakhua (@sureshnakhua)This @FifNdhs has tweeted multiple outcomes and then deleted wrong ones #WorldCupFinal #WorldCup2014 pic.twitter.com/OzYDqodOmeJuly 13, 2014It would be simple to predict which way the Brexit vote went or who won the presidency because there are are only two viable options. Predicting the Beyonc√© baby news, the exact Brexit percentage, or Lady Gaga‚Äôs next album is a little trickier, but not entirely impossible. You‚Äôd just need to send and delete more tweets.But why hasn‚Äôt @BeyonceFan666 been caught out like Fifa Corruption? Surely someone would have archived or screenshot the tweets before they were deleted? If you look at the replies to each tweet, they were sent quite recently. In fact, most were sent not long after Beyonc√© announced she was having twins. This suggests the account was private until shortly after the Beyonc√© baby news. It‚Äôs likely the Beyonc√© tweets began trending first, before Twitter users noticed the rest.. (@beyoncefan666)Okay so Beyonc√© is gonna announce a pregnancy in February(2017)July 22, 2016That or, @BeyonceFan666 is psychic. But, probably not. Because if they were, then surely they would have predicted the bombshell twin detail of Beyonc√©‚Äôs announcement? Naturally, we‚Äôve contacted them to see if we can get to the bottom of this mystery.
