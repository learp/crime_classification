Peter, 82, and Luis, 17A retired black-cab driver with five grandchildren, including Luis, Peter sums up his personal style as “neat”. He likes blazers and tailored jackets in maroon or milk chocolate, and arrives at our shoot in a checked green Austin Reed jacket with slim-cut Farah trousers. He is not fond of an M&S cut: “Too much fabric, flapping about like a sailor. When I was a boy, it was the teddy boy era: we wore drainpipe trousers.”Peter isn’t convinced by how teenagers dress today – “They sell trousers already split!” – but does like the tobacco overcoat his grandson arrives in. He also approves of the rollneck-under-the-shirt look he is asked to model: it ticks the neat box.Is there anything Luis envies in his grandad’s wardrobe? “The one thing I would borrow is a pair of his cream suit trousers. I’d roll them up and wear them with a hoodie.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Vic wears cardigan, norse projects.com. Gilet, prada.com.Shirt, several.co.

Vic has one grandchild and is a retired movie poster designer and artist: his CV includes The Man Who Fell To Earth and the now iconic collectors’ edition of A View To A Kill (the one with Roger Moore in a white tuxedo jacket).Miles describes Vic’s personal style as “somewhere between George Clooney and Guy Fawkes”. “He has a great collection of hats, including a Russian sailor one. He wears his scarf that old-school 60s way, the way the Rolling Stones did. Vic comes from a generation when casual wasn’t a look. Guys always looked smart when they went out, not like me in my ripped jeans.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Phil wearscardigan by Sunspel, from matchesfashion.com.T-shirt, oliverspencer.co.uk.

Despite initial reservations – “This reminds me of going for a prostate exam” – he is soon showing his son, who works in the music industry, how to work it on set. Dudley wears his own loafers, bought on a day trip to France with his wife a few years ago (and worn to Phil’s wedding). “I was a snappy dresser in my day,” he says. “I used to wear a zoot suit.” And he takes a black and white photograph from his wallet to prove it – it’s of a 22-year-old Dudley in a double-breasted grey suit with lemon striped tie: a look, he says, that went down very well with his girlfriend of the time.What does his son make of his style? “Dad has always been a smart dresser. It doesn’t matter about the destination or occasion. Smart black leather shoes, pressed shirt and trousers is his uniform. When I went out in jeans and trainers, he’d say, ‘Son, you’ve been brought up, not dragged up.’ For him, your style is a reflection on your upbringing. I can’t remember the last time I saw him in a T-shirt. I very much doubt I ever will.” • Styling: Helen Seamons. Photographer’s assistant: Will Corry. Fashion assistant: Billie Brand.
