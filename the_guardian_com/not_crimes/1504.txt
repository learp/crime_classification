The Vietnamese-American writer Viet Thanh Nguyen’s Pulitzer prize-winning novel The Sympathizer has won the Dayton literary peace prize, a unique award that “celebrates the power of literature to promote peace, social justice and global understanding”.Nguyen’s novel, winner of the Pulitzer this spring, looks at the legacy of the Vietnam war through the story of a double agent. The organisers of the Dayton prize, which is worth $10,000 (£8,000) and was inspired by the Dayton peace accords that ended the war in Bosnia in 1995, called it a “profound, startling, and beautifully crafted debut ... both gripping spy yarn and astute exploration of extreme politics”.Viet Thanh Nguyen: 'Winning the Pulitzer changed the value of my book and myself' Sharon Rab, founder and co-chair of the Dayton literary peace prize foundation, said The Sympathizer – alongside Susan Southard’s account of the impact of nuclear war, Nagasaki, the non-fiction winner – offered “cautionary tales but also guideposts to lead us toward a greater understanding of those who are originally seen as enemies”.“This year’s winners remind us that the effects of war reverberate for many years and often many generations after treaties are signed,” said Rab.Nguyen said he was honoured to win the Dayton prize because it “recognises that in writing about war, I was also hoping for peace”.“As a realist, I don’t believe in peace. As an idealist, I have to believe in it,” said Nguyen. “We live in bloody and fearful times, but I think back to how, only a few millennia before, our human imagination was once limited to our tribe. Realism meant seeing the world only as far as the horizon. Now we can see further, and our imagination extends far beyond the horizon.”The author, who is also in the running for a National book award for non-fiction for his investigation into the legacy of the Vietnam war, Nothing Ever Dies, suggested that “perhaps writers have something to do with that expansion of the imagination, which has occurred while we as a species have collectively groped towards the end of war, conflict, violence and abuse”. After the A-bomb: Hiroshima and Nagasaki then and now – in pictures “The role of writers in these half-blind efforts is twofold. We can portray the worst of what human beings do to each other, and in so doing we can remind readers, and ourselves, that inhumanity is a part of humanity. In the face of that cruel truth, we can also imagine the best that humanity is capable of, and in that way provide a vision, a way to overcome the momentum of past conflicts and inherited bitterness, the inertia of accepting our brutality,” he said. “A strong dose of unsentimental realism, mixed with a touch of wild idealism – that is one way to imagine what I attempted to do through The Sympathizer.”Southard said she accepted her prize “in memory of the hundreds of thousands who died 71 years ago and in the years that followed, and the countless more who faced the acute and long-term terrors of post-nuclear survival”. “Their day-to-day suffering is still obscured by iconic images of atomic clouds rising over Nagasaki and Hiroshima, or diminished by passionate justifications for using the bombs. Peace is an arduous endeavour and impossible to achieve without a commitment to understanding the grievous harm our actions inflict on others,” said the journalist. “My deepest gratitude to the Dayton literary peace prize, to the survivors who trusted me with their stories, and to all Nagasaki hibakusha [survivors of of the atomic explosions at Hiroshima or Nagasaki in 1945] past and present, who have fervently fought to ensure that Nagasaki remains the last nuclear-bombed city in history.” Nguyen and Southard will be presented with their prizes on 20 November. Earlier this year, the American novelist Marilynne Robinson was named winner of the Dayton literary peace prize’s Richard C Holbrooke distinguished achievement award.
