These little nocturnal animals are so unobtrusive that very few people ever see them or even know they exist, let alone care about their survival. The European or black-bellied hamster (Cricetus cricetus) might very well have vanished from France unnoticed, had the European Court of Justice not taken up its case.In a ruling last month, the court concluded that France had failed to take the necessary measures to protect the rodent and demanded that it remedy this situation promptly.The court's findings were confirmed by the most recent survey of burrows in Alsace published this month by the Regional Environment Agency. It found 460 burrows spread over 22 localities, which was down from 480 and 25 respectively last year.But why should we worry about black-bellied hamsters, long considered in Alsace – the only part of France where it ever managed to thrive – as a dangerous pest? Why has this small mammal, which rarely exceeds 25cm in length, despite its inordinate appetite for wheat and barley, been protected all over Europe since 1992, and in France since 1993? Simply because, after years of being remorselessly pursued, the humble hamster has come to symbolise the battle against urban sprawl and monocropped maize, which now occupies more than 80% of the Alsace plain."This hamster is emblematic of the small wildlife living in the countryside. If it disappears, all the other wildlife will go too," says Jean-Paul Burget, who set up the Sauvegarde Faune Sauvage organisation in 1993 in an attempt to save the species, subsequently lodging a complaint with the European commission in 2007. SFS manages three breeding grounds and every year releases a fresh batch of hamsters, assisted by the National Wildlife and Hunting Agency, as part of a nationwide drive to save the species.Over the last 10 years there have been several rescue operations in France, but the results have been disappointing. In 2000, about 1,200 hamster burrows were identified in Alsace, but by 2007 their number had dropped to only 180.A new action plan was launched with a €1.5m ($2.1m) budget for 2007-11. It focuses on three priority sectors, two to the west of Strasbourg and one in central Alsace, encompassing 3,200 hectares of farmland. The plan is two-fold: to release about 200 hamsters raised in captivity every year; and to set up contracts backed by financial incentives to encourage local farmers to diversify their crops.In the three sectors covered by the plan, a fifth of the land will be kept for wheat and 2% for alfalfa. But this target, which has been reached this year in all three sectors, is not enough to secure the hamsters' survival. The most recent headcount falls short of the threshold for a viable population, estimated at 1,500 burrows spread over contiguous stretches of suitable land covering 600 hectares.The French ecology minister responded to the European Court of Justice ruling with a call for projects to mitigate biodiversity loss, setting four specific goals, one of which concerns Alsace and protection of the European hamster. "In absolute terms this initiative is good news, but in practice I don't see how we're going to find room to actually deploy the necessary measures. It's difficult enough to find suitable land in the three sectors covered by the existing plan," says Benoît Hartmann, of France Nature Environnement."If we really want to save the hamster, we just need a suitable swath of land," says Burget, "with one or two hectares here and there, so it has somewhere where it is safe and can build up reserves." The problem, he suggests, is that wheat has only been planted in the areas where hamsters have been released, with electric fences to protect them from foxes. "Elsewhere nothing has been done," he says."Due to the low population levels observed in certain sectors, improving the habitat will not be enough to reverse the downward trend," says an official with the wildlife and hunting agency. At the end of 2010, the agency called for the annual release of 700 more hamsters bred in captivity, but the ministry only agreed to 500.This article originally appeared in Le Monde
