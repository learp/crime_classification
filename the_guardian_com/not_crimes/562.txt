Facebook’s VR firm, Oculus, is fighting to combat suspicions raised by its privacy policy and terms of service that it will spy on users’ activity and pass information to third parties.The privacy policy warns about “information automatically collected about you when you use our services”, including “information about your physical movements and dimensions when you use a virtual reality headset” which may be used “to send you promotional messages and content and otherwise market to you”.It was first highlighted by news site UploadVR, which pointed out that “an ad executive at Coke, for instance, could tell just how long you stared at the Coke bottle cleverly placed inside your favourite game as an in-game ad and use that data to better place it in the game for you next time.”The device’s terms of service sparked fears of a different sort, with Gizmodo highlighting an apparent rights grab for content: “By submitting User Content through the Services, you grant Oculus a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual (ie lasting forever), non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free and fully sub licensable (ie we can grant this right to others) right to use, copy, display, store, adapt, publicly perform and distribute such User Content in connection with the Services,” the terms state.It adds: “You irrevocably consent to any and all acts or omissions by us or persons authorised by us that may infringe any moral right (or analogous right) in your User Content.”The paragraph is preceded by the statement: “Unless otherwise agreed to, we do not claim any ownership rights in or to your User Content”. But the language used is much stronger than that of other publishing platforms such as Twitter. That social network also requires “a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense)”, for instance, but doesn’t maintain that the right should be “irrevocable [and] perpetual”, as Oculus does.Oculus has since released a statement clarifying the privacy and rights issues. When it comes to user generated content, the company said “our terms of service give Oculus a license to user created content so we can enable a full suite of current and future products and services on our platform, like sharing a piece of VR content with a friend. People continue to own the rights to the content and can do whatever they like with it outside of our platform.”Addressing the privacy concerns, the company wrote: “We want to create the absolute best VR experience for people, and to do that, we need to understand how our products are being used and we’re thinking about privacy every step of the way. The Oculus privacy policy was drafted so we could be very clear with the people who use our services about the ways we receive or collect information, and how we may use it. For example, one thing we may do is use information to improve our services and to make sure everything is working properly — such as checking device stability and addressing technical issues to improve the overall experience.“Lastly, Facebook owns Oculus and helps run some Oculus services, such as elements of our infrastructure, but we’re not sharing information with Facebook at this time. We don’t have advertising yet and Facebook is not using Oculus data for advertising – though these are things we may consider in the future.”But the statement didn’t please everyone, with many pointing out that it simply restates the same rights that concerned people before.MOOMANiBE (@MOOMANiBE)This "clarification" on Oculus collecting userdata basically amounts to "Yup. Gonna sell it" https://t.co/lqVTN5jM9W pic.twitter.com/vjHgruTjNAApril 7, 2016Privacy issues are particularly sharp for Oculus, which battled a wave of anger when it was bought by Facebook in 2014 for $2bn (£1.4bn). The company, which had secured its initial funding from a fan-driven Kickstarter campaign, had to reassure supporters that it was still focused on creating a games-focused VR experience, and would retain independence from Facebook.
