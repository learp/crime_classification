Camera traps are best known for capturing images of threatened species such as tigers, but the NSW government is using the technology to document the health of animals considered a little more commonplace in Australia. The Office of Environment and Heritage has released the first images from a 10-year project, called WildCount, to monitor the distribution of animals across its national parks and reserves. So far, nearly 400,000 pictures of mammals have been captured by the motion-sensitive cameras, set up in 800 locations in a study area spanning 250,000 sq km of eastern NSW. Shuffling wombats, curious echidnas and nonplussed kangaroos have casually posed for posterity, as well as animals that have taken a little more interest in the cameras. One image shows an emu staring down a lens, while another shows a swamp wallaby looming eerily from the darkness to get into frame.  Other images include a lyre bird attacking a snake and a bird perching on the back of a kangaroo. Preliminary results from the study have revealed a previously undiscovered colony of the endangered brush-tailed rock wallaby, as well as plenty of sightings of deer and pigs, which are considered pest species. The NSW government has provoked controversy by introducing amateur hunting to national parks, ostensibly to help curb invasive species. A trial in 12 parks will begin in October, potentially expanding to 75 parks, in a deal struck with the Shooters and Fishers party. The trial will go ahead despite the abolition of the Game Council of NSW, which administered amateur hunting licences. John Porter, a research scientist at the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, told Guardian Australia that the WildCount study would provide valuable data on species. "This was brought about by the realisation that we really don't have information on the status and trends on species, which is a basic first step," he said. "When you're looking at issues such as impacts from climate change, water regimes, broad-scale land clearing and weeds and pests, you need to take a close look to see which species are widespread and what's going on with them. "The power of this program is that it can look at changes in distribution patterns over a period of time. It can help good management of our parks. "Camera traps are very cost effective and much less disruptive than live trapping. We've had some really interesting stuff. There's no white flash to startle them, but they can sense that a human has been there, so there's lots of funny pictures of snouts and whiskers as they check out the cameras."
