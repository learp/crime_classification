We had sailed the length of the Great Glen on the Ros Crana, the largest barge in Scotland, and now, for the last half mile, could smell the sea. Past the Clachnaharry Works Lock, then the swing railway bridge, we were at the point where the Caledonian canal juts into the Beauly Firth.Between the closely mown arms of twin embankments there is one last lock before open water. The solid wooden gates opened slowly and the Ros Crana eased into a sea so smooth that its surface looked viscous like the skin forming on boiled milk. Inverness was behind us as we headed under Kessock bridge, the bargeâ€™s engines reducing the noise of the traffic above to a blur of sound. Sun lit up vast banks of broom on the Black Isle and the green slopes where sheep grazed its fertile soil.Bird song carried far across the water: chiffchaff, blackcap, wren. Curlews cried as they swept along the bay, reminding me of home and the North Pennine moors. A red kite circled above a wood of scots pines and several pairs of fulmars were nesting on grassy cliffs at the entrance to Munlochy Bay.In the wide curve of Avoch Bay, the RSPB had constructed rafts for common terns to nest. These gravelled platforms were fenced around to give shelter to the chicks, and above them wheeled flocks of terns, elegant wings slicing through the air.Chanonry Point is a long narrow spit of land with a white and yellow lighthouse on the end. From its shingle beach, when the tide is running in, it is an almost guaranteed place to see the bottlenose dolphins that live in the Moray Firth. Groups of people waited on the gravel, their long lens cameras turned on the jaunty red and green of the Ros Crana.Every dark triangle of a wave was an imagined fin, before a merchant ship came powering in with dolphins riding its bow wave. One leapt backwards out of the sea, before they came to us too, shooting under our bows as we leant to see their solid pale shapes below us in the water; a moment of pure joy.
