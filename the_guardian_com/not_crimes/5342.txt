I’m a big fan of the zombie genre. However much of a slob you feel when you sit down to watch, you look, sound and smell terrific compared with the legions on screen.Nonetheless, we now seem to have hit peak zombie. The sixth season of The Walking Dead recently ended in the US, while the second season of its spin-off show – Fear the Walking Dead – began. In the first episode a member of the undead had his face shaved off with the propeller of a speed boat, a scene clearly heralded in the viewer advisory: “This programme contains violent content that may be too intense for some viewers.”Can zombies swim? Fear the Walking Dead sets sail for season two Intensity isn’t the problem. (Incidentally, the wording of that advisory seems to place the burden of responsibility newly on the viewer, a weakling who finds life “too intense”, as opposed to the standard phrasing – “contains scenes that some viewers may find disturbing” – which firmly implicates the film-makers.) One of the appeals of the zombie genre is the way it defamiliarises our world, asking us to consider afresh the flimsiness of the membrane between civilisation and chaos. The intensity works best when it is thrown into relief by scenes from prelapsarian life.That’s why the first season of Fear the Walking Dead was so satisfying, charting as it did the transition from normality to armageddon, when everyone got used to having to scythe someone else’s head off on the way to the store.Now both shows are firmly entrenched in the post-apocalypse, and it’s getting a little boring. There are only so many combinations of man/sword/zombie that screenwriters can come up with, a desperation apparent in the first episode of the new FTWD season, when the heroes took to sea and came across a capsized boat, within which lurked – yes – sea zombies.You can imagine what lengths the writers had to go to in order to get sea zombies to actually catch anyone. (They can’t swim, only float, which doesn’t make a lot of sense given that, unless I’ve got the wrong end of it about zombie biology, they don’t have any oxygen in their bodies). I took it as a wake-up call: not to consider the savagery within, but to tidy up and get out of the house.An app for the undead Spring finally seems to have arrived in New York, and people are shucking off their dead skin and getting “sandal ready” for summer. To this end, a welter of phone apps have sprung up in the past few years – the beauty equivalents of Uber – that will send someone to your home within a 20-minute window to buff your nails and peel bits off your instep. Manicube, which has been around for a couple of years, will send a nail technician to your office. Priv (a service that is trying to get the term “Priv it!” off the ground, which has about it the doomed ring of “Fetch!” from Mean Girls) offers hairstyling, massage and beauty options.There are scores of others, including City Mani, Glamsquad, Vensette and Zeel – all service apps designed to save us the bother of having to go anywhere. These feel like a luxury, but also a conspiracy to keep us chained to our desks or beached on our sofas for ever longer periods of time. There comes a level of convenience that is indistinguishable from the shuffling inactivity of the freshly undead.Skeleton in the kitchen Perhaps rescue will come in the form of two relatively new food trends, fermented food and bone broth. The former is all about gut health, with predictions of a surge in demand for kombucha, kimchi and sauerkraut this year. Artisanal versions have already started cropping up in farmers’ markets – namely, jars of corrugated carrot and gently fizzing cabbage.Meanwhile, the beverage machine company Keurig is introducing bone broth K-cups, so you can have a healthy brew as easily as a cup of coffee. Of course. If it can’t be done in one’s sleep, why do it at all?@emmabrockes
