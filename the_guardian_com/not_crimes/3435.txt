A woman dressed in western clothes and a hijab is a common sight across Europe’s capital cities – a fact now reflected on the catwalk at Milan fashion week.Halima Aden, a Somali-American model, is fast becoming fashion’s face of 2017, currently stealing the show at fashion week from the catwalk superstar Gigi Hadid. Aden, 19, who made her catwalk debut this month at Kanye West’s Yeezy show in New York, covered her hair with a black headscarf to match the black knit she wore on Alberta Ferretti’s catwalk on Wednesday evening, and teamed the brand’s classic camel coat with a matching fine wool headscarf at the Max Mara show on Thursday. A caption on the official Ferretti Instagram ran: “Embracing culture and diversity to break norms and change the thinking of modern-day fashion with Halima Aden.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Backstage at the Alberta Ferretti show.

I went in [for the beauty pageant] thinking that I want something positive for young Muslim girls. But I’ve heard stories from parents who are Christians, telling me: ‘Thank you, I want my seven-year-old daughter to know that you don’t have to be half-naked to be beautiful.’Backstage before the Ferretti show, Bella Hadid, sister of Gigi and a fellow supermodel, greeted Aden by calling out: “You’re the greatest!” Aden posted a photo of herself with Gigi, thanking her fellow models and Roitfeld for their support.  Getting great tips from a supermodel sure does help 😍❤️ meeting @candicehuffine , @parisjackson , and @gigihadid on the set of @crfashionbook prepared me so much!💞 I can't thank them enough for the warm hugs, kind words, and most of all AMAZING tips ❤️❤️😘A post shared by Halima Aden (@kinglimaa) on Feb 22, 2017 at 1:30pm PSTShe later posted another selfie, this time a high-school snapshot of her in the middle of a group of headscarf-wearing American teenagers, captioned: “This is for you #MuslimGirlsCan.” This is for you ❤️😉 #MuslimGirlsCanA post shared by Halima Aden (@kinglimaa) on Feb 22, 2017 at 3:19pm PST
