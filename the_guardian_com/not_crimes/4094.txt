Aw, mate. Foster’s have finally called time on the two beach-bum agony aunts so marinaded in blokey Aussie banter they could legitimately be called ripperologists. Say g’day to the new guy: Tom, an amiable drongo seeking his true calling.While drudging away in a dry cleaners, Tommo has a brainwave: by half-inching various outfits, he can test-drive possible vocations while also charming the ladies. Suave long-haul pilot? No worries! Dashing medic in scrubs? The sheilas will love it! Smouldering matador? OK, probably not an outfit you’d find in a suburban dry cleaners but it’ll look hilarious in the montage. Crucially, this is all framed as a knockabout Catch Me If You Can-style caper rather than the behaviour of a calculating, master-of-disguise pickup artist. The Mr Benn approach also opens up lots of fancy dress options for TV sponsorship bumpers and blipverts.But have Foster’s really thought this through? The new slogan “for the thirsty” seems to lionise those who try different things: great for enticing new patrons but do you really want your loyal consumer base branching out beyond their usual pint? Still, it’s probably a better tagline than “fizzy pish for catfishers”.
