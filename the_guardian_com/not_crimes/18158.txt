Sometimes, a jacket comes along and rapidly gets ubiquitous. Last month, it was the Saint Laurent souvenir jacket, beloved by everyone from Miguel to Keith Richards. This month it’s a customised denim jacket that has been spotted on A$AP Rocky and Kanye West. West even paid tribute to the jacket, with his Sharpie-covered Life of Pablo signature sheet jean jacket.Kanye West’s Himumimdead’s jacket.Created by designer-cum-artist Pauly Bonomelli under the charmingly titled nom de plume of Himumimdead. Each of these bespoke jackets feel like mini art projects: filled with doodles that look like they have been nicked off school desks or taken from the wall of the CBGB’s toilet. The label is consciously shrouded in mystery – they don’t do collections. Instead the team takes a DIY approach to stuff. “I just treat it as a selfish creative outlet rather than a fashion label,” Bonomelli says. We’re loving this anti-fashion as fashion.
