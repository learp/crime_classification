It is the status symbol of our time, or at least this season, because of its size: micro, somewhere between a camera bag and a tinder box, except with a chain and a monogram – in short, the gold standard of pointlessness because there’s room for nothing.See it as a counter to this season’s (it’s now September) oversized-ness – from Topshop’s longline MA1 jackets and swamping dresses, to Balenciaga trench coats with extra flaps at the front, everything has a too-long sleeve or a extra-wide leg. It’s taken a while for big to shift from accessories to clothes but it’s happened, and while none of it makes sense, its saving grace is the price – £470 is not affordable, but it is affordable for Saint Laurent. £97 for Diane Von Furstenberg is bearable.

Big, too big, heavier than the sum of its contents, capacious enough for weighty boots and egos, the sort of thing you need a car boot for, such is the size of the thing. The size varies, but is somewhere between 12 and 15cm long. It will barely fit an iPhone 6, let alone a compact, extra socks and a floating biro. Which is sort of the point – the Saint Laurent bag is also known as the blogger bag. Why would they need a pen?
