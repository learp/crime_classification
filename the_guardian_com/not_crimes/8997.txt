Barack Obama's plans for cutting US greenhouse gas emissions represent an important first. Piecemeal attempts have been made to address the issue, but this is the first time a comprehensive strategy to combat climate change has been unveiled. For the first time, limits will be imposed on the carbon dioxide output of existing power plants, which, as the biggest single source, account for 40% of America's carbon emissions. Shares in coal have plunged but, in climate change terms, that is a good a thing. It is a sign that Mr Obama is not tinkering around the edges, but attacking the source of the problem.It should also be acknowledged that Mr Obama is proceeding in the teeth of opposition from the Republican-dominated Congress, whose reaction to the very idea of new climate rules, let alone their detail, was summed up by John Boehner, the house speaker, dismissing the very idea as "absolutely crazy". Mr Obama's chosen route around a deadlocked Congress is to use his executive authority to direct the Environmental Protection Agency to draw up new regulations. These in turn will be subject to legal challenge by business groups which will argue that the EPA is exceeding its authority under the Clean Air Act. Challenges have already been set in motion over plans the EPA announced last year to limit carbon dioxide emissions from new power plants. Regulating existing plants presents more problems.Viewed from Europe, the plans are less than bold. Mr Obama's commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17% from 2005 levels contrasts with the EU target of a 20% cut from 1990 levels, the key being the difference in the baselines. His speech on Tuesday is not the only decision he has to make. He has yet to approve the Keystone XL pipeline to transport tar-sands oil from Canada to the US Gulf coast refineries and ports. Without that pipeline, Canada cannot develop a market for the third-biggest oil reserves in the world â€“ reserves that could generate three to four times more carbon emissions per barrel than conventional oil, because of the energy-intensive process of separating the oil from the rock. Lobbying for and against has intensified on both sides of the Atlantic, with the EU proposing to penalise Alberta's tar sands. Let us hope that Mr Obama does not tarnish his image by letting that one through.There is no doubting that, for today, Mr Obama is not only leveraging the power of his office. He is also investing his political capital into the cause of cutting greenhouse gas emissions. This and immigration will be the defining domestic reforms of his second term. No cause could better merit this effort. With the US and China, the world's biggest emitters, making tangible efforts, no bigger signal could now be sent to the rest of the world.
