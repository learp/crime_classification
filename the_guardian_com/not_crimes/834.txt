Donald Trump is the next president of the United States. A man who has been criticised for misogyny, whipping up xenophobic hysteria about migrants living in the US, and rejecting climate science, and who told Japan and South Korea to “enjoy themselves” if they were to wage nuclear war on North Korea, is set to take power in one of the most powerful countries in the world.By 1pm GMT on Wednesday the word Trump had been tweeted tens of millions of times, and internet users around the world have reacted to the news with a mix of dark humour, fear, and hope for what might be next. #JeSuisUSAAfter the offices of Charlie Hebdo were attacked by extremists in Paris last January millions got behind the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie in solidarity against the violence. The “Je Suis” (I am) sentiment has since been used in many sad circumstances, from mourning the victims of Boko Haram in northern Nigeria to bombings in Beirut. Today this has been adapted yet again as people mourn the election result using #JeSuisUSA. Many adapted the image of the Statue of Liberty, a proud symbol of America’s history of welcoming immigrants, to one of despair.

The first criticised “wretched” society, with a “lingering structure of racial discrimination”, a record they say leaves the US with “no qualifications to be a ‘human rights judge’”. The second said that the sitting president’s sanctions against the DPRK were unworkable and had failed in preventing the expansion of the nuclear weapons programme. State media previously said that they hoped that Trump, a “wise politician” and “prescient presidential candidate”, would be victorious.
