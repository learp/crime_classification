Iceland is to allow parents to name their daughters Angelína – a name that, like many others, has been prohibited until now as part of efforts to preserve linguistic cohesion.Iceland has a limited list of authorised given names managed by the official Personal Names Committee, which regularly adds names to the list at parents’ request.'No McDonald's, no motorway, no army': Iceland's evolution recalled On Wednesday the committee added Angelína and 10 other names to the list, including Luna, Hofdis and Eilif for girls and Eyjar and Kiran for boys.The committee’s role is to look out for the child’s best interests and ensure that names are compatible with Icelandic traditions and language.Yet many Icelanders, especially younger ones, consider the rules archaic. In addition, it can be problematic in a country welcoming an increasing number of migrants.Icelandic names differ from most western family naming systems. A son born to a man whose first name is Sigurður will have the surname Sigurðsson, and the man’s daughter will have the surname Sigurðdóttir. As a result, in Iceland, listings such as the telephone directory are alphabetised by first name rather than surname.The days of the committee appear to be numbered, however. In June the government presented a bill that would eliminate it by giving people a freer hand.The bill is not expected to be voted on before legislative elections on 29 October.
