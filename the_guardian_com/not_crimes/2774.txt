After months of angst and debate over the omission of the term "climate change" from the draft version of the new geography curriculum for key stages 1-3, the Department for Education has today released the new wording.The two versions remain virtually word-for-word the same, except for this section of the key stage 3 "subject content". Under the head "human and physical geography", the draft wording (pdf), first published in March, said that pupils should be taught to:…understand how human and physical processes interact to have an impact on and form distinctive landscapes.The new version (pdf) has now been amended to say:…understand how human and physical processes interact to influence, and change landscapes, environments and the climate; and how human activity relies on effective functioning of natural systems.The inclusion of these all-important extra words has been hailed as a victory for campaigners, such as 15-year-old Esha Marwaha, as well as Ed Davey, the climate secretary, who personally wrote to Michael Gove, the education secretary, asking for climate change to be included in the geography curriculum. In May, Davey wrote in a letter to Gove:Specifically mentioning climate change alongside the existing reference to 'climate' will ensure clarity on this issue for schools without requiring any major drafting changes to the curriculum. In doing so we will demonstrate the coalition's willingness to respond to feedback. More importantly we will safeguard the very important role that teachers have in helping children understand the impacts of climate change, one of the most important global issues of this century.When I wrote about the draft wording in March, I said the wording across key stages 1-3 was loose enough for any teacher or school to introduce climate change as a topic as early as they wished. It was not being "banned" from schools, as some seemed to believe. Others disagreed with me, arguing that the term "climate change" should be explicitly referenced in the curriculum to guarantee its teaching.I certainly welcome the tightening up of the wording, but I think it might be a little premature for those wanting climate change – and, by extension, environmental stewardship – embedded in the curriculum to claim total victory on this matter. For example, the Wildlife Trusts has issued a press release welcoming the new wording say it now means that "all children" will now be expected to learn about learn about "human dependence and our impact on nature".However, it is important to stress that the wording has only been amended for key stage 3 (ages 11-14), not key stages 1-2. This still means that a child can pass through primary school without the national curriculum demanding that they be taught about climate change. (Key stage 3 chemistry also states that pupils should be taught about "the production of carbon dioxide by human activity and the impact on climate".)The UK Youth Climate Coalition has hailed the "u-turn" and said it is a "crucial first step in the right direction". However, it correctly notes that any reference to "sustainable development" remains expunged from the geography curriculum:Today's revised geography curriculum is far from ideal. Whilst it may make explicit reference to the human influence on climate change, it is considerably weaker than the current framework. There is no longer any mention of sustainable development at Key Stage 2, nor its associated topics of social fairness and conservation of resources. There is no mention of global citizenship, as is currently detailed in Key Stage 3, or the tensions between economic and environmental prosperity, which are at present included.Cherry Duggan, head of schools and youth at WWF-UK, expresses similar concerns:Michael Gove has listened to the headline demands for climate change but weakened the curriculum when it comes to sustainable development. This government pledged to be the greenest yet but this message doesn't seem to have reached the education department when applied to the natural world. We welcome the inclusion of climate change in the geography curriculum at key stage 3, although we're seriously concerned about the lack of learning about sustainability and climate change at primary level. Even at secondary level, students are only required to learn the facts about how humans cause climate change. Missing is the broader understanding and debate about sustainable human and societal interaction with the environment on which we all depend.As I said back in March, I believe that key stage 3 is the point at which climate change should be explicitly taught, ideally within the geography class room. However, I do share these wider concerns that the meagerly worded new curriculum has removed any notion of environmental stewardship at just the age when children are most curious about - and in awe of - the natural world they see around them.Update: Via Twitter, Jamie Buchanan Dunlop has pointed out that the new wording also includes this amendment:Draft:...understand, through the use of detailed place-based exemplars at a variety of scales, the key processes in: physical geography relating to: glaciation, plate tectonics, rocks, soils, weathering, geological timescales, weather and climate, rivers and coasts.New:...understand, through the use of detailed place-based exemplars at a variety of scales, the key processes in: physical geography relating to: geological timescales and plate tectonics; rocks, weathering and soils; weather and climate, including the change in climate from the Ice Age to the present; and glaciation, hydrology and coast.
