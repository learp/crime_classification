As a former show business journalist, I’ve met my fair share of celebrities – George Clooney and Michael Jackson to name(drop) a couple of them – and been invited to the glitziest parties in the A-list calendar. But in December 2006, work was the furthest thing from my mind.I’d just married my lovely husband Jason, and we were beside ourselves with excitement at the prospect of our three-week honeymoon in Australia. Lizard Island, the most northern resort in Queensland and located on the Great Barrier Reef, was the first stop. It was the perfect place to relax after the hectic run-up to our wedding. We spent long, lazy days strolling across the sand and snorkelling. Most evenings, we would enjoy a leisurely dinner before heading to the bar for a few drinks. Invariably, one of us would suggest a game of chess and then it was war.I hate to say I’m competitive, but I once upended the Scrabble board because I was losing, so you’ll have some idea of the stakes. On one night, it was not looking good. Jason, who is much more of a strategist than me, had already claimed several of my pieces. Grinning at the prospect of another victory, he disappeared to the toilet while I considered my next move.At that moment, a shadow loomed over me, and a gravelly voice interrupted my glum thoughts of defeat. “You need to move that piece there,” explained the voice. “And when you’ve done that, move this piece over here.”With nothing to lose, this sounded like excellent advice, and I glanced up to thank my mystery saviour. Standing next to the table, scrutinising the board with a look of concentration, was none other than Donald Sutherland. Hawkeye from M*A*S*H was giving me tips on how to win my game of chess Given the nature of my job, I was not often starstruck, but the sight of Hawkeye Pierce from the film version of M*A*S*H giving me tips on how to win at chess rendered me practically speechless.I mumbled my appreciation and he gave me a conspiratorial smile before ambling off. When Jason reappeared I casually moved my pieces as suggested, and within a few minutes victory was mine.My new husband was baffled by my abrupt change in fortune and, of course, I milked it for all it was worth. However, I did finally confess all in the end, though. It turned out that Mr Sutherland was staying on the island while shooting the film Fool’s Gold, but we didn’t see him again for the rest of our stay.Which meant that was the last time I beat Jason at chess.Fiona Cummins’s debut crime thriller Rattle is published by Macmillan at £12.99.
