1. Getting started I tried this once: I didn’t try to think of a beginning, or an ending or any kind of story at all. I just made a list. Easy peasy. It was all about balloons. Balloons are. . . squeaky, bouncy, floaty, weightless and explody. And suddenly I thought my balloon should be indestructible. It should have a mind of its own. Then an idea popped into my head for an ending, and last of all a beginning. Lots of people have read The Blue Balloon. Maybe lots of people will read your story too.Mick and Chloe Inkpen’s top 10 author/illustrator pairings in picture books So why don’t you try the same thing. Think of a subject that catches your imagination. It might be a favourite toy, a particular place or even something as ordinary as a cardboard box. Then make a list of possibilities for it. Let’s take the cardboard box. Is there something in it or is it empty? Is there a label on it? What does it say? Is there any sound coming from the box? Is there just one box or are you in a massive warehouse with a thousand boxes piled high? You’re not trying to get a story yet, just listing ideas. But already your ideas are flowing, and that makes it much more likely that you’ll begin to recognise connections between your ideas. Those connections are what make a story. 2. Finding a character How to draw… Kipper Another way of getting started is to think what kind of character is central to your story. You can discover a character either by writing him or her into existence or by drawing him or her. Kipper started with a drawing, not a storyline. I drew him before I named him. If I get stuck with plot ideas I find it helpful to switch to drawing. Drawing uses a different part of your brain so switching between writing and illustration helps to keep the ideas flowing.

You don’t want your reader to be able to see the end from the beginning. So allow your storytelling to take a surprising turn or two. I almost always find that the most difficult thing to write is the ending; one that feels satisfying and complete. So once I’ve got the basic idea for a story I often concentrate on finding an ending before I write the rest. You might like to try that. Emily Gravett's top 10 animal picture books 4. How many words should you write? Picture books don’t usually have many words on each page. Try counting the words in some of the picture books you have enjoyed to find out how many words you’ll have to play with on each page. Think about how the words and the pictures will work together on each page. Don’t forget that the pictures should tell part of the story. It’s tempting to focus on the words and make them tell the whole story. But think constantly about how you can simplify your writing to work with the pictures. You’ll get a much more punchy and exciting picture book if you do. 5. Pages and spreads Look at some of your favourite picture books. You’ll find that many of them are made of 32 pages and have between 12 and 14 “spreads” for the story – two facing pages make up a spread. Yours can have less or more than that. But think how your story will divide into spreads.A spread might have lots of pictures on it, or one big illustration stretching across two pages. Think which moments are the most important ones in your story and what space you will give to each illustration. Think too about your page turns. Page turns can make a story entertaining. As the reader turns the page, what are they going to discover on the other side? Will the page turn add a twist? Will it finish a sentence in a surprising way?

Roughly draw your empty spreads and decide how to divide up the words of your story. Then do quick scribbly drawings on each spread to try out which pictures and which words go where. Don’t spend an age on your scribbles; they aren’t your finished pictures and you’ll probably want to change things around. You can even cut out your pictures and paragraphs and swap them around. You can write notes to yourself in the margins too. To check that you are happy with your plan read through each spread in turn as if it was your finished book.

Write a story that you will enjoy When you are making a picture book don’t worry too much about having to write a story that you think will appeal to a three or four year old. Your story will only come alive if you yourself are entertained by it. I’ve made books for very young children for my entire career, but I always think of it as entertaining the child in myself. After all I was three once. And so were you. So have fun putting your words and pictures together.
