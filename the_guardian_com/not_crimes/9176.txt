The resignation of Peru's deputy environment minister amid violent protests against the country's largest ever mining project has highlighted how weak institutions, unable to ensure decisions are made on the basis of robust information, undermine green policymaking in Latin America.José de Echave quit in late November, calling environmental impact studies on the $4.8bn (£3.1bn) Minas Conga open-cast gold and copper mine, located in the northern Cajamarca region, "weak, outdated and lacking in credibility".The move exposed divisions within the administration of President Ollanta Humala indicative of the difficulties faced by left-of-centre governments in resource-rich countries. Balancing economic development based on foreign investment with environmental protection is far from easy.After days of violent protests, and following De Echave's resignation, the US-based Newmont Mining Corporation – the majority partner in the joint venture, together with Minera Yanacocha, behind the Conga plans – said it was halting construction in an effort to ease tensions. But CEO Richard O'Brien indicated that the company, which is South America's largest gold producer, remains committed to the project.At issue is the impact on the local watershed, as Yanacocha plans to divert water from four mountain lakes into new reservoirs to enable mining to proceed. Protests have been led by local farmers and residents concerned about the impact on the underground drainage network and natural water harvesting system. Cajamarca is Peru's leading dairy and livestock region.Yanacocha insists that steps proposed in the project's environmental impact assessment (EIA) – already approved by Peru's water authority and energy and mines ministry – will safeguard water supplies and quality.The EIA was approved in 2010 under Peru's former president, Alan García, whose government expanded extractive projects that activists say were environmentally damaging and socially divisive.However, a damning 12-page review of the Conga project, handed to prime minister Salomón Lerner by Ricardo Giesecke, the environment minister, on 24 November, and leaked to the online magazine IDL-Reporteros, said the plans "will transform the headwater of the water basin in a significant and irreversible way, destroying various ecosystems". The review noted that only two of the four lakes to be drained will be used for mining per se: the others will simply be dumps for spoils. Giesecke has now asked the International Finance Corporation to evaluate the EIA.The dispute demonstrates how institutional weakness is allowing environmentally damaging mineral extraction to proceed in developing countries such as Peru, an issue on which multilateral agencies such as the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Bank have begun to focus in recent years.In particular, it reveals the power struggle between a weak environment ministry charged with co-ordinating green policies across the stronger "sectoral" ministries, such as mining, that sit at the heart of a country's economic development strategy. The latter tend to be much closer to powerful producer interests, putting them at risk of "regulatory capture".De Echave, a key figure behind the environment ministry's review of the Conga EIA, resigned after energy and mines minister Carlos Herrera Descalzi described it as "alarmist". Herrera Descalzi had already declared the EIA beyond reproach and said it had the environment ministry's backing.The outgoing De Echave was withering in his criticism of the "outdated" process for approving environmental permits in Peru. He was similarly unimpressed by Humala's decision to give the council of ministers – the cabinet, which the president appoints – authority over EIAs. This approach, suggested De Echave, effectively creates a parallel environment ministry, further emasculating a department that already defers to the mining ministry on matters of this kind.The dispute puts at stake the credibility of EIAs in huge projects and the mining ministry's prerogative to approve them. Lawyer Juan Carlos Ruiz Molleda, of Peru's Instituto de Defensa Legal, wrote on the blog Servindi: "A reality that the Conga case has exposed is that the approval mechanism for environmental impact assessments … is incompatible with the state's obligation to protect the right to live in an adequate and balanced environment contained in article 2.22 of the constitution, and with its obligation to implement effective national environmental policy, in article 67."Information management and balancing interests are key roles of environmental ministries. This is recognised by bodies such as UNEP, which has long been pressing Latin American and Caribbean governments to improve their approach to compiling environmental information, especially the statistics upon which they base policymaking.In November, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean held a conference in the Dominican Republic at which there was a call for environmental statistics in the region to be beefed up. Mining now threatens to trip up Humala, who was elected in June after promising poor Peruvians greater benefits from the exploitation of natural resources. Analysts say the suspension of the Conga project threatens the estimated $50bn mining companies are likely to invest in the country this decade.
