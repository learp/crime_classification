The world of graphic novels can seem like a minefield to navigate, especially if you are new to the genre. Traditionally the home of superheroes and their arch nemeses, first time readers who aren’t into the superhero theme might not realise what else is out there too! This genre is home to some of illustration’s finest talent, as well as writers who take storytelling to a new imaginative level. There are many fantastic YA graphic novels to discover that offer a breath of fresh air.It can be hard to know where to begin since there are so many beautiful works out there and not all of them are aimed at teen readers. So here’s a list of great starter graphic novels that might get you hooked. The Encyclopedia of Early Earth by Isabel GreenbergWhen this book first hit the shelves a few years ago, I was instantly struck by how breathtakingly beautiful it was. This was when I was first starting to become interested in the world of graphic novels and I couldn’t get over how stunning each and everything page in this chunky, hardback book were. This is the story of a boy from the North Pole who travels to the South Pole, only to meet the love of his life. However, there’s a catch. They can’t touch. So in a bid to save their relationship, the boy and girl travel the world in search of the answer to all their problems. This story is told through a series of folk tales that read with a natural lyricism, as if they are being read aloud around a camp fire. Prepare for some stunning mythology that you will never have read before, full of gods and demons of various shapes and sizes. All the while the central story of longing and love captivates all the way through to the end.This is the kind of book you will want to take home and keep forever. It’s timeless folklore and exquisite drawings will convert lovers of fantasy and mythology to the wonders of graphic novels.  This One Summer by Mariko and Jillian TamakiRose spends every summer at the beach but this summer her parents can’t stop arguing. She looks for a distraction but finds trouble instead. This is a coming of age story with a twist and older YA readers will find lots to admire here. It’s a relatable story full of heart-break and shocking revelations but it is ultimately about growing up and dealing with change. We are drawn into the heart of Rose’s life and her struggles which unfold through a serious of sensitively drawn illustrations. There is mature content here only suitable for older readers. Scrumptiously painted, this graphic novel will make a gorgeous addition to any YA reader’s bookshelf. Suffragette by Sally Heathcote, Mary Talbot, Bryan Talbot and Kate CharlesworthOne of the most tumultuous periods in modern British history is given the graphic novel treatment. Following the story of one woman who joins the campaign for women’s equality, Sally Heathcote and her collaborators take the reader inside a pivotal moments in democracy, introducing us to key historical figures along the way. Although this book can be a little dry at times, the writer has done a great job at combining historical fact with an engaging story line. This is definitely one for older teens. There’s violence and hardship aplenty, but translating the fight for equal rights into graphic novel form is a joy to see and a great way to learn a bit more about the time, as seen through the eyes of the characters who lived it.The Gigantic Beard that was Evil by Stephen Collins This is a story about an ordinary man, who leads an ordinary life, until one day he grows a gigantic, town-swallowing beard. Sounds simple (and childish enough) but this wonderfully weird story is full of enough surreal twists and turns to keep you entertained. Stephen Collins has meticulously penned his illustrations in this modern fable about identity and what it means to fit in. In some ways, it reads more like a picture book for adults in that there are lots of lovely double page illustrations that are different to the traditional graphic novel layout. I read this in one sitting and think it’s a great introduction to graphic novels for those just looking to get a taster of what this storytelling medium can offer.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Through the Woods by Emily CarrollThere is a whole diverse world of genres waiting to be explored in the graphic novel world, to show it’s not all just action adventure and superheroes and Emily Carroll’s Through the Woods is a perfect example. Inspired by Penny Dreadfulls and a Victorian fascination with all things gothic, this is a collection of five thrillingly scary stories that will keep you up at night. Fans of YA horror fiction will appreciate the kooky illustrations and how Carroll plays with typical horror plot elements. Not only is this a great read, the illustrations really build the suspense, while making you marvel at her drawing skills. See how Emily Carroll’s Through the Woods inspired one children’s books teen site member to make her own graphic novel in our fan art gallery. The Graveyard Book, graphic novel by Neil Gaiman and P Craig Russell Eerie yet loveable, The Graveyard Book has long been the beloved book of choice for YA readers internationally. So it was a tall order for P Craig Russell to take such a highly imagined and finely crafted fantasy story by award-winning Gaiman and turn it into a graphic novel. But he pulls it off. The story follows orphan Nobody Owens, or Bod, who is raised in graveyard by a pair of ghosts and a vampire. Meanwhile, his parent’s killer seeks to find him and finish the job. The sheer scale and scope of Neil Gaiman’s multi-world story is captured pain-staking detail by Russell’s illustrations. We see life with Bod’s graveyard pals and the series of other worlds his visits throughout brought to realisation on the page; a fantastic testament to Gaiman’s imaginative power and sheer talent for storytelling. Seeing the characters we all loved and imagined realised in ink is a real treat.If you loved the book in it’s original form, then this graphic novel version is one not to be missed. And if you are new to Gaiman’s stories then this is the perfect introduction to one of the most distinctively unique and quirky writers writing for YA there is. And if that isn’t enough, there is also a graphic novel adaption of Coraline, also penned by P Craig Russell for the die-hard Gaiman fans. Persopolis by Marjane SatrapiThis wonderful graphic novel tells the story of Marjane Satrapi’s life in Tehran from the ages of six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah’s regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. It’s gorgeously drawn and immensely moving story paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Not recommended to anyone under 12 as it is quite an upsetting read with strong themes, even though it tells the story through a child’s eyes. You can read a review of Persopolis by site member SaiWish0221 which gives you some more info. But do read it! There is also a Persopolis 2 which tells the story of the next eight years of Marjane’s life.

I read the first book and I anxiously await the second. The illustrations are very, very cool. Also, for anyone who is curious about Wonder Woman but doesn’t know exactly where to start, I would highly recommend The Legend of Wonder Woman, which DC just released. It has really amazing origin stories, strong female characters across the board. Great for young kids too.Emily Drabble (@EmilyDrabs)I recommend @CeceBellBooks graphic novel El Deafo for all ages https://t.co/wPare9IRmc - it's one of my fav books of 2015 @GdnChildrensBksApril 25, 2016thebookseekers (@thebookseekers)@GdnChildrensBks @neilhimself @Marji_Satrapi @emilyterrible Blacksad by Canales & Guarnido.
