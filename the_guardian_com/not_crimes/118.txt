The eerie contemporary resonance of the Great Fire of London, and the fate of the homeless and destitute whose shanty town outside the city was eventually destroyed by the authorities, will be traced in a major exhibition this summer at the Museum of London.The show will present evidence that camps filled with refugees from the fire that overwhelmed the capital in 1666 were still there eight years later – until they were cleared by the authorities.“It’s a very interesting aspect of the fire which hasn’t been much studied,” said curator Meriel Jeater at a press preview on Thursday. “We know they were there for so long because in 1674 an order was passed that what was described as their miserable shacks and hovels be pulled down, and we really don’t know what happened to many of these people after that.” While the rich found new accommodation, the poor, Jeater said, fled to improvised shelters in fields on the outskirts, where they were stranded. Initially there were subscriptions to help the homeless, and the monarch gave army tents as emergency housing, but as months passed the poorest had no hope of escape. Illness spread and there were reports of despairing people killing themselves.Markets and businesses sprang up among the tents, but they were dangerous and disorderly places, where a riot broke out after a rumour that the French – widely blamed, along with Roman Catholics or Roman Catholic French, for starting the fire – were planning to invade. The ultimate fate of those whose precarious refuges were destroyed after 1674 is unknown.

Fanned by gale-force winds, in a tinder dry city after months without rain, it swept westwards through the crowded medieval timber buildings for three days, until four-fifths of the city had been destroyed and 80,000 people were homeless.Archaeologists on City sites are still making finds from the scorched layer marking the disaster, which often reek of soot even after 350 years. Exhibits will include humble objects that act as graphic witnesses to the ferocity of the blaze. They include a rusted lump of metal that x-rays show holds the melted remains of two expensive locks and keys; beautiful ceramics left with their glaze bubbled by the heat; and a roof tile melted till it folded in two. A vivid painting made a few years after the fire – rediscovered in 1910 by an amateur picture restorer – shows flames spouting like Roman candles from all the city’s towers.One poignant relic, a piece of embroidery reputedly rescued from a house on Cheapside, will go on display for the first time: the entire elaborate design has been drawn on to the linen, but only a corner of the piece stitched – the owner evidently could never bear to complete it.As the city burned, with fire leaping from street to street through sparks blown on the wind, the rich took refuge with relatives, moved to their country homes outside the city, rented new houses – rents soared in the aftermath – and eventually rebuilt their homes and businesses.Although only six people are known to have died in the fire, the financial loss was tremendous in a city still recovering from the ravages of the Great Plague the previous year. One widow with five children got £10 in aid after the destruction of the house she had just spent £800 renovating.

He had fled with his family and as much mail as he could rescue, but the post office and most of the letters in his charge had been destroyed. He signed himself “your sorrowful friend”, writing to all the postmasters “betwixt London & Chester & Holly Head”, warning that the fire “last night & this day rages through all parts of the city … & by all conjecture is not by any means to be stopped from further ruin except God in his infinite wisdom prevent.”Robert Flatman wrote in shock to his lawyer brother from Lambeth, across the river: “I am not able to express without horror the great progress of the fire … your Chamber in the Temple is down but your books are safe.”After three days of the blaze running out of control, effective fire breaks were created by blowing up houses and, crucially, the wind dropped.The Pudding Lane baker continued to protest his innocence, and a man who was almost certainly mentally ill and innocent confessed to arson and was hanged. “The truth is we don’t know exactly how the fire started, and we probably never will know,” Jeater said.Fire! Fire! will be at the Museum of London, 23 July 2016 until 17 April 2017.
