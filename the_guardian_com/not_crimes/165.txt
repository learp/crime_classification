The fact that a Google self-driving car had a crash is “not a surprise” according to the US transport secretary Anthony Foxx.Talking to the BBC at South by Southwest in Austin Texas, Foxx discussed the future of road transportation and the recent crash caused by Google’s autonomous SUV, which pulled out and struck a bus. Foxx said: “It’s not a surprise that at some point there would be a crash of any technology that’s on the road.“But I would challenge one to look at the number of crashes that occurred on the same day that were the result of human behaviour.”Seven US cities, including Austin, Columbus, Denver, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Portland and San Francisco, are in the running for a $40m government grant to fund smart city technologies, including driverless cars.Foxx said that he expected the autonomous technology not to be perfect, but that it could prevent up to 80% of crashes in the US. For the foreseeable future there is likely to be a mix of human driven and driverless cars, but the future for the subsequent generations might be different.But Foxx said: “My kids don’t know what a typewriter is. They don’t even know what it is to roll up a window in a car, because they’re all motorised these days.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Google’s driverless Lexus SUV – without a scratch.

It’s unclear to me now exactly how that future unfolds.”George Osborne to back driverless car trials on UK motorwaysYour next car will be hacked. Will autonomous vehicles be worth it?
