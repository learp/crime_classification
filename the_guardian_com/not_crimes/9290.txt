A study is being launched to discover the best way to tackle what many gardeners see as their ultimate foes – slugs and snails.The one-year research project will examine the use of mulch, slug pellets and nematodes, a form of biological control of slugs and snails. It is being conducted by the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) and the chemicals company BASF, the only UK producer of nematodes.It aims to address gaps in understanding how best to tackle slugs and snails, which have topped the list of garden pests in seven of the past 10 years, based on queries to the RHS gardening advice service. The project will test six different control strategies, combining multiple methods in a process known as integrated pest management to find the best system.Armed and dangerous: how to tackle pests and diseases in small gardens Dr Hayley Jones, the RHS scientist who is leading the research, said: “The damage slugs and snails do to plants has, over the years, led to the development of a wide array of control methods, but these animals are still a persistent problem, which means the current treatments are not working as well as hoped.“By conducting scientifically robust research into which combinations of treatments are the most effective, gardeners will for the first time have access to guidance on which method best suits their unique circumstances. “What this could mean is that in years to come slugs and snails will drop down the table of gardeners’ most troublesome pests.” The six methods involved in the study are:A standard cultural treatment, or mulch, around plants.Mulch with a chemical treatment, metaldehyde, the most commonly used type of slug pellets.Mulch with an organic ferric phosphate slug pellet.Mulch and application of nematodes once damage is seen. The microscopic organisms enter the pest and release a bacteria that kills it.Mulch and nematodes applied as a preventive regularly from early spring.A control with no treatment.
