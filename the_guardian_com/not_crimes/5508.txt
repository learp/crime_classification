On the formal lawns of a National Trust country house, I elected to walk “informally” barefooted. Down an avenue with evenly spaced lime trees on either side, the alternations between sun and shade were felt on sleeveless arms; they were experienced by naked soles, cooled by rain-damp grass, warmed by the underfloor heating of sun-baked turf. On open ground with lush green vegetation laced with purple sprigs of self-heal, my toes curled as if the surface below were a medium-pile carpet. Under conifers that had shed brittle husks, foot arches drew up instinctively, rather as they might do when touching down on shingle after a blissful stretch on soft sand. My soles flexed and shaped to suit ground that was more uneven than it looked from a casual view. They felt the unyielding hardness beneath cracked, droughty patches of bare soil and sparse grass.I was be-sandalled again when I entered the rose garden, a parlour of odours, a riot of pink, peach, primrose yellow, crimson and white. Elderly visitors threaded between the rectangular flowerbeds, leaning decorously over for a sniff. Perhaps more supple and certainly less inhibited, I dropped on all fours to drink from the lowest-hanging blooms, a sampler of scents, tripping from one flowerbed to the next. There were maybe 30 varieties of rose here, each one intensely, uniquely perfumed, but each noseful of fragrance could only be inhaled with ecstasy a nose-length away.Some varieties of rose were heavily specked with moving black dots. These were pollen beetles, swarming over the flower heads. The rose nectaries must have showered their sweet bounty liberally about, for the beetles were clambering into every fold of petal. They behaved as if every minute were the start of a Boxing Day sale: one beetle had landed on its back in a drop of rainwater and was paddling its legs helplessly. Another landed on top of the stranded beetle and scrambled over it with brutal disregard to reach the bargains on the other side. For us, roses are an exquisite joy. For single-minded beetles, they sustain life itself.Twitter: @DerekNiemann
