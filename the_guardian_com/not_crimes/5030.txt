Now that we are in August, has there been a big trend for summer 2016?Mia, N1Indeed there is, Mia, and it’s one that I only cottoned on to after the US political conventions – not, it has to be said, usually a hotbed of fashion trends. I don’t want to be mean about American politicians (well, not all of them), but let’s put it this way: they don’t tend to give Milan fashion week too many paroxysms of insecurity when it comes to carving out the look of the season.And yet, a trend most definitely came from, of all places, Pittsburgh and Cleveland – and that trend is white. I first noticed this during Melania Trump’s karaoke version of Michelle Obama’s speech during the Republican National Convention, when she wore a white Roksanda dress that was a lot more impressive than anything that came out of her mouth. It was also, I thought, not very Melania. I have made it my mission over the past decade to acquaint myself with the ways of Melania, just as I did with Donald Trump’s previous two wives, all of them fascinating in their own ways. Each of his wives was perfect for the decade in which they married him: Ivana, with her shoulder pads and open love of wealth, was like a human embodiment of the 80s; Marla Maples looked like a cast member of Baywatch or Melrose Place, making her perfect for the 90s. Then there’s Melania, with her frankly terrifying smoky-eye makeup and permanently blown-out hair: so very 21st century. She looks, and I don’t think she’ll take this as an insult, like an assassin in a Bourne movie, or maybe an Austin Powers film, or possibly even Zoolander. Anyway, the soft femininity of the Roksanda dress was so strikingly different from Melania’s usual fembot style (which can be summed up as tight and pointy with brass detailings) that I knew something was up. As, indeed, it was: white was up.Hillary Clinton then wore a white pantsuit at the DNC, a nod, apparently, to white being the colour of the suffragettes. Rather amusingly, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty wore the same white dress as Melania to the DNC, and not only did she look better in it, she also reminded everyone about what is now referred to as the Melania Incident. So 2-0 to Congresswoman Beatty.Finally, this week, Michelle Obama wore a sleeveless full-length white dress to a state dinner for the prime minister of Singapore. I like to think Queen Obama chose this as an homage to the full-length white dress by Jason Wu that she wore to the Inaugural Ball in a kinda “Remember that night? Well, now we are outta here! You’re gonna miss us, guys!” way.White really is the ultimate power colour. We can talk about its references to purity, saintliness and all other words that are just synonyms for virginity until the white cows come home. But the truth is, what it is about now is a woman who wants to be noticed, doesn’t care if her thighs look fat and doesn’t give a damn about her dry-cleaning bill. Now, if that isn’t a power statement, I don’t know what is. And that’s what summer 2016 is all about, fashion-wise: ladies not giving a good goddamn, whether it’s about breaking glass ceilings or blatantly ripping off someone else’s speech on the international stage.Ah well, win some, lose some, eh, ladies?      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Sarah Jessica Parker ... not a feminist. Photograph: Lovekin/WWD/Rex/ShutterstockSarah Jessica Parker has disowned feminism. What does this mean?Cara, by emailThat she’s an idiot? I mean, I know this column is called Ask Hadley, but it’s hard to know how to answer this question, at least without being blatantly rude. To recap, Parker was interviewed in Marie Claire and was asked if she considers herself a feminist. “I am not a feminist,” she replied, to the sound of a million heads falling on the desk. “I’m so tired of separation. I just want people to be treated equally.”You know, when Andrea Leadsom said something similar last month, I honestly didn’t mind. “I’m not a feminist because I’m not anti-men ... Feminism is a term that has been used to abuse men, so I don’t identify with it,” quoth Andrea, in the now infamous interview that ended up torpedoing her leadership bid. And the reason I didn’t mind is because I didn’t expect her to know better: she’s a Tory MP who looks like she hangs out at private golf clubs in Surrey. I never thought she would be up on her Dworkin. But SJP, for God’s sake. You live in Manhattan, you starred in a show that was in some ways a feminist landmark, you have – I assume – New York friends. How could you have got to the age of 51 and still be saying things like this without hitting yourself in the face? There’s nothing surprising about a celebrity saying something stupid – the truth is that most celebrities are stupid. But for a woman who grew up in the 70s, lives in a modern metropolitan city and hangs out with writers and artists to not understand that feminism is about equality, well, that takes some serious effort. Well done, SJP. You win the coveted crown of Ask Hadley’s Numpty of the Month.
