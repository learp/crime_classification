Recycling is a bit like fitness. The moment you stop putting in the effort, you lose your muscle.This was on my mind as I watched microwavable black plastic containers whizzing up a conveyer belt at a recycling depot in Kent. This is progress. Innovation in plastic chemistry means these trays can now be recycled.Most people assume all this is recyclable. Sorry, no. Insurmountable issues include grease mixed with paper (pizza boxes), plastic mixed with paper (laminated pouches, coffee cups, sandwich wrappers) and a lack of market to sell the material on to.But technical barriers are being overcome: recyclingtechnologies.co.uk has developed chemical recycling using a thermal cracking process for oil-based plastics, while simplycups.co.uk can separate paper from plastic wax in disposable coffee cups, and even has a market for the paper.So if we’ve solved how to recycle these persistent offenders, why can’t we do it? Because these schemes are too small to make a dent in our consumption.By 2050, it’s estimated that there’ll be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Old-style eco advice would say we shouldn’t be eating microwavable meals in the first place. And this is a fair point. As is avoiding plastic packaging and upcycling more.These strategies alone will not stop the packaging mountains. We must beef up our capacity. The UK only managed to reprocess one third of our plastic waste last year. The rest disappeared abroad.So is there any point in continuing to be vocal about recycling? Yes absolutely, and copy me into your protest emails (as a reader did this week, when tackling Waitrose about its use of disposable coffee cups). It’s a slow, laborious process, but we need to keep the pressure on.The big picture: the Tiny House Movement      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Little gem: a tiny house built by Plymouth University students.When you scale back to this extent, it becomes possible to live off grid. This is one reason why, in the US, the Tiny House Movement has mushroomed, seemingly overnight. Here in the UK, we’ve been more restrained, but student architects from Plymouth University have produced this little gem. Its compact, bijoux nature is the very point, as is the fact that it has been produced using materials from the Dartington Hall estate, a landscape synonymous with sustainable living and cutting-edge architecture. Well dressed: the Secret Sari Project      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Summer style: vintage saris are turned into beautifully simple dresses by the Secret Sari projectBritish entrepreneur Fritha Vincent works with young women in safe houses in Mumbai and Bangalore. Rescued from sex traffickers, they are all awaiting court dates (which can take years). To give these women something to do that would improve their self-esteem and give them some income, Vincent devised the ‘Secret Sari’ project. Vintage saris are turned into simple summer dresses that unfurl from a small pocket. This follows on from her first project ‘Secret Pillow’, where economically challenged women make pillows that unfurl into blankets and sell for £45, of which £15 goes to the maker. In the future Vincent expects that the women in India will run their own producer networks by training other women in their own communities. Until then, Vincent and her team will continue to give them a helping hand.
