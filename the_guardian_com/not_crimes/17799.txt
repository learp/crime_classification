Major Lazer will become the first major US act to play Cuba since the two countries began restoring frozen relations in July 2015. The DJ group will play a free show in Havana on 6 March, in front of the US Embassy.In a statement, the band’s Diplo said: “Cuba has such a powerful cultural impact all over the world and for me, especially growing up in Florida, it became one of the biggest cultural centres for music to evolve from. I was lucky enough to visit Cuba a few years back with my friends Calle 13 and during my four days there my mind was blown by the people, depth of culture and their way of life.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Watch Major Lazer & DJ Snake – Lean On.Major Lazer are also set to invite Cuban music students on to the stage with them during the show, which takes place at Tribuna José Martí. It will be staged two months before the Musicabana festival, which features Cuban musicians playing alongside artists from all over the world. In December 2014, US president Barack Obama announced that the embargoes imposed on Cuba during the 1960s would be relaxed, leading to free travel and eventually trade between the two countries.
