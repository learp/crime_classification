Organisers of a conference celebrating the best and brightest businesspeople in the north of England have issued a grovelling apology over lack of female representation.The two-day UK northern powerhouse conference in Manchester caused controversy after all 15 main speakers highlighted in a press release were men. Only 13 out of the 98 speakers over the two days are women.The event to be held on Monday and Tuesday charges delegates £450 to “network with the key players, potential business partners and stakeholders in the northern powerhouse economy”.Now organisers have been forced to apologise after resignations from its advisory boards and influential female figures in the north announcing that they would boycott the event.Keith Griffiths, managing director of UK Northern Powerhouse International Conference and Exhibition, will give a speech at the event pledging that there will be “no single-gender panels” at next year’s conference.'Northern powerhouse' event labelled 'embarrassing' over lack of women In an apology posted on the event’s website, Griffiths said the conference did not adequately “reflect the gender balance of the north” and in future this would be addressed. But critics say his apology has come far too late and is a complete U-turn from the conference organisers’ initial defiant response. Griffiths said: “I’d like to explain how we intend to address this issue in future and also to apologise that this year’s event does not reflect the gender balance of the north.“We understand the[northern powerhouse] can never fulfil its potential if we ignore half the population. As such, this conference must reflect the contribution of women and harness their ideas, their drive, their insight, for the good of everyone.“We have already started to work with key women leaders to understand how we make this happen.”In an email sent to some of those concerned by the lack of female representation, he finished with: “I hope this meets with your approval and please believe we will not allow this to happen again.”The apology comes after Mike Emmerich, a former Downing Street adviser, said that he had resigned from the advisory board of the conference due to concerns raised with him about the lack of female representation.He emailed event organisers on Wednesday night to raise concerns and said he received a somewhat resolute response completely contrary to Griffiths’ apology.Emmerich said: “I got a response back which said: ‘It is an important challenge, but it is the businesses who take part who select their spokespeople on the basis of their expertise, not us. It’s not our job to solve the wider problem and it is not our role to take a political stance.’“One of the problems with the north is that it does think like this and I resigned because I did not want to be associated with this stance.”Women plan 'Lass War' protest at northern powerhouse conference Meanwhile, Donna Hall, chief executive of Wigan council, said the apology was only issued after mounting pressure. Hall was not invited to speak at the event. Last year she was named the north of England’s most transformational leader at the inaugural Northern Power Women awards, set up to celebrate the region’s talented women.She said: “The privately organised event is focused on men, transport and property with no mention of people, skills or communities. It doesn’t reflect what we are trying to achieve in the northern powerhouse. No women on the agenda is just part of this.“Following an initially defensive stance, the company have realised they need to formally apologise for their actions, but only after they had been encouraged to do so by male leaders in the system. We have boycotted events with no diversity on the panel and will continue to do so until they finally get it.”Hall went on to boycott another conference to discuss prison reform in the UK as there were also no female representations at that event.

Are only men involved in prison reform work?”Female speakers not deemed worthy of inclusion in the press release for the northern powerhouse conference include Judith Blake, leader of Leeds city council, and Anne Longfield, children’s commissioner for England, who is speaking about a project she is running on growing up in the north.Chaired by the Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys, the conference will include keynote speeches by Andrew Percy, minister for the northern powerhouse, and Lord Kerslake, chair of the UK Northern Powerhouse advisory board.Meanwhile, in response to the the lineup at the northern powerhouse conference, Jo Miller, president of Solace, a society of local government senior managers, has written to all of its 1,800 members asking them to call out single-gender panels.
