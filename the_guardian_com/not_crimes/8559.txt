When you risk your life fishing in crocodile-infested waters, a stiff drink on dry land may seem like a welcome relief. But in a sleepy town in Uganda it has given rise to a culture with staggering rates of HIV.In Kasensero, near the border with Tanzania, 43% of the population live with HIV, compared with 7% nationally. For a man seeking a sex worker, the rates of infection are inevitably far higher. The town of 10,000 people has another dubious distinction: it is where the country's first Aids cases were diagnosed in the 1980s.Exhausted from a night on Lake Victoria, fishermen come off the boats as the first rays of light glimmer at dawn. Once their catch is sold and nets untangled, some go home to their families, but most head for Kasensero's bars and the sex workers who hang out there."The fishing communities along the shore are the places with the highest HIV prevalence rates in the country," says Dr Raymond Byaruhanga, at the Aids information centre in Kampala, the Ugandan capital. "The mindset of the fishermen is to say: 'One day my boat will overturn and I will die. Therefore there's no need to be scared of HIV, it will take several years to kill me.'""Most of the fishermen are interested only in drinking and in women," says Josua Mununuzi, who owns four boats.During his 10-year career, nothing has changed, he says, except the faces of the prostitutes lurking in the narrow streets, where the stench of urine mingles with the smell of rotting rubbish.The bumper wages earned by fishermen in the town attract sex workers from surrounding communities, says Kato Francis, a doctor at Kasensero's rundown hospital.Sex workers typically stay in the town for a few months, often during the peak fishing season. They return home with some savings – and very often HIV. The going rate for sex is just $2 (£1.20) – or up to $3 for a highly prized prostitute.Like most of the sex workers in town, Sheyla lives in a tiny room close to the bars. Her surroundings are basic: underwear hangs up to dry in a corner of the room and condoms are scattered on a bench, while a small bed with mosquito netting dominates half the room.She arrived in Kasensero from Kampala two months ago, and says her clients regularly ask for sex without a condom. She says she always refuses, but most of her colleagues do not. "A friend of mine had sex with a man and when she took the condom off he was bleeding," she says. "I'm scared of that."  Lamola, 29, is one of Kasensero's sex workers, many of whom do not use condoms.The perilous waters near Kasensero are part of the reason why local fishermen seek prostitutes, says Mununuzi. Lake Victoria, which for centuries has been a vital resource for the millions of people in Uganda, as well as Kenya and Tanzania, is teeming with crocodiles and hippos. Storms are frequent around the lake and a wave can easily overturn the typically flimsy fishing boats. Few fishermen can swim and none wear life jackets."It's so risky going out on the lake, that when the fishermen come back they want to spend their money exactly as they wish," Munzuni says. "They know they could die the next day, so they don't bother to make plans for the future."Ugandan authorities say animal attacks, inadequate fishing equipment and unpredictable weather kills approximately 5,000 people on the lake each year.Apolinari Yousters, 57, has fished in Kasensero for the past 20 years. Three years ago he was diagnosed HIV positive. He says he has no idea when he became infected, but suspects he contracted the virus from prostitutes or bar girls.Several aid agencies have set up camp in Kasensero in recent years to work on issues related to Aids, Francis says, but "changes have been few and far between".The flow of sex workers, traders and fishermen makes it difficult to follow up on and treat patients, Byaruhanga says.Sheyla says she has big plans for the future. With an average of five clients a day, she has saved enough money to buy a small plot in another town, where she hopes to build a house. But for many of her peers, and the fishermen that visit them, the outlook is bleak.
