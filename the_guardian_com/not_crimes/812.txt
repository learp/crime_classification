I don’t know where the urgency comes from to do all those things, it’s just out of my hands.”He also discussed his attachment to hard work and professional discipline, saying: “The way I work is a lot of work, and it may be standard for many singers to do a six-day week, but for me and the way I work it’s too much. ‘Cos I’m singing every song and really SINGING.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The official video for We’re in This Love Together.In a 2014 interview with the Arizona Republic, Jarreau discussed his crossover tendencies.“I grew up in Milwaukee,” he said, “and I took it all in. I want it all. Don’t cut me off at the pass and say I can’t listen to Muddy Waters because I’m a jazzer. Or I can’t listen to Garth Brooks because I’m a jazzer. Get out of here.”Music was not always his focus. Jarreau was an athlete who earned a master’s degree in vocal rehabilitation and started his career as a counselor in San Francisco, playing jazz on the side. He did not record his first album until he was 35.“His second priority in life was music,” read a statement on the singer’s website on Sunday. “There was no third. His first priority, far ahead of the other, was healing or comforting anyone in need.”The statement on his Facebook page asked admirers to donate to the Wisconsin Foundation for School Music, “a wonderful organization which supports music opportunities, teachers, and scholarships for students in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin”.Jarreau is survived by his wife, Susan, and a son, Ryan. On Thursday, according to a statement on Facebook, his son reported “that he caught his dad singing Moonlighting to one of the nurses yesterday!”
