The late Brian Sewell, renowned as an acid-penned art critic, has left a tender painting to the National Gallery in London, a place he loved so much he once said he wanted to have his ashes mixed with bird food and scattered on its front steps.Maternal Affection, a glowing painting on copper by the French artist Louis-Jean-François Lagrenée, has been hung beside works by other French 18th-century artists including Jean-Honoré Fragonard, François Boucher and Jean-Antoine Watteau. Although there are works by Lagrenée in the collections of the Bowes Museum and Stourhead, this is the first on public display in a national collection.Brian Sewell obituary The director of the gallery, Gabriele Finaldi, said: “Brian Sewell had a profound love for the National Gallery as well as a connoisseur’s passion for lesser-known masters. It is especially pleasing that Lagrenée’s beautiful and refined Maternal Affection, which he owned, has come to the gallery as a gift from his estate.”Sewell, who was born in London in 1931, and died in September 2015, said in an interview: “As a child there was not a major museum or art gallery in London I didn’t know, and the National Gallery was my favourite,” and he continued to pay weekly visits to Trafalgar Square for most of his life.
