The Chinese assimilatorDreamworks’ Kung Fu Panda series reportedly caused some grumbling in China about its appropriation of local mythology. But not only is it increasingly successful there, the country is becoming the financial bedrock of the franchise. Number three in the series this weekend opened bigger in China ($58.3m, a record for animation in a country lukewarm on the genre) than in the US ($41.3m). Cleaving to the typical franchise decay curve in America, the new instalment has all the momentum in China, where, in a first for the series, it was developed as a full co-production. That meant that Dreamworks knew about the release date further in advance, allowing it to finesse its marketing better; the film gets to stay in cinemas longer than the 30 days allowed for foreign imports; and the company gets to keep a larger box-office share. Its new subsidiary, Oriental Dreamworks, reportedly honed the script and animation to better reflect local sensibilities and language, and recruited a top-notch voice cast to replace Jack Black and colleagues in the Chinese version: Jackie Chan and summer 2015’s local breakout star Bai Baihe are at the top of the list. With all that in its favour, Kung Fu Panda 3 should comfortably beat KFP2’s $92m Chinese haul, and will have the country’s $153m record for an animated film – held by last year’s Monkey King: Hero Is Back – in its sights. That level of performance is actually a must for the franchise: the US is predictably tailing off, while results from Russia and South Korea this week (Russia, KFP2: $15m; KFP3: $5.1m. South Korea, KFP2: $12.8m; KFP3: $11.4m) suggest that countries without China’s strong cultural stake could follow. A monster Chinese effort will be needed to keep Kung Fu Panda above the $600m mark earned globally by each of the first two parts. A strong hold in the US could see it hit a $700m+ high.The great black hope   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Creed – Guardian film show reviewTwelfth on the global chart, Creed has fallen short of Straight Outta Compton’s US take ($108.7m against $161.2m). But it is pulling ahead internationally ($51.7m against $40.3m), which may allow it to make up the difference. Both overseas tallies are encouraging for CGI-free dramas, and gently probe the received “wisdom” that black films don’t travel outside the US. Judging by the top territories for the likes of Compton and 12 Years a Slave – multicultural western countries such as the UK, France, Germany and Australia – then a market does exist. 12 Years a Slave, though, seems to have gone beyond this caucus, probably because of its clout as an Important Historical Document and its Oscars success. It over-performed in small territories such as Argentina ($1.2m) and Norway ($1.9m), and took blockbuster-sized grosses in emerging strongholds such as Mexico ($5.5m), on its way to a final $131.1m overseas. Promisingly for Creed, it’s also showing signs of having reach beyond the expected locales; being part of the Rocky franchise, with Stallone a powerfully nostalgic presence at the heart of the film, must help. Italy ($5.7m) and Japan ($3.3m) currently feature in the top five territories, and in Mexico this week it opened higher than 12 Years a Slave ($1m against 681K). Italy finished third overseas for 2006’s Rocky Balboa, the only other Rocky film for which we have full data, so there might be some specific Italian-American factor there. As for the assumed international bias against black drama, though, it is perhaps less significant than the general difficulties of putting out mid-budget fare these days. The same goes for black films as for anything else: quality and astute branding can make all the difference.Mid-term reports   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Big Short – Guardian film show reviewThe Force Awakens is some $17m short of becoming the third film ever, after Titanic and Avatar, to cross the $2bn mark worldwide, but it is now flagging badly after a light-speed first month. Its $1.09bn overseas total can be read, in context, as a disappointment – slightly below what the far less celebrated Fast & Furious 7 took last year. The UK ($176.4m), China ($121.1m), Germany ($106.1m), France ($86.3m) and Japan ($83.3m) clock in as the top five territories. That’s a slight reshuffling of the order for the prequels: Japan dropping and an unsurprising new entry for China. The credit-crunch drama The Big Short is showing great consistency – dropping just 5.6% on its seventh wide-release weekend in the US, and showing similar stamina elsewhere, its $28m budget should mean it winds up as one of the most profitable awards-contenders of the season. $102.7m worldwide and counting means it’s already several multiples in profit, unlike The Revenant – which has snatched a superlative $274.4m but is hobbled by a $135m spend. One film that won’t be showing up at the Oscars is Michael Bay’s Clinton-baiting Libyan embassy flick 13 Hours, which is just commencing its overseas rollout. Taking $1.5m abroad, to put it 13th on the global rankings, it held up tolerably in south-east Asia this weekend. But a 320K UK debut is truly abject, and suggests Bay may be best off separating politics – or at least pretensions to seriousness – and work. The Fraternal Order of Police have been giving Quentin Tarantino similar advice, but it’s doubtful the director’s stance on police brutality is why The Hateful Eight is struggling financially. $112.3m worldwide is easily his weakest showing since Reservoir Dogs, though the film may eventually surpass the second volume of Kill Bill. The daft decision to open against Star Wars, those middling reviews, and a general sense that the director is repeating himself seem to have taken their toll. After The King’s Speech ($410.9m) and Les Misérables ($441.8m), fellow box-office heavy-slugger Tom Hooper is also checking his expectations with transsexual-pioneer drama The Danish Girl. He surely knew the subject matter was less commercial and, about halfway through its rollout, $34.5m worldwide confirms it. The Danish Girl also seems to be slipping behind The Revenant, The Big Short and Spotlight in the awards conversation, too.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Beyond HollywoodThere is an unusual Brazilian entry, at 17th on the global chart with $5m, for The Ten Commandments. Adapted from a local telenovela, the film puts a distinctly South American gloss on BC Nile-valley messianism. Three-million ticket pre-sales – five times what The Force Awakens managed in the country – are testament to the influence of evangelical Christianity there. But such a specialised-audience gig isn’t perhaps the overall boost that the Brazilian film industry could do with. For a country of its size, Brazil doesn’t produce as many films as it should, and it struggles to get more than one homegrowner in the annual top 10. But The Ten Commandments is still a local success story, and the likeliest contender to match the favela actioner Elite Squad 2’s $62.9m from 2010 – the current national record. The Ten Commandments: film set to be biggest box office hit in Brazil history Italian odd-couple comedy L’Abbiamo Fatta Grossa, taking $3.8m for 18th place, has the unenviable task of following up January’s bureaucracy caper Quo Vado? – which, hovering near the $70m mark, almost certainly became the country’s highest grossing film ever, this weekend. The final non-Hollywood entry, at 21st globally with $3m, was the Chinese actioner Lost in the Pacific. Vincent Zhou’s film adds to the soon-to-be-exploding sub-genre of cheapo Chinese-US collaborations, alongside the likes of Nicolas Cage’s Outcast. The one-time Superman Brandon Routh and Stephen Chow collaborator Zhang Yuqi team up as passengers aboard a marooned airplane, in what looks like the cross-cultural orphan of Lost and Titanic. But probably not as successful.The futureAnother wan winter weekend looms, with no major new worldwide releases, then Chinese new year – and a barrage of blockbusting local titles – dropping a day later on 8 February. The Coen brothers’ studio-era Hollywood comedy Hail, Caesar! heads out in the US, ahead of a Berlin film-festival bow and limited European opening. With their starriest ensemble in a while, headed by their “Numbskull trilogy” collaborator George Clooney, it has the potential to do $150m-plus: the range occupied by 2008’s Burn After Reading. The brothers’ biggest ever grosses are still for the more dour, more manly likes of True Grit ($252.3m) and No Country for Old Men ($171.6m).    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Lionsgate’s Pride and Pride and Zombies will open in a seemingly random selection of initial territories – the US, Brazil, Italy, Bulgaria and the Philippines – presumably chasing a slightly more female slant on the mashup-savvy demographic drawn to 2012’s Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter ($116.4m worldwide). And proving that the Brits can climb aboard the remake bandwagon as desperately as the Americans is Dad’s Army – pootling out on both sides of the Atlantic courtesy of Universal – with Bill Nighy and the Joneses Toby and Catherine-Zeta on antics duty.
