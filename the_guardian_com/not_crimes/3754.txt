For a non-baker (like me), a zero-energy cake used to mean one someone else made. But I’ve forced myself to recognise the footprint of shop-bought croissants and cream puffs. It’s no joke. First, there are obviously the giant ovens devouring energy, then there’s industrial baking’s reliance on palm oil, too. A new report highlights the devastating impact of the continued march of palm oil monocultures. A further ingredient is bread miles: in the UK an estimated 130m extra road miles are caused by getting “fresh” bread into stores.Home baking gives you some control. But a homemade cake still has an impact. Research from the Centre for Alternative Technology highlighted the impact of the eggs (1.8kg of CO2 per box) and the 350 ears of wheat it takes for one loaf.What we’ve tended to overlook traditionally is the energy footprint of the actual baking. Until now. This is the sort of energy use (and expense) that the next generation of smart meters (there’s a nationwide roll-out by 2020) makes explicit in cold, hard currency. Ultimately these meters banish the whole farce of estimated bills and ridiculous uncertainty in energy consumption that we’ve lived with for too long.The prodigiously talented 2015 Bake Off finalist Ian Cumming is an early adopter. He’s been using one of the new meters to get a grip on his oven and has developed a series of low-energy baking recipes in response. They also tell you the actual energy cost of baking (as a smart meter does). So feta and spinach buns will cost you 5p in energy use but Welsh cakes just 2p. I like the recipes because I feel he’s demystifying energy and baking in one fell swoop. And there’s not a soggy bottom in sight.The big picture: electric aircraft      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   On the quiet: an artist’s image of Nasa’s X-57 hybrid electric research plane, with its 14 electric motors turning the propellers.

As Nasa unveils the X-57, dubbed the Tesla of the skies, green travel gets interesting. So far the all-electric model is only a four-seater, so it’s presumably a while before budget airlines swap aviation fuel (the annual fuel bill for global aviation is £88bn) for electric.Well dressed: Holi studio coats and jackets      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Quality time: Holi Studios, in CambodiaVolunteering in Cambodia in 2011, Leah Rodrigues watched as NGOs ran sewing programmes for local women – who were then drafted into sweatshops. So she started Holi Studios, in Siem Reap, employing mostly former sweatshop workers who now have, mostly for the first time, decent working conditions, career opportunities, holiday entitlement and a wage they can live on. Holi produces an eponymous collection of coats and jackets and beachwear for Lilliput & Felix and sells at Avenue 32. The studio never outsources. “This is the only way we can ensure the safety of our team and rigorous quality control,” says Rodrigues, who trains staff for six to 12 months (almost unheard of in the garment industry). “The industry will only change,” she says, “when we place value on the skills needed to make clothing.” The Holi coats and jackets collection starts from £275 (sale price).Email Lucy at lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @lucysiegle
