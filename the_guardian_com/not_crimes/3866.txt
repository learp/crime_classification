Around 3,500 Severn Trent customers in Derbyshire have been advised not to use their water supply because of abnormal chlorine levels.The utility said in a statement that residents in the DE11, DE65 and DE73 postcodes should not use their water supply at all until further notice.Severn Trent said it had issued the statement as a precautionary measure while it investigated “a problem with higher than normal levels of chlorine” at a service reservoir.The statement added: “This means that customers affected should not use the water supply at all.“We’re sorry for the inconvenience this will cause and we’re working hard to isolate the problem and get everything back to normal as quickly as possible.”
