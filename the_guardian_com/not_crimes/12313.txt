England must urgently improve its recycling rates if it is to reach European Union targets by 2020, according to one of Britain’s biggest waste companies.David Palmer-Jones, the chief executive of Suez recycling and recovery in the UK, said England is trailing behind the EU after new figures show there has only been a marginal increase in recycling in England over the last two years.The Regional Household recycling rates, published today by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), reveal that the rate of recycling in English households from March 2014 to March 2015 was 44.7% - an increase of 0.5% since 2013.The EU target is for the UK to recycle at least 50% of its waste by 2020.Recycling rates have actually dropped in London and the East Midlands, where there have been declines of 0.8% and 1.2% respectively.The drop represents London’s second successive decline, and Palmer-Jones said greater focus is needed in these areas of high population.He said: “For the UK to achieve its agreed EU target of 50% recycling rates for household waste, England has to improve its performance and Suez believes this is still possible provided some key changes are taken in the way waste is collected at the doorstep.“Greater focus is needed within large urban areas, such as Greater London and parts of the Midlands which have at best remained static or at worst showed significant declines in recycling over the past two years.Household recycling rates in Wales show a continual year-on-year improvement and reached a new high of 56.2%.Palmer-Jones added: “Wales has shown the rest of the UK that reaching, and now comfortably surpassing, the key 50% EU target is eminently achievable once clear coherent strategy is put in place from the top down.”Recycling rates in England have stalled The figures also show that the rate of recycling has increased by 1.3% in the South East, 0.9% in the North West and 0.9% in the South West. They have dropped by 0.1% in the North East and 0.3% in Yorkshire and Humber. Rates remain unchanged in the Eastern region and the West Midlands.A Defra spokesman said: “These latest figures show the amount of waste going to landfill fell 20% last year, and the waste from households recycling rate was up on last year. This reflects hard work by local authorities and a desire from people to recycle more.“We remain committed to building on this success and recycling 50% of our household waste by 2020 and will continue to support local authorities’ and Wrap’s (Waste and Resources Action Programme) efforts to promote recycling.”
