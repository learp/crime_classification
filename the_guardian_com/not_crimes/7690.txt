The recipePut 2 tbsp of groundnut oil into a large mixing bowl, stir in 2 peeled and finely crushed cloves of garlic, 35g of grated ginger, 1 tbsp of soft brown sugar, 3 tbsp each of light soy sauce, rice wine and white miso paste. Mix thoroughly.Place 450g of chicken meat into the marinade and toss briefly, then set aside for at least 30 minutes. Toss the meat and marinade every 15 minutes or so. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.Tip the chicken into a roasting tin, leaving behind most of its marinade, and roast for 25 minutes or until it is golden and sizzling.Cut 250g of broccoli into short lengths. Roughly chop a couple of spring onions, then finely chop a red chilli and 2 cloves of garlic. Heat 2 tbsp of groundnut oil in a wok then add the garlic, onion and chilli. Fry briefly – the garlic should just start to turn nut brown – then add the broccoli and cook for 3 minutes till crisp and tender.Toss the roasting chicken pieces with the sizzling greens and serve. Enough for 2-3.The trickGet the marinade made, then add the chicken and leave it to one side for anything up to 24 hours. Drain the meat of most of its marinade before roasting, then, once the chicken is cooked, remove, pour the reserved marinade into the roasting tin and bring to the boil, then use it to dress the chicken and broccoli.The twistI used tenderstem broccoli, but there is some very fine-looking purple sprouting about, too – it needs a little more care when frying as the florets can break up. Alternatively, use cavolo nero, cut into short lengths.Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
