The first full trailer for Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie has Edina and Patsy on the run in France after possibly killing Kate Moss.What next for the Weinsteins and why The Huntsman bombed – the Dailies film podcast Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley reprise their roles as the champagne-drinking fashionistas for the first time in four years, while the film brings back the sitcom’s other co-stars Julia Sawalha and Jane Horrocks.The trailer also shows off a long list of celebrity cameos, including Jon Hamm, Rebel Wilson, Stella McCartney, Gwendoline Christie, Lily Cole and Moss herself. Other stars set to make an appearance include Joan Collins, Perez Hilton and Jeremy Paxman.The original TV series was first broadcast in 1992 and continued for five seasons, also inspiring a French film called Absolument Fabuleux, starring Nathalie Baye and with a cameo from Saunders herself.Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie has been in development for about five years, with Saunders saying she would do the film for no other reason than to have the two characters walk the red carpet at the premiere.The production has already been subject to controversy, when it was announced that Krankies comedian Janette Tough would be playing a Japanese man called Huki Muki. “I love AbFab but #YELLOWFACE is something I cannot watch – I just can’t,” Korean American comic Margaret Cho tweeted. “It’s sad when heroes are no longer heroic. Too bad. #racism.”Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie will be released in UK cinemas on 1 July
