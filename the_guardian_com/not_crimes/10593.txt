Kylie Minogue and her British fiance would love to tie the knot in Australia, but will not do so until marriage equality is achieved.The pair want to get married in Melbourne, says Minogue’s partner, UK actor Joshua Sasse.“There are chances of a Melbourne wedding ... [but] we will not get married until this law has passed in Australia,” Sasse told Network Seven from Vancouver on Thursday.Margot Robbie backs Australian marriage equality on Saturday Night Live Minogue and Sasse, 28, are fighting for same-sex marriage to be legalised in Australia, after Sasse launched the “Say I Do Down Under” campaign at the weekend.“When I found out that gay marriage was illegal in Australia, I was astounded,” he said.“I simply can’t fathom on any level, whether it’s moral or religious or anything, that I have the right to get married and to marry the person that I love and that somebody else doesn’t because of their sexual orientation.”The Turnbull government has proposed a plebiscite on marriage equality.The Australian actress Margot Robbie supported the campaign by wearing a T-shirt on the US’s Saturday Night Live at the weekend.Minogue, 48, has previously said how “backward” Australia is about marriage equality, saying “the Earth didn’t cave in” in other countries where it is legal and that “love is love”.
