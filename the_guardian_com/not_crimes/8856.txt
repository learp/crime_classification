Vomit tux      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Come, friendly bombs, and fall on these plums. Photograph: GettyThe school leavers’ prom was once a US phenomenon that British teens had never experienced, like corn dogs or country music. If the Guide had been asked to review going to the prom back when it was just something we’d only ever seen in John Hughes films, this would probably be quite a favourable write-up. With the notable exception of Carrie, the movies made it look pretty fun: homecoming kings and queens, corsages, speeches, jocks and nerds alike coexisting over punch.But when disco fever hit our shores around a decade ago it lost its sheen – comps and private schools alike a Moss Bros-sponsored hotbed of fake tan, limos and 16-year-olds aggressive-grinding to Sean Paul. Like most things that eventually cross the Atlantic - Five Guys, Top Model, braces - prom had seemed more glamorous at a distance. Perhaps something about its glitzy optimism just jars with the cynical British way of life, but it just doesn’t work. I say this entirely objectively, as someone whose prom date definitely didn’t ditch her after an hour to skulk away to a Wetherspoons. 3/10HJD      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Kevin Costner’s disdain for regional dialects      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘I love the smell of arrows’ – Kevin Costner, 1991. Photograph: Allstar/WarnersIt’s amazing to think that, in 1991, an unwatchable romp like Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves became the second highest-grossing film of the year. Especially considering that its titular swashbuckling hero a) had a mullet, b) did not sound in the least bit English and c ) was played by All-American (And Unfeasibly Tanned) Sweetheart, Kevin Costner. It is, in 90s terms, the equivalent of letting Channing Tatum play King Arthur.At least Tatum would have tried to nail the accent thing, because surely this sort of horror-voice is banned in 2016. I’ve consciously avoided Costner’s epic ever since I thought that Bryan Adams on TOTP would never, ever end. Watching some choice scenes back, though, it’s clear that instead of gently taking Costner aside and having a quiet word about his lines, they simply let him go ahead and pronounce them as he pleased.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Now, we know that, traditionally, Hollywood cares very little for historial accuracy, but Costner didn’t even try to “go a bit Nottingham”. His Robin Hood may as well have been lasooing bears in Montana. The only thing it sounds like is smug, as he woos Maid Marian by stepping out of a waterfall half-naked. It’s an F for effort on enunciation; by the sound of his accent alone, if we rewound history and got to the bottom of the myth, then Robin Hood would actually be Kevin Costner.But while it’s easy to have a pop at his and his mulleted mouth-meandering, Costner’s English accent is, unbelievably, not the worst offender. Cast your memory back to Christian Slater in that same film, Keanu Reeves as Dracula, who sounds like he’s having a very stiff seizure, Don Cheadle’s cockney in Ocean’s 11 (comedy gold) and Shia LaBeouf in Nymphomaniac (supposedly aiming for Brit bastard but instead creating a curious bespoke intonation called “Beouf”). Imagine if they all did one of those ensemble films set in Victorian London. Actually, don’t.A generous: 2/10 KHDeeply unprofessional ticketryWhen I was five I was in Sheffield Children’s Hospital with a virus and I remember there being a nurse there who hummed Somewhere Over The Rainbow as she went about her business. I can recall it as vibrantly as if she were here now, next to me, doing my head in. Of all the creative compound swear words and Wham! atrocities she could have uttered to pass her day, she chose that. She was like an angel. This was my first experience of someone going above and beyond the call of duty, for no reason other than because they cared, and because they wanted, however they could, to make you feel just a tiny bit better. Which brings us to this ticket. And the twee-as-Innocent smoothies train-gorp who scribbled on it. Instead of doing their job properly like someone whose face you wouldn’t want to slap until it melted, they tried to do what that nurse did. To cheer someone up a bit. And, as feckless spanners will always, always do, they failed, and failed hard.The eyes are smudged, which either suggests poor technique or poor stationery. Either is unforgivable. Both together suggests the work of someone who says “hollibobs” and leaves Facebook statuses like “some people say there you’re friend and are just out for wot they can get LOL” . Look at it. The nose runs into the left eye (their left, stage left). Imagine if you saw a person in the street whose nose went into their eye. You’d drop one. The mouth, too, curls far too highly into a realm reserved exclusively for the ears. What this person has drawn is an abomination against biology. Against form. Plus, the asterisk on the top lip suggests a cold sore. And herpes never goes away. Just ask your mum etc. If, David M Barnett, it weren’t for the fact you’re travelling from Leeds – and so there’s a chance you’re from Yorkshire and are therefore brilliant – you’d be staring down the business end of a violently reluctant 2/10. But, despite what the previous paragraphs may suggest, I’m in a good mood today. I’m wearing a good shirt. It’s Friday. Soon I will be drunk.
