Controversial Russian political artist Pyotr Pavlensky was released this week after spending seven months in prison for setting fire to the door of the Federal Security Service in Moscow.He was convicted of damaging a cultural monument but, contrary to fears that he would be given a harsh jail term, was sentenced with a fine of about £5,500. As the judge finished reading the sentence on Wednesday, the courtroom erupted in applause. Speaking outside the courthouse the artist thanked his supporters and said: “It does not matter how the trial ended. What is important is the fact that we were able to unmask, uncover the truth: the government is founded on the methods of terror.”The artist, who has gained notoriety through his wince-inducing performances – including nailing nailing his scrotum to Red Square – spoke to journalist Dmitry Volchek about his time in custody and his plans for the future.‘Every day I clashed with police surveillance’What did you learn over your seven months in prison about the Federal Security Service (FSB), the organisation whose door you set on fire?Petr Pavlensky: I saw the machine from the inside, the enormous police clot. I saw in concentrated form the surveillance service, all the mechanisms for breaking a personality, the mechanisms of compulsion, the bureaucratic rituals. I saw the cult of the bureaucracy and the religion that has grown up around that cult. Every day I clashed with police surveillance. It is a permanent conflict. It isn’t diffused, but rather is concentrated and one must be on the lookout all the time for this machine from the inside. Peep holes. Cameras. Microphones. Constant searches – all of this is a constant effort to seek out and find one’s vulnerable spot. And prison is a laboratory.  The process of determining the limits of political art is still going on. Even in prison, that did not stopPetr Pavlensky Later you can see the same thing in so-called life at liberty. The same mechanisms, the same methods of control and compulsion that have proven effective in prison are used on the masses.As far as the FSB is concerned, in my view the most significant thing is this organisation has been methodically destroying our culture for nearly 100 years now, while at the same time having the gall to publicly declare itself a cultural monument. Your verdict, according to many, is little short of a miracle. How did you manage it?Pavlensky: Well, what really happened? The court just converted the measure of guilt and punishment into a financial amount. If you remember, for instance, the case of [19th-century French artist and revolutionary] Gustave Courbet, the government also tortured him by means of money. And in his case, this turned out to be just as effective as the guillotine.Why did they choose this punishment? It is a bid to sway public opinion. If the government had granted my request and recharged me with terrorism, then its true face would have been exposed and it would have stood in the light of truth. But [...] the apparatus shamefully continues to hide behind the mask.Do you think the machine is invulnerable, or can it be destroyed or resisted?Pavlensky: No, it can’t be destroyed. But it can be influenced, if we all try to influence it at once. That depends on the personal responsibility of each one of us. What were you reading while you were in prison?A nailed scrotum and the FSB set ablaze: Petr Pavlensky's life in art Pavlensky: [Italian philosopher] Giorgio Agamben, [French philosopher and critic Michel] Foucault, [French philosopher and critic] Roland Barthes, [Czech playwright, dissident, and politician] Vaclav Havel, and the memoirs of [Ukrainian anarcho-communist] Nestor Makhno.Some of your supporters are saying they hope your next piece of political art will be something grandiose. Are you planning something like that?Pavlensky: I don’t have any plans, honestly. I don’t know what will happen next week or in two weeks or in a month. So I can’t say. The process of determining the limits and the forms of political art is still going on. Even in prison, that did not stop.A version of this article first appeared on RFE/RL
