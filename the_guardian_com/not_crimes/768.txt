What’s your musical guilty pleasure?I listen to a wide range of music, everything from Mahler through to Taylor Swift. I don’t feel guilty about any of it!What was the last piece of music you bought? I think it was Brickhouse by The Commodores. I must have heard it somewhere, a few clicks on iTunes and that was that! Before that, I bought everything Frank Sinatra did with Count Basie and his orchestra. Nothing beats it.How do you mostly listen to music?Most of my listening is done in the car where I can plug in my iPod, or while I’m on a plane. But when possible I like to relax at home and listen to something through a good pair of speakers with no distractions.What was the first ever record or cd you bought?   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The Benny Goodman Orchestra - Sing Sing SingThat’s a tough one. I think the first CD I remember buying was a compilation of Benny Goodman’s Greatest Hits. At the time the thought didn’t cross my mind about playing jazz myself. Goodman’s playing seemed so different from what I was used to so I just appreciated it for what it was. It wasn’t until many years later that I found that CD and it inspired me to explore jazz.Is applauding between movements acceptable?This, and the bigger discussion of audience etiquette, is hotly debated. There are many things that have become rules when going to a classical concert and I think they can put people off. I personally don’t mind it if there’s applause between movements. The audience are only showing their appreciation!What single thing would improve the format of the classical concert?Something that is very simple but that makes a big difference is when the musician talks to the audience. The atmosphere immediately changes, and the audience feels more relaxed. I don’t plan what I’m going to say when I’m on stage, which I think means it comes across as being more natural. What’s been your most memorable live music experience as an audience member?   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The one I will always remember was the Party at the Palace for the Queen’s Golden Jubilee in 2002. Some of the biggest names in British popular music took to the stage in front of a crowd of thousands; it took me a while to process that I myself had stood on that same stage and played the day before.We’re giving you a time machine: what period, or moment in musical history, would you travel to and why?    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Ella Fitzgerald - SummertimeIt would have to be one of two times. I would go back in time and sit down with either Brahms, Dvorák or Rachmaninov and just talk to them about music and how they approach the whole process of playing and composing. Other than that it would be back to the heyday of Ella Fitzgerald. I could listen to her on repeat for ever.Do you enjoy musicals? Do you have a favourite?When I was a kid, Stomp was a firm favourite. I wouldn’t say I had a favourite today. The most recent musical I saw was Wicked, next on my list is The Book of Mormon.Which conductor or performer of yester-year do you most wish you could have worked with? Claudio Abbado without a doubt. Everyone I speak to tells me that he had a instinct for music that is incredibly rare. To be able to work with someone like that would be amazing.

Photograph: AGF s.r.l./REXWhat is the best new piece written in the past 50 years?In the last couple of years I’ve really grown to appreciate Steve Reich’s music more and more. It’s incredibly clever writing and the sum of all the parts creates some really interesting sounds and lines. Recently I was fortunate enough to record New York Counterpoint, which was a great experience.If you found yourself with six months free to learn a new instrument, what would you choose?I would go back to the piano since I haven’t had the opportunity to play much these last few years. I’d try and learn jazz piano as well. And if not the piano, then I’d try singing.Which non-classical musician would you love to work with?There is a long list! One of those at the top is jazz legend Wayne Shorter, who in fact I’m lucky enough to be working with this year as he’s writing a concerto for me - it’s a dream come true. It would be pretty cool to work with a few people on the popular music scene - someone like Beyoncé would be top of that list.

(ie is there a warhorse whose appeal you really don’t relate to?)I wouldn’t say any piece is overrated as taste is a personal matter, and everyone’s opinion is valid. Even if I don’t particularly like a piece of music, I still find myself able to appreciate it for being well composed or well orchestrated. Imagine you’re a festival director here in London with unlimited resources. What would you programme - or commission - for your opening event? I’d put on a concert of a Symphonic Big Band. There would be a large string section and a really great big band. You are almost unlimited in the sounds you could make with those two together. You could really cross some musical boundaries and have a lot of fun doing it.It’s late, you’ve had a few beers, you’re in a Karaoke bar. What do you choose to sing?    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The first thing to come to mind would be Frank Sinatra. What do you sing in the shower? It tends to be whatever I was listening to just prior. So anything from Rachmaninoff to Jamiroquai.Julian Bliss’s recording - with the Carducci Quartet - of Brahms’s Clarinet Quintet and David Bruce’s Gumboots is out on Signum Records on 15 April. Bliss gives the world premiere of Wayne Shorter’s Clarinet Concerto at the Royal Festival Hall on 30 November.
