Indigenous prisoners in Victoria will be able to sell art they have produced in jail and keep the profits to support themselves upon release under an Australian-first scheme that the Victorian police and corrections minister, Wade Noonan, said would help reduce recidivism.Artist Jonathan Jones on Wiradjuri country: 'Everything is chained up' The scheme will be administered by Indigenous advocacy group the Torch, chaired by the former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett, which runs art and cultural classes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women in 12 of Victoria’s 14 adult prisons.The Torch will be allowed to sell artworks produced by its students, which are exhibited annually in Melbourne, and put the money in a trust to be accessed by the prisoners on release. Prisoners and their families can also apply to access the money earlier to cover healthcare, funeral, or education costs for family members.The chief executive of the Torch, Kent Morris, said the Indigenous community had been fighting to be able to sell paintings made on the inside for 40 years. He said it was a crucial pairing of economic development with cultural learning, which was necessary to give prisoners options for a life outside.“It creates the capacity for that person to come out and, if they want to, have the resources to leave that abusive relationship or leave that problematic community – leave whatever it is that’s causing them to offend,” Morris said.“At previous Confined exhibitions I probably could have sold 50% to 60% of the works on display on opening night, and that’s purely just because they are fabulous works of art.”Morris, a Kurnu Barkindji man, said the program was primarily about cultural healing and teaching Indigenous inmates, who may have a very broken connection to their family groups, the stories of their own language groups. Those stories are then repeated in the artwork, but they are also shared among the inmate’s family.“I think the healing process comes through the act of that cultural production, through that painting and telling that story,” he said. “There is a sense of healing through the telling of this story.”He said the benefit, even without the profits from selling a painting, was a change in the way that person was perceived, both by the community at large and by themselves. “One man said to me, ‘My family have been calling me the artist, the storyteller, whereas before I was the ex-offender, the criminal,’” Morris said.“It’s not really set up for people to come out and be an artist but the artistic community gives them the skills and support to get out there and make a difference in another area of their community.”Number of prisoners in New South Wales surges to record high of 12,000 Kennett got involved in 2014 after he tried to buy a painting by a prisoner that was exhibited at the annual Confined exhibition. He joined the board and began lobbying the Victorian government.In a statement released on Tuesday, Kennett said that because most people were in prison for crimes unrelated to their art, they could not be said to be benefiting from their crimes.Noonan told reporters on Tuesday that the government approved the proposal after a report from the Victorian ombudsman on the rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners recommended Indigenous prisoners be able to sell their artwork to support their transition back into the community.Indigenous people in Victoria are 13 times more likely to be jailed than non-Indigenous people, and more likely to return to prison.“This is really important in terms of assisting critically in those early days of transition out of prison where even a difference of $500 or $1,000 could be essentially the foundation for a shift away from crime or a reintroduction into that system,” Noonan said. Some form of Aboriginal art and culture program operates in every jurisdiction in Australia, but prisoners in Victoria have previously only been able to give their artwork away. A program allowing prisoners from Long Bay jail in New South Wales to sell their artwork at the adjacent Boom Gate Gallery began in 1992, but unlike The Torch program was not geared to all Indigenous prisoners in the state. Founder Sue Paull said prisoners were allowed to keep 85% of the profits.Djon Mundine, a Bandjalung man and well-known Aboriginal artist, ran an art program for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander prisoners at Goulburn supermax prison in New South Wales. He said he could have helped some prisoners sell their paintings into galleries. Dotted masterpieces from the tiny Aboriginal town of Papunya – in pictures “They were being paid some miniscule amount to be in the art program, I think it was $20 a week,” Mundine told Guardian Australia. “There must be ways to do more than that, otherwise people just fall back in.”Mundine said he would support the Torch program being rolled out across Australia. “That situation where they can only keep their money somewhere for when they get out – or they can give it to their relatives, their friends – that’s an incentive to rehabilitate in itself,” he said. “They can see something in their future.” • The Confined 7 exhibition will be held at the St Kilda Town Hall Gallery from 10 February to 9 March.
