Your wedding day is supposed to be one of the happiest days of your life, but what if it’s not? Getting married, while exciting, can also be incredibly stressful – especially for introverts who hate attention or those who experience anxiety.It’s something that BBC Great British Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain touches on in a new documentary about her life, The Chronicles Of Nadiya. Looking back on her marriage at the age of 19, she says: “My wedding day was one of the worst days of my life … You are literally on show and it’s something I was always really uncomfortable with.“It’s bizarre a bride is unhappy on her wedding day, when really she should be happy.”Others have talked about experiencing anxiety or panic attacks on their wedding day. The US journalist Scott Stossel wrote about this, saying: “Mercifully, the ceremony ends. Drenched in sweat, I walk down the aisle, clinging gratefully to my new wife … I’m pantomiming happiness. I’m smiling for the camera, shaking hands – and wanting to die.”But a wedding day can also become a bit of a disaster for other reasons, after all there’s a lot that can go wrong (from missed cake deliveries to ripped wedding dresses).
