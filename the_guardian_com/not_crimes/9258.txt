Simon Jenkins' article on wind turbines (We trash the landscape for the benefit of billionaires, 6 December) suggests a lack of knowledge on the subject. At various points in the article Jenkins claims that wind energy is not green, creates "almost no jobs", and that it doesn't matter where wind turbines are sited as they receive payment no matter the supply of wind. In fact, carbon payback of construction of wind occurs in three to six months, there are over 16,000 direct jobs and around 14,000 indirect jobs in the wind industry, and payments only occur for energy generated by wind turbines – not installed capacity. In a final piece of confusion, he states that offshore turbines are less efficient than onshore – despite them having a higher load factor, the generally accepted measurement for efficiency.Jenkins is clearly no fan of the look of wind turbines, but the majority of people are, and the debate should focus on the real facts. Wind energy works, and it is an important part of meeting our energy needs today and into the future.Maf SmithDeputy chief executive, RenewableUK• If wind turbines do not work, could Simon Jenkins explain how Denmark is a net exporter of electricity? If subsidies are such an evil, why does he not rail against the obscene amounts of our cash given to the nuclear industry, which has yet to finish a UK project on time, within budget and capable of generating its promised output? Rather than sending cash abroad, subsidies should be made available to communities wanting to put up their own turbine for local micro-generation projects to provide local cheaper power.Duncan GrimmondMarkington, North Yorkshire
