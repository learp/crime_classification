Body image issues are typically seen to mainly affect young women, but a survey by an advertising think-tank has found young men can have just as many insecurities.The survey by Credos of more than 1,000 secondary-school aged students, found 56% saw eating disorders as an issue for both genders and 55% would consider changing their diet to look better. What’s more, 23% said they believed there was a “perfect male body”. Despite this, over half of those surveyed found it hard to talk about their concerns with teachers – and 29% struggled telling parents. The biggest influences on young men to look good come from friends, social media, advertising and celebrities, according to the survey.We want to hear from young men about this, sharing with us your biggest worries and concerns.
