The New Zealand Herald reported that a man who answered the gate at the Hells Angels club did not know what Pokémon Go was and told players to “go talk to the police”.In a statement New Zealand police said: “Like anything we would remind people to be aware of their surroundings and be wary of visiting unfamiliar locations, or going on to private property in search of a cartoon character.” Lilia Alexander, who runs the Pokémon Go New Zealand Facebook fan page, has organised 21 nationwide events this coming Saturday for fans to hunt for the virtual creatures together.So far 10,000 people have said they will attend.“I think this game is a good step towards changing gaming towards a more social activity,” said Alexander. “People are getting exercise because of the game, and socialising because of the game, so that’s a great advancement, it is much healthier.”
