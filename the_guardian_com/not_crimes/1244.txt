Anyone might think this house was getting ready for a play or film this week. I have staying here one American producer, whose boyfriend is my actor son, who is also here, and the Australian actress who shares the house with me. But she would not say she was an actress, but an actor, and the others agreed with her. “We don’t say a writeress or a doctoress so why should we divide by sex people who act for a living?” I’m told. Refusing to divide the sexes is supposed to be good for the downtrodden females. But I’m not sure names make any difference. All nurses are called nurses – but you’d think they are mainly female. Yet when Christine Hancock was general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, she had to insist that official posts “must include at least a third women”. Refusing to divide the sexes is supposed to be good for the downtrodden females It is usually females who have to demand privileges that men have already got. In my lifetime we have wanted private areas for women, women’s pages in newspapers, schools as good as the boys have but not necessarily exactly like them, even parts in drama in countries where once traditionally only men could play.The whole history of women’s progress divides into two things: one in effect saying: “You have things that we have not;” and the other: “You make us do what you would want.” So we want to have our own way – in what we teach, in what we choose to do, and not just who we chose to love and marry but whether we marry at all. It’s not just that we can make our own decisions, but that we may have no interest in the same things; and we may strongly feel we don’t just want to follow what men do.So perhaps females who act today should prefer to have the same title as Sarah Siddons or Greta Garbo rather than that of any old bloke whose Western they may not even admire.What do you think?
