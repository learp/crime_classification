The Césars, France’s answer to the Oscars, is still reeling from the controversy ignited by the decision to invite Roman Polanski to act as president of the awards ceremony; now the nominations have been announced, two days after Polanski stepped down from the role.Leading the field with 11 nods each are Elle, the rape-revenge drama starring Isabelle Huppert, and Frantz, a period romance directed by François Ozon. Behind them on nine nominations is Slack Bay (AKA Ma Loute), a surreal comedy from Bruno Dumont.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Elle trailer: Isabelle Huppert stars in Paul Verhoeven’s noir thriller – exclusive videoElle, which sees nominations for Huppert and its Dutch director, Paul Verhoeven, has made considerable headway on the international festival and awards circuit, winning the best actress (drama) and best foreign film Golden Globes, as well as an Oscar nomination for best actress (though it failed to make the shortlist for best foreign film). Frantz, which chronicles the relationship between a German first world war widow and a mysterious Frenchman, has had a much quieter run, premiering at Venice (where Paula Beer won an acting award) and yet to be released in the US or UK.Divines, from first-time director Houda Benyamina, has put up an impressive showing, scoring seven nominations including two for acting, as well as best director for Benyamina. Acclaimed for its portrayal of alienated suburban youth, Divines won the Camera d’Or at Cannes and was picked up by Netflix.Six titles have made it into the best foreign language list, with Ken Loach’s Palme d’Or winner I, Daniel Blake arguably the favourite over Oscar-nominated Toni Erdmann and Kenneth Lonergan’s grief drama Manchester by the Sea.Divines director Houda Benyamina: 'It's better to make a film than a bomb' The winners will be revealed on 24 February in Paris. Alain Terzian, president of the Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma, which administers the Césars, expressed his dismay over the Polanski controversy, saying the director was “one of the world’s most critically acclaimed film-makers, and that’s the only thing which we should look at: a consideration of artists and their accomplishments”. With Polanski wanted in the US over a 1977 statutory rape charge, his participation in the Césars had been opposed by a number of women’s groups, including Osez le Féminisme (Dare Feminism), which had described the invitation as “shameful”.Full list of nominationsBest film Divines Elle Frantz The Innocents Slack Bay From the Land of the Moon Victoria Best director Houda Benyamina (Divines) Paul Verhoeven (Elle) François Ozon (Frantz) Anne Fontaine (The Innocents) Xavier Dolan (It’s Only the End of the World) Bruno Dumont (Slack Bay) Nicole Garcia (From the Land of the Moon) Best actress Judith Chemla (A Woman’s Life) Marion Cotillard (From the Land of the Moon) Virginie Efira (Victoria) Marina Fois (Faultless) Isabelle Huppert (Elle) Sidse Babett Knudsen (150 Milligrams) Best actor François Cluzet (Irreplaceable) Pierre Deladonchamps (The Son of John) Nicolas Duvauchelle (A Decent Man) Fabrice Luchini (Slack Bay) Omar Sy (Chocolat) Gaspard Ulliel (It’s Only the End of the World) Best supporting actress Nathalie Baye (It’s Only the End of the World) Valeria Bruni Tedeschi (Slack Bay) Anne Consigny (Elle) Déborah Lukumuena (Divines) Mélanie Thierry (The Dancer) Best supporting actor Gabriel Arcand (The Son of John) Vincent Cassel (It’s Only the End of the World) Vincent Lacoste (Victoria) Laurent Lafitte (Elle) Melvil Poupaud (Victoria) James Thiérrée (Chocolat) Best new actress Oulaya Amamra (Divines) Paula Beer (Frantz) Lily-Rose Depp (The Dancer) Noémie Merlant (Heaven Will Wait)Raph (Slack Bay) Best new actor Jonas Bloquet (Elle) Damien Bonnard (Staying Vertical) Corentin Fila (Being 17) Kacey Mottet Klein (Being 17) Niels Schneider (Dark Inclusion)Best foreign film Aquarius Graduation The Unknown Girl Manchester By the Sea I, Daniel Blake  Toni Erdmann Best original screenplayDivinesThe Acquatic EffectThe Innocents Slack BayVictoria Best adapted screenplayElle150 MilligramsFrantzMy Life As a CourgetteFrom the Land of the MoonHeal the Living Best documentary  Dernières Nouvelles du CosmosFire at SeaThanks Boss!SwaggerJourney Through French Cinema Best first film The Fabulous Patars The Dancer Dark Inclusion Divines Rosalie Blum  Best original scoreChocolatIn the Forests of SiberiaElleFrantzMy Life As a Courgette Best soundChocolatElleFrantzFrom the Land of the MoonThe Odyssey Best editingDivinesElleFrantzIt’s Only the End of the WorldFrom the Land of the Moon Best cinematographyElleFrantzThe InnocentsSlack BayFrom the Land of the Moon Best costumesThe DancerFrantzFrom the Land of the MoonSlack BayA Woman’s Life Best animated film The Girl Without Hands My Life As a Courgette The Red Turtle Best animated short  Cafe Froid Celui Qui a Deux Ames Journal AniméPeripheria Best short After Suzanne Au Bruit des Clochettes Chasse Royale Mamans Vers la Tendresse
