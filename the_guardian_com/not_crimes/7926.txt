The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has pulled the plug on the controversial plan for a garden bridge across the Thames, announcing that he would not provide the vital financial guarantees needed for construction to begin.In a letter to the Garden Bridge Trust, the charity leading the much-delayed project, Khan said he had taken the decision because of a continuing shortfall in fundraising for the scheme and the lack of the necessary land use agreements despite three years of talks.The decision ends the long-running saga of the proposed construction of the bridge, which was championed by the actor Joanna Lumley, Boris Johnson and George Osborne, and drew anger from critics who saw it as a symbolic indulgence.Planning permission for bridge, which was designed by Thomas Heatherwick and would have run from Temple on the north side of the Thames to the South Bank, expires in December, making the timetable appearimpossible, Khan said. “The funding gap is now at over £70m and it appears unlikely that the trust will succeed in raising the private funds required for the project,” he said.“I am simply not prepared to risk a situation where the taxpayer has to step in and contribute significant additional amounts to ensure the project is completed.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Sadiq Khan: ‘It appears unlikely the trust will succeed in raising the private funds required for the project.’ Photograph: PDN/SIPA/Rex/ShutterstockUnder the plans for the bridge, its future operational and maintenance costs are guaranteed from mayoral funds if the trust is unable to meet them through its commercial and fundraising activities. Khan does not have the power to scrap the project, but his withdrawal of public guarantees effectively does so.The proposal for a garden over the Thames, featuring 270 trees and thousands of other plants, was originally devised by Lumley and won support from Johnson, Khan’s predecessor as London mayor, and the then chancellor Osborne, who committed £60m of public money to the scheme.The rest was intended to be raised from corporate donations, but fierce local opposition and fruitless talks with the housing trust occupying the south side of the project delayed the start of construction and costs rose.Khan commissioned the Labour MP Margaret Hodge to investigate whether the bridge still represented value for public money. Her report, published earlier this month, recommended it be scrapped.The bridge was likely to cost more than £200m, Hodge said, and £37.4m of public funds had already been spent without any building work taking place.She also found the Garden Bridge Trust had lost major donors and secured only £69m in private pledges, leaving a gap of at least £70m. It has received no new pledges since August 2016.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The proposal featuring 270 trees and thousands of plants was supported by Boris Johnson and George Osborne.

The Garden Bridge Trust was set up at the request of Transport for London and the Department of Transport to deliver the project which had received public money,” he said. “We have had enormous support from our funders and are very confident we can raise the remaining funds required. But sadly, the mayor of London has taken a different decision to those in place when the project started.”
