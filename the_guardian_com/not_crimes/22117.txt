I never thought the day would come when I’d see a bantu knot-wearing, diastema-having Nigerian-American on my screen, acting in one of the most critically acclaimed TV shows of the last five years. But then I had not reckoned with Uzo Aduba.Aduba, 35, is the kind of performer who makes use of her gifts. She has large, brown eyes that she is not afraid to widen as the role calls for it, and a smile that turns from bright and guileless to wicked and calculating in front of your eyes. I first saw her, like most other people, in Netflix’s Orange Is The New Black. She plays Suzanne (given the disparaging moniker of “Crazy Eyes”), a prisoner with a passion for Shakespeare and an uncanny talent for writing about alien group sex. Suzanne could easily have become a caricature, but Aduba plays her subtly, giving her a very human depth. She is such a big, exaggerated character; surely, you think, Aduba must be a little like that herself? Nope: out of character, she is bashful charm and warmth itself. She sings opera, her voice creamy and rich; her anecdotes are delightful, often filled with references to her Nigerian mother (me, too, Uzo!); and her acceptance speeches are excellent, tearful things – and pull off that neat trick of being endearing.Why I love... The Good Wife’s Eli Gold But great as Aduba is onscreen, it’s onstage that she’s blown me away. I went to see her in a revival of Jean Genet’s The Maids a few weeks ago in London, and was left agog by her Solange, who is by turns brutal and tender, as broken as a person can be, but still trying to make it. She has talent to spare, and I just hope Hollywood (and beyond) knows what to do with it.
