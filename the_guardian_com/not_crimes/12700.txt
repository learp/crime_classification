Here’s our news piece outlining who won and who lost out:Game of Thrones dominates Emmy awards list with 23 nominations As Alex Needham writes, diversity was the other big winner: It was a morning that showcased the diversity of television compared to Hollywood, with Black-ish, a highly praised American sitcom about an African American family starring Anthony Anderson, receiving nominations including outstanding outstanding comedy series, up against Master of None, Modern Family, Silicon Valley, Transparent, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Veep, which took the prize in 2015.Updatedat 5.48pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.06pm BST17:06Phew!So a lot to digest there. Obviously, it’s a huge win for Game of Thrones which looks set to dominate in September once again. Elsewhere, a lot of new series got a shout (Mr Robot, Master of None). It was a very diverse list in general: a reflection of a shift in the industry’s output or a response to #OscarsSoWhite? The People v OJ Simpson also did incredibly well. Also, on a personal note, I’m overjoyed all the shows in our main holding picture got nominated.Snubs wise: The Daily Show with Trevor Noah missed out, so did Stephen Colbert, Fresh Off The Boat, The Good Wife and UnREAL.
