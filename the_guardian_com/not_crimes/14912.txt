We didn’t know what to do with it.”There were a few collaborators that got cut from Wildflower, too: August Darnell from Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Luke Steele from Sleepy Jackson and Empire of the Sun (“that almost made it actually ... we just couldn’t find a way to finish it in time”), Jens Leckman, Connan Mockasin.The Luke Steele track was “the one that got away”, they say: “we just couldn’t find a way to finish it in time”.Updatedat 5.59am BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.26am BST05:26And some more good news: Within the first year of Wildflower being out, the Avalanches are planning to package everything up that they’ve been playing with through this period, and release it. “And then the slate will be clean to make new music.”FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.25am BST05:25Zane Lowe’s favourite track on the album is called Colours – a collaboration with vocalist Jonathan Donahue of Mercury Rev. The Avalanches worked on the track in Robbie Chater’s house, with his mum hanging out in the lounge room in the background. “I think it’s nice!” she said, which is just a great mum review.The hardest song to finish on Wildflower, say the Avalanches, was Frankie Sinatra. “That got mixed for about two and a half years,” they say. How many mixes? “Over a hundred.”They let go some of their favourites, too. “They didn’t contribute to the overall feeling of the record ... Once we had the feeling right we just built upon it, selected tracks that fit it. It was kind of like making a mixtape.”Updatedat 5.40am BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.21am BST05:21Zane Lowe says there is a “distinctly Australian-sounding” feeling to the new album which, a reminder, is called Wildflower: “The music that I hear has a very wide-open-sky sound to it. I do hear it, driving down the coast of Australia. Is that a fair observation?”Avalanches: “I think what you’re saying about the wide open spaces, I’d agree with that. This new record feels a bit like a road trip, and we spent a lot of our teenage years driving around in cars in the country and in suburbia listening to music, and that was in our heads making this record as well. For us this record was supposed to capture that feeling.”Updatedat 5.42am BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.19am BST05:19“Have either of you listened to Since I Left You since it was released?” asks Zane:“It took a long time, but when I eventually did I thought, ‘Okay, I understand why people like it’, because it was from the heart ... We weren’t trying to sound big or huge or make these enormous beats, we were trying to capture a feeling.“You know how something can be happy and sad at the same time, that beautiful sweet spot ... that’s what we were chasing.” Updatedat 5.42am BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.18am BST05:18BREAKING: Journalist and broadcaster Virginia Trioli is not a fan of the new track...Virginia Trioli (@LaTrioli)You're kidding, @zanrowe ...

Some Avalanches shows, when we were starting out, were just two people DJ-ing; others were like house parties, it was never a concrete thing ... Every thing we’d done was so spontaneous, and so fun, and it was difficult to replicate that night after night.“It sort of became this strange situation where, without things being smashed or legs being broken [bandmember Darren Seltmann broke his leg twice in 2001], people were going to be disappointed.”Updatedat 5.43am BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.14am BST05:14The Avalanches have revealed that they could have picked a whole other 20 songs for the album. “There’s a vault [of unreleased music]. And we never want to listen to that vault again.”FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.14am BST05:14Why has it taken so long? “I think for us, we just kept making music, which we’d always done and probably always will do. There was so much of it, and so many different projects going on, that at a certain point we realised we had to pull a record together.” The Avalanches had a bunch of side projects going at once – collaborating with Luke Steele, an animation project, music for a King Kong soundtrack – and used bits and pieces of everything to pull inspiration together for the album.“It sounds like the most brilliantly fun sixteen years of your life,” says Zane.

He’s on Beats 1 Radio, interviewing Tony Di Blasi and Robbie Chater of the Avalanches right now. On getting Danny Brown (“one of the most compelling voices in rap music,” says Zane) and MF Doom together for Frankie Sinatra: “We wanted to make this record still sound like us but to be a bit more loose and rock and roll. The initial plan was to make a crazy loose rock record, but with samples. Danny’s voice is almost like a punk rock voice sometimes, so we thought it’d be perfect – but we thought, ‘He’d never have heard of us’.” Luckily for the Avalanches, his manager was a fan, so flew Danny Brown to Melbourne to record on Frankie Sinatra, and a second track as well.Zane reminds us that Danny Brown was responsible for news of the new album leaking, too.Updatedat 5.43am BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.08am BST05:08“You can give a record a title that’s trying too hard to paint a certain picture.
