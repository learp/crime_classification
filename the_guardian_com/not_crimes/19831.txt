He then went on to tweet about “dirty ass fake muslims selling alcohol in the hood” before falsely claiming his song had been removed from Soundcloud because of hate speech.Finally, after arguing with those attacking him, he tweeted: “I get the hint God. Yo Lupe fans it’s been fun and I hope you’ve had fun. I’m officially not releasing anymore music. Albums cancelled.” He also said he was “getting beat up for telling the truth”.The star, whose hits include Daydreaming and Superstar, previously claimed that he was retiring in 2012. He also quit Twitter in 2015 before returning. He was set to release three albums this year before announcing a delay and now apparently cancelling them all.Fiasco, who was featured on Kanye West’s Touch the Sky in 2005, sent a message to the rapper when he was recently hospitalized. “... To perform, day in and day out,” he said on stage. “And when you not performing, you thinking about performing. And when you not thinking about performing, you performing. When you not performing, you recovering from performing. When you not recovering from performing you gotta prepare yourself to perform again. That’s hard. And with that said, we want to send prayers out to my big bro Kanye. He say a lot of goofy shit sometimes, but he from Chicago, so it don’t even fucking matter.”
