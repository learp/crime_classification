James Deen, the porn star recently accused of sexual assault, is facing government citations and potential fines for his production company’s alleged violations of condom and safety laws, with California officials accusing his enterprise of exposing performers to sexually transmitted infections.California rejects plan to force porn actors to wear condoms, dental dams and goggles His production company failed to use condoms and did not provide vaccines or medical examinations to employees who were potentially exposed to hepatitis B, according to citations issued Wednesday by California’s division of occupational safety and health (Cal/OSHA).The proposed $77,875 penalty comes months after the high-profile adult entertainment star, known as an ambassador for the industry, experienced a stunning downfall amid numerous public accusations of assault. In November, three women who were fellow porn actors – Stoya, Tori Lux and Ashley Fires – said that Deen had sexually assaulted them, prompting Deen to describe the accusations as “false and defamatory”.A number of industry groups subsequently severed ties with Deen, who is now facing state allegations that he runs an unsafe workplace.Deen denied the accusations in a statement on Thursday, arguing that no performer was exposed to any disease and that the government should not dictate what people watch in the privacy of their homes.“Not one person was exposed to or contracted any illness on my sets,” he said in a statement. “I gave the performers the option to perform with condoms however, they desired not to use condoms and I honored their requests.”James Deen Productions, also known as Third Rock Enterprises, has been under investigation since 8 December, and according to California officials, the porn star and his lawyers refused to provide the state with safety documentation and further denied the government permission to investigate.Los Angeles superior court issued a warrant allowing Cal/OSHA to conduct a January site inspection at the company’s Woodland Hills location in southern California.The state issued a total of nine violations, including four that were serious enough that “death or serious harm could result from the actual hazardous condition,” according to the state. The company also faces citations for failing to disclose safety records.“Cal/OSHA requires condom use in adult films to protect workers from exposure to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections,” Cal/OSHA chief Juliann Sum said in a statement. “Third Rock Enterprises failed to protect employees from illness and injury while on set.”California has a number of regulations on the books for the adult film industry. The state argues that existing health laws mandate condom use on porn sets, and Cal/OSHA recently proposed a set of rules that would clearly state the condom requirement for the porn industry.

According to state data, Cal/OSHA has uncovered 14 violations at four adult entertainment companies since 2014 and has at least one ongoing investigation.
