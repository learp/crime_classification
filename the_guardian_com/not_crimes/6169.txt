Channel 4 News economics editor Paul Mason is leaving for a freelance career to escape the constraints of impartiality rules governing broadcasters.Mason told the Guardian he had been delighted with his time at Channel 4, but wanted to use journalism to explore the themes he has written about in his book PostCapitalism: A Guide to Our Future. He said: “I don’t disagree with the impartiality rules as, without them, TV as well as the press would be completely Tory. But I think that I have been working under those rules for 15 years now and, with my book becoming fairly influential in a space that I would describe as the left of social democracy, I feel the time has come.”Mason, who will continue writing his column in the Guardian, said he wanted to branch out into covering new areas such as geo-politics and national security. He intends to stay in journalism both in video and print and has ruled out moving into politics, saying “the thought sickens me”.He said: “I have been delighted to work here, and it’s been a superb place. Channel 4 are leading the field. The time and opportunity has come for me to do things in a different way.”Mason joined Channel 4 News in 2013 as digital and culture editor, before being made economics editor the following year. Previously he was economics editor on BBC2’s Newsnight and had spent more than a decade at the BBC.Mason, along with Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow, has recorded YouTube videos which would be unlikely to pass impartiality rules applied to broadcast news by regulator Ofcom.Ben De Pear, editor of Channel 4 News, wished Mason well for the future: “Paul is a unique talent, a renaissance man with a knowledge and interest in so many different areas and with an originality and take which lends itself to almost every form of journalism and media. “He has been a pioneering journalist for us in social media, an area which he has mastered, as well as being a natural born writer and talent for television.”
