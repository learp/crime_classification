Balenciaga, one of fashion’s hottest labels, took inspiration from Bernie Sanders for its most recent collection at Paris fashion week. But what would Bernie himself look like in the oversized, feel the Bern-branded scarfs and quirkily proportioned bomber jackets? Well, pretty good, if a little bit sheepish, if the zeitgeist-y Instagram art account @Siduations is anything to go by. Is this the B train? 🤦🏻‍♀️ #balenciaga #siduationsA post shared by SIDUATIONS (@siduations) on Mar 5, 2017 at 8:57am PSTThe account has been tickling the fashion industry, picking up steam during the autumn/winter shows. Its most successful posts place some of the more unusual items of high-fashion in everyday situations. There is a model in a Chanel metallic wrap stuck next to marathon runners shrouded in foil, and an impossibly fluffy Commes des Garçons felt dress looking like tumble-dryer fluff.The idea, says Sidney Prawatyotin, the man behind the memes, is not to make fun of the unwearability of some fashion items. “I love fashion. I hope none of the designers think I’m making fun of them,” he says. Comme Des Peluche 😜 #commedesgarcons #nike #siduationsA post shared by SIDUATIONS (@siduations) on Mar 4, 2017 at 7:54pm PSTHaving worked in fashion PR for the past 15 years, Prawatyotin has an obvious respect for what designers do. And, he says, while you might think that some of these garments aren’t made to be worn, just look at street-style stars pulling them off. “I often think, who’s going to buy this? But I look at the [street style] pictures and it’s like, people will buy this.”The idea for the account started when he saw a picture his friend, the actor Chloë Sevigny, had posted of herself on Instagram. In it she is wearing a floor-length Prada dress and is on a basketball court – not a natural combination, you might think. And neither did Prawatyotin – he put a basketball emoji on it and sent it back to her as a playful lol. Sevigny posted it to her account. Man About Town 🇺🇸 #balenciaga #vetements #berniesanders #siduationsA post shared by SIDUATIONS (@siduations) on Feb 8, 2017 at 8:24pm PSTHaving recently moved to Los Angeles from his native New York, he was spending more time on social media as a way to see what friends were up to. Prawatyotin started making these little pictoral gifts for friends, repurposing pictures they had posted on Instagram. You only need to look at Zoolander’s cult status in the industry to know that fashion – despite the poker face – likes to laugh at itself. After all, the first rule of fashion is: definitely talk about fashion, even if that is to rib the absurdities.
