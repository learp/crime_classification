France’s highest administrative court has suspended a ban on the burkini – beachwear that covers the body and head – in a test case in the southern town of Villeneuve-Loubet, near Nice. Lawyers argued that the bans were feeding fear and infringing on basic freedoms. If you wear a burkini, or dress modestly, we’d like you to share your experiences.Several towns in France implemented the ban citing concerns over religious clothing in the wake of recent terrorist killings in the country. It is hoped the temporary suspension will set a precedent for other towns that have banned the burkini.There has been strong backlash against what many see as a ludicrous law. Around 40 demonstrators gathered outside the French embassy in London Thursday, for a ‘wear what you want’ beach party to protest the ban. Woman held flags and banners reading ‘Islamophobia is not freedom’, and ‘Our choice’.Aheda Zanetti, the garment’s creator, says it isn’t something to be mistaken for oppression, or a symbol of Islam. “It’s just a garment to suit a modest person, or someone who has skin cancer, or a new mother who doesn’t want to wear a bikini” she says.
