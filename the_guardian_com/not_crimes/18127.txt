One night the BFG (Big Friendly Giant) comes to Sophie’s house during the witching hour. Sophie hides under her duvet because she thinks he is a bad giant. When you read on you will find out about their amazing adventures.The main characters are the BFG, Sophie, the Queen and the Giants. My favourite character is the BFG because he is really clever and caring and he’s always ready to help.I like the illustrations Quentin Blake did. He is really good at drawing.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I really liked this book. It was quite difficult to read but it was an excellent book. My favourite bit is when the Queen’s footmen make the BFG a cup, knife, fork, spoon, table and chair.I would recommend this book to a friend if they were over the age of seven because some bits are sad.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
