Shakespeare On Film, LondonYou’re always spoilt for choice when it comes to Shakespeare in film form (there have been more than 1,000 adaptations and counting), but the 400th anniversary of the playwright’s death has brought with it a global drive to celebrate our national hero – so even more reason to relive his celluloid legacy. And who better to lead the charge than Ian McKellen? He’s closely involved with the BFI’s commemoration, which kicks off this week, and will be discussing with director Richard Loncraine their 1930s-set take on Richard III (28 Apr) at NFT1, before conducting bus tours of the London locations (see website for details). There’s also the pick of adaptations from around the world and across time, including new restorations of Kurosawa’s Ran and Zeffirelli’s Romeo And Juliet (pictured), plus rarely seen silents – including 20-year-old John Gielgud as Romeo – with new scores.BFI Southbank, SE1, Thu to 31 MayTwin Peaks Weekender, Brighton & EdinburghIf you’re of a certain age, news that David Lynch and Mark Frost are making a new series of Twin Peaks will have brought the memories flooding back: cherry pie, logs, owls, backwards-talking dwarves, clearing your diary on Tuesday night because that was the one and only chance to catch it back in the pre-internet 1990s. If you’re of a different certain age, Twin Peaks is ancient folklore, filtered through 25 years of pop-culture rip-offs and homages. In either case, here’s the perfect way to prepare for the most eagerly anticipated return in TV history: a marathon binge-watch of all 30 episodes, back to back. The feature-length pilot episode (directed by Lynch) is a masterpiece in itself. By the time you come out the other end, you’ll be pining for more. Or unable to remember your own name.Duke Of York’s, Brighton; Cameo, Edinburgh, Sat & Sun
