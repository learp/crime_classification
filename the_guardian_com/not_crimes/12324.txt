The UK film industry’s timid approach to comedy is hard to explain. After all, the influence of the Edinburgh fringe has made the British stand-up scene one of the most vibrant in the world, with a raft of performers debuting new and ambitious shows on an almost absurdly reliable basis. If an act as off-putting as that of American character comedian Gregg Turkington – who on stage portrays scabrous comic Neil Hamburger – can pack out British theatres with intentionally unfunny one-liners about the Holocaust and Kentucky Fried Chicken, then why is comedy that pushes boundaries considered such a risk at British cinemas?UK distributors were apparently uninterested when Turkington immortalised Hamburger on film in last year’s acclaimed comedy-drama Entertainment. In the film, a fictionalised Turkington tours backwoods US comedy clubs in the guise of a grotesque character clearly modelled on Hamburger, right down to the oleaginous combover and amplified lack of respect for the audience. Here though, we get a glimpse at the lonesome existence behind this stage persona, a nomadic lifestyle so soaked in melancholy it makes Turkington’s jet-black club routine look like a Tim Vine set.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest As his character’s confrontational style collides with his own desire to be left alone, our protagonist falls into a nightmarish tailspin littered with anxieties both fantastically large and achingly small. In a film that sees Turkington angrily bottled halfway through a set – much as he was when the organisers of Reading festival unwisely asked him to fill in for Kevin Bridges in 2010 – and forced to deliver a still-born baby in a public bathroom, perhaps the most dread-inducing scene of all comes when a relative asks him to repeat a joke out of character, stripped of the mitigating distance afforded by his costume.It all adds up to a fittingly bleak big-screen vehicle for the “anti-comedy” movement of which Turkington is a key proponent, and maybe that explains why the film proved an unappealing prospect for British distributors, whose idea of risk-taking big-screen comedy is a $20m major studio movie produced, but not necessarily directed, by Judd Apatow. And so, six months after the film played at the London film festival, Entertainment debuted across the rest of the UK this week as an unheralded addition to the Netflix catalogue – just the kind of unceremonious welcome its protagonist might find ruefully familiar.
