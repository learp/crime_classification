I saw his pictures of the Warhol Factory when I was in college and thought, ‘Oh, that’s the place to get to. Everyone is so beautiful and it looks brilliant and complicated – art, music, film, but most of all a kind of wild life.’” It looked like the future as I imagined it.”He was an editor at Warhol’s Interview magazine in the early 70s before becoming GQ’s Style Guy. In the role, he wrote about sartorial developments and gave advice in a column.He also dabbled in punk, writing a long-running and influential column on the New York scene and playing in the group Konelrad, who were regulars at CBGB.
