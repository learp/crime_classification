Mancunians are being invited to apply to host part of the Manchester international festival in their own homes.The biennial arts festival, which has featured premieres from the likes of Sir Kenneth Branagh and Maxine Peake, will take place from 29 June to 16 July, with the full line-up published on 8 March.Festival in My House, one of the first of the festival’s projects to be announced, will involve local people proposing ideas for events they would like to stage themselves. If an idea is chosen, a producer from the festival will advise the householder on how to host the event and book artists.MIF’s new artistic director, John McGrath, said the project would combine “the most invigorating artists and ideas with a real commitment to community leadership, skills-development and creativity”. “We are making a year-round invitation to Manchester residents to engage with and learn about everything that makes the festival special,” he said.“It could involve flying somebody in to do the headline act in their living room,” McGrath told the BBC. “But the budget’s not huge – it’s £1,000 for people to spend each time. Like us, they need to work out how to make their money stretch as best they can. And we support them every step of the way with that.”The project is being piloted with two events in Mancunian homes in November and December this year. The M8 festival will be curated by Yatie Aziz, a resident of Cheetham Hill, and promises to feature cross-cultural music, food and dance.The Mehndi festival will be curated by Nija Dalal-Small from Levenshulme, and invites Manchester-based visual artists from different disciplines to interpret the traditional art form of mehndi and create their own contemporary hand decoration. • This article was amended on 21 November to correct the spelling of Nija Dalal-Small’s name.
