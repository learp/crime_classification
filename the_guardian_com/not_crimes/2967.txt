Re Aditya Chakrabortty’s article (One blunt heckler has shown just how much our economists are failing us, 10 January), GDP is a crazy measure for prosperity: a country’s GDP equals the aggregate income of its inhabitants.

And London’s highly paid financial specialists make a “healthy” contribution to UK GDP.Wiebina HeestermanBirmingham• Your recipe for green peppercorn and lemongrass coconut broth (Cook, 7 January) really appealed, but in a tour of four supermarkets I could not find any green peppercorns.
