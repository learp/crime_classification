2.09pm GMT14:09That’s all for today  Guardian contributor GemmaArterton 22 March 2016 2:04pmThank you very much for all these varied and interesting questions - especially the ones I didn't answer that still amused me greatly!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.08pm GMT14:08ID8256164 asks:Teachers do outreach at schools and universities. Would you be interested to do similar work, helping student film-makers at educational institutes?  Guardian contributor GemmaArterton 22 March 2016 2:04pmMy worry about the new generation is that everyone wants to be an actor or model, and they're not the same. As long as it's not to promote celebrity I would be happy to talk to them about what acting involves. It's an amazing thing to do as a life journey - you can learn about yourself and others, but my worry is that people go into it for the wrong reasons. Maybe it's good for famous people to say hey! Don't do it, for this reason!I was reading something in L'Officiel recently and famous people's kids all want to be a model or actor - God, it's not as easy as that, and that's not what it's about.I think acting makes you learn about what issues interest you. When I first started out, I really enjoyed acting and telling stories. As time's gone on I care more about what I'm telling; if I'm going to give myself over to something for five months, what is it that moves me about it? Recently I've been doing a lot of working class girl does good, and that sort of stuff - that's close to my heart. But I have other tastes that are quite absurd - I like quite odd films, and odd theatre. That's a side of me I don't really understand, but is really fascinating to me. Also, if you don't start developing something yourself, you get what you're given. And maybe you're one of fifty people on a list - often it's quite limiting. So creating stuff, nicking creative people and saying let's write this script, let's put this play on, that's really exciting to me.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.00pm GMT14:00Mark74 asks:Do you have a dream project that you would like to see realised someday?

Loved the first one, great fun!  Guardian contributor GemmaArterton 22 March 2016 1:58pmI don't think so. I really enjoyed it, a great director Tommy Wirkola, he;s just made a film with Noomi Rapace where she plays seven characters in the same scene. He's really interesting. He's got a great attitude to work - we had a great time. But I think everyone's moved on from it - it's a bit too late to carry on with it.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.58pm GMT13:58Tmstms asks:What does it take for an unknown director to attract the attention of a big-name actor like you for his short film? The outstanding script? To know your agent? Great food on the set? Would you even consider starring in some no-name’s film?  Guardian contributor GemmaArterton 22 March 2016 1:55pmIf the script was great, yes. It's all about the script. And then I'd want to meet the director and know they've got vision.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.57pm GMT13:57My favourite place? The town of Glastonbury, when the festival's not onAleshea Simmons asks:Where is your favourite place to be and why?  Guardian contributor GemmaArterton 22 March 2016 1:54pmGlastonbury town, in the summer, not when the festival's on. Anywhere in Somerset in the summer actually - it's beautiful and serene, and makes me feel good. But not the festival! It's the opposite. I used to go every year as a kid though - it's a special place for me.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.55pm GMT13:55Autonova1 asks:What do you think about while doing a scene? Are you trying to put yourself in a certain emotional state, or are you thinking about how a viewer is going to see you, without necessarily feeling the emotion?  Guardian contributor GemmaArterton 22 March 2016 1:53pmIt really depends on the scene. Some scenes you have to prepare for. It depends where you're at - for instance if you're coming in with a lot of tension and anxiety, you might want to get yourself to that state. I get myself to a state, then play the scene, and forget about the state. Be with the actor and act with them, rather than play the emotion, because that's boring. There's something to be said for preparing yourself for a scene. In Nell Gwynn, because I'm on stage all the time, I don't have to prepare as much, it happens around me. Sometimes you can get distracted in scenes - especially on stage, where you've been doing it for months. I have to remind myself to be in the moment, and be present moment to moment. It helps you keep focused and keeps your energy up. Doing film the most challenging thing is to forget about the camera but know that it's there - if the camera can't pick up your work, there's no point. So yeah, that can be in the mind - how close is the camera? That's something I struggle with.Updatedat 1.56pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.54pm GMT13:54Doing a foreign-language film is like speaking through a mask – the key is to really, really rehearsePhoque asks:You are amazing on stage. Tell us if you plan [to appear in] future shows in London.Also, I though your performance in Gemma Bovery was special. Can you share some comments about the shooting?  Guardian contributor GemmaArterton 22 March 2016 1:50pmI don't have any more plans for theatre that I'm aware of, but I'm always open. I have good relationships now, I can create stuff with people, and bring ideas to the table, and not come in at the last minute as an actor - that's exciting to me.Shooting Gemma Bovary was my first French language film - since then I've done another one which is predominantly in French. It's interesting - you have to relinquish control, you sound different and it's not your language and you have to let yourself go. It's like speaking through a mask, a bit, when you're speaking another language - it's interesting, a different experience. I think the key is for me to really, really rehearse. I think rehearsal is really underestimated! People like to go in fresh, and there is merit in that - but I think rehearsal can make you free as well. Speaking another language, to not have to think about what I'm saying because I've rehearsed so much, means I can be free in my performance. I'm a big advocate of rehearsal. It's a shame that on some films you never rehearse - the actors might be unavailable. You turn up and meet them for the first time, and do an intense scene together - it's quite odd. There's a director in France who never does a second take, which is an interesting exercise. It'll only happen one time, which is magical - but you could have gone somewhere else with it. There's not a right and wrong way.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm GMT13:49DefaultLogin asks:What are the main differences between a pickle and a relish? Which would be more suited to a ploughman’s lunch?  Guardian contributor GemmaArterton 22 March 2016 1:44pmIsn't the pickle just a more basic version of relish? I see relish as more a Waitrose thing, and pickle is an Asda thing. Pickle is the right thing in ploughman's - relish would be an overpriced ploughman's.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.48pm GMT13:48Bumrusherer asks:How have your career goals changed since you started?  Guardian contributor GemmaArterton 22 March 2016 1:43pmWell, I didn't really have career goals when I started. At drama school they drill it into your head that you're really lucky if you ever get a job - so to have a plan, I never thought about that. Now, I do have things I'd like to do - but I don't have goals, because that's something where when you get to it, it's done. I'm on a journey with my work, and I feel in control of the decisions I made, whereas before I was taking whatever was thrown at me, and was grateful for the work.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
