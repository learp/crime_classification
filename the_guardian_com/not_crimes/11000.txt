Claims that windfarms cannot reduce carbon emissions are "rubbish" and result from critics ignoring the facts and "believing what they want to believe", according to Lord (Adair) Turner, chairman of the government's official independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC).In an interview with the Guardian, Turner said there was a legitimate debate over whether wind turbines were a visual blight on the hills of Britain, but that the debate had to be honest and critics had to accept the much higher cost of placing the turbines offshore. He added that enabling local people to profit from wind power would lead to a switch in "deeply subjective aesthetic perceptions".Under his leadership, the CCC's ambitious targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions have been accepted by parliament.The most recent carbon budget – to cut emissions by 50% by 2025 – was agreed only after a fierce cabinet battle. "We have set a real standard for fact-based analysis and established a very high level of credibility," said Turner, who also chairs the Financial Services Authority.The controversy over windfarms has become even more heated in recent weeks, with the chairman of the National Trust, Sir Simon Jenkins, claiming the NT was "deeply sceptical" over wind power – only for the organisation to respond that this did not "chime" with its official line.Turner said that there was a "confused" debate on the merits of wind power, along with nuclear power and carbon capture and storage, as part of the package to replace fossil fuels."It is really regrettable that people leap – without reading the facts – to things that they want to believe," he said. "Wind works. The idea that it is so intermittent that it is not beneficial, that is rubbish. There are countries getting large amounts of energy from wind."If someone argues they passionately believe that windmills are bad for the aesthetic environment and are willing to do more nuclear instead, or willing to bear the cost of offshore wind, that is a real argument. But latching on to 'they don't work', or 'they are too intermittent' or 'they are not low-carbon because of the concrete' is just a failure to read the facts."Turner acknowledged the expense of going offshore. "Offshore wind today – until the costs come down and we think they will over time – is a relatively expensive way of producing electricity, because it is a new technology. But as for onshore wind, it actually is not all that much more expensive than nuclear or coal or gas once you allow for a reasonable cost of carbon."The visual impact of turbines varies by landscape, according to Turner, who said he did not object to turbines near his father's house in Lochgilphead, Argyll.He added: "There is something about those big, wide, rugged, sweeping landscapes that can take windmills without destroying what it is you love about that landscape."On the other hand, I can completely understand that there are some downland landscapes where some great big windmill development fundamentally changes the nature of it."In Britain the vast majority of wind turbines and other renewables are owned by large energy companies, whereas in Germany most are owned by individuals and communities.Turner thinks this may be part of the reason for local opposition to windfarms, despite the public at a national level strongly favouring them over alternatives."I think the Germans have been more effective at creating a sense of community ownership of these assets that changes the dynamics of people's attitudes towards it," said Turner."Rather than looking at it and saying 'that big company dumped it here to make profit', they look at it and say 'that's ours and I get some profit from it' and as a result it turns out aesthetic perceptions are deeply subjective and you say 'I rather like it' rather than 'I rather dislike it.'"He added: "I think there's more opportunity for the individual wind turbine, where it is sited near a village, but you devise it so the village, the community, gets some economic benefit from it."Turner expects that three-quarters of the UK's wind turbines will end up being built offshore. "But it will come at a higher cost," he warned.He said fact-based honesty was also an essential part of the debate over cost. "If there is a cost of £100-150 per annum on the average bill [to build a green energy system], we need to tell people that, but also reassure them that it is £150 not £1,000 as some of the more crazy bits of the anti-climate change press would like to suggest."
