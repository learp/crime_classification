The Great British Bake Off 8pm, BBC1The nation’s most beloved show has always been stuck in a bit of a timewarp, harking back to a gentler notion of Britishness. But having been outpaced by reality, it has now become a collective flashback to a happier time when Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood – our very own Brangelina – had yet to be been torn asunder by commercial forces. With only six contestants and four episodes left of Bake Off as we know it, tonight’s theme is desserts. Graeme VirtueCoast: The Great Guide 8pm, BBC2More amiable stories from Britain’s coastline in this enduring series, which generally lurches between the mildly revelatory and the borderline humdrum. Tonight, Tessa Dunlop hitches a ride to the new London Gateway in the company of the Thames river police. Moving on to Ramsgate, she then attempts a more tranquil recreation of the journey of one of the famous “little ships” of Dunkirk. Elsewhere, Neil Oliver explores trade and defence. Phil HarrisonOur Girl 9pm, BBC1Michelle Keegan has played the role of Georgie with guts and glamour, and she is surrounded by drama right up to the last moment of this final episode. The soldier is back in the UK and she is counting the days until she leaves the army, but memories of the kidnapping still haunt her. She and Jamie have a wedding to arrange, but in among the discussion of floral arrangements, Georgie’s being sent on one last mission, a dangerous one. Hannah VerdierA World Without Down’s Syndrome? 9pm, BBC2As the question mark at the end of the title suggests, “curing” Down’s syndrome remains both maddeningly elusive and ethically questionable. This documentary looks at what is both a moral and medical conundrum, with the NHS considering introducing new prenatal screening. The presenter, actor Sally Phillips, has a personal stake in the story, as the mother of a son with Down’s. Here, she meets both experts and those living with the condition. Andrew Mueller Containment 9pm, E4This US series has been packed from beginning to end with dystopian cliche, which seems a shame given that it was based on a Belgian effort that didn’t lay on the sneezing and haemorrhaging quite so thick. At least the seemingly xenophobic plotline that saw a Syrian refugee blamed for the outbreak proved to merely be a red herring. As it reaches its close, can Lex bring down dodgy Dr Lommers for her part in the epidemic? And will the cordon finally be lifted? Hannah J DaviesThe South Bank Show Originals10.15pm, Sky ArtsMelvyn Bragg reflects on past profiles of two British jazz greats. Firstly, in a film from 2000, there’s Courtney Pine, the prodigy who turned down the chance to join Art Blakey’s group to develop a popular British take on jazz with Caribbean influences. There follows a 2007 profile of Humphrey Lyttelton, the Etonian jazz star and radio panel show regular on as easy terms with Louis Armstrong as he was with Tim Brooke-Taylor. David StubbsUndercover: Britain’s Abortion Extremists 11pm, Channel 4Anti-abortion campaigners regularly hold protests up and down the country. Their activities, including filming and haranguing women who seek advice or terminations, have led to calls for safe zones around clinics, and there have even been reports of centres being forced to close permanently because of protests. For this edition of Dispatches, Cathy Newman investigates the behaviour of these fervent and intimidating groups. Jonathan WrightFilm choiceMacbeth (Justin Kurzel, 2015) 9pm, Film4Kurzel, the director of horribly violent serial killer drama Snowtown, brings all his visceral powers to Shakespeare’s gory tragedy – the misty, slow-mo battle scenes make Braveheart look wimpy. Michael Fassbender is a commanding Macbeth, a warrior would-be king slipping into a delusional netherworld, while Marion Cotillard fascinates as Lady Macbeth, here, it seems, impelled by grief after the death of their child. There’s a wild beauty, and plenty of sound and fury, to this compelling version of the Scottish play.
