A controversial movie about the future of Hong Kong won the top prize at the city’s film awards on Sunday, after being a local box office hit but antagonising Beijing over its portrayal of the semi-autonomous territory in 2025.Ten Years scooped the best film prize at the Hong Kong film awards, following a short cinema release that was widely believed to have been curtailed for political reasons.Ten Years – the terrifying vision of Hong Kong that Beijing wants obscured The film is made up of a series of five vignettes that tap residents’ worst fears for the future of the southern Chinese city as Beijing’s grip tightens.The film had only a short general release, while some cinemas refused to screen it altogether, and it raised hackles on the mainland with China’s state-run Global Times newspaper describing it as “totally absurd” and a “virus of the mind”.The film’s producer Andrew Choi said after the awards ceremony: “The meaning of this prize is that it shows Hong Kong still has hope. It reminds us that we could have courage to be creative. I would like to thank everyone who has watched it.”Major China-based TV channels pulled out from broadcasting the awards on the mainland, with the nomination of Ten Years widely believed to be the reason.Ten Years review – a smoke grenade lobbed down Hong Kong's corridors of power But one of the film’s directors, Ng Ka-leung, said he was not concerned by Beijing’s opinion, only by what his fellow Hong Kongers thought of the film.“If you ask me what Beijing might feel towards us, I would say it doesn’t really matter. The movie was made for Hong Kong people. We are open-minded to anyone who likes it or not. We just hope that Hong Kong people can share our feelings. We would like people to think about the future of Hong Kong,” he said.The chairman of the Hong Kong film awards, Derek Yee, acknowledged the controversy that had arisen from the film’s nomination.“President Roosevelt said one thing: ‘the only thing we have to fear is fear itself’,” Yee said before announcing the winner of the best film category.

In the final short, a protester self-immolates outside the British consulate – a scene that moved many viewers to tears.Hong Kong police thriller Port of Call also won big at the awards, scooping seven prizes including best actor for singer Aaron Kwok and best actress for newcomer Jessie Li.Full list of winnersBest Film: Ten YearsBest Actor: Aaron Kwok (Port Of Call)Best Actress: Jessie Li (Port Of Call)Best Director: Tsui Hark (The Taking Of Tiger Mountain)Best Screenplay: Philip Yung Tsz Kwong (Port Of Call)Best Supporting Actor: Michael Ning (Port Of Call)Best Supporting Actress: Elaine Jin (Port Of Call)Best New Performer: Michael Ning (Port Of Call)Best Cinematography: Christopher Doyle (Port Of Call) Best Film Editing: Cheung Ka Fai (Ip Man 3)Best Art Direction: William Chang Suk Ping, Yau Wai Ming (Office)Best Costume and Make Up Design: Yee Chung Man (Monster Hunt) Best Action Choreography: Li Chung Chi (SPL 2: A Time For Consequences)Best Sound Design: Kinson Tsang, George Lee Yiu Keung, Yiu Chun Hin (The Taking Of Tiger Mountain) Best Visual Effects: Jason Snell, Ellen Poon, Tang Bingbing (Monster Hunt)Best New Director: Raman Hui (Monster Hunt) Best Original Film Score: Dayu Lo, Chan Fai Young (Office)Best Original Film Song: We Almost Fly (She Remembers, He Forgets) Best Film From the Mainland and Taiwan: The Assassin
