Two forest rangers have been shot dead in the Spanish region of Catalonia after approaching a hunter reportedly carrying an unlicensed shotgun.The rangers, who worked for the region’s agriculture department, were on a routine mission on Saturday when they met a hunter in an olive grove and asked to see his firearms licence, according to Roger Cole, from the International Rangers Federation. 'What can I do to help elephants?' The accused, identified as 28-year-old Ismael Rodríguez, is alleged to have turned his shotgun on them and to have shot them both at close range, according to Spanish press reports. He then voluntarily turned himself in.Rodríguez told police he has “no memory” of shooting the two forestry agents, according to thelocal.es.The regional minister of agriculture, Meritxell Serret, told El Nacional, “There has never been any such incident in the 30-year history of the rangers’ body … The rangers are a strategic body for the country. They provide an invaluable service to the territory of Catalonia.”The dead men have been identified as 43-year-old Francesc Xabier Ribes, who leaves behind a wife and a 10-year-old son, and 37-year-old David Iglesias Díez, who leaves a wife and a daughter, aged seven.The incident, which has caused shock throughout Spain, has spurred calls for a review of hunting laws.Another day, another dead wildlife ranger. Where is the outrage? | Sean Willmore “Following the unfortunate incident in Aspa, we call for a thorough review of hunting legislation to not only protect the people but improve on conservation,” said Spanish NGO Ecologistas en Acción. Tributes were paid to the fallen park rangers, with a minute’s silence held at Catalonia’s department of agriculture.More than 100 wildlife rangers die each year while carrying out their duties. They are often the victims of poachers or others seeking to exploit the resources and animals they protect.To support rangers and their families, visit the Thin Green Line Foundation website.
