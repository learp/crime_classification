It has been assumed, as Colin Grant says, that no one outside Edward Lear’s family “knew of his epilepsy or the shame he felt about it” (After the fall, 13 August). But Lear noted in a late diary entry that he had “almost always” managed to keep his sometimes “heartstopping and braintwisting” seizures secret. The forms of Lear’s grand mal seizures seem to have varied and there are indications that he sometimes had absence seizures (petit mal).It was not only in the culture of Emily Dickinson’s polite America that epilepsy was associated with syphilis, insanity and masturbation, both in the popular imagination and among influential medics. The many editions of the pamphlet Onania, first published in England circa 1715, established masturbation as a cause of epilepsy, and for a while one of Lear’s sisters slept in his bedroom to make sure he did not give way to “impurity”. Lear would have been in accord with Graham Greene’s doctor who prescribed “good walks”, but did not live long enough to enjoy the benefits of Kepler’s malt extract.Charles LewsenBristol• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
