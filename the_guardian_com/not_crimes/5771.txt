Paul Pomroy is overseeing a quiet revolution at one of the world’s most famous brands.Since becoming chief executive of McDonald’s UK in February last year, the Londoner has introduced some eye-catching initiatives at the fast-food chain. These initiatives have already changed the views of a taxi driver in Luton, who describes the McDonald’s we are heading towards to meet Pomroy as “posh”.  Paul Pomroy: ‘Basically, we are bucking the trends.’The restaurant opened earlier this year and shows off the McDonald’s “experience of the future”, a new look for the company’s sites that is gradually being rolled out across the country. It includes charging points for mobile phones, tablets for children to play on, digital kiosks for ordering food, the option to customise burgers, a range of gourmet burgers called Signature, and table service.“I am really proud,” Pomroy says. “Obviously customer expectations up and down the high street and in retail are changing, and we have got to keep pace.“Basically, we are bucking the trends. We have just gone through 10 years of consecutive sales growth. We are serving more customers than ever before. We serve 3.7 million a day now, we have now hit 90% of the population [that visit McDonald’s]. When people say who is your target audience – there is not a target audience anymore. High street footfall is, at best, flat in certain towns, but mostly negative. But we are well above 5% footfall growth in the restaurants we are converting.”The Luton restaurant is one of 400 McDonald’s restaurants that will have table service by the autumn. Families are clearly taking advantage of it, with parents waiting at a table for their food while their children play. At peak times, more than half of customers in the restaurant are ordering their food at the digital kiosk then waiting for it to be delivered to their table, Pomroy says.McDonald’s UK is one of the best-performing and highest-regarded divisions in the American company. Steve Easterbrook, a Briton and a previous UK boss, is now the global chief executive. Successful initiatives in the UK business are being exported around the world.

I was sick and tired of people writing myths. To be honest I was pissed off about it.“You read stuff either on Twitter or Facebook or in the news that is just wrong – there is no chicken in your chicken nuggets, there is no beef in your beef burger, there is no potatoes in your fries. You name it, we have had it. “We are tackling the myths head on. It’s important to me. I used to run supply chain. I have been to see all of our suppliers, whether it is in this country or abroad. We have the best standards of any retailer, or as good as any retailer, and I am proud of it. Our meat is 100% British and Irish. We use 17,500 farmers in the UK, who are very proud to supply McDonald’s.”With the government preparing to launch its obesity strategy in the summer and having already announced a sugar tax, the focus on the provenance of McDonald’s food comes at a vital time.Pomroy defends the health credentials of McDonald’s, pointing to its wide range of products.“In a Happy Meal we have reduced salt by 50% and sugar by 30% in the last 10 years. We introduced things like water bottles, fruit bags, carrot sticks. People want choice, they don’t want a nanny state. When you listen to customers, they want to be given control. As a parent, when you sit and talk to them you say: ‘We can do lots of things. We can make it that Happy Meals only come with carrot sticks.’ They are like: ‘Don’t be ridiculous, it’s a treat for my child. But I want the choice.’”So does that mean you can eat in McDonald’s every day?“I would say that with any diet anywhere you would not eat it every day. If you went and just ate salad every day, that is not good for your diet either. Our average customer comes to us just over three times a month. It is about choice.”Pomroy said McDonald’s was trying to break the misconception about its food. “The Big Mac is 508 calories. Now you would struggle to get a sandwich in London for 508 calories. So I am passionate. I know – I have seen the cows, I have seen them grazing, I have seen the beef – it is as good as it gets.“I want people to understand that. But I am not advocating that people have got to eat in McDonalds seven times a week, that’s for sure.”The government’s proposed sugar tax will affect McDonald’s because it sells Coca-Cola soft drinks. Pomroy says the company will have to wait to see the details of the tax before deciding on its approach. At present, customers can swap a fizzy drink in a meal deal for a bottle of water or organic milk for no extra cost.McDonald's offer staff the chance to get off zero-hours contracts Other legislation to which McDonald’s is adapting is the “national living wage”, which means workers over the age of 25 must be paid £7.20 an hour. Unlike some retailers, McDonald’s has decided not to pay that rate to its workers aged under 25 as well. Instead, Pomroy has awarded an average pay rise of 10% across the company, including 14% for those aged between 16 and 18. He has also left all the company’s benefits intact, including free lunches and premiums for working overnight. At the same time, McDonald’s is offering staff on zero-hours contracts the chance to move to fixed hours.“We are not passing it through to customers,” Pomroy says of the wage increase. “The way we are paying for it is by growing the number of people we serve, and it is an investment we are making in our business. I see it as a journey.”The final controversy that Pomroy addresses is tax. McDonald’s is being investigated by the European commission about its tax affairs, in particular deals with Luxembourg about the royalty payments made by its European empire to the parent company in the US.Pomroy says McDonald’s in the UK has paid more than £250m in corporation tax in the last five years.“One hundred per cent of our sales are registered in the UK,” he says. “The only discussion for us in the UK is literally the royalty we pay to our parent. But we are within a percent of the UK corporation tax. I think we are incredibly prudent in our approach to taxation, and I am passionate about that. “People have looked, of course they have looked at us as a UK business. I was CFO, I have sat with HMRC myself in many meetings over the last six or seven years. We are a unique business – we are a British business under an American parent and I am proud of that.’’
