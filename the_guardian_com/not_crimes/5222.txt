Bono’s ego: the final frontier. Following the release of new information, galactic cartographers are invited to get in touch to plot the revised boundaries of the U2 frontman’s self-regard. Current indications place the northern border of this vast entity in low Earth orbit. Specifically, in the International Space Station.According to the latest batch of Hillary Clinton’s private State department emails to be released, Bono is a donor to the Clinton Foundation, presumably as part of his pro bono work. Philanthropy need not always be its own reward and, in the course of discussions, Bono seems to have made an off-topic request to Hillary’s people. As a Clinton Foundation executive puts it in a joint email to both Hillary’s top aide, Huma Abedin, and Bill’s equivalent adviser: “Bono wants to do linkup with the International Space Station on every show during the tour this year.” Well, of course he does.“I’m trying to figure out who the best contact is to talk to at Nasa, or the congressional committee on science and technology,” the charity executive wonders. “Any ideas?” Alas, both aides replied with the same phrase – “no clue” – and nothing more was done. However, U2’s 2009 U2360 concert tour did end up featuring a recorded video segment filmed with various ISS crew. On stage, Bono would credit them with “figuring out how our little planet exists in this cosmos we call home”.But in many ways, we should also credit them with figuring out something ultimately more important. Namely, that there is no escape from Bono. Not only was U2’s album automatically installed on every iTunes user’s library a couple of years ago, but he is willing to pursue you across the galaxy to enforce promotion. There is only one thing more horrifying than the suggestion that in space, no one can hear you scream. And that is the possibility that in space, no one can hear Bono.
