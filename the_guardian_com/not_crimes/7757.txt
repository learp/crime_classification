This is not breaking news but it may still be news to some that London’s new mayor Sadiq Khan will be attending one of the main Pride in London events later this month. Here’s his written reply to a question submitted in May by Labour London Assembly member Tom Copley:During the mayoral election campaign I stated that I’d be proud to be the mayor of a city where those from different backgrounds don’t simply tolerate each other, but respect, embrace and celebrate each other. That is why I am delighted to be attending the Pride celebrations on 25 June this year.I will be walking in the parade alongside thousands of LGBT+ Londoners from across London’s diverse communities, public services, campaigners, the military, sporting groups, charities, LGBT+ businesses and companies and I will also be speaking on the main stage in Trafalgar Square.This commitment pre-dates the Orlando nightclub shootings, whose victims were honoured with a vigil in Soho’s Old Compton Street on Monday evening. Khan, whose headline election campaign pledge was to be “a mayor for all Londoners”, was among the politicians there. He has described the “hideous and cowardly attack” on Orlando’s LGBT community as also being an attack on the freedoms and values of Londoners. He added: “I’m clearly conscious of how vulnerable LGBT Londoners feel at the moment in the context of homophobic crimes going up last year.”Khan, who supported equal marriage rights when he was an MP despite receiving death threats, was quick to make known his zero tolerance stance against homophobic and other hate crimes after becoming Labour’s mayoral candidate last September. During the election battle he spoke at a Kylie-themed fundraiser - entitled Khan’t Get You Out Of My Head - for his campaign at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern (RVT). The RVT, long famous for its cabaret and drag acts, secured protected status last year amid concerns about its future. Khan has promised to change the London Plan to make it more difficult for redevelopment projects to bring about the closure of all types of heritage and cultural venues.
