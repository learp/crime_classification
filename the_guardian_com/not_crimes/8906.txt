Recently this blog published a post by Tom Smart bewailing young people’s preference for smart phones over tulip bulbs, blaming millennials’ lack of patience as the root cause for their lack of interest in horticulture. I’ve also come across this argument in the RHS magazine, The Garden.As a millennial myself, I think this is rubbish. How can young people be accused of lacking patience when we’ll have to wait decades, if ever, until we manage to afford a house and garden? And therein lies the crux of the matter.Gardening requires land - preferably land you own. What young people really lack is not patience, but gardens. In a survey of 500 14-24 year olds, 75% said that they enjoyed growing plants, but many added that they didn’t have the space.Five garden crowdfunding projects to back this spring Most rented flats and houses have no gardens to speak of and landlords tend to be unimpressed if you do start to dig up their lawns. Last year Sue Biggs, director general of the RHS said: “There is a crisis in our front gardens and one of the major strands in it is the growth in rental properties”. She heralds container gardening as a solution for renters, but they tend to be filled with bedding plants which are expensive to replenish seasonally, and often pots of plants left in front of properties get pinched.Even if you are lucky enough to have a garden and an understanding landlord, short term lets make the long term planning and development crucial to a garden impossible. Not for us planting a hedge, or mature perennials. RHS research has found that twenty-somethings only became engaged in gardening once they own their own gardens, which is understandable. An alternative for the pot-bound gardener is volunteering at a community garden; unless you work regular office hours. Many community gardens only run volunteering sessions during week days, I’ve had to search long and hard for one I can go to at weekends. Damn lazy millennials and their nine to five.Gardening has long been linked with benefits to mental health, including stress reduction and attention restoration. More young people suffer from anxiety now than in any previous generation. The benefits of creating opportunities for those who would otherwise be excluded from a chance to garden are obvious.But before this can be done, we need to understand the cause. And millennial bashing won’t get us anywhere. Rather than disparaging young people as “too impatient to garden”, give us a chance to try it.Otherwise we’ll be stuck in our rented rooms Instagramming our sempervivums, which is all we’ll have space for.Emily Mangles spent a year after graduation working as a gardener in Somerset before moving to London to work at a health charity. Her gardening is currently restricted to window boxes and as many plants as will fit in her bathroom.
