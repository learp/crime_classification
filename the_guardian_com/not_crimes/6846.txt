Labor has enlisted the former climate change minister Greg Combet to help develop policies for the next election – including a new climate change stance – as the party debates how to make good its promise to reintroduce an emissions trading scheme.Combet has been employed part time by Labor’s national secretariat to help the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, as the party debates policy ahead of its July national conference and the next election, due in 2016.Labor has yet to make basic decisions about how to implement Shorten’s pledge that it will continue to advocate an emissions trading scheme.Most are envisaging a new cap-and-trade scheme broadly similar to the one introduced during the last parliament, and repealed by the Abbott government.But some are pondering whether the “safeguards mechanism” in the government’s “Direct Action” policy could be dramatically strengthened, forcing polluting companies to reduce emissions or buy pollution permits on the domestic or international markets. This would create a type of emissions trading scheme, but require regulation rather than legislation.And others are concerned at the political and market instability that would flow from Labor putting up another ETS if it could not be passed into law, or if the Coalition again pledged to repeal it. They are determined Labor should have a credible means to achieve Australia’s emissions reductions, but are contemplating a two-stage policy, with immediate action on a stronger renewable energy target, environmental regulation and a strengthening of the existing laws, with an emissions trading scheme as a longer term policy once it has broader support.Shorten first recommitted Labor to taking a carbon price to the next election in an interview with Guardian Australia in March 2014, promising its climate change policy would include a “market-based system”.On the day the House of Representatives voted against the former government’s emissions trading scheme, Shorten told parliament a future Labor government would reintroduce one, saying “any serious policy solution to climate change must, sooner rather than later, include an emissions trading scheme”.But Labor appears to have made few concrete decisions about how to implement the leader’s promises. It is also waiting to see what the government announces as Australia’s post-2020 emissions reduction target. The decision is due late next month.The prime minister, Tony Abbott, has been criticising Labor for its intention to “bring back the carbon tax”, linking the charge to his claim that Labor is the party of “higher taxes”.Combet was elected in 2007 and did not recontest his NSW seat of Charlton in 2013. Since leaving politics he has worked in the superannuation industry.The opposition spokeswoman on families, Jenny Macklin, is spearheading the policy development process inside the parliamentary party.
