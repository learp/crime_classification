Since emerging three years ago, members of the PC Music collective may have failed to become world-conquering superstar acts in their own right, but their jarring pop is finally reaching a global audience via chart-topping proxies. Sophie has worked with Madonna, Hannah Diamond (pictured) and Charli XCX recently collaborated on a song together, and now Danny L Harle (whose Broken Flowers has had a fair amount of Radio 1 airplay) is working with Call Me Maybe’s Carly Rae Jepsen. PC Music’s Pop Cosmos (Scala, N1, 19 May), their first London event in six months, sees Diamond and Harle – along with AG Cook, Felicita and GFOTY – play nicely together …Fresh from four nights at London’s Forum this week, Wolf Alice continue spreading their credible indie rock by joining Fall Out Boy as support for Biffy Clyro at the band’s Glasgow Summer Session (Bellahouston Park, Glasgow, 27 Aug) …Lastly, Hackney trio Hælos, who deliver a trip-hop sound that is rougher and harsher than the original – will embark on a UK tour in support of their recently released debut album (29 Apr-4 May, tour starts Night & Day Cafe, Manchester).
