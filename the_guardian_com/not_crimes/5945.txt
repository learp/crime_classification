The reality TV star and music producer David Gest has died in London at the age of 62, his friend Imad Handi said in a statement.Gest appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in January but left the house for medical reasons. Viewers saw Gest take to his bed as Big Brother informed the audience he was under the weather.Gest was married to Liza Minnelli from 2002-03, but they only officially divorced in 2007. He was also known for being a close friend of the late Michael Jackson.David Gest: from impressario to star of British reality TV Handi said: “It is with great sadness that I can confirm that David Gest has died today. David was truly larger than life. He was not just a huge talent and a dear friend but a showbiz icon. I know he will be missed by millions of fans around the world, and particularly in Britain, who came to love his charm and blistering one-liners.“If I may steal the words of one eminent critic, David was a natural star and a genuine celebrity. I will miss him desperately.”A Metropolitan police spokesman said officers went to the Four Seasons hotel in Canary Wharf, east London, at around 10.15am on Tuesday after receiving reports of an unexplained death. London Ambulance Service staff also attended but he was pronounced dead at the scene.Gest became a public name when he married Minnelli in 2002, although they separated around 18 months later. He sued her for $10m, claiming she had been violent during their marriage. Minnelli denied the accusations, saying Gest was simply after money. The case was dismissed in September 2006.

You look at the minster, the cobblestone streets, the history with the Vikings and the river Ouse running through. It also has the York Hogroast. People come by and see me eating there and I tell them I’m having my turkey and my yorkshire pudding, my stuffing, my crackling, my vegetables and my gravy and I’m loving every minute of it.”Gest grew up in Encino, a wealthy neighbourhood in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. He became involved in the music business when he was a teenager, writing interviews and reviews for newspapers. At the age of 17 he was hired by London Records. “I said I was 21 and I looked that age because by then I had a beard, moustache and an afro down to my tush,” he told the Yorkshire Post. “They hired me as west coast publicity director and the next year I became national public relations director in New York. I was handling the careers of people like Tom Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck, ZZ Top and Al Green.”
