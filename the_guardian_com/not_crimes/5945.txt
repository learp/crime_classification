A top conservationist has called on world leaders and environmentalists to urgently renew their focus on the state of tropical rainforests, arguing that the issue has dropped off the political agenda even though the world is “not far away from a dangerous tipping point”.Claude Martin, the author of a report on the precarious health of tropical forests and a former head of the WWF, said the world ignored the plight of forests at its peril, calling them “vital to the future of humanity” and stressing that governments needed “a wake-up call”.“Tropical rainforests have disappeared from the political radar, having been at the centre of the environmental debate in the 80s and 90s,” Martin said at the launch in Berlin of On the Edge, which was commissioned by the global thinktank Club of Rome. “We need renewed political will to trigger a global conscience about this issue. “Governments are too focused on other environmental issues, as if the forest problems had gone away, when in fact they’re getting worse every day.”He said that while the world’s remaining tropical rainforests cover 16m sq km of land – an area nearly the size of Russia – every year a piece of land “the size of Switzerland is being lost”, mainly to agriculture.The book’s launch came two days after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and her French counterpart, François Hollande, urged 33 environmental ministers to commit to clear, concrete pledges to cut greenhouse gases. The ministers were in Berlin ahead of a United Nations summit in Paris later this year aimed at producing a new worldwide deal on global warming.Martin, who headed the WWF between 1993 and 2005, added: “About half the world’s tropical rainforests remain intact. If we don’t manage to protect them, the sixth mass extinction will become reality in the lifetime of our children and grandchildren. We are literally eating up the rainforest and are not far away from a dangerous tipping point.”Martin said it was time to “put on the agenda once again an issue that has been pushed on to the back-burner”.He said that consumers needed to be made aware of the direct role they could play in putting pressure on politicians and business, by consciously choosing products that were certified “free of the deforestation chain”.On the Edge provides an up-to-date portrait of the health of the world’s rainforests. It brings together satellite imaging and data gathered by economic and ecological experts to predict the likely future of the forests over the next few decades.Martin said it was “totally underestimated” by many, including scientists, the extent to which rainforests were increasingly unable to contribute towards managing the threat of climate change.“For a long time the hope had been that the tropical rainforests could absorb half of the fossil fuel emissions we are producing. But the more the forests become the victims of climate change themselves, because of increasing levels of drought, the more they are in danger of turning into a source of CO2. If we reach the two degree [centigrade] threshold by the middle of this century, many of the forests will turn into a CO2 source and that would effectively lead to a very dangerous tipping point for humanity.”On the Edge follows in the tradition of The Limits to Growth, the first report to the Club of Rome in 1972, which triggered an environmental debate that is still continuing and was credited with kickstarting the green movement.
