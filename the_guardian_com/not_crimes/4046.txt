Charlie Brooker’s dystopian technology series Black Mirror comes to Netflix for its third series at the end of this month.To celebrate, Charlie is returning to the Guardian – home of Screen Burn and his beloved G2 column – to answers questions from readers. They could be about how it feels to see elements of Black Mirror playing out in real life. They could be about hanging around in the green room with Screen Wipe’s Barry Shitpeas and Philomena Cunk. They could be about Nathan Barley, Big Brother or what he had for breakfast. So, have you got a question you’ve always wanted to ask Charlie? Now’s your chance. Just fill in the form below before 6pm (GMT) on Thursday 13 October and we’ll put the best ones to him.
