Pye Corner Audio – Perfect Secrecy ForeverAudio have been making incredible records at an astounding rate for a few years now and I recommend every single one. This is from a recent split album and is classic Italo-themed psychedelic electronic music.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Sheer Mag – Fan the Flames  I finally saw this band at SXSW and they were incredible. All my friends in Glasgow got me into this record, it’s loud and catchy. I can see them doing really well. Every song sounds like a hit.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Lubomyr Melnyk – Parasol  Every record I hear on Erased Tapes is tremendous but this might be the best of them all. Very unique solo piano music. Incredibly soulful and beautiful.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Mdou Moctar – TahoultineI first heard this guy on the incredible Music from Saharan Cellphones compilation and he blew me away. I saw him play last year and was mesmerising. A total rock star.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Minor Victories’ self-titled album will be released through Play It Again Sam on 3 June
