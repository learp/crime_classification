From the sea to the land to the air, EU directives on habitats and birds have protected and enabled the recovery of wildlife, including dolphins, orchids and butterflies and the booming marsh-dwelling bird the bittern.But, with the intensification of farming having seriously harmed wildlife in past decades, the impact of the EU’s huge common agricultural policy (CAP), has often been in the opposite direction.Among the most beneficial of the EU interventions has been the Natura 2000 network of specially protected sites. It now covers 18% of the EU’s land area and half of that area has no protection under national laws, and so would otherwise be unprotected.Sites protected include landscapes and plants, from peatland on the Isle of Lewis to heaths in Dorset, and the delicate fen orchid in Norfolk and Wales. Freshwater pearl mussels and Atlantic oakwoods are among the species and habitats supported by EU funding.The directives have also helped strengthen UK protections that were in place. Before the directives, 10-15% of sites of special scientific interest were damaged every year but this fell to 2-3%.Research has shown that birds protected by the EU directive have fared better than those that are not. The red kite, a spectacular bird of prey, is one success story. Its population was once widespread but persecution almost led to extinction in the UK. However, EU protection has allowed reintroduced birds to flourish and there are now 2,000 in the UK.However, there are 421 million fewer birds in Europe overall than there were 30 years ago, including far lower populations of skylarks, house sparrows and starlings.CAP subsidies that encouraged harmful farming are a significant factor, although some more recent agri-environment measures funded by the policy have reversed declines at local levels in species such as the corn bunting, turtle dove and the marsh fritillary butterfly. Bees and other crucial pollinators could also benefit from an EU ban in 2013 on harmful neonicotinoid pesticides, a move the UK opposed.The RSPB’s Martin Harper says the questions for supporters of staying in the EU are how they would keep the directives intact in the face of pressure from industrial lobbies and how they would reform the CAP. The question for the leave camp, he says, is how they would maintain current levels of protection for wildlife and support for farmers.The father of the prominent leave campaigner Boris Johnson, Stanley Johnson, who helped write environment directives at the European commission, says: “I personally believe that our country’s greatest resource – its nature – will be better protected and better preserved for future generations if we remain an active, full, partner within Europe.”
