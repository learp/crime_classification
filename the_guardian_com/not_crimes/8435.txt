3.24pm GMT15:24That's everything from Marianne.  Guardian contributor MarianneFaithfull 01 February 2016 3:23pmGoodbye everyone - thank you for all your lovely questions. I enjoyed talking to you very much.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.23pm GMT15:23Daniel Theodore Tobilius Watkins says: My question is, will you ever perform an evening in the Weimar Republic type of show/ the songs of 20th Century Blues or similar again?  Guardian contributor MarianneFaithfull 01 February 2016 3:22pmNo - that ship has sailed. Tomorrow I will be doing a broad mixture of different songs from all different periods of my life. And maybe, but only maybe, Warren Ellis is coming- but that's not for sure.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.22pm GMT15:22"My favourite writer is Shakespeare - Hamlet is my favourite."Lilz Zocca asks: My question to you is, which books do you consider your absolute favorites, classic literature or not? If you don’t mind, may I also ask about your likes in the last couple of decades’ music and movies?  Guardian contributor MarianneFaithfull 01 February 2016 3:20pmI read at least three books at a time, I love the classics of course - happy birthday Anton Chekhov. My favourite writer is Shakespeare - Hamlet is my favourite. I have my own little Hamlet, my son. Not so much now, he's grown up, but when he was younger he was very like Hamlet.But I love Nick Tosches, I love William Burroughs, Gregory Corsair, Keats, Shelley, Byron. I'm reading a great book about Mitterand, which is very interesting. And Penny Arcade's book, Longing Lasts Longer, which is very good. Great title, by the way.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.20pm GMT15:20ID707714 asks: What is your relationship to dance given that, your mother was a dancer, and that you have recently worked with the prima ballerina, Marie-Agnès Gillot?  Guardian contributor MarianneFaithfull 01 February 2016 3:18pmThe etoile of Paris. Marie-Agnes is one of my dearest friends, I love doing projects with her, but I most love going to the opera to watch her dance. I think of it as a good evening out. I only saw my mother dance when she was with my father - she was very traumatised, after the war. She did a dance in the drawing room to Beethoven's fifth - I must have been five. And she danced the story of Persephone, when I was about five or six. My mouth just fell open. It's the first time I realised my mother was acting a tragedy.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.20pm GMT15:20"I am just coming to terms with being disabled, and I'm not in the mood for writing songs at the moment."ID8897733 asks: What is your typical day when you are at home?  Guardian contributor MarianneFaithfull 01 February 2016 3:16pmWell, I wake up very early. I play with the computer for a bit, I squeeze two clementines and have a natural yoghurt, and one or two cups of Lapsang Souchong. Then I do my inhalations for my emphysema, and then I go back to bed until 8.30. And then Rochelle comes and makes my vegetable juice - beetroot, ginger, two green apples, and carrot, plus two pieces of brown toast with marmalade, and coffee. And then, if I can stand it, I go for a little walk down the boulevard. And then I have my lunch, which is very healthy, salad or spinach with poached eggs. Then a little nap, then I get up, and I might go for another little walk. I've just been through three years when I've had the most terrible accidents, including a bone infection. I am just coming to terms with being disabled, and I'm not in the mood for writing songs at the moment. It will happen. It's good for me to come to London and play the Roundhouse this week - I'm happiest when I'm performing. I put so much into Give My Love To London, and I like it better than Broken English, the famous comeback album - Give Me Love To London is much more brilliant. I don't see a new record coming out for the next year and a half, but I have the live record coming out. It's soon.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.18pm GMT15:18Coedy Marwood has four questions, including: 3. Is there anyone who you haven’t collaborated with whom you would like to collaborate in the future?  Guardian contributor MarianneFaithfull 01 February 2016 3:12pm3. No. Why should I! I've collaborated with everyone I've wanted to; I know how lucky I am, the people I work with now are the best. One of the things I learned in the theatre is repertory, doing things with the same people again and again, and that way you refine it.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.17pm GMT15:17GlennBrox wants to know: After 50 years in music, what keeps you inspired?  Guardian contributor MarianneFaithfull 01 February 2016 3:11pmThe music. My music. My band, the people I work with. Music is my life. I draw inspiration for songs from absolutely anywhere - not just myself. I've got ideas at the moment, but they're cooking, and I haven't got to the writing bit yet. They cook in my head.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.16pm GMT15:16ID8897733 asks: You said in an interview that you are likely to record EPs rather than full albums in the future. Is that still the case?  Guardian contributor MarianneFaithfull 01 February 2016 3:10pmWell, no, I never meant only EPs, it was something that I would like to do - and then go back to albums. It's not written in stone, it was just a thought. Maybe because I'm lazy and it's less songs to write! And also because I do remember when I was a teenager, I really did enjoy EPs myself.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.16pm GMT15:16"Being taken seriously was absolutely impossible: I was a 'chick'."ohohcheri says: First of all I just want to say that you’re such a badass woman and truly someone that inspires me as a teenage girl! If you don’t mind, I have two questions; Was/is it hard being a woman in this industry and being taken seriously as an artist? And I hope this isn’t inappropriate or offensive but I wonder if you have any nice memories or kind words of Brian Jones, I feel like some people tend to paint him as a mean, sad and almost pitiful person, and so I just wondered if that was always the case or if it’s a one-sided portrayal of him?  Guardian contributor MarianneFaithfull 01 February 2016 3:08pmBeing taken seriously was absolutely impossible. I wasn't even a woman in those days, I was a "chick". It's taken a very long time to be taken seriously. I don't people to take me deadly seriously, that's the wrong impression, I'm not that serious myself- but I am a musician, a writer, and I do make records and performances, and they're good, and I know that. You have to have compassion for Brian. In the beginning he was brilliant, and it was his idea, The Rolling Stones - his problem was he couldn't write songs, and Mick and Keith could, but he sure could play. And of course, he was very beautiful. I can't say I liked him, but I have nothing against him. He didn't deserve to be murdered.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.08pm GMT15:08"How has the internet changed things? Artists aren't really getting paid any more."Magdalena Bee says: I love the phrase ‘candyfloss techno hell’ from “Sparrows Will Sing”. It seems to be alluding to the fact that modern technology is changing humans for the worse. How do you feel about modern technology like the internet and smartphones? And how has the internet changed the music industry or the workflow of working artists like yourself?  Guardian contributor MarianneFaithfull 01 February 2016 3:06pmThat was written by Roger Waters. I wouldn't have an iPhone if they gold-plated it - I hate that kind of thing. I have to have a laptop... I know I couldn't work an iPhone. And how do I know how the internet has changed things?? Artists aren't really getting paid any more - that's how it's changed.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.06pm GMT15:06derekdasilva says: You and Barry Reynolds wrote a song that I think is one of Grace Jones best performances. I’m wondering how it came to be. Was it a cast off from one of your records that then Barry later brought in when working with Grace? Or was it written just for her? And without ruining the world weary enigma of the song, is there anything you might say about it?  Guardian contributor MarianneFaithfull 01 February 2016 3:04pmBarry wrote most of it, he wrote the book actually - and I wrote some of the verses. I remember particularly the one about Jenny Lin - I was there when Jenny Lind first sang... I can't remember what it meant but I wrote it!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.05pm GMT15:05reve88 asks: What was it like to work with Derek Jarman? (Loved that short film for Broken English).  Guardian contributor MarianneFaithfull 01 February 2016 3:03pmDerek Jarman, it was very interesting, and fast, which I liked very much. He was wonderful. At the time, nobody understood it, Island Records didn't get it; it wasn't the sort of film they put on MTV.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.04pm GMT15:04"Terry Wogan was always incredibly kind and good to me."JessBrown1984 says: I was very sad to hear of the passing of Terry Wogan. I heard your interview with him a couple of years ago, what are your fondest memories of him?  Guardian contributor MarianneFaithfull 01 February 2016 3:02pmHe was always incredibly kind and good to me. The most wonderful moment in my friendship with Terry was when he was doing his television chat show, and I had just got clean and sober. My father was still alive, and he was so proud - my poor father had watched people put me down for years, and of course he knew me, and knew I was nothing like how the press made me out. And it hurt him. And Terry Wogan made him proud, and I thought that was wonderful. It wasn't just being on the show, it was how Terry Wogan was with me, his questions. He stood for something - if I really had been what I was represented as, they wouldn't have wanted me. We had a wonderful time in that last interview, and I told him that story - he was very pleased.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
