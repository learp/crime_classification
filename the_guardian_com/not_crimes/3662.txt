Royals make natural photographers, it seems. They are born not just with a silver spoon but a golden camera. First Prince Harry showed his photojournalism from Lesotho, and now the Duchess of Cambridge has been honoured by the Royal Photographic Society for her baby pictures.Could this recognition be a tiny bit sycophantic? The clue is in the institution’s name. The Royal Photographic Society was founded in 1853 and Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were patrons. Yet its new year announcement of lifetime honorary membership for Kate and slavish – sorry, lavish – praise of her “talent and enthusiasm” has irritated a few camera buffs. Sarcastic social media commenters went so far as to joke that she probably “knew someone”, and even compared her with Brooklyn Beckham, who also points a camera about from time to time.

Photograph: The Duchess of Cambridge/APDoes the Duchess of Cambridge deserve to be singled out for her photography? The honest answer is that her pictures are good. Photography is a simple thing and has a lot to do with emotion. Most of us try to use a camera to praise the beauty of people we care about. Kate’s photographs of her children – she snaps other stuff too, but it is her portraits of George and Charlotte that are most memorable – are full of love. Seen with a parent’s eye, they are strong, characterful portraits. I would much rather look at these honest documents of familial love than Mario Testino’s fake flattery of royal glamour.Is the Duchess of Cambridge a photographic genius? No – because there is no such thing. The best photographs are a mixture of technical skill, appropriate equipment and simply being in the right place at the right time. If any concept of creativity is to survive in this technocratic millennium, we desperately need to take a more measured and honest view of what it is to take excellent pictures with a camera, like those Kate has been praised for.A good place to start is the German theorist Walter Benjamin’s famous 1936 essay The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction – the most profound thing ever written about photography, as later writers such as John Berger and Susan Sontag acknowledged.

Photograph: The Duchess of Cambridge/PAFor Benjamin the revolutionary nature of the reproducible photographic image is that it destroys the “aura” that traditionally surrounded the unique work of art, and makes visual imagery functional, ordinary and available to everyone. It inaugurates a truly democratic visual age.The Duchess of Cambridge is a paradoxical icon of this age. For she is not a professional photographer, nor is she claiming to be a great artist. Instead, she excels at photography in the only way most of us all ever can: by looking at what she loves.Kim Kardashian looks at what she loves, too, and so does Sebastião Salgado. If you want to take worthwhile pictures, concentrate on what really matters to you, be it your bum or the lost peoples of the Amazon. It is the scene that is wondrous, not the snapping of the shutter.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Photograph: The Duchess of Cambridge/PAThe trouble is that with the easy availability of good camera technology and the infinite ways to publish images online, it is tragically easy to get confused into believing your snap of a summer sunset or a flower at Kew is a work of art. It is depressing to visit some beauty spot and see hundreds of cameras all taking the same image. That’s banality in motion. Do you really think your eye is better than all the other eyes looking through viewfinders and that your pictures are special just because you took them?For “talent” is not what makes a photograph special. Only one thing matters in photography – and that is content. If you want to take a great photograph you need to discover something unique. If you are Salgado, that means travelling the planet in search of rare and vanishing scenes. For most of us, for amateurs, it means concentrating on what is close and special. It means photographing people and places you love, because the only thing that makes your photography unique is the uniqueness of that love. The Duchess of Cambridge understands this. I’d be proud to have taken her innocent and admirable photographs.
