Run the Jewels’ Killer Mike has taken aim at Hillary Clinton, saying that his conscience wouldn’t allow him to vote for her.Killer Mike, AKA Michael Render, was speaking at a Bernie Sanders rally at Claflin University in South Carolina on Sunday when he made the comments. In particular he criticised Clinton’s response to a recent question from Ashley Williams, an activist for the black liberation movement, Black Lives Matter. During a Clinton fundraiser, Williams asked her if she would “apologise to black people for mass incarceration” and held up a banner with a 1996 Clinton quote that said “we have to bring them to heel”. She was escorted out by security, but the incident was captured on video.

He said: “If I could find a picture of you from 51 years ago chained to a black woman, protesting [against] segregation, and I know that 51 years later you’re willing to fold your arms, hold your head and listen to two black girls yell and scream – rightfully so – as opposed to telling them to ‘shut up’ after you’ve read your own words … as opposed to someone who will tell you ‘later’, when it comes to your children dying in the streets, I know that the only person that I have the conscience to vote for is Bernard Sanders. I know that the only person my logical beautiful black mind will allow me to vote for is Senator Bernie Sanders.”Killer Mike has been heavily involved in the Sanders campaign, interviewing him for the Talking Shop YouTube series and speaking at his events. In 2015, he introduced Sanders in his home town of Atlanta, Georgia.However, Clinton has recently taken the upper hand in the race to be the Democratic candidate for the White House by winning South Carolina with a large majority.
