The writing sessions on Mrs Merton were some of the most fun times I’ve had in TV. The recording nights were nerve-racking but exhilarating. Caroline always exceeded anything we had written or planned.Caroline Aherne's life and career – in pictures I first met her when she was doing the character Mitzi Goldberg, a Jewish country and western singer, and could immediately see she was special. I was very proud that she asked me to write The Royle Family with her and Craig Cash. I co-wrote the first series, but it was very much Caroline’s vision – revolutionary at the time. The BBC couldn’t understand why there was no real plot. Caroline stuck to her guns and history has proved her right.We then co-wrote Mrs Merton and Malcolm. I still find it funny, and I have an autistic son. We were in no way making fun of disabled children. Malcolm was as he was through obsessive mothering. It was about a loving relationship. When it finished, I met Caroline and Craig to talk about what was next. They wanted to write a second series of Royle Family but I was committed to making a film, and sadly never got to work with her again.Caroline was very generous and helped so many people. I do feel privileged to have been a part of those years. As told to Liese Spencer.
