Rachel Lindsay has become the first African American lead to be cast on the romantic reality shows the Bachelorette or the Bachelor.The announcement was made on Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show on Monday evening, after days of rumors that the show’s producers were poised to cast an African American for the first time in more than 30 seasons.While being interviewed on Good Morning America on Tuesday, Lindsay said: “I don’t feel added pressure. I’m honored to have this opportunity and to represent myself as an African American woman.”ABC boss Channing Dungey, who became the first black woman to head a network TV channel, said that the show would cast an African American lead soon while speaking at the TCAs, saying that diversity had improved on the shows.The two shows’ lack of diverse contestants has been criticized for years, and a lawsuit was brought against the production company and the show’s creator, Mike Fleiss, in 2012 by Nathaniel Claybrooks and Christopher Johnson, two African American men who had auditioned for the Bachelor.The class-action suit claimed that the company and Fleiss had “knowingly, intentionally, and as a matter of corporate policy refused to cast people of color in the role of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette”, since the shows started in 2002.The case was thrown out by a judge in October 2012, after she ruled the show’s casting was protected by the first amendment. In 2011, Fleiss put the lack of diversity down to the fact minority contestants rarely come forward to appear on the show. “We always want to cast for ethnic diversity. It’s just that for whatever reason, they don’t come forward. I wish they would.”Last year Fusion reported that 59% of the black contestants who have been on the show exited within the first two weeks. After the lawsuit in 2013, the show cast its first non-white lead in the Bachelor with Venezuelan former footballer Juan Pablo Galavis – but the show’s creators were criticized for choosing a light-skinned south American.In a statement Robert Mills, senior vice-president of alternative series, specials and late night for ABC, said of Lindsay: “She is an accomplished, confident and beautiful woman who knows what she wants in life. We all look forward to joining her on the joyous journey as she looks for that one special man.”Lindsay, who is a lawyer, has already featured in the Bachelor, and will become the Bachelorette on 22 May when the show’s 13th season begins.
