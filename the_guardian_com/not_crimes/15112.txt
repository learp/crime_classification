The US TV network FX plans to examine the fraught relationship between Prince Charles and Princess Diana in the second instalment of its real-life dramatisation series, Feud.According to the Hollywood Reporter and Deadline, Feud: Charles and Diana will air in 2018 across 10 episodes.The series will be a follow-up to Feud: Bette and Joan, which debuts this Sunday and charts the enduring and bitter enmity between the Hollywood actors Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, centered around the film Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?‘I wouldn’t sit on her toilet …’ Screen revival of Davis and Crawford feud sparks sexism debate Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange play the feuding stars, with other big names such as Catherine Zeta-Jones in supporting roles. No casting has been announced for the second, royal-focused series, but a similarly high-profile cast is likely to be recruited.The series has been created by Ryan Murphy, who has a longstanding relationship with FX, with shows including American Crime Story and American Horror Story. Speaking prior the announcement, Murphy described his ideal subjects for future series of the show. “I’m interested in this show being a two-hander that’s really about the human dilemma of pain and misunderstanding. And I think you need a long period of time, maybe 20 to 40 years, to have a big backstory,” he told the Hollywood Reporter.Charles and Diana married in 1981 but separated after little more than a decade, before divorcing in 1996. Diana died in a car crash in Paris in 1997, leading to a national outpouring of grief across the UK. Charles went on to marry Camilla Parker Bowles, with whom he had been romantically involved prior to the divorce. FX, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, started out in the 1990s as a combination of live interactive TV and reruns, but in recent years it has invested in increasingly ambitious original programming.
