Tudors, 12th-century Plantagenets and a Nazi are hot on his foppish heels but Richard III remains the most fascinating figure in the eyes of historians and the public, an annual poll has revealed.BBC History Magazine’s History Hot 100 puts the villainous – or misunderstood – monarch at number one for the second year running, undoubtedly helped by the discovery of his remains under a Leicester council car park.The bones of the last Plantagenet king, who was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, were discovered in 2012, reigniting interest in a king whose reputation as a deformed sadist burns enduringly bright because of Shakespeare.His reburial in Leicester Cathedral in March last year was broadcast live on Channel 4, presided over by the archbishop of Canterbury and attended by members of the royal family as well as a very distant relative in the shape of Benedict Cumberbatch, a third cousin 16 times removed, who read a poem by the Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy.Robert Attar, BBC History Magazine’s editor, said the discovery of Richard’s remains had been the biggest history story for a decade and was still fresh in people’s memories.“He is someone who fascinates people and is the only king that I know of who has several societies dedicated to him. Richard also divides people like few others,” Attar said. “He has a lot of supporters, a lot of people think very highly of him, think the Tudors have maligned him. There’s also a large number of academic historians who have a very low opinion of Richard.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Portrait of Elizabeth I by George Gower.

Thomas Cromwell is eighth. Abiding interest in the second world war, even though it is the centenary of the first world war that is currently being marked, means Winston Churchill is at six (down four), and Hitler is at 10 (up five).In an analysis piece for the magazine, the historian Dan Jones said it had become something of a cliche “to say that history in Britain, from the classroom to the BBC, is mostly about Tudors and Nazis. As with most cliches, this springs from a truth.”Richard is heavily connected to the Tudors, in that Henry VII defeated him at battle, and the top 10 would have been a “Tudor/Nazi clean sweep”, said Jones, were it not for two 12th-century Plantagenets.Eleanor of Aquitaine, queen of England and in her time the most powerful woman in Europe, is at seven, up two; and the knight William Marshal, who served five kings – Henry II, Henry the Young King, Richard, John and Henry III – is at nine, up one.Tracy Borman, a Tudor expert, said there was a simple reason for people’s interest in the period: “The tales of these larger-than-life characters are so remarkable that they read like a far-fetched soap opera. And in the background are seismic events: the Reformation, revolution in government, overseas exploration and unprecedented vibrancy in the art.”Among the interesting new entries in the fun rather than rigorously scientific poll, now in its second year, is the US founding father Alexander Hamilton, entering as a result of the all-conquering Broadway musical set to open in London in 2017. He is at 15, the top new entry, followed by Mathias I (19), Catherine the Great (30), Katherine Parr (31), and the far from well-known 15th-century Hungarian general John Hunyadi.
