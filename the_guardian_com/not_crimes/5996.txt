The footage will be included in a 90-minute special of the series, alongside four “passion project” films chosen by Attenborough from his vast back catalogue.Attenborough said: “I was astonished when someone said we’ve got nearly all the film of the first three expeditions you did in colour. I said it’s impossible, we shot in black and white.”Great Barrier Reef: David Attenborough ignores politics and appeals to the heart Zoo Quest will be shown on BBC4 on 11 May, with Attenborough’s favourite four films to be screened on BBC2. The season of programmes will also include new programmes Attenborough at 90 and Life that Glows, both on BBC2.Cameraman Charles Lagus said: “At its best it’s as good as any colour you see now … quite staggering for the period that it was filmed in. I was astonished.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  David Attenborough: environmentalism is a duty, not an interest – video interviewFor his four passion projects, Attenborough chose 1971’s A Blank on the Map, about a trek into New Guinea in search of a group of uncontacted people known as the Biami, and Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives, from 1989, a journey of discovery to the world’s most famous fossil sites.
