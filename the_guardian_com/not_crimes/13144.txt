Bronze figures of patient commuters that have stood at a railway station for 30 years have been given listed status because of their importance to black British history.The sculptures will be familiar to anyone who has waited for a Southeastern train at Brixton railway station in south London.Commissioned by British Rail, the three figures were made by the artist Kevin Atherton in 1986 and include two thought to be the first public sculptural representations of black British people in the UK.Called Platforms Piece, it is one of three new black history listings announced by the government on the advice of heritage body Historic England, part of its contribution to the BBC’s Black and British season.The others are Brixton Recreation Centre and Ian Walters’ bust of Nelson Mandela on London’s South Bank. All now have grade II listing.Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: “Today’s announcement is part of the work we have been doing to recognise and explore the rich diversity that has been part of our national story for so many centuries.

Atherton wanted models who represented the local community. One of those was Joy Battick, who recalled the fun she had being cast for the sculpture.“But we were serious too because we knew it would be on display to local people forever. Now it’s a real Brixton landmark and I can’t believe that my figure has appeared in a book next to other London statues of people like Queen Boudicca and Winston Churchill.”Not far from the station and also being listed is the recreation centre, or the Rec. It opened in 1985 and is now recognised as one of the finest sports centres to have opened in the 70s and 80s.The third listing is for the Mandela bust, which was completed in 1982 to mark the 70th anniversary of the African National Congress. It was unveiled on the south side of the Royal Festival Hall by the ANC president Oliver Tambo in 1985.Historic England is calling on people to add details of their own stories and pictures relating to black history to the National Heritage List for England.The Black and British season takes place on the BBC this month.
