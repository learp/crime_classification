I called the name that I had rehearsed with, and it was the wrong person.Property aside, what’s the most expensive thing you’ve bought?Elvis Presley’s limo. He ordered it and, when it came, he didn’t want it. There was a refrigerator and you could lay the seat flat into a bed. I paid around $50,000 for it.

I had a baby out of wedlock and married the wrong guy. I would take my own advice and be a young heart running free.Q&A: David Haye, boxer: ‘My guiltiest pleasure? Crisps, late at night’ How do you relax?I like to float around in an inner tube in my swimming pool.What is the closest you’ve come to death?My ex-husband Clarence Carter went to the IRS and told them I hadn’t paid taxes.
