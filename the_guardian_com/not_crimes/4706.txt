Thanks very much for all your questions - I've enjoyed answering them.We hope you’ve all enjoyed reading Nights at the Circus this month on the Reading group - next Tuesday, we’ll discuss which book to read by Anthony Burgess, whose centenary falls this coming Sunday (25 February) – do join us!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.02pm GMT14:02KatyProsser asks:How do you think The Bloody Chamber short stories relate to the novel of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley? Are Carter’s and Shelley’s motives similar?  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:54pmWell, they were both drawn to the Gothic, of course, and both were interested in subverting traditional modes - but I fear this question requires a doctoral thesis to do it justice...FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.01pm GMT14:01'Her favourite authors included Borges, Melville, Dostoevsky, Emily Bronte, Joyce...'GuiltyBystander says:The first two parts of Nights at the Circus are quite different in tone, but both reminded me first and foremost of her short stories (a good sign of a unique voice). The third part, full of disintegrating and disintegrated personalities, really surprised me however. It reminded me more than anything of Gravity’s Rainbow.What do you think Carter’s biggest literary influences were, especially on that particular novel?  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:52pmShe described Nights at the Circus as being "a bit like psychedelic Dickens", and one of the things she was trying to do was to parody the conventions of the nineteenth century literary novel... More generally, her favourite authors included Borges (whose influence on her short stories was enormous), Melville, Dostoevsky, Emily Bronte, Joyce, and French symbolist authors such as Baudelaire. She wore her influences on her sleeve, and you can see the imprint of all those writers and many more on her work...FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.00pm GMT14:00Ashe97 says:Whilst studying Angela Carter’s books in school, I came across an interview where she was very insistent her work not be labelled as ‘modern fairytales.’ Why do you think she felt they needed the distinction, considering The Bloody Chamber was clearly inspired by such tales?  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:48pmI think what she objected to, certainly in the case of The Bloody Chamber, was adjectives like "modern" - she felt that she was extracting the latent content of the original tales, not creating clever new modern takes on them.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.59pm GMT13:59Anbaric asks:How do you, and how did Carter herself, view the film adaptations of her work? I believe she was directly involved in the adaptations herself - did the finished products adequately realise her intentions?  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:46pmThe first film adaptation of her work was The Company of Wolves, which she co-wrote with the director, Neil Jordan. She was delighted with it for the most part, but unhappy with the ending. She'd wanted it to end with the heroine waking from her dream and diving into her bedroom floor, as if into a pool of water - but in the mid-1980s, long before CGI, this was impossible, so Jordan ended it with a pack of wolves bursting into the house. Carter was entirely happy with the adaptation of The Magic Toyshop, for which she also wrote the script.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.58pm GMT13:58nosuchzone says:Carter’s focalisations, the personæ of her fictions, started out with a run of several male narrators in her Bristol period works, a good few kidnapped and astray girls in the scary fairy tales, a male bureaucrat turned libertine, a boy-made-into a-manmade-girl, a winged woman and finally a lady much older than Carter ever got to be. Is there a section, or a paragraph, or a sentence, in her writing where you thought – ah, that’s Carter speaking as herself?  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:43pmHa! Great question. I do think it's a mistake to expect writers to make direct statements via their fiction - especially novelists as provocative and ironical as Angela Carter was - but there are a few moments when it's hard not to read her as if she was speaking as herself. One thing that comes (heartbreakingly) to mind is the passage in Wise Children, written shortly before she was diagnosed with cancer, when her domestic life was happier than it had ever been: "Truthfully, these glorious pauses do, sometimes, occur in the disordered but complimentary narratives of our lives and if you choose to stop the story there, at such a pause, then you can call it a happy ending."FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.56pm GMT13:56IreneLavington says:I remember one interview in the past where Angela Carter said she enjoyed cutting her small baby’s fingernails by biting them. This rather stuck in my memory. During your research, were there any odd facts that stuck in your memory?  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:42pmSo many! The one that first springs to mind right now is that she allowed her two pet birds, Adelaide and Chubbeleigh, to fly free in her sitting room, while her two cats, Cocker and Ponce, were relegated to the garden of her south London home...FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.55pm GMT13:55'My favourite of her books is The Bloody Chamber'semideponent says:I’ve meant to read Angela Carter for several years - after finding her quoted to great effect in Caroline Walker Bynum’s Metamorphosis and Identity. What’s the best story to begin with in your view?  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:40pmHmmm... Tastes differ, and she worked in such a great variety of modes and genres that there are hundreds of equally good embarkation points with her work - but speaking entirely personally, my favourite of her books is The Bloody Chamber, her collection of re-imagined folk and fairy tales, and within that, "The Company of Wolves", an incredibly beautiful and creepy version of Little Red Riding Hood.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.54pm GMT13:54Samuel_Adamson asks:Her libretto of ORLANDO for Glyndebourne was completed, correct? Is it conceivable that some enterprising composer could set it to music?  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:36pmYes, I wish someone would!(You can read more about Carter’s libretto on the OUP blog - Carter was famously negative about Virginia Woolf’s Orlando, calling it “the apotheosis of brown-nosing”.)FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.51pm GMT13:51love_love96 says:I am currently writing an undergraduate dissertation locating Carter’s The Bloody Chamber in relation to 18th Century Conduct books and sentimental literature. Do you feel that The Bloody Chamber is a direct call for women to unapologetically ‘behave badly’, i.e to refuse to be passivity? Best wishes.  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:36pmWell, "direct call" might be putting it a bit strong, but the book is certainly very concerned with female sexuality, and with the cultural forces that have acted against women embracing those sides of themselves…FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm GMT13:49'She described Arthur C Clarke as "possibly the most boring man in the entire universe…"'siancain has a question:Did Carter read much science fiction? Did she ever see some of her writing coming under that term or did she veer towards the label speculative fiction more?  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:35pmYes, she did! She was hugely influenced by New Worlds magazine in the 1960s, and by the work of J G Ballard and Michael Moorcock in particular. She was guest of honour at various science fiction conferences, and was very flattered to be invited. (When she met Arthur C. Clarke, though, she described him as "possibly the most boring man in the entire universe…")FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.47pm GMT13:47Michealmack asks:Firstly I was wondering if Carter knew that Wise Children would be her last novel? And if she did, isn’t it amazing that it’s such a wonderful Shakespearian whirligig, stuffed full of life, riotous, hilarious & heartbreaking zinger of a novel?! At the very least it should have been shortlisted for the Booker. I recall the disappointment at the time it was passed over. Do you think the Booker mattered to Carter? I know (as does Selina Scott) that she was a judge in 1983 when Coetzee won. Do you know if he was her choice?   Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:33pmNo, she didn't know she was ill when she was writing Wise Children - she was diagnosed with cancer between delivery and publication. Coetzee - or, as she always called him, "that boring South African" - was certainly not her first choice for the 1983 Booker! She wanted Rushdie to win for the second time.(Rushdie was shortlisted for Shame; Coetzee won for Life & Times of Michael K)FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.43pm GMT13:43Jericho999 asks:Do you think Angela Carter critiqued magical realism as much as she embraced it? (I’m thinking especially of books like Dr Hoffmann... Oh and how comfortable was she with the magical realist tag?)  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:32pmI think Hoffman is the novel of hers that most neatly fits the magical realist corner people often try to put her in... She wrote it after encountering Borges and Garcia Marquez, and was quite open about their influence on it. Later, as magical realism became more fashionable in Britain, she tried to distance herself from it, and in later years she tended to deny that she was a representative of the genre at all.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.41pm GMT13:41weegie says:I fell in love with Angela Carter’s writing when I was in university and I read pretty much everything she wrote; I feel that now she has been almost forgotten. Magic realism, ornate language, and of course feminism have fallen out of fashion or been subject to a powerful backlash. Do you agree that she has fallen out of favour? Are there any indications that there will be a renaissance of interest in her writing (apart from with your biography)? how are the cultural trends she was a part of still alive?  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:29pmI think there's a great revival of interest in Angela Carter at the moment, and not just because of my book. There's an exhibition of art that inspired her, and art that she's inspired, currently on at RWA Bristol - I haven't yet been to see it, but I've heard great things. The Bloody Chamber is currently on the A-Level syllabus. And there's been some talk of a new BBC documentary about her life and work, although I'm not entirely sure what's happening with that… I also think there's a great resurgence of feminist writing and activism at the moment (a lot of it in a spirit much closer to Carter's feminism than many of her contemporaries were…)(The RWA Bristol exhibition is on until 19 March, if you are a big Carter fan or keen after reading Nights at the Circus with us).FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.39pm GMT13:39'I think Angela Carter's work has survived - and should continue to survive - incredibly well'nilpferd asks:In our discussions on Nights at the Circus there seems to have been a split between people who loved the novel unconditionally, and those who couldn’t get into it at all. Of the latter, some have said they found the style off-putting, while others have considered it too much “of its time”. Yet it seems to me that Carter’s fluid gender politics ought to be ideal for our times.How do you think she’ll be seen by coming generations? And will she remain an acquired taste, or might her works “cross over” into more mainstream acceptance?  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:27pmI think Angela Carter's work has survived - and should continue to survive - incredibly well. That's partly because she was never particularly interested in recording the social minutiae of life in late-twentieth century England - she was more interested in the underlying structures of society, and those change much more slowly. She also has this incredible linguistic vitality, and that ages very well. So to me, her work feels a lot less dated than most other books published in the 1960s, '70s and '80s… Mainstream acceptance, though? Depends what you mean - I'd say she already has a pretty massive readership for such an arty novelist!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.36pm GMT13:36GuiltyBystander says:Hi Edmund! My partner has just bought The Invention of Angela Carter for me for Valentine’s day; I’m very much looking forward to tucking into it.In Nights of the Circus, which we’ve just read, Carter’s interest in folklore, fairytale and myth is wedded to her feminism and interest in women. Judging by The Magic Toyshop, this was always a combination that factored into her work, and yet Carter herself claims to have had her awakening well afterwards, during her Japanese years.Was Carter myth-making even her biography, or do you think her work from Love onwards has a marked shift in emphasis?  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:26pmWell, Love was actually written before she went to Japan - its appearance was delayed because she moved publisher - and she spoke of herself as a feminist before she moved there, too. I think what happened in Japan was that she was appalled by the absolute polarisation of the sexes and, as she put it, "became radicalised." But her feminist instincts were in place much earlier, and you're right to notice them in novels like The Magic Toyshop.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.34pm GMT13:34'Carter was not just one of the most intelligent English writers of the last century, but a human being of exceptional moral and personal courage'Homonecans asks:How did you end up feeling about Carter? Anthony Burgess’s biographer famously found out that he despised his subject. Presumably you admired her as a writer before you started, how do you think you can disentangle that skein of regard and admiration to be objective about her?(The Burgess biographer mentioned is Roger Lewis, if you’d like to read a review of that biography – Blake Morrison did not enjoy it.)  Guardian contributor Edmund_Gordon 24 February 2017 1:25pmI found that my admiration for her only increased as I went on. She was a truly remarkable person - not just one of the most intelligent, most imaginative English writers of the last century, but a human being of exceptional moral and personal courage. I don't know if I could have finished the book if I'd grown to dislike her. As a biographer, you spend so much time with your subject, and get to know them so intimately, that it must be an appalling burden if you end up despising them. The Burgess biography that you mention, by Roger Lewis, is a very odd book indeed - brilliant in its way, but actually more interesting as an autobiography than a biography. Andrew Biswell's subsequent biography is better if what you're after is a book about Burgess's life.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
