Made in Chelsea star Mark-Francis Vandelli has become the fourth celebrity to leave Channel 4’s The Jump after fracturing his ankle.The 26-year-old was taken to hospital after injuring himself in a tumble during a challenge on Sunday’s show and will not be returning to the competition.Channel 4 launches safety review of The Jump as celebrity casualties mount A Channel 4 spokeswoman said: “Whilst racing during the show on Sunday evening, Mark-Francis fell, injuring his ankle. He received immediate medical attention but sadly will not be able to continue in the competition due to an ankle fracture which has now been treated.”Fellow contestant Brian McFadden sparked speculation that Vandelli had undergone an operation when he posted a now-deleted picture of the reality star in a hospital bed.According to the Mirror, he captioned the picture: “Even post surgery MarkVandelli looks like a Versace model!!!”On Monday night, Vandelli posted a picture on Instagram of him sightseeing in Innsbruck, Austria, but did not mention his injury. He joins a long list of injured celebrities forced to pull out the winter sports show. Competitor Beth Tweddle, 30, remains in hospital following neck surgery which involved having a piece of bone taken from her hip after a fall on the slopes during rehearsals for the latest series of the winter sports show.Fellow Olympian Rebecca Adlington and Holby City actress Tina Hobley have also withdrawn because of injury, while athlete Linford Christie has been forced to take time out due to a hamstring injury but hopes to return to the show.Channel 4 have confirmed they will review safety procedures on the show.A Channel 4 spokeswoman said: “The Jump is now in its third series and since launch 46 celebrities have taken part successfully. Though it is a new course, the events have been designed to be no more difficult than in previous years and all contributors have undertaken a rigorous training programme to prepare them for the show.“All winter sports carry some element of risk but in light of the number of injuries this year, Channel 4 has asked the producers to review safety procedures again to further reduce the prospect of accident.”British former ski jumper Eddie “The Eagle” Edwards defended the show’s producers and has said celebrities should “bear the brunt of the blame” for any injuries they suffer while taking part in The Jump.The 52-year-old, who represented Britain at the 1988 Winter Olympics and worked as an expert on the previous two series of the Channel 4 show, said the growing number of stars on the injury list was not solely down to producers and suggested the contestants needed to practise more.Tweddle described the last 48 hours as “very scary” after the operation in which surgeons took a bone from her hip and used it along with pins to fuse together two fractured vertebrae in her neck.Her exit follows that of Adlington, 26, who withdrew on medical advice after a shoulder injury. She told host Davina McCall the fall was “literally the worst thing that has ever happened to me, it was worse than childbirth”.And Hobley, 44, also quit after she dislocated her elbow and suffered two fractures to her arm.
