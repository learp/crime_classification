In reference to your article (Why working parents like me dread the summer holidays, theguardian.com, 22 July), I thought I might share an idea I used to use when my children were young.When they were young teens, they always got bored towards the end of August. One year I came up with a “feed yourself” week, which they loved doing, and it became a regular feature in later summer holidays. They were each given a budget to spend and some basic rules on healthy eating (ie you cannot live on sweets and biscuits for a week).They had to plan their own menus, using cookery books if needed, keeping the cost of their main ingredients within their budget (not including basics such as milk and butter). I took them to the supermarket and they did their own shopping for their food. At home they had their own space in the fridge and pantry. Then they made their own meals for the week and, being quite competitive, they were constantly comparing with each other as to who had the “best” meals. It was fun, educational and helped fill up a wet week at the end of August.The trick is in the timing – introduce the idea when they are really bored and the weather is bad. I plan on doing it again this year when I am childminding my grandchildren aged eight and 10!Linda WhiteWhitley Bay, Tyne and Wear • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
