Before I go out, I like having an afternoon watching TV and loads of time to get ready, but quite often I’ll end up not going out because I really like having time to myself.When I am on tour, I use a stylist called Dean Bright but, going out-wise, I dress down. My favourite outfit is my skinhead jeans (which are quite tight and look like they’ve had bleach thrown over them), with a T-shirt and jumper or nice jacket, trainers or shoes. If I find shoes that I really love, I wear them all the time. I have had one pair of brown leather lace-ups that I bought in Hamburg 30 years ago. I had them resoled and they look almost brand new.Two or three days before a night out, I save my shave and let my beard grow. On the night, I have a bath and give my face an exfoliating scrub. Then I’ll shave and my face will be nice and smooth. I sometimes use compact powder and I put concealer under my eyes. I first had my eye bags done when I was 40 (I am 51 now) and I had a chin tuck. The year before last I had my eye bags done again – they suck a bit of fat from your belly and put it in under your eyes to fill them out. It really works. I feel happy now. I look quite good in my own skin. I don’t want to do too much and start looking too ridiculous.How I get ready: Neil Morrissey, actor I’ve still got hair but it’s getting thinner. Every time I go to the hairdresser they say, “Oh you should use this and that” but I just towel-dry it and comb it over. I might have to start using a bit of gel to thicken it up a bit. I have highlights and I use that shampoo by John Frieda that makes your hair blonder each time. I actually put it on hair elsewhere on my body, too, as it works quite well!• Andy Bell’s latest album, Torsten – The Beautiful Libertine, is out now.
