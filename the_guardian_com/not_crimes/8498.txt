Farmers should be allowed to continue to sell unpasteurised milk from their own farms or at farmers' markets and via the internet, under government proposals for new food safety regulations.But wider retail sales from outlets such as vending machines or dispensers in shops should remain illegal and the rules made more clear, the government's Food Standards Agency will recommend in a consultation document.In a review of the public health risks associated with raw milk, the FSA sets out four options ranging from removing all restrictions on sales to making all milk pasteurised before it goes on sale. The review applies only to England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as the sale of unpasteurised milk is banned in Scotland.The consultation follows an investigation after the London department store Selfridges installed vending machines selling unpasteurised milk supplied by a Sussex farmer, Stephen Hook, in December 2011.Raw milk may contain bacteria such as salmonella and E coli, which can cause food poisoning, and the FSA warned at the time that the move was in breach of food hygiene regulations. It threatened legal action against both parties but then agreed to a broader review, leading to the three-month consultation.Hook has been selling unpasteurised drinking milk from Longleys Farm in Hailsham since 2007, and claims that consumers enjoy health benefits.The FSA is seeking views on the four options but says its preferred approach is to retain the restriction on sales while adding clarity to the rules. This would allow raw milk and cream to be sold directly by farmers to consumers, as in the current regulations.In addition, the FSA would clarify the rules around other sales outlets, standardise labelling and work with producers to harmonise controls for raw milk from species other than cows, such as goats. Farmers would be able to sell raw milk directly to consumers via the internet and vending machines placed at the farm or farm shops.Internet sales were not included in the scope of the original regulations drawn up in 2006, although the FSA permits them provided that consumers are buying the milk directly from the farmer.Raw milk dispensers are hugely popular on the continent, allowing customers to fill their own glass bottles. But in the UK the sale of raw milk has always been much more tightly regulated.Steve Wearne, head of policy at the FSA, said: "[Our] view remains that pasteurisation is the best way to address the risk from raw milk because this will destroy any germs that might cause illness. However, we acknowledge there is a market for raw milk and strong support for consumers to be allowed to make informed choices."Our preferred approach therefore seeks to strike the right balance between allowing consumer choice and protecting public health."
