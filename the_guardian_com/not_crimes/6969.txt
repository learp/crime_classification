In five wordsNot just Romeo and Juliet.Sound of the city The River Adige is the focus of the city. In 49BC, Romans designed Verona inside a bend of the waterway, which worked as natural defence. Today, that area corresponds to the core of the city and is connected to the rest of Verona by a series of bridges.From its start at an Alpine pass of around 1,500m, the river can be crystal clear, shining between light green and pinkish grey. During heavy rains, however, this pearly water turns into a violent brown mass, dragging mud, branches and ducks through the city. One flood was so devastating that there still is a plaque three metres above the banks marking the water level on 17 September 1882, before the embankments were constructed.

Not just for religious reasons, but because the big square in front is where old people chat, others read and children play. Of course, they also love its beauty: San Zeno is a magnificent example of Romanesque architecture.

Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Biggest controversySince mayor Flavio Tosi was first elected in 2007, the town hall has sold many historical buildings owned to private companies, often despite public opposition. An ongoing case concerns the  vast Hapsburg arsenal from the 19th century that was given to the city by the Italian Army in 1995. It functions as a large public garden, yet a big part of the building still needs to be structurally secured. The city’s administration recently approved a project with private firm Italiana Costruzioni, which is likely to alter the structure of the building, but a citizen-founded committee is opposing this decision. They are instead asking for a cultural centre, designed in collaboration with Fondo Ambiente Italiano (FAI), a national trust protecting Italy’s natural and cultural heritage.Most under-rated location?Ex Macello is an ancient building on the River Adige.

That was the beginning of the famous Arena Opera Festival, which continues to takes place every summer in our city.What does your city does better than anywhere else?Wine. The countryside around Verona is cultivated primarily with vineyards and the range of wines is incredibly diverse: from homemade Valpolicella Classico to the award-winning Amarone, from Custoza (a white wine perfect with lake fish) to the sweet red Recioto dessert wine.
