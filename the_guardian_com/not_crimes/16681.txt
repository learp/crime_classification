Just a few months ago, the momentum behind the plans for a new concert hall in the City of London seemed irresistible. Conceived as a world-class new home for the LSO, as the orchestra looked forward to a new era under its incoming principal conductor, Simon Rattle, it was a venue that would attract the cream of visiting orchestras from around the world. The scheme to build the new hall on the current site of the Museum of London had been given the green light in a feasibility study undertaken by the former artistic director of the National Theatre, Nicholas Hytner, and received backing from the government in general and chancellor George Osborne in particular.Those who thought the whole thing an unnecessary extravagance, a vanity project dreamed up by Rattle and Nicholas Kenyon, director of the Barbican Centre, at a time when arts organisations across the country were struggling to fund performances in the spaces that already existed, were drowned out by those determined to give the returning hero Rattle whatever he wanted. The deal, apparently, was as good as done.Government pulls its funding for London concert hall However, amid the swirling financial uncertainty that has followed the Brexit vote, it always seemed unlikely that the City of London, which is already a generous benefactor of the Barbican, would easily find the sums necessary for such an ambitious scheme. Now Theresa May’s government has withdrawn its support for the early stages of the project, and that, apparently, is that.The fact remains that London already has plenty of concert halls, including more medium-sized ones than it realistically needs and can convincingly fill most of the time, and two respectable, if not truly exceptional, full-sized ones in the Barbican Hall and the Royal Festival Hall. There may not be an auditorium in the UK capital that comes close to the warmth and clarity of the sound in the finest European halls, such as Symphony Hall in Birmingham, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam or the Musikverein in Vienna, but neither is the sound in the current Barbican or the Southbank’s Festival Hall as disgraceful as some suggest.One of the ironies of Rattle’s campaign is that where the LSO’s Barbican concerts under his predecessor Valery Gergiev often sounded overbearing and coarse-grained, his own recent performances with the orchestra there have revealed so much more subtlety and refinement, suggesting that not all the previous problems can be blamed on the acoustics.LSO/Simon Rattle review – glorious season finale Potentially, London already has two first-rate arts complexes, even if one of them, the Southbank Centre, seems more interested these days in functioning as a drop-in centre and internet cafe than in presenting the year-round programme of top-quality music-making it was designed for. Had the Southbank Centre been fulfilling its proper role effectively in recent years, one suspects, attracting the full range of international talent it should, then the clamour for yet another space across the river might have been less insistent. Meanwhile, the Barbican continues to go from strength to strength and offer an ever-increasing range of world-class music as well as theatre. It has been so successful in recent years, one can understand why Kenyon and his team were so keen to add another venue to their roster. That, though, is not apparently to be.
