2.05pm BST14:05  Guardian contributor Woody Harrelson 01 May 2017 2:03pmI'd just like to say thank you to everybody who took the time out of their day to be a part of this. I know there were a lot I didn't answer, but there were literally hundreds! I was a captive of how much time I had. Also, I really hope you guys go see Lost in London, because it's a labour of love, and a lot of great people spent a lot of time working on it. And having said all that - have a great day!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.03pm BST14:03The banter between the Cheers actors was so funny I was literally laughing all day – does it get any better than that?Proselytiser asks:Cheers has withstood the test of time and is as charming now as it was 20 years ago. Did you have any inkling back then that you were joining a show destined for such longevity?  Guardian contributor Woody Harrelson 01 May 2017 2:02pmI knew it was a good show, of course, but you never know if something will stand the test of time. It is gratifying that people love the show so much. I was lucky to work with that whole gang - it was like going to work at a playground every day. One of the things I learned was - I love the writers/producers work ethic. If a joke wasn't working they'd make it work. They were unrelenting in the pursuit of excellence. If a joke wasn't working during the shooting of the show, they would stand round the bar in a circle, and pitch jokes to each other - it might take 15 minutes. I just love the fact that they always wanted to make it great. And I think ultimately they succeeded. I think that what happens is people fall in love with characters. The characters were really interesting and played by great actors - I still marvel at how Ted Danson and George Wendt and Rita Perlman and Kirstie Alley and John Ratzenberger and Kelsey Grammar - I just marvel at how great they were. What a privilege to get that time with them. It was a remarkable journey. It's cool to have a joke or two in one story, that you know a) millions of people are going to see on Thursday and b) you know they're going to laugh. That's not something you get very often, no matter what you're doing. And the banter between all these actors was so phenomenally funny I was literally laughing all day - does it get any better than that?  Cheers.

Guardian contributor Woody Harrelson 01 May 2017 1:57pmI think The Messenger was very hard, because imagining myself as a career military guy, it's pretty far from who I am. And the fact I was working on another movie in Romania, and had to leave that movie, go shoot this in under a month, and go back to Romania to finish the other movie, just didn't give me any prep time. But I watch it, and I love it. I think Ben Foster is one of the great young actors. And my performance turned out OK, in spite of all the obstacles.  The Messenger, 2009.

Guardian contributor Woody Harrelson 01 May 2017 1:55pmIt's gratifying to hear people ask about Rampart. It was not a good release - you can make a movie that's really good, but it's put in the hands of a distributor, who may or may not care about it. Certainly in the case of this movie, I don't think they released it well. But fortunately I've heard from a number of people who seem to like it. That's the good thing about projects that fail, you get to see them later on. Like Out of the Furnace, it's dark, but it is very well done. Scott Cooper, great director. Another movie of his I'm looking forward to seeing again is Hostiles with Christian Bale, it's phenomenal. But I don't see a sequel happening to Rampart - my understanding is that a movie has to be even mildly successful to think about sequel...Rampart – review   Woody Harrelson in Rampart.

Guardian contributor Woody Harrelson 01 May 2017 1:53pmWell, I quit, so I must! On the other hand, pretty much every day I'm tempted to go back to smoking. There's nothing wrong with smoking pot, if you can do it moderately, and I was in a perpetual fog, be it London or San Francisco. I felt like I wasn't as emotionally connected to people around me. I feel more emotionally available now. I cry sometimes.

Guardian contributor Woody Harrelson 01 May 2017 1:51pmI love Michael Franti and his latest album is phenomenal. His band is called Spearhead. In a sense it's like U2 - very political, there's songs with incredible messages, and it's also musically great. His latest single, my God it's good! There's an incredible video he did, Once a Day... there's this video that's so happy and optimistic. And just the philosophy of the music is incredible - it's something the world is lucky to have.I love Alt-J, Kasabian, Elbow, Arcade Fire, The Killers I've been on a kick with. I love Dave Matthews. And of course, Willie Nelson. I think U2's latest album is the one I'm looking forward to, as well as the latest Alt-J album - those are the two I'm really anticipating. And Bruno Mars! Went to that show, it was off the hook. And i'm getting into Donald Glover - aka Childish Gambino- because I'm working with him now. He did a rap album, but came along with this R&B, funk, soul album - it's so good.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.46pm BST13:46I feel lucky to have been in a U2 video, because I'm such a fan. They have never sold out, never kowtowed to the mainstreamstuckinazoo asks:The U2 video seemed to come out of leftfield. How did you and your daughter’s involvement come about?  Guardian contributor Woody Harrelson 01 May 2017 1:44pmThe album was Songs of Innocence, a phenomenal album. Bono was visiting Maui, and we were hanging, and he asked me if I wanted to do this video and maybe Zoe my daughter would like to be in it as well. I love the way he presented the idea. He said: I would never do this, but you should! So I couldn't not do it. And I really like how it ended up, and feel lucky to be in a U2 video, because I'm such a fan. I think just generally the music is phenomenal, the content of the lyrics and the musicality is as good as it gets. The band have never sold out, and although their songs are very popular, they've never kowtowed to the mainstream. One of my favourite albums is Pop, which was universally panned, and maybe did least well in terms of sales. It's maybe my favourite album of theirs. Of course they've got one coming that's been two years in the making - it's supposed to be finally coming out soon. Well it better be, because their tour starts in three weeks?Updatedat 1.47pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.42pm BST13:42mataubrey asks:Do you still play football? Your winning penalty for the Rest of the World at Soccer Aid was the stuff of dreams (also a fan of your acting)!  Guardian contributor Woody Harrelson 01 May 2017 1:40pmI do still play, and I love it, although I had never done a penalty kick before in my life - it was the stuff of dreams to do it in front of 95000 people at Old Trafford, and 10 million people watching on television. Frankly, since I was on the Rest of the World team against England, I didn't feel very popular. The goal was met with a profound silence in the stadium - I wondered if it was even a legal goal. It wasn't until I flew to Ireland the next day that I got a lot of pats on the back.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.41pm BST13:41kcsLeeds asks:Could you give us three pros and three cons of being a vegan?  Guardian contributor Woody Harrelson 01 May 2017 1:39pmThe pros are you generally have more energy, although you could be a vegan and just eat potato chips and cereal and pasta. I feel it's the raw component is very important, you need your enzymes, almost more than any other notion about food - you don't have to worry about protein, carbs, and fats, you get those things, animals in nature don't worry about that. my reason for becoming vegan, mostly raw, is energy. You can feel somewhat ethically clean about the source of your diet too, and also about the fact your diet doesn't contribute to a lot of ecological problems. Because after all, it takes something like 1500 gallons of water to make a pound of beef. No to mention all the methane that cows produce. And the horrors of factory farming. I don't see the con side. I experienced both, I used to be a meat eater, and I don't see the downside. The one thing is you take a little longer to order a restaurant, and incur the wrath of those around you who think you're crazy for being vegan.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.38pm BST13:38ianita1978 asks:What is your favourite way to escape the craziness of Hollywood?  Guardian contributor Woody Harrelson 01 May 2017 1:35pmI live in Hawaii, and have the greatest family I could imagine, and the most incredible friends, so it's very easy for me to escape the craziness. When I go home it's about as far away as it could be. After Cheers ended, I was certain I didn't want to raise my kids in Los Angeles, so set about looking for where we would raise them. No place was off limits. We went to Australia, New Zealand, Europe, looking for a home, and ended up in Costa Rica for a few years. I was in LA, and my buddy asked if I wanted to see Willie Nelson in concert - afterwards this lovely lady asked if I wanted to meet Willie, I said sure, went on the bus, smoke billowing out, and through it all I see a man holding up a fattie, saying come on in, let's burn one! I had the greatest conversation, and after maybe a couple of hours of talking, he said if I was ever in Maui, come and stay at my place. I said: well, sure. And after that visit to Maui, I had a sense that is where I would end up living - and sure enough, that's what happened. I can't imagine a better place to raise a family. The natural beauty, the chill people who are so cool and funny.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.33pm BST13:33ID3334123 3d asks:Woody, I cannot wait to see Wilson. Will you be working on any future Dan Clowes projects? (hint: I’d love to see you playing ‘future’ Jack in Patience)  Guardian contributor Woody Harrelson 01 May 2017 1:32pmI don't think I will be in any more Clowes - I would, but the odds seem astronomical. I love Wilson, I think it came out exceptionally well, and it's cool that Picturehouse are showing that too. A real opportunity to get back to some comedy and work with my dear friend Laura Dern, who I love a lot. It was a great experience. Wilson is based on a Daniel Clowes graphic novel, which is itself very funny and well done. The character is a bit of a misanthrope, and a curmudgeon, except he's kind of very outgoing and wants to connect with people - so there's a real interesting dichotomy in his nature. He doesn't have a lot of friends, and ends up finding his old girlfriend, played by Laura Dern, and then discovering from her that she had their child who's now 16, and has been adopted. And so he goes about trying to put together this family but of course there's a lot of problems on the road to doing that. And all the hardship is material for good comedy - Craig Johnson who directed it also did Skeleton Twins, he's really a great director. It's very cool to be part of that. I prefer comedy so it's really nice to get back to doing that. I think if I got a chance I would just do comedy, but on the other hand there's films like The Glass Castle, which has comedic moments, but it's a phenomenal movie and I can't imagine not having done it. Or a movie like LBJ which has a considerable amount of comedy but I guess you'd have to call it a drama. That also hasn't come out yet. There's parts I've chosen, even Three Billboards is a comedy with some tragic elements. In many ways my character is the dramatic relief, and I wouldn't want to miss doing that.Wilson review – Woody Harrelson and Laura Dern in mostly charmless adaptation   Laura Dern and Woody Harrelson in Wilson.

He has a way with words that's extraordinary, finding the poetry in the dirtbookchick56 asks:If you could play any role – any character from history, literature, any religious character, absolutely anyone, man, woman, animal – who would it be, and why?  Guardian contributor Woody Harrelson 01 May 2017 1:26pmProbably Jesus... no! I think right now the character that intrigues me is Clarence Darrow - an incredible character from history, and a man of the people, he fought for labour, he fought for the working man, although he did do things for captains of industry which surprised me. The other guy I would be interested in playing is Henry Miller, one of the greatest writers of all time. The autobiographical nature of his writing inspired me to do Lost in London, I wouldn't have done such a personal story had I not been such a fan of Henry Miller. He has a way with words that's extraordinary, but also has a way of catching gritty dark moments, and finding the poetry in it. Finding the beauty in the dirt. I find him fascinating.Updatedat 1.32pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
