How can local authorities and community groups ensure a meaningful connection with the wider public? There is no easy answer. You guys probably have a better idea on how to do this than central government and that is why we need your observations to provide evidence. This agenda can't just be about those who are already involved; we need to scale up. Roping in friends and family is always a good start. Twitter (@Gregbarkermp) helps, of course, as does finding new ways to address these issues in the language of ordinary people, not just using in the lingo of us committed "tree-huggers".Do you plan to investigate crowdfunding more closely and develop it as part of the overall strategy?I am looking forward to hosting a round table on crowdfunding and democratic finance in September. I am really keen to help drive this innovative and potentially scaleable source of funding for community projects.To get behind this new sector we need to better understand the barriers and what's stopping people from taking it up on a bigger scale. It would be great if everyone could also contribute their ideas, including those on crowdfunding, through our current evidence call on Community Energy.Does the concept of a local energy market that benefits the community through local ownership, generation and supply fit in with your thoughts about the future of energy markets?I want local energy markets to take off just in the way the local food economy is growing. Just as people look to buy locally I want residents to adopt a local mindset for community scale renewables.Licence Lite is being pioneered by the Greater London Authority, but I want to use that learning to roll this out around the country. I want to allow a new generation of small-scale local power producers to cut through the current complex electricity market regulations and sell direct to customers. Cutting red tape and bureaucracy to let in the electricity entrepreneurs is the way forward.Will community-led renewable energy schemes have direct access to the Green Investment Bank for funding?The Green Investment Bank (GIB) is investing in a range of exciting green technology, some of which is appropriate for ambitious community schemes. There is no specific mandate yet for community-led investments, and any investment has to be commercially viable (the GIB does not do grants or soft loans), but I hope more community projects, particularly the larger scale ones, will consider the GIB.Given the economy's need for more capital spending, why on earth does the Green Investment Bank not have borrowing powers?The GIB will start borrowing in due course –that has always been our vision – but we have to deal with Labour's deficit first before we unleash GIB on the debt markets.However, despite the squeeze on public finances, it has a whopping £3bn to invest and just a few weeks ago secured extra firepower when I helped deliver a strategic investment link up with the UAE to invest in great UK Green projects.• What do you think?
