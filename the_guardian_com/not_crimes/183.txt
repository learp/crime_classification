While much of the world has been enthralled by the charms of Pokémon Go for the past month, there have been certain international pockets of resistance.On Monday Iran became the first country to ban the augmented reality game, citing security concerns over its location-based technology, and in Russia officials have been whipping up hysteria over possible hidden dangers in the western-made game.State TV channel Zvezda, run by the Ministry of Defence, recently published an article claiming that the CIA was interested in them because “they placed a Pokémon gym in our building”.

But the game has advantages too.

But then you download Pokémon Go and discover that you’ve been walking past historical reliefs of cute cats and a monument to Kolobok, the cartoon bread roll from Russian fairytales, without ever knowing.It’s also a welcome reminder that Vladimir Lenin lived in nearly every building in your neighbourhood – you just stopped noticing the commemorative plaques.How Pokémon Go takes us back to the real world Such benefits have been recognised by the Moscow authorities who have developed a Pokémon Go style app to encouraged tourists to hunt out the city’s historical landmarks.But are Russian users vulnerable to local inference? While Varlamov’s comparison to political protests is a stretch at best, it does highlight Russia’s current laws and how they might be misused in the future. A Russian law banning “unsanctioned gatherings”, initially used to shut down political protest and marches for LGBT rights, has been recently used to persecute non-political activities.In several cases musicians playing on the streets of Moscow have been fined, not for begging, exceeding noise levels or public disorder, but organising a “mass gatherings of citizens”.Almost everyone will have seen videos of people running to catch rare Pokémon and if this law can be used against anyone drawing a crowd it’s possible that the Russian police could use it to stop people playing the game.MediaZona recently reported that Moscow police have beefed up patrol units near Kitay-Gorod in the centre of the city where people gather to play the game. Police chief Kirill Vorontsov said it was “to keep the public order.”Cultural elitism and general disdain for Moscow and St Petersburg’s mobile-obsessed millennials, the app’s main audience, have also contributed to the backlash.There is also an entrenched distrust of entertainment and fun in Russia. In the land of classical novelists Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn chasing cute little monsters is not an activity to be publicly endorsed.A version of this article first appeared on The Calvert Journal, a guide to the new east
