1.09pm BST13:09That’s everything from KevinThanks so much to Kevin for answering your questions. Let the Record Show: Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul, is out 3 June. Read his interview with the Observer here.  Guardian contributor KevinRowland 24 May 2016 1:04pmOkay, I'm off! Thank you. Bye bye.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.07pm BST13:07Scoopmuldoon asks:Of all the songs you’ve done, which is the one you’re most proud of? I saw you at the Liverpool Phil three years ago too … You looked sharp very, very sharp. Your version of What’s She Like that night is one of my stand-out live memories.  Guardian contributor KevinRowland 24 May 2016 1:03pmThis is What's She's Like is one of the best songs we've written. But I think my best vocal is probably Carrickfergus – I don't think it's my best technical singing and I'm sure I could have sung it better technically but before I did the track, I tried to do a lot of preparation and look right into it. My dad told me about the long distance men, Irish guys, that used to travel from town to town, work on a building site for a couple of weeks, probably sleep rough and then go on the drink for a couple of weeks, then walk to another town, he even told me what they were wearing, they had a certain look. I realised that that's what this song is about, a long distance man, at the end of his life, who wants to go home to Ireland, to die, with his ex who's already buried there. When we recorded it in the studio, I decided to wear a 30s/40s suits and a cap and an overcoat and after about two takes, something happened. I just felt like my body felt weaker, I felt myself hunching over, and I felt shivery and I turned the collar of the coat up and I just said: carry on – and we did that vocal and coughed half way through it. That vocal is one take and we left the coughing on - I was completely in that song and being that character and most of those guys died form TB. It just felt really authentic and I knew that was the vocal. I send stuff out to people and ask them which version they like and everyone said: that version. My ex manager Tim said: leave the cough in. And I thought: fuck yeah.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.58pm BST12:58I lied to Chris Evans: I don't like darts.

His old man, Bob the Dog, used to run the Ellesmere pub in east London, where I lived.  Guardian contributor KevinRowland 24 May 2016 12:52pmBobby was a great drummer. He played on our first single and a couple of tours, a terrific drummer and great guy, RIP.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.52pm BST12:52I'm not interested in nostalgia. I haven't listened to Don't Stand Me Down in yearsJacobBurton asks:How much (if any) satisfaction did you derive from the critical re-evaluation of Don’t Stand Me Down? At the time it was derided for the directional shift from Too-Rye-Ay. I can’t believe it took so long for this great album to be appreciated.  Guardian contributor KevinRowland 24 May 2016 12:49pmI must say a hell of a lot actually. Truth is I was in rehab when I got the first re-evaluation ... a guy called Chris Roberts in the 90s. It was a really glowing piece, a good few pages long saying it had been misunderstood. It got re-issued a few years after that. I don't listen to it now because I'm not interested in looking back at all or nostalgia. I haven't listened to that album or any of those albums in years. I've got no plans to. Just focusing on what I'm doing now. Nice that they are appreciated. They don't belong to me anymore – they are out there now.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.49pm BST12:49Jamie James asks:You did a Beeb 4 doc a few years back where were asked to reflect on the past, and you said something like: “I just wish I had enjoyed it more.” It made me sad to hear this. I love that you are making music again. Are you able to enjoy it more now?   Guardian contributor KevinRowland 24 May 2016 12:45pmI'm definitely enjoying it more than I did in the 80s.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.46pm BST12:46Jamie Robinson asks:Are Dexys as regimented as they were in the early days?  Guardian contributor KevinRowland 24 May 2016 12:44pmOkay, Dexys are not as regimented as they used to be. Obviously the whole band lineup every morning and I do an inspection ... haha... no it's not as regimented. It's a different setup now and I'm actually much happier with what we've got now than then. We let the music dictate who is involved. So we don't just make jobs for people because they play a certain instrument and they're in the band and my mate. We serve the music. When I hear people describing Dexys as a band I feel uncomfortable because it's not a band in the traditional sense. Everyone else involved with Dexys also has other musical projects on the go. Except me. More than a band, it's like an ensemble of musicians - it seems to be a floating lineup where people come and go as they are needed. Some people step back for an album then come back again. And I'm much happier for it. Cos I've found that the band thing in the 80s used to influence the music too much. And now we don't force that.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.44pm BST12:44I snuck into Wembley for the 1966 World Cup final. I saw Muhammad Ali at the gateMrStan asks:I am sure I once read that you sneaked in to see the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley. Is that true? Please tell us the story.  Guardian contributor KevinRowland 24 May 2016 12:40pmIt certainly is true. I'd gone to the first game, England v Uruguay is, I didn't have a ticket, walking around outside. A policeman asked me: did I have a ticket? I had an attack of honesty and I said no. And he gave me one. Then we went on holiday down the south coast for a couple of weeks. The day we were returning was the final. And I had a feeling I could get in if I could get there. I said to my dad: drop me at Wembley. My mum said: he'll be arrested, they'll only throw him out. And it was that kind of day! He dropped me at the bottom of Wembley Way and the game had already started. I ran up but I couldn't get in, Muhammed Ali showed up, drove up, it's true! And he got out, and wen up to the stairs, couldn't get in, went back int he limo. There were five or six other kids around and one of them said:I know a way. If we pull the gate aside, we can squeeze in one at a time. We started to do it but wee couldn't pull hard enough. Then a grown man appeared. It was that kind of a day. This guy went okay son, let's grab it, let's pull it. If you can get your head in you're in. So we got through one at a time. And that was it. We watched the rest of the gameFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.37pm BST12:37How do you think your Irishness has informed your work? Has your relationship with the Irish part of your identity changed over the years?  Guardian contributor KevinRowland 24 May 2016 12:34pmBig question! And hard to answer in a short space of time. But it has massively influenced it. At the same time, I feel it's a tightrope and far too easy to get into that nationalistic thing: everything Irish is great; everything English is shit. I have been guilty of that in the past, gone through a couple of phases, short-lived thank god. And I don't know. It's a very strong culture and easy to get swamped in. I've mostly always had an ambivalence about it. At the end of the day, I look more Spanish than Irish, and I rarely get taken for Irish – I don't really feel I belong anyway. But those songs; Carrickfergus, Women of Ireland, Town I Love So Well, etc, all that music, touches me very very deeply. And like I said in a previous question, I have a strong need to express it. But it isn't in a "look at me, I'm Irish, this is great" way. My experience is second generation Irish; completely different from the first generation experience. So these songs are our interpretations and they are informed by growing up here with a distance but at the same time a very deep connection.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.33pm BST12:33Ragged? Never ragged. Every style detail is thought out and plannedScoopmuldoon asks:“As the dungaree’d former frontman of Dexys Midnight Runners, Kevin Rowland became a star playing a unique style of ragged pop-soul. Come on Eileen and Geno were their big hits …”That is the introductory line to a Guardian piece. Do you ever get irritated by such glib and lazy reflections on your career? Ragged! You are never ragged.  Guardian contributor KevinRowland 24 May 2016 12:27pmThat's right! Never ragged! Even in the 80s, contrary to what I saw on some TV programmed about a year ago, supposedly about style, they billed us for being anit-style because one of our looks was quite scruffy. What they didn't realise is that every detail was though out and planned. But they misunderstood it and said it was a proud working class thing, an anti-style thing. Some people take things too literally.Updatedat 12.35pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.29pm BST12:29Spluuuuurgh asks:Can you talk us through your current look? It seems similar to that on the previous album. What’s the inspiration, and are you planning another shift in look and sound?  Guardian contributor KevinRowland 24 May 2016 12:25pmYeah, the album cover was just completely intuitive. The idea just came to wear pink trousers a blue shirt, and I actually visualised the exact shade of pink and blue, so then went around finding the material and getting the made. Jason Jules who works with us was massively instrumental in that. I saw the fabric first in a little cloth shop of Brick Lane – Crescent Trading – an amazing place to go in. Two old Jewish guys and they've got loads of vintage fabric. And I saw this pink. I was looking for pink but this particular one was so lovely, I knew it had to be the one.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.28pm BST12:28Joseph Croskery asks:Do you have any favourite emerging artists?  Guardian contributor KevinRowland 24 May 2016 12:22pmHello Joseph,When we performed at Imagining Ireland series of concerts really at the Royal Festival Hall, there was a girl called Lisa O'Neill on the bill.

Totally pure artist.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.26pm BST12:26Marc Jones (Daysofspeed) asks:Your voice is superb on the new stuff. Tip of the well-cut felt hat to you. Traditionally, you’ve shifted organically but this LP is sonically very close to the last LP. Do you think Dexys have a sound they’ll hold on to for a while?Having you back is triumphant and delightful in equal measure.  Guardian contributor KevinRowland 24 May 2016 12:20pmThanks for the compliment. I wouldn't agree with that. I think the production and the sound on Let the Record Show: Dexys do Irish and Country Soul, is markedly different from the last album. It is more of a development than a shift in style. The thing that makes this album completely different to the last one is the content, the fact that they are all known songs. Some people might write it off as a covers album. But it isn't like that at all. That's a lazy approach. I heard something yesterday that really struck a chord, that Van Gogh saw something in the chair he painted he wanted to communicate. These songs on the new album are standards because they are so well known. But we saw something else in them that we wanted to communicate. People look at a chair and see a chair but Van Gogh saw something else in it and wanted to communicate it. And when people really look at his painting, they see what's going on at it. But if they just glance at it it's a picture of a chair. That's exactly how we approach these songs.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.23pm BST12:23  Guardian contributor KevinRowland 24 May 2016 12:12pmHello ...

Come on Eileen and Geno were their big hits, the former still a wedding disco staple, but Rowland has created much more besides.He recorded two solo records after the Dexys days, including My Beauty, the cover of which saw him dressed in lipstick and lingerie, and which featured versions of songs like Daydream Believer and You’ll Never Walk Alone. Rowland has always revered classic songwriting, and, with Dexys reformed, continues the tradition with new album Let the Record Show Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul – it does what it says on the tin, covering the Bee Gees, LeAnn Rimes and others in an Irish style.Watch the video for Carrickfergus by DexysWith the album out on 3 June, Kevin joins us to answer your questions in a live webchat on 24 May from 12 noon onwards.
