This is a book that will lead you to everywhere, from the shattered archipelago to the flame ravaged land of the boundless plains and then on to Monerva. Finn and Marrill ride the pirate stream heading towards a long fabled city only heard about in myths and legends. The city harbours a mysterious machine that sucks in the pirate stream and churns out something more powerful than has ever been seen before.Authored by both Carrie Ryan and John Parke Davis this book is artfully written. Its language is sophisticated, the drawings come to life and the descriptions are pleasing. If I had to pick one favourite aspect it would have to be the characters, wittily created they will relate to anyone anywhere.I would say it should be read by those 8+ as it is not complicated, but it has a long plot. This is probably one of the best (series of) books I have reviewed and I would recommend everyone who has read this review to borrow or buy this book as it will provide excellent reading material. • Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
