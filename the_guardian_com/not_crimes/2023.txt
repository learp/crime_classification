I had quite an itinerant childhood – my dad was a headteacher – and I went to a few schools, both state and private. At all of the schools I went to, I was never really part of the gang. I do still sometimes feel like an outsider, but I can get on with most people in most situations. I’m the middle child of three – Sarah’s the oldest and Jonathan is five years younger than me.One thing my parents failed to pass on was a love of caravans, although we had some great holidays in Cornwall. I remember waking up one Easter when I was eight or nine with snow on the outside and frost on the inside of the windows. I went to the chemical toilet and thought, this is just horrible. Mum and Dad were hardcore campers – when they camped before having us, Mum said they didn’t even have lilos, just sleeping bags.Dad had a great sense of humour. We grew up listening to the Goons, Morecambe and Wise – the André Previn sketch was one of his favourites – and Flanders and Swann. I have them on my iPod – I’ll find myself working the gym treadmill to The Gas Man Cometh. He also loved Gilbert and Sullivan – his mother, my granny, was a big fan too. Her brother – Great Uncle Stanley – fought and was killed in the first world war. She had a photo of him on her mantelpiece, where she would always put her poppy every year, and we’d see him in his military dress and think about him on Remembrance Day. I found out more about him recently when I contributed to a book of stories about relatives lost in the war. I asked my cousin for some documentation and I managed to piece together how he died.The letter sent to tell his parents was thoughtful but completely ridiculous. It said he was admired greatly and had died instantly, but it also said his last words were, “Don’t think of me, do your duty.” Anyone reading that now would know it was constructed to make his parents feel better, so you can forgive the ludicrousness when it was obviously a horrendous death.Dad was a headteacher when I was a child. I remember his pile of reports, which he’d work on until late into the night in his study downstairs. Watching his career gave me great respect for teachers – my sister is now a headteacher and my mother taught too. Before I found broadcasting, I got a place at Nottingham to do a PGCE – I think it’s in my DNA.Dad died in 2001 and a few years later, I had a dream about him. In it, I went to a party in a big house, was shown into a room, and my father was in there holding a drink – it must have been tea because he didn’t drink. I walked up to him, and he looked at me and said, “I know, I’m surprised too!” It made me laugh, which woke me up.Mum worked at GCHQ on official secrets, but was then invited to be a studio manager for the BBC in the 1950s – she always talked about the programmes she worked on. I thought it sounded amazing. She looked after us full-time, but later got a job teaching French to businessmen to help send me to private school.I think my children [Ben, 24, Natasha, 22, and Joe, 16] have had a very different upbringing. My circumstances are very different to my parents – my job has stayed the same, in the same place, since I joined Radio 1 in 1986. They are Londoners, growing up in the same house all their lives. It’s an enormous privilege – they’re in one of the most cosmopolitan and liberal cities in the world. Even though we go to Suffolk for holidays, we never considered bringing them up there – I’m a city boy by heart.• Blame by Simon Mayo is published by Corgi, £7.99
