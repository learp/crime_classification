This is Spinal Tap star Harry Shearer is suing Vivendi, the parent company of Universal Music and StudioCanal, alleging it has withheld millions of dollars in profits owed to the creators of the cult 80s rock mockumentary.Shearer, who co-wrote the film and soundtrack and starred as bassist Derek Smalls, has lodged the legal action at the Central District Court of California.Shearer, who has voiced 23 characters on The Simpsons including Ned Flanders and Mr Burns, is claiming $125m (£102m) in compensatory and punitive damages from the French conglomerate.Vivendi acquired the rights to This is Spinal Tap, through its subsidiary StudioCanal, in 1989. Shearer claims that since then, profits from This is Spinal Tap have not been fairly shared between its four creators, cast or crew.“This is a simple issue of artists’ rights,” said Shearer. “It is stunning that after all this time, two cinema releases, all the various home-video format releases, all the records and CDs, and all the band-themed merchandise still widely available worldwide, the only people who haven’t shared Spinal Tap’s success are those who formed the band and created the film in the first place.”Harry Shearer (@theharryshearer)I’m going up against @vivendi and @studiocanal to ensure #fairplayfairpay for the movie #SpinalTap - #fairnessrocks pic.twitter.com/fTG23OMbsWOctober 18, 2016This is Spinal Tap was created by Shearer, Christopher Guest, who went on to co-write and direct dog competition mockumentary Best in Show, Rob Reiner and Michael McKean.The legal complaint alleges that between 1989 and 2006, Vivendi reported that the total income from soundtrack music sales was just $98.And in addition, it claims Vivendi reported that the four creators’ share of total worldwide merchandising income between 1984 and 2006 was $81.The lawsuit names Ron Halpern, who has been in charge of international productions and acquisitions for StudioCanal since 2007, as a co-defendant in the claim. Vivendi’s agents are named as StudioCanal and Universal Music.“Though I’ve launched this lawsuit on my own, it is in reality a challenge to the company on behalf of all creators of popular films whose talent has not been fairly remunerated,” said Shearer. “I hope this lawsuit will help set a new precedent for … fair artistic compensation industry-wide.”In 1982, the four co-creators signed an agreement with Embassy Pictures for the production, financing and distribution of This is Spinal Tap.Shearer claims the agreement included profit participation payments at 40% of net receipts bases on all sources of revenue, including merchandise and music.The film, which had a shoe-string budget of $2.25m, was released in 1984 and became a global cult classic.Vivendi acquired the rights to Spinal Tap in 1989, and Shearer’s legal action claims it began a “concerted and fraudulent campaign to hide, or grossly underreport, the film’s revenues in order to avoid its profit participation obligations”.A Vivendi spokesman declined to comment on the legal action.
