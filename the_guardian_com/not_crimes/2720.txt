Christopher’s in Covent Garden is 25 this year, and to celebrate we’ve refreshed our martini list. This is the most summery of the lot. Serves one.4 basil leaves30ml gin (we use Bombay Sapphire)20ml Cointreau20ml strawberry puree15ml strawberry liqueur (try Fisselier; failing that, any berry liqueur or even 10ml limoncello will do)10ml lemon juiceClap three basil leaves between your palms, to release the oils, put in a shaker with everything else and shake hard over ice. Double strain into a chilled martini glass, float a basil leaf on top and serve.• Eduard Vasile Christopher’s, London WC2
