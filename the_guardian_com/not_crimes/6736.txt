John Boyne is an Irish author of 15 novels for adults and children. His most successful book, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, has sold 7m copies worldwide and was made into a film starring David Thewlis. His latest novel, The Heart’s Invisible Furies, is a bold, funny epic, spanning 70 years of one man’s lifeThe protagonist of your new novel is a gay man growing up in Ireland from the 1950s to the present. What made you want to explore homosexuality in Ireland?We had the [gay marriage] referendum last year, so I knew it was something that was on the horizon. It occurred to me that of all the countries that would potentially be the first to pass that law by public plebiscite, it was strange and surprising that Ireland – the great Catholic Ireland – would be that country. And I wondered how we had got to that place. My previous adult novel, A History of Loneliness, was about the child abuse scandals in the church, and I feel the referendum was the closing chapter of that story, where everybody, old and young, came together and said to the church, “We are no longer listening to you and we will no longer take guidance from you because of your behaviour”.The Catholic church is portrayed as harsh and unforgiving in Invisible Furies. Do you worry about the novel’s reception in Ireland?Young people today just don’t have the relationship with the church I had when I was younger. They’re just not interested. In my generation, I don’t even know anybody who goes to mass. The church has become a spent force.There’s a lot of humour in the Irish sections of the novel, but not when you take the story to Amsterdam and New York. Was that a conscious decision?Yes, I wanted it to feel that in spite of all the things Ireland has done to Cyril [the protagonist] in the first 28 years of his life, it’s still his home, still where he feels most content. I’ve had people say to me that I seem quite negative towards Ireland, but I love Ireland. I live in Dublin and I know I couldn’t live anywhere else.Review: The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas by David Fickling You write for adults and young people. Do you have a different approach for each? I actually say I write books about adults or about young people. I think it’s an important distinction. But in the young people’s books I’ve never tried to use simpler language, simpler stories or simpler themes. I’ve written the book I would normally write, but with a young person at the centre of it.There’s been an explosion in YA fiction recently. What do you think that’s down to?Most writers for young people these days aren’t thinking about children as being little kids. They’re tackling serious subjects, writing about issues that are really faced by young people today, and that’s what they want to read. Young people want their reading experiences to reflect their own lives.What was your favourite book as a child?I loved the Bobby Brewster books by HE Todd, The Secret Seven, and the Narnia books.Who are your favourite authors now?John Irving, John Banville, Anne Tyler, David Mitchell, Jonathan Coe and Philip Hensher.What was the last great book you read?The Tidal Zone by Sarah Moss was very good, and Five Rivers Met on a Wooded Plain by Barney Norris was just fantastic. And I loved Rose Tremain’s The Gustav Sonata – I couldn’t believe it wasn’t even on the Booker longlist.The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas brought you international acclaim. Did that success change you as a writer?Yes, it gave me freedom to write and it gave me an audience. It was my fifth novel and I’d been struggling to find an audience, particularly on an international level. I know I’ll never write a book that reaches as many as The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas – that’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience. But that book was a great gift at the right time in my life.• The Heart’s Invisible Furies by John Boyne is published by Doubleday (£16.99).
