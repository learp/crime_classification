A cluster of toasted nuts in a soft syrup tart. A jumble of grains with pomegranate seeds and cashews. A Picnic bar or even a Snickers. There is much satisfaction in the crunch of seeds and nuts alongside the softness of syrup, sweet molasses or honey, a layer of soft caramel or chewy strings of toffee. You can harness that in a pecan tart or chocolate bar, but also in a homemade salad, nubbly with barley, nuts and seeds.You just need a dressing with the silky texture of honey or pomegranate molasses to provide a little smooth with the rough. This week I have a fragile tart for you with a filling of three different toasted nuts and maple syrup, and a salad that feels luxurious despite its humble ingredients.Pecan, hazelnut and almond tartsCare is needed here. The finished tarts are tender and too fragile to remove from their tins. I suggest you bake the pastry tart cases separately, then allow them to cool a little so you can tease them out of their tins before filling with the nut and syrup mixture and giving them their final baking.Serves 8For the pastry:butter 120gplain flour 200gegg yolks 2For the filling:almonds 75ghazelnuts 125g, skinnedpecans 125gdark chocolate 100geggs 2light muscovado sugar 150gmaple syrup 200mlbutter 75g, meltedvanilla extract 1 tspsea salt a pinchplain flour 3 tbspsesame seeds a few tspYou will also need 8 tart tins (10cm diameter) with removable bases.Make the pastry: rub the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Mix in the egg yolks and enough water (about 2 tbsp) to bring the dough to a rollable consistency. On a floured surface, roll into a thick, short cylinder, then wrap in clingfilm and let it rest in the fridge for half an hour. There is much satisfaction in the crunch of nuts with the softness of syrup Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Cut the pastry into eight equal slices, roll each one out and use to line the tart cases, pushing the pastry down well into the corners and trimming any that is overlapping. Fill with greaseproof paper and baking beans and rest for 20 minutes. Then bake the pastry shells for about 20 minutes, carefully remove the baking beans and paper, patch up any tears with the leftover pastry trimmings and return to the oven for 5 minutes or so. Carefully remove the pastry shells from the tart cases and place on the baking sheet, then set aside and make the filling. Lower the oven to 180C/gas mark 4.Tip the almonds into a heatproof bowl. Pour boiling water over the almonds and leave for a good 10 minutes for the skins to soften. Toast the hazelnuts in a dry pan until the skins are a very dark brown, then tip them into a clean tea towel. Rub the nuts firmly in the towel, until the skins have flaked off. Put the skinned nuts back into the pan and toast over a moderate heat, tossing them around the pan so they brown evenly.Pop the almonds from their skins with a good squeeze between finger and thumb. Roughly chop the almonds, hazelnuts and pecans, either by hand or in a food processor. Chop the chocolate into small pieces. Break the eggs into the bowl of a food mixer, add the muscovado and whisk for a good 4 or 5 minutes till fluffy. With the mixer on a slightly slower speed, pour in the maple syrup, slowly, then add the melted butter, the vanilla extract and salt. Mix in the flour. Switch off the machine and remove the bowl.Fold the chopped nuts into the mixture, followed by the chopped chocolate. Pour the mixture into the baked pastry cases, filling them almost to the top. Bake for 25 minutes until lightly set, then remove from the oven and leave to cool for 20 minutes before moving to a cooling rack. Sprinkle toasted sesame seeds over the top if you wish.

You can skip soaking the barley, but a brief steep does help to reduce the cooking time.pearl barley 100golive oil 3 tbspalmonds 50g, skinnedcashews 75g, roasted and saltedsalad leaves 2 large handfulssprouted seeds, such as radish, 50gorange or clementine 1, smallpomegranate 1For the dressing:pomegranate molasses 1 tbspwalnut oil 3 tbsplemon 1Rinse the pearl barley in cold, running water then tip into a bowl, cover with water and leave for 20 minutes. Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan then cook the almonds till golden brown. Remove and transfer to kitchen paper and salt generously. Toss the almonds with the toasted cashews. Keep as many pomegranate seeds as possible in clusters, but remove the pith Wash the salad leaves and sprouted seeds, dry them in a salad spinner then put them in a bowl. Peel and segment the orange, then add to the leaves. Halve the pomegranate and remove its seeds. I like to keep as many as I can in large clusters, but take care to remove any of the pale yellow pith that might be there. Add the pomegranate seeds to the bowl and then combine all with the prepared barley.Make the dressing. Using a small whisk or fork, combine the molasses and oil then beat in half of the lemon juice. Season with salt and black pepper then taste and add more lemon if you wish. The dressing should be distinctly sweet/sour. Pour the dressing over the salad then toss gently.
