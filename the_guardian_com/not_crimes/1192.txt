2.02pm BST14:02Time to wrap up  Guardian contributor JonBonJovi 12 October 2016 1:58pmThanks for the great questions - I'm out! We've got to catch a flight.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.01pm BST14:01Karl Watson asks: My favourite album of yours is These Days, and its the favourite of a lot of my friends who are fans too. It came out at a time when you guys were on top of the world, selling out stadiums, touring for Cross Roads your greatest hits, yet its a very dark record. Can you tell me what your memories are of making that record and what was the general inspiration during that songwriting period?   Guardian contributor JonBonJovi 12 October 2016 1:57pmIn truth we were in a very good place emotionally, and although it's perceived to be a darker record, we were anything but dark. That record is perceived to have been much more successful in Europe than in the US, but we're proud of every record we put out, especially at the time we put them out.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.58pm BST13:58Lori Clapp Powell asks: The economic divide in the US only seems to be widening. Have you ever thought of using the JBJ Soul Foundation as a way to create jobs and encourage other entertainers, artists, etc to use their resources for helping the poor and homeless?  Guardian contributor JonBonJovi 12 October 2016 1:55pmI don't think it's the responsibility of any entertainer to use their celebrity for philanthropy. I have chosen this path for all these years, but never because I was a celebrity. I was drawn to it. Our Soul Kitchen does in fact have a job training programme, also an empowerment team who help our communities with regard to job applications, legal and medical advice, and of course food and security. There are political obstacles that lead to bureaucracy getting in the way as something as simple as feeding people. No one wants to be hungry, no one is looking for a handout. But sometimes people need a hand up.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.57pm BST13:57Pagey asks: How did you come up with the lyric: “...as I dream about movies they won’t make of me when I’m dead.” It’s absolute genius – but deeply poignant.  Guardian contributor JonBonJovi 12 October 2016 1:52pmI had seen the movie The Doors, with Val Kilmer playing Jim Morrison. That movie was great, and I left the movie really invigorated - we kicked up hell that night, driving the wrong way down one way streets... I woke up the next day thinking about the impact of it, and that line came from it.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.56pm BST13:56Amy Greenwald asks: Please come to Maine to play for a night or two? With the release of this new album and of course the forthcoming tour, do you and the rest of the band feel like there is a missing element? (Richie Sambora not joining you.) Do you think that the music and tour vibe will be different? Will Richie be back or is he gone for good?  Guardian contributor JonBonJovi 12 October 2016 1:49pmWell, we've had to perform 100 shows since Richie left. We were as surprised as the fans were. Of course he's missed, but I fully support his choosing to follow his own path. In the meantime, Phil has done a superb job, and there's a great energy on the stage every night.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.53pm BST13:53Tobias Weigel asks: I was at your concert in Munich in 2013 and there seemed to be a very special connection between you and the audience there. The atmosphere was incredible. Do you have any idea where this connection comes from?  Guardian contributor JonBonJovi 12 October 2016 1:46pmThe connection comes through the songs. One thing I've come to know is that when we wrote a song we write them for us; the day we release them, they become yours. Many people have taken these stories and made them their own, and the characters they're about become them. They're not just the band's song - they become the audience's songs. That connection has been maintained for 30 years.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.52pm BST13:52Tiyana Puric asks:If you could travel back to the past, would you change anything?  Guardian contributor JonBonJovi 12 October 2016 1:44pmIf I could meet the 18 year old me today, the only advice I would give him would be to stop before the key change on Livin On A Prayer. Stop! You didn't need the key change!

To quote one of your new songs: “We were introduced as strangers but we will leave as friends.” My question is: Do you have any plans to expand the Soul Kitchen out of the US? Also, what made you decide to team up with Hart & Dagger to create the new clothing line? Thank you again for all that you have done and continue to do. Keep rocking and keep the faith.  Guardian contributor JonBonJovi 12 October 2016 1:41pmThank you! We have two Soul Kitchens, and our foundation just celebrated its tenth anniversary. We do plan on continuing to open others as the need is in fact great. We currently launched a fundraiser to support building more JBJ Soul Kitchens. If you're interested, you can go to omaze.com/jbj and for a $10 donation, you have the chance to come out on the road with the band. Who knows, you could be our new background singer or you might make the difference to lighten somebody's life, just by donating. I started the foundation in 2006. Our focus was on the issue of homelessness, and it was very clear to me that we could effect change even if it was on a small level without a need for a scientist to find a cure. All it was going to take was money, education, and sweat equity. Since then we've built 500 homes, opened two restaurants and fed 60,000 people at the Soul Kitchen.Here’s a link to that Omaze fundraiser Jon mentioned.Updatedat 2.12pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.41pm BST13:41Vote HillaryID6628607 asks: Given your appearance in the final series of The West Wing as a Matt Santos supporter what are your views on Clinton-Trump?  Guardian contributor JonBonJovi 12 October 2016 1:36pmAt the time when I appeared on The West Wing, I knew that it was the only way I was going to see a Democrat win the office, so I had to enter a fictional world because the real one we were living in was breaking my heart! I'm sure President Bartlett would not have approved of the potential of a president Trump. I'm a supporter and great admirer of Hillary Clinton. Experience matters. This is a trying time in American politics, and its influence will be felt around the world.  Jon Bon Jovi joined Hillary Clinton on stage when she delivered an address at Rutgers University, Newark, in June.

At the time alternative rock was undergoing a big change, with hair metal losing its cool factor, and grunge taking over. I think with Keep the Faith you managed to straddle that fine line better than any of the 80s rock bands, and made an album that was accessible but maintained its integrity. Looking back its impressive how you guys managed to stay relevant during that era, whilst other 80s rockers disappeared from view. Can you share your memories from that era and did you feel under any pressure to evolve as a band, both with regard to image and to songwriting?  Guardian contributor JonBonJovi 12 October 2016 1:31pmThe grunge movement in the beginning of the 90s was original, unique and desperately needed. The late 80s pop metal wasn't creating its finest work. After I'd written the Young Guns record, and Richie did Stranger in This Town, we got together to write Keep the Faith, with only our own inspirations to guide us. We were not living in the past, nor were we pretending that we were a part of the grunge movement. Songs like Keep the Faith were inspired by the LA riots, the Rodney King beating, the Berlin Wall coming down, and we were maturing as a band. It was much more than a haircut that provided the backdrop for the second phase of our career.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.35pm BST13:35KSantaFe asks:After hearing you describe the way that you formulated New Year’s Day in the studio with the band, I was wondering if we can expect that kind of approach going forward? Is it possible that future Bon Jovi albums might feature songs co-written with David, Tico or maybe even Phil? Looking forward to the #THINFS release!  Guardian contributor JonBonJovi 12 October 2016 1:28pmOf course it's possible. Some of my best songs were collaborations. I'm open to any suggestions.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
