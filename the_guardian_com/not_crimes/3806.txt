The global coral bleaching event devastating the Great Barrier Reef has spread to reefs in Western Australia, where the federal government halted the implementation of marine parks, which would help the reefs recover.Mourning Loomis Reef - the heart of the Great Barrier Reef's coral bleaching disaster In light of worsening bleaching, the Greens have called on the government to urgently implement the marine reserves, which were created in 2012, but were effectively abandoned by the Coalition when elected.Greens senator Rachel Siewert put on notice a motion calling on the government to “make the marine parks operational without further delay” and to “commit adequate funding for management, buyout and education”.Bleaching has been recorded at reefs between Darwin and Broome, as well as Browse Island. Other reports emerging from Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) surveys have revealed bleaching at sites along the Kimberley coast, and further off-shore at Christmas Island, Cocos Island and Seringapatam Reef.The latest reports show that between 60% and 90% of coral at the renowned and isolated Scott Reef have been bleached in water as deep as 15m. Scientists there say widespread coral death has been seen already.Karen Miller, a program leader and researcher at Aims said the bleaching at Scott reef is the worst they have ever seen, even worse than the severe bleaching that smashed the reef in 1998.Scientists resort to advertising to get Great Barrier Reef crisis in Queensland paper Miller said the worst bleaching in the region is expected from April, and repeated expeditions to the sites over the coming weeks and months could reveal worse bleaching.She said climate change is a worry for the future of these reefs. “If these bleaching events happen more regularly, the reefs won’t have the time to recover between the bleaching events – and that will affect the persistence of the reef.”Scientists have demonstrated that marine reserves, where fishing and other disruptive activities are banned or limited, helps reefs recover from damage, including from bleaching.In 2012, the Labor government announced a network of marine reserves that extended around the country, following a decade of work that began in 1999 under the Howard government.When the Abbott government was elected, a review of the management plans was announced, putting on hold all the protections the marine reserves would create.“When elected, the government effectively abandoned our comprehensive world leading system of marine parks so they could undergo review, since then those parks have been just become lines on the map,” said Siewert.Great Barrier Reef: 93% of reefs hit by coral bleaching “I have been worried for some time that coral bleaching would also be occurring off the coast of WA and now unfortunately we are starting to see the evidence of this bleaching,” she said. “I’m deeply concerned that we might have bleaching similar to the scale of that occurring on the Great Barrier Reef.“Greg Hunt needs to wake up to what is happening to our precious coral reefs around Australia, on the Great Barrier Reef and in the West,” Siewert said.Asked to respond to the issue, a spokeswoman for federal environment minister Greg Hunt said the reserves proclaimed in 2012 “remain in place”.In relation to the review that has halted the associated protections, she said: “We are carefully considering the zoning and other recommendations of the Commonwealth Marine Reserves Review.”
