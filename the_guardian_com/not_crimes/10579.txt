The dating site eHarmony has revealed that certain books render people veritable catnip to the opposite sex. To be clear, we’re not in the realms of Dostoevsky here. Women are most attracted to men who list go-getter business books, such as those by Richard Branson, on their dating profile, while men are driven into a passionate frenzy by women mentioning Suzanne Collins’s The Hunger Games. Stieg Larsson’s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo hits the sweet spot for both sexes.However, the main attraction is that people are reading at all, especially if they’re men. While women who put reading on their profiles received 3% more messages, men received 19% more. Let’s not forget those other studies that suggest that being a reader reduces the chances of depression and dementia, while improving everything from brain function, empathy and general wellbeing throughout life.That all sounds credible to me, but then, I’m old and pre-Kindle enough to still find an absence of bookshelves in someone’s house extremely disconcerting. The scariest date I ever went on started by meeting at the guy’s house, where there were no books to be seen, and I ended up staring around his front room, politely smiling until my face hurt, while inwardly screaming “Patrick Bateman!”As it transpired, this poor man’s worse tendencies were nothing more than sombrely studying the restaurant menu for so long that I thought he’d died. However, the no-books thing made me genuinely ill at ease. It’s not about snobbery – how could it be when books are still the cheapest, most portable and, therefore, most democratic art form you could possess? It’s rather that people who read seem to have a completely different atmosphere swirling around them, palpable, it would seem, even on dating websites.
