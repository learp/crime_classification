Guardian contributor ADeBotton 27 April 2016 2:01pmA lot of parental love is like this: we don't expect our kids to ask how our days are, or to worry that we might be needing a nap. As a parent, we give love rather than expect it, it is the most selfless of all daily kinds of love. In my view, we should learn some lessons from the way we love children and apply them to the love of adults too; ie. a focus on giving love, and on interpreting the troubles that others give us in benevolent ways (ie. they haven't slept very well rather than 'they are evil...')FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.07pm BST14:07Frugal_Dougal asksDo you see any positive signs of change in the UK housing market since you made your Perfect Home series?  Guardian contributor ADeBotton 27 April 2016 2:00pmNot focusing on the price of houses directly, there are some real signs that architectural quality has improved a lot. Much has to do with the moves of the last Labour government, that put the quality of housing delivery at the heart of its agenda (some of this has been scrapped, but not all of it, fortunately). But an ordinary housing block going up now in London or Inverness has a better chance of following best practice than it did 10 years ago. As with food, we in Britain are very slowly catching up with ideas that have been common in Holland or Germany for a while.  New homes under construction.

(I was privileged to work closely for him for 18 months – he had astonishing focus and discipline.)  Guardian contributor ADeBotton 27 April 2016 1:59pmSmall world! I've grown up with a very strong work ethic, which in me is really animated by a sense of just how short our time on this spinning planet really is. So I'm constantly guided by a guilty sense that there is a lot to do and very little time left to do it. At best, I can put out another 8 books or so. That's a scary prospect in terms of choosing what might be the best topics and how not to mess them up too badly.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.02pm BST14:02ID9552055 asksThe poet Shelley said: “We are all Greeks.” In this respect, if we take out the Greeks from our civilisation as it stands today, what are we left with?  Guardian contributor ADeBotton 27 April 2016 1:57pmI would say that we are a mixture of Greek and Judeo-Christian ideas. The latter have just as much of an influence of the former. Our idea of human rights, of equality, of democracy are as much Christian as they are Greek.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.00pm BST14:00MsMooch saysLately you have been very down on love: in the otherwise excellent TSOL videos for example. I loved your Essays in Love and I can’t wait for the sequel, but do tell me, are you still in love with your wife, or is all that doom and gloom stuff because you fell out of love but are clinging on for the sake of remembrance of temps perdu In which case, are you free for dinner next week?  Guardian contributor ADeBotton 27 April 2016 1:57pmI should say that the films on Youtube are not the ongoing story of my life and my marriage. They are heartfelt perspectives, but arise from a number of sources. There is a very understandable temptation to connect up what a writer discusses - say - in a novel with the events in their life, but the awkward truth is that it's immensely fun and liberating to invent perspectives on problems one hasn't necessarily directly experienced. All this to say - thank you so much for dinner, but not this time around.  Dinner … denied.

If young people were introduced to ethics as part of the national curriculum and how different moral choices/problems that we might end up growing a population of more moral, responsible adults who would be more likely to take custodianship over issues such as the environment, poverty and inequality?  Guardian contributor ADeBotton 27 April 2016 1:55pmThe tricky thing is HOW such an education would work. I recently was reading David Hume who was very against delivering lectures on ethics to young people. He cheerfully explained why: they won't listen, they'll find it boring. So for Hume - and he was right I think - what those with ethical ambitions need to do is find ways to make 'the good' not just true but convincing and - to use a doubtful word - charming. Hume believed that popular history and plays could help to reform character far more than dry lectures in philosophy. In short, any ambition to reform the young always has to start with the true enemy one is facing: boredom, disengagement, and the unbelievable charms of twitter. These are the things that any educator has to overcome in a quest to reform the world.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.54pm BST13:54ellalw asksIs a sense of purpose necessary for a fulfilled life? If so, how should you navigate the consequent feelings of failure and shame if you can’t find out what yours is? The overwhelming pressure to find one makes all options seem inauthentic.  Guardian contributor ADeBotton 27 April 2016 1:53pmIt is immensely hard to find a sense of purpose, but if you are feeling very actively that you haven't found it, that you are on the wrong track, these are signals that imply - like a negative implies a positive - that somewhere within you you do have a sense of what might be meaningful for you. A feeling that things are inauthentic wouldn't be possible without an underlying (even if still veiled) belief in authentic possibilities. It's important not to panic or despair because the answer hasn't manifested itself yet. It may well take a decade or two till one can start to know oneself well enough to realise what might bring purpose to life. In the meantime, sympathy for the scale of the challenge one's facing is important - that and an accurate sense that one is far from alone (even though society constantly presents us with examples of people who seem to know exactly what is what; people who in fact constitute a painfully small majority, who nevertheless make it to the front pages of websites too often for our mental well-being.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.52pm BST13:52The refugee crisishvadaltsaa asksHow do think we will look back on the current refugee crisis? With pride, guilt or shame? Do you think that we as a species will ever learn from our history and stop fighting wars?  Guardian contributor ADeBotton 27 April 2016 1:49pmThe origins of the refugee crises will, I think, be what particularly concerns historians. The roots have to do in the catastrophic approach of the Western powers to the politics of the Middle East. Don't forget that Syria was a client state of France for many years, it's ancient tribal structures were destroyed and the current regime - responsible for the war in key ways - is the fruit of an entirely dysfunctional state, which took years to get into the shape it was in when the conflict broke out. In short, we are still - as a species - learning some basic principles of good statecraft: that intervention in the affairs of other nations causes problems that can last centuries, that human rights have to be respected, that economic liberty needs to go hand in hand with political liberty, that women's rights must be respected etc... The refugees we are seeing in the stations of Germany and the camps of France are the last link in an appalling sequence of mistakes that goes back to the mid 19th century. None of this is an argument for passivity. Simply that good governance is at the heart of the crisis and something humanity is still only just learning about.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.50pm BST13:50Allan Ray Jasa saysAlain, I have two questions: 1. how long did it take you to write The Course of Love?2. in what ways did The School of Life / The Book of Life affect your novel?  Guardian contributor ADeBotton 27 April 2016 1:45pm1. It took 3 years.2. The School of Life provided a forum in which I could test some of the ideas, by presenting them to small audiences - and also, learn from the many people who come through our doors. We run a psychotherapy service and our resident therapist was extremely helpful to me in discussing some of the problems of couples. So all in all, it's very good to go into an office rather than spend all day alone in a room...FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm BST13:49BaddHamster asksGiven that, with a long enough timeline, all life is ultimately futile, and sooner or later humanity will cease to exist, am I justified in calling in sick for the week and instead just watching movies in bed and drinking cheap wine?  Guardian contributor ADeBotton 27 April 2016 1:43pmThe lack of 'meaning' as humans can conceive it when we look at our lives on a cosmic perspective should not be an invitation to do nothing. However nice beds and cheap wine are, knowing that our lives are short and our efforts fragile could as well be a goad to action - especially around helping others - as to indolence. That shouldn't sound hectoring or ungenerous. Most of all, I wish you a nice break.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.47pm BST13:47  A philosophy class under way at Sunnyside Primary school in Alloa, Scotland. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the GuardianIan Batch asksDo you think we’ll ever live in a post-religious age – where the majority of the people on the planet are educated atheists and church and state are completely separated from each other? Do you find it desirable?Do you think the UK is as suspicious of intellectuals as the US, and is this a trend that will increase in this internet age of information overload and knowledge deficit?Should philosophy be taught from the age of 11 in state schools and what role if any does/could philosophy play in averting teenage depression?  Guardian contributor ADeBotton 27 April 2016 1:41pmYes, we will - I think - eventually reach a post-religious age. In many ways, in Western Europe, we are already here. This would be very desirable in my view; of course, there are better and worse ways of secularising. For me, the best way is to remember all the emotional needs that we once turned to religion with - and to try to find alternatives in the secular world. No longer believing generally isn't the end of some of the feelings that took people to belief.Suspicion of intellects has many sources, not least, that many intellectuals have made enormous mistakes, especially around politics (think of the very misguided ideas of Sartre, or of Heidegger or other big mid 20th century names). That said, allowing a variety of voices onto the airwaves seems a way to achieve genuine plurality. As for teaching philosophy, a lot depends on how it is done. There are ways of teaching it - historically, unimaginatively - that are far worse than not teaching it at all (at least then it retains an aura). My recommendation would be that we'd teach young people about relationships via the ideas of psychotherapy; this seems to offer a more direct route to solving some of the big issues that crop up in teenage years.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.40pm BST13:40PatrickLee asksI’m writing this from my office, where I feel under extreme pressure to get things done. I’m also working a freelance job simultaneously, and so am currently all about making money. Basically, I’m making good tracks career-wise. I’m ‘doing OK’, I’m saving money to one day have a house and am doing a good job. But I don’t know if this is what I want to be doing. I try and imbue it with as much meaning as pos, but it doesn’t really work. Surely it’s too late to start again and spend all my hard-earned money on re-studying. Three more years of poverty just to start from scratch again.What should I do? How can I be happy and find meaning in my work? ... Are the School of Life looking for a good communications person?  Guardian contributor ADeBotton 27 April 2016 1:35pmI'm sorry about the challenges of day to day life: yes, we do need a good communication person... But I would just ask what it is about further study that you're hoping will move you out of the current situation. In general, when people consider a job move, the risk is a faulty analysis of the current dissatisfaction, a flawed analysis of what one's true talents and interests are - and a misreading of the job market. All these are hugely tricky issues - which is why i'm a firm believer that one should spend a h ugely long time unpicking the dilemma, possibly with the help of a mentor - and only very slowly judge whether a big move is necessary. The tragedy of most job searches is that they proceed under the pressure of immediate feelings of instincts, which turn out not accurately to reflect the aptitudes of the people involved. In short, take it slowly and think a lot...  Guardian contributor ADeBotton 27 April 2016 1:37pmPS: I would add that there are many ways in which a greater deal of meaning can be found in existing jobs, without the need to throw everything in. At the School of Life, we're keen on what we call 'branching' moves, which involve a little shift to the right or to the left. These undramatic moves - which may involve a conversation with a colleague or boss about slightly changing how things are done - may hold a remarkably important part of the solution to a situation of dissatisfaction. We're often fatefully in love with the dramatic move.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
