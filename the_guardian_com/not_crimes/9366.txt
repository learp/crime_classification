I am 26 and moved to a new city three years ago and I’m finding it hard to meet other people, either romantically or as friends. My hobbies – photography, dancing and the piano – are a little solitary. My work is with a small team and I adore my job, so there is no question of finding a new one. My friends from school and university are nowhere near me and it feels as if everyone my age just wants to party when I am trying to be healthy and to exercise, or are in long-term relationships that take priority over seeing friends. I am struggling to find new people who are on the same wavelength as me to do cultural and interesting things. I am not lonely and enjoy my own company but I’d like to have people over to eat with, to cook with and to go and do social activities with like I had at university. How can I meet more people and cultivate interesting, healthy relationships?• When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
