That at the present time a small tortoiseshell butterfly should fly in through a window, as was mentioned by a Knutsford lady in Saturday’s issue, is unusual but not extraordinary, for this species, like the peacock and a few other kinds, exists from year to year by the hibernation of the females of the late summer brood. Clinging with tightly closed wings and stiffened limbs to the rafters of outhouses, the sheltered sides of hollows in rotten trees, or the ceilings of cottage kitchens, these flies slumber from autumn until spring, until vernal currents stir them to activity, and they awaken, seek the young green nettles; lay their eggs, and die. Now and then some elusively mild winter day or accidental disturbance sends them forth to expose their beautiful wings in the wintry sunshine, but they speedily seek shelter or perish.My Llandudno correspondent, ever on the alert, tells me of a black redstart on the Great Orme. This smart little robin-like winter visitor often gives rise to the erroneous reports of the abnormally early arrival of its spring relative, the common redstart, but in the southern counties the black redstart is a regular winter visitor, hawking flies along the cliffs of Cornwall and Devon. Further north it is seldom seen except on passage in spring and autumn, but my friend has by regular observations proved that the mild North Wales coast must be included as within the limits of the bird’s winter range.
