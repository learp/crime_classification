The first full trailer for Kingsman: The Golden Circle – the follow-up to the hit Bond pastiche Kingsman: The Secret Service, directed by Matthew Vaughn – has been released online.Taron Egerton returns as Eggsy, the council estate kid who is improbably chosen as a recruit for a mysterious, elite spy agency, and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mission to save the world. The sequel appears to have all the same building blocks in place, with the major addition, as the plot synopsis reveals, of a US version of the agency. When [the Kingsman] headquarters are destroyed and the world is held hostage, their journey leads them to the discovery of an allied spy organisation in the US called Statesman, dating back to the day they were both founded. In a new adventure that tests their agents’ strength and wits to the limit, these two elite secret organisations band together to defeat a ruthless common enemy, in order to save the world.The American end appears to be held up by Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges and Halle Berry, while Julianne Moore has been roped in as the least likely supervillain in history. And although Colin Firth’s character was supposedly killed in the first film, the trailer suggests there is a return for Colin Firth as Eggsy’s mentor, Harry Hart.Kingsman: The Golden Circle is out on 22 September in the US, 28 September in Australia and 29 September in the UK.
