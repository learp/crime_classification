Ally Watson, founder of Code Like a Girl, only got into programming because she couldn’t get into art school.She chose computer science because it was one of the few courses at university that had vacancies when she missed out on her first choice.“I bump into people from school who are surprised I went down this career route, but I can’t think of a career more suited to my skills,” she says.Women in particular are turned off careers in technology because they think it is all about maths, science and computers – but it is so much more than that, Watson explains.Unconscious bias: most women believe sexism still exists but most men disagree Watson, who builds websites for digital agency Deepend in Melbourne, admits she is “quite bad” with computers generally – she recently installed an operating system on an external hard drive by mistake. But that hasn’t held her back. “People think you have to be good at the whole thing to be into technology or that you have to be a computer wizard to be a programmer and that is absolutely not true,” she says. “You can build a small component of a bigger system.”Code Like a Girl is an organisation that encourages women to code through tech-focused events and workshops in Melbourne. Watson started the organisation a year ago to try to connect with other women. She had moved to Melbourne from Scotland and was feeling isolated as a female programmer. Women make up less than than 20% of Australia’s digital tech sector. A mere 14% of graduates are women and 30% leave within 15 years of service.

And by 2020, the digital tech sector is expected to require 700,000 information and communications technology workers in Australia. Getting women into programming is not just about filling those job vacancies; it is about enriching business and innovation with greater diversity.The rewards are also there for women themselves. “The benefits and the perks and the salaries straight out of university are just amazing,” says Watson. “So it worries me that ... girls are missing out on this opportunity because they have this idea that technology has a stigma.” When Watson organised her first Code Like a Girl event, she was encouraged that more than 120 women turned up. After six years of often being the sole woman in the room, she had expected less than a dozen.Some of the women who come to her events are already in the industry and are looking to make connections and improve their skills; others are dipping their toe into the world of coding to see if it suits them.Watson says young women and girls are turned off tech careers when they compare their skills to those of the males around them. Boys often learn to code through gaming and playing around with computers and robotics.“When you have never even tried coding and you don’t know if you would be good at it and you walk into a classroom where most of the people in that class are doing that degree because they are good at it, they’ve been doing it since age 10, that can be intimidating and [could] put girls off computer science.”Watson started her computer science degree with only some high school classes in Excel to prepare her. “I was one of three girls in a classroom of 80 and everyone else seemed to know the curriculum already. It was hard to put your hand up and ask silly questions,” she recalls.Watson’s turning point came when her studies moved on to interactive systems which describe how humans use computers. All of a sudden, her difference became her strength.The Grattan Institute is wrong. We need more science students, not fewer “The psychology element really appealed to me. For the first time I was the one in the classroom getting the great grades. I realised that I had a place there and that it wasn’t just about maths and logic. Having a creative, diverse background gave me an edge over the other people in my class and I fell in love with it. I cannot believe it was almost an accident.”Sandy Plunkett, the founder of the consultancy Innovation Clearinghouse, says one of the easiest ways to get girls into Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) is through the liberal arts.“By getting them into music and art and drama and languages, they are learning another language. If they can read music, the chances are that they will be less intimidated by code,” Plunkett says.The “brogramming” culture of the male-dominated industry also needs to change because women find it unappealing. Watson says while people often say learning programming is hard, it is no harder than learning to play an instrument.“When you start playing, you won’t be very good and you won’t be able to build apps and websites straight away and so a lot of people are deterred by that. But form a band, find other coders who are like you and code together and create a study group. You practise together and it is fun and it is sociable.”It is not necessary to go to university to become a coder, says Watson. Some people in the industry are self-taught, others have done online courses and she has heard of people who have completed 16-week courses and walked straight into a good job.Women also need to see the real-world applications of programming, to find things they are passionate about and then use programming as a way to make things happen, she says.“Curiosity is first. Being curious about the world around you. Curiosity about health or medicine or art or space will get you there. You will have to, at some stage, see the impact of technology on that.”
