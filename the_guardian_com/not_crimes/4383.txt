Heathrow has warned the Davies commission that government forecasts for aviation demand are flawed and that the case for a four-runway hub may never materialise.In a submission to the commission considering the case for expanding airport capacity, Heathrow said the Department for Transport incorrectly assumes that passengers who cannot be accommodated at the London hub will pass through other British airports.Instead, Heathrow claims, much business will be lost to overseas hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul, which operate on a similar model for long-haul routes and transfer traffic.The airport states that the passenger demand case for a third runway is clear and present now â€“ marking a slight change of tack for Heathrow. Chief executive Colin Matthews has been reticent in spelling out its objective so baldly during recent lobbying.The airport reiterated that the "hub capacity constraint" brought by its cancelled third runway is having a "damaging impact on connectivity" and "lost trade opportunities" that the UK may never get back.The government has published its delayed aviation policy framework paper, eagerly anticipated by the sector before the question of airport expansion was hived off to the Davies commission. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said it "strikes the right balance between allowing the aviation industry to thrive while minimising impacts on the environment and local communities". However, proposals published in the draft paper last year by his predecessor, Justine Greening, to impose stricter thresholds on aircraft noise aligned with the rest of Europe, no longer appear.
