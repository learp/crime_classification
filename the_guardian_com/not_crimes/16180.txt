The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with Jovonn: Nite Roads   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I think the first three tracks are super important. I love Jovonn’s signature sound, the groove part with the piano chords.The track I wish I’d signed to my label Maurice Fulton: Life Is Water   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’m a massive fan of Maurice Fulton, I would want every track of his on my label if I had one. I saw him DJing once in London; when he dropped Yellow Magic Orchestra’s Firecracker, I felt magic happening.The track I’d play to show off my eclectic tastes Ikenga Super Stars Of Africa: Soffry Soffry Catch Monkey   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’m fascinated by African music; it’s my biggest influence. The rhythms, groove and the vibe are very powerful to me. Moodymann sampled this, too; it’s just an amazing track.The track that got me out of bed this morning Pharoah Sanders: Harvest Time   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’ve started to listen to this almost every day since Sam – AKA Floating Points – posted it on Instagram, as he is one of my favourite producers. I think of him as someone with huge, broad music knowledge.The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding Brothers Johnson: Runnin’ For Your Lovin’   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I love Brothers Johnson, their music is typical happy music with nice lyrics. They are a muse for a lot of musicians including myself, so I would love to play this in a special moment.The track I’d play at sunset in Ibiza Auntie Flo ft Anbuley: Dance Ritual II   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I play this as the very last track of my set as a “thank you for dancing”, which is why I immediately thought of this for “sunset”. Even though I do not understand the lyrics, Anbuley’s vocal makes me want to sing along with it.The track I’d play at my funeral Peggy Gou: Hungboo   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This track is the first ever track that I made after I learned production with Korean traditional sounds and influences. So, I would like to say I would want the first to also be the last.Peggy Gou plays Bussey Building/The CLF Art Cafe, SE15, Fri
