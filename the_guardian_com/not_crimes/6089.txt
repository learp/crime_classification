Vibe/crowdPacked with teenagers celebrating (or attempting to forget) their GCSE results, which they’d received the day before the festival began. Reading acts as a rite of passage for thousands of 16-year-olds each year and their presence, boosted by acts such as BBK and Stormzy, added some much-needed charge to the atmosphere.Best actThe much-hyped return of Reading veterans the Red Hot Chili Peppers didn’t disappoint. Attempting to atone for their appearance here in 2007, widely considered to be one of the worst headline shows in the festival’s history, the band filled their set with some of their biggest songs. It went down well with an extremely varied crowd, which was peppered here and there with actual chilli costumes.A$AP Rocky’s set was also met with excitement, perhaps stoked by rumours of a possible cancellation circulating the previous day. The New York rapper lit up the main stage with tracks such as Goldie and Wild for the Night while demanding moshing and crowdsurfing from those in attendance.Biggest absence?Pull-outs from US rappers Travis Scott, Fetty Wap and G-Eazy dampened the mood, as many attendees had travelled to see them. On Instagram, the South-African rap-rave group Die Antwoord attributed these cancellations to the “disrespectful” attitude of festival organisers.

A greater-than-usual number of tents survived thanks to a festival-wide ban on campfires on the last night, with fire-watch stations set up to discourage the burning of tents.OverheardOne excited festival goer replacing Fallout Boy’s lyrics with “Dicks out for Harambe”, a reference to the gorilla shot at Cincinnati Zoo in May. Harambe was much referred to at the festival, popping up on T-shirts, flags, face-paint decorations and even in a set by Chvrches, who dedicated their song Under the Tide to the gorilla.Best dressedA group of energetic men dressed in large fluorescent parrot outfits, who consistently appeared on the big screens.Best tweet
