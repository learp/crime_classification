Dr Danny Haelewaters, of Harvard University, with co-authors in the Netherlands and Belgium, recently described a new species of Laboulbeniales from the Harener Wildernis in the Netherlands. Like related fungi, it is parasitic on insects, in this particular case growing on the surface of a pselaphine rove beetle collected from under the bark of a dead European alder. The new species, Bordea denotata, differs from related fungi in several microscopic details but I focus on the detail of the position of the fungus as reported. The illustration is of thalli observed on the left elytra or hardened forewing of the host beetle. Far from a useless detail, such precision in noting where on the body of the host a fungus is seen has fuelled a debate among biologists for a century.Another Harvard professor, Roland Thaxter, began his studies of Laboulbeniales in 1890 and over the course of ensuing decades named more than 1,200 species of the fungi. In the course of doing so, Thaxter observed the improbable: a given laboul was not only confined to a particular host but was consistently seen to grow on exactly the same places on the host. Some were found only on a tibia, others on a pronotum or abdomen. The story seemed incredible, yet repeated observations often reinforced Thaxter'sÂ claims.A recent paper in Mycologia by two of my colleagues at the College of Environmental Science and Forestry gave new insights into this weird pattern, although their new explanation is no less shocking than the rumours preceding it. Their conclusion? Laboulbeniales are sexually transmitted! Lauren Goldmann and Alex Weir studied of 13 species of Chitonomyces, all ectoparasitic on the predaceous diving beetle Laccophilus maculosus. They were particularly interested in testing Thaxter's theory of "position specificity". Using the nucSSU rRNA gene and 5.8S and partial ITS1 rRNA regions, all 13 species were sorted out into pairs of morphotypes and a revised total of six species. Each of the six species were indeed located at corresponding positions of both male and female beetles, vindicating the Thaxter rule. Video recordings of mating behaviour of the host beetles confirmed that sexual transmission is the long-sought mechanism explaining this bizarre phenomenon.Males and females of the beetle are more or less parallel while mating and as the fungus is passed from one to the other. They found that when the male position was skewed a bit to one side or the other during copulation, the fungi appeared later on the female in a similarly offset position. I must say that I am a little disappointed that the mystery of how the fungi could tell one part of the body from another has been debunked. The reality is that most Laboulbeniales can fruit on nearly any body part of either sex of a host. Because spore transmission involves physical contact between hosts and because many individuals come in such intimate contact when they are, well, intimate, the correlation of fungi on particular spots on the body is a lot less surprising. It turns out that routine beetle sexual behaviour has more to do with position specificity than some unknown fungus attribute. Weary of justifying my own interest in slime-mold beetles, I used to be fond of reciting a story, perhaps apocryphal, about Roland Thaxter. He is said to have delivered a lecture on labouls at Harvard. After, a women in the audience said something to the effect of "Professor Thaxter, all of this is quite fascinating, but of what value is it to mankind?" to which he replied, "None, thank God!" Goldmann and Weir have scored another one for the joy in pure curiosity.
