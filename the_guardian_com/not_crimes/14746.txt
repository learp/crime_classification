Home from our fortnight’s walk across Norfolk and Suffolk, I patrol our immediate surroundings in this predominantly pastoral landscape of small fields. The bean row has collapsed and the raspberries are soggy but the brightness of pink nerines, red fuchsias, blue flowers of rosemary and the yellow of fig leaves glows in the murk. A mistle thrush is already on guard around berries on the tall hollies by the field gate. Hazels on uncut hedges sport tight catkins but this year’s exceptional crop of nuts has all gone. There remain juicy sloes and dark-red haws on leafless bushes, all mixed with briars, brambles, ivy, faded bracken and new fronds of polypody ferns.The landmark clump of beech has dropped brown mast and orange leaves that lie as crunchy drifts across the adjoining lane. Crows seek unshed nuts and a gang of finches flash yellow as they dart away from burdocks and bedraggled thistles. In the farmyard opposite are stacked bales of haylage wrapped in turquoise plastic and cattle remain out on grass in a field adjoining horses at livery.Across the stream to the south, slopes that have grown barley for years have been reseeded for sheep pasture, and gulls rest on the flush of new growth. To the east, Dartmoor is obscured in drizzle. Visibility extends only as far as Bere Alston, on a hillside above the Tamar, and misty woods on the river cliff of Morwellham.Northwards, a layer of cloud caps the tops of Kit Hill and Hingston Down, but lower slopes around old mining settlements such as Harrowbarrow and the Silver Valley show up as vivid green fields, divided by hedge-banks topped with the copper-coloured crowns of oaks.Up the lane and out of sight of home, pheasants scuttle across stubble while sheep and bullocks shelter under a hedge adjoining the field that was named as “plaguery” on the tithe map (maybe a reference to its use as an isolation area for diseased animals in former days). At the crossroads, two fields are rented by a specialist swede grower, with the roots and leafy tops protected from flea beetle attack by acres of plastic mesh.Twitter: @GdnCountryDiary
