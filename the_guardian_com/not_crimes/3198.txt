When asked where my inspiration comes from, it’s the laid-back, slightly scruffy style I love. I can appreciate a beautifully sculptured space, but many of us need gardens that don’t show up their flaws the minute someone stops tending to them endlessly. Although I love glossy magazines, I am wary of using them for inspiration. They are like magazine hairstyles; go to the hairdresser and they’ll tell you it’s going to take styling tongs, products and a good hour in the mirror to look so artlessly windswept. I like a garden that can look after itself, that has space for the self-seeders and if there are a few weeds or plants out of place, it doesn’t throw the whole garden off.If you want to get good at design, you need to visit lots of gardens; you should make it your pastime for a year or so. The National Gardens Scheme has a garden open every month of the year, so you can’t claim the weather’s not right. The National Trust will teach you about good garden bones better than anyone. Botanic gardens are like going to good libraries; you can look up detail, width, height, colour and form.Your local parks will teach you about size and scale, particularly for trees. Whichford Pottery in the Cotswolds and Great Dixter in Sussex provide wonderful inspiration for containers.There are a couple of books that I return to endlessly. Joy Larkcom’s Creative Vegetable Gardening is my happy place, as full of inspiration as the woman herself. I also love Sticky Wicket: Gardening In Tune With Nature by Pam Lewis. It’s about her five-acre plot in Dorset, and although few of us have that space, there are plenty of ideas for smaller gardens. Likewise, Dream Plants For The Natural Garden by Piet Oudolf and Henik Gerristen is my go-to bible for perennials.Alys Fowler: learn to love plant labels Often a garden doesn’t need an overhaul, it just needs simplifying. Less is always more, particularly in a small space. Use enough repetition so that there is a rhythm to the garden; plant in groups and drifts, using these as the base notes to the rest of the piece.Stature is good, height is essential, but bulk can drag the whole space down. Shrubs and large perennials can slump in a heavy way. Don’t be afraid of dividing, pruning and in particular crown-lifting old shrubs so you get more light underneath their feet and a new planting spot for shade lovers. By the height of summer, stuff flopping over the path is charming; but too much, so that you lose the space of a path, is a mistake. You want to see where your feet are going. Sometimes a little judicious pruning or staking can let the garden breathe again.
