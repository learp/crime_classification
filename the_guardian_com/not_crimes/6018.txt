The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with Louisahhh & Maelstrom: Listen   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I like opening sets with my own work to set a tone. This starts really tiny and gets huge like an approaching storm.The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor John Dahlback I Slide (Flatfoot remix)   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I have been playing this song for a long time and it’s kind of a tongue-in-cheek reference at this point, but the combination of the basketball kick/hard snare/swarm of bees hook always wakes people up.The track I wish I’d signed to my label Powell ft Frankie: Frankie   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’m a huge fan of Powell’s last album, Sport, and this song is the weirdest, coolest, most irreverent thing. I think it actually really captures the “techno for punks” spirit of my label, RAAR, even though it’s really hard to play in a club.The track that currently gets the most rewinds DJ Rashad: Don’t Drop It   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Although I have to pitch it down about 20% to mix it into my sets, this track will never fail to set things off.The track that’s been unfairly slept on this year Crave: Hahaha Cops   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Crave AKA Lieu Noir AKA Jonny Teardrop is the most exciting creator I have encountered in the last year. His “visual album” (as Jonny Teardrop) entitled No Problemo, is incredible and I push it every chance I get. Hahaha Cops is like some slow-motion David Lynch rock’n’roll heartbreak. Impeccable.The track I’d play at my funeral Patti Smith: Grateful    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest “One common wire/ One silver thread/ All that you desire rolls on ahead”. I’ve probably thought an unhealthy amount about this, but this is definitely a perfect funeral song.The track I wish I’d never played Population One: Out of Control (Vocal mix)   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This track is awesome but it somehow gets out of sync kind of invisibly so that when you’re mixing it you feel like an imbecile and wonder when you stopped being able to DJ.Louisahhh plays Fabric, EC1, Sat
