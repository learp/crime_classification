Bake Off is back. The hour each week when we can put our feet up, forget the unholy mess we are in and console ourselves with tortes and bundts, kugelhopf and gateaux. Mary and Paul will return as our much-loved good cop, bad cop judges. Sue is polishing her baking-related puns and, if all goes belly up for our contestants, Mel Giedroyc will be there to dry their tears and say, “Never mind, let’s pretend it’s a trifle.”Never has watching lovely people make cakes in a tent been quite so necessary. A sweet salve for a frankly grim moment in the country’s history. Cake can’t heal, but it can certainly take our mind off things for a bit. For the start of this, the seventh series, Tim Lewis went on set to try to get to the bottom of why a programme that has millions of viewers watching people make scones has become such a TV phenomenon. This is the time of year we say move over Olympics and Formula One, that programme where nice people make cakes is back.Bake Off is unapologetically sugar-laden and flies in the face of the “clean eating” mantra. (When the contestants made sugar-free cakes last year, it felt like we’d been handed an eclair with no cream in it.) And so it should do. The whole idea of clean food versus dirty food is at best misguided, at worst dangerous, and yet it has its converts. Philosopher Julian Baggini gets to the root of the whole guilt-trip eating craze and comes to a surprising conclusion.No summer issue of OFM would be complete without a trip to the seaside. This month, we sent Laura Barton to the coast in search of fish. Thanet is one of the country’s most important fishing areas yet has surprisingly few fish shops or restaurants. So what happens to the catch?We also have Norman Cook’s Life on a Plate, Fuchsia Dunlop in the land of fish and rice and Felicity Cloake is busy spreading joy.
