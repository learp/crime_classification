It’s something we’re incredibly excited about and we think is the direction it needs to head.”It is unclear whether this new direction will involve Arnold Schwarzenegger. According to reports, Paramount had decided not to pick up an option to retain the actor, as well as his Genisys co-star Emilia Clarke, for future films.Terminator Genisys received scathing reviews when it was released in 2015, with the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw describing the film as “a cynical franchisebot, machine-tooled to clank into cinemas and gouge money out of people”.
