The wetsuit designed to make him invisible to sharks appears to have worked – but a British man has nevertheless had to call off his bid to become the first to swim the breadth of the Atlantic Ocean after bad weather severely damaged his support vessel.Ben Hooper, a 38-year-old father and former police officer from Gloucestershire with a deceptively languid-looking front crawl, set off from Senegal 33 days ago and was aiming to reach the coastline of Brazil sometime in March. Ex-police officer to swim from Senegal to Brazil in shark invisibility wetsuit But on Friday he admitted defeat – for the time being at least – after his support vessel, the Big Blue, was bashed about by terrible weather and high waves.In a statement on his Facebook page, Hooper said: “We were subjected to our fifth day of Atlantic storms as a result of which the sailing catamaran Big Blue suffered damage to her steering and rigging.“The crew worked through the night to make the vessel safe for all onboard and we were able to assess the extent of the damage and the impact on the expedition at first light.”Emergency repairs were made that means she can continue to sail towards Brazil but the damage had led the team to “reappraise” the expedition.It had by no means been an easy trip thus far. The sharks may have been flummoxed but Hooper was injured by another marine beast – a Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish that left him incapacitated in the water.Big Blue picked him up but the fear was that further damage to the boat’s steering might have made it harder to reach him quickly if there was another emergency.Hooper said: “I would add that we are all safe and that Big Blue remains seaworthy and capable of completing crossing of the Atlantic Ocean during the months of December and January.”Much of Hooper’s training had taken place in a swimming pool in Cheltenham, where the sight of him ploughing up and down became a familiar one to fellow swimmers and staff. He also trained in open water in Florida and in the Mediterranean, notching up 7,450 miles (12,000km) of training in pool and ocean.Such is his attention to detail that he worked with Hartpury College in Gloucestershire to find out what music – played on a waterproof MP3 player – helped him most. It turned out that if he listened to Eminem his performance was bolstered by up to 10%, though he leavened the American rapper with tunes by the Prodigy and Faithless.The swimwear specialist Arena designed a Sams (shark attack mitigation systems) wetsuit with Hooper in mind. It features a camouflage print that apparently makes the wearer harder for sharks to spot. Hooper was aiming to cover 2,000 miles. By the time he called a halt he had completed 87 miles in 33 days. Fifteen days had been lost to weather, medical problems and issues with the boat.He remains determined to try again.“My attempt to become the first person to swim across the Atlantic Ocean – every single mile – remains but it has been postponed for the time being,” he said. “My crew have worked tirelessly to make this possible and this decision has not been taken lightly; indeed, the easy option would have been to carry on at all costs. That would have been foolhardy and unnecessary.“To quote Theodore Roosevelt, ‘It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.’ We have not failed; we have achieved and gained the knowledge to succeed in the future.”
