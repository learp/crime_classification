A row of stately trees guards the meadow’s fence line beneath a sultry summer sky. One tree is a small-leaved lime, a diminutive name for a colossal plant. The ground beneath its wide boughs is bathed with the soporific perfume of linden blossom, and the pale stars of its flowers are laden with nectar-devouring insects.Next to the lime is a shaggy yew, bluish green, decorated with the scaly brown seeds of the female flower.The other trees in the row are sentinel oaks, crowns deep and glowing green, trunks sturdy with age. The oak nearest the fence has grown just beyond vertical and its yaw-ways frame offers a wallow of shade to a small gathering of cattle.I stand to enjoy the cool of the oak’s shade and am watched by a white-faced, wall-eyed beast, udders sucked flat and shining by her calf. Strings of saliva course from the mother’s wide mouth and tangle in the stalky cock’s-foot and fescue at her knees. Through the fizzing haze of flies at the cow’s flanks a couple of hornets thrum, toffee and yellow-striped jumbo jets.I turn to watch as they circle, then home in on a wedge-shaped wound at the base of the oak. The ragged bark surrounding the wound is loose, like thick grey scabs, and the wood beneath glistens with sap. Some of the sap has fermented to beige-grey clots in the sun; the largest is a globule the size of an eyeball while others are soft smears like wet dough. Each smells of brewer’s yeast.Surrounding the fermented sap are hundreds of red ants, which, despite being trampled by the marauding hornets, have pressed themselves shoulder to shoulder in their desire to feed upon the intoxicating manna.Several red admiral butterflies join the throng and creep bent-legged through furrows of bark, their thread-like tongues probing for sugar.Yet from beneath the edges of the tree’s wound lurk the creamy heads of a fungal bloom, and several hoof-like wedges of bracket fungus climb the trunk like steps to a tree house. This meadow’s army of trees might soon be one warrior down.Twitter: @ GdnCountryDiary
