When Priscilla Chan and her husband, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, announced they are expecting a baby girl, the internet showered them with praise. At last count, nearly 800,000 people had liked the Facebook announcement in which they shared the big news. But this being the internet, the happy couple were almost immediately upstaged by their dog.“Who is that moppy thing? How can I hug it?” many of us asked ourselves.elena (@LAWNBEAR23)Celeb crush: mark zuckerberg's dog pic.twitter.com/EmmRtQhFYwJuly 31, 2015robbie (@heartofpixels)UMMMMMMM can we just talk about mark zuckerberg's dog for a goddamn second 😱 pic.twitter.com/5Bv4PYGnH7July 31, 2015The dog’s name, it turns out is Beast, and he is a Puli, a type of hungarian sheepdog. According to the American Kennel Club, the puli (plural: pulik) was recognized as a breed in 1936 and is the 145th most popular breed in the US. Naturally, Beast has his own Facebook page, where we can see many more (adorable) photos of him, and learn many more (adorable) facts about him. He has more than two million facebook fans, which is just under half what the Guardian has (we’re not jealous).He likes “cuddling and herding things”, according to his profile. (No word on long walks on the beach, though Palo Alto isn’t far from the coast.)“I was born in Grants Pass, Oregon and now I live in Palo Alto with Mark and Cilla.”“I am extremely cute.” [Editor’s note: Yes! Yes you are!]Those who want to run out and get a puli for themselves should know that they are “very active; a hardworking herder, the Puli likes activity and running room,” according to the AKC. So it’s probably not a great fit for your tiny apartment that you share with six other broke millennials. Still, that didn’t stop everyone from wanting to chill out with Beast for a little bit.Moisés Chiullan (@moiseschiu)Dog Zuckerberg wants to know if you wanna like hang out & maybe I dunno listen to Phish or kick around a hackysack? pic.twitter.com/lTz3sKZV1YJuly 31, 2015But maybe the reason we’re all obsessed with Beast is the reason we’re obsessed with all wealthy celebrities: we secretly want to be them.Charlie Warzel (@cwarzel)this derg has more money than you'll ever have and he can't even spend it your life is a joke pic.twitter.com/n1BuGrHAtXJuly 31, 2015
