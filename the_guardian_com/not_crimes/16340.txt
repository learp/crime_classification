The PT Barnum biopic The Greatest Showman on Earth, which will star Hugh Jackman as the celebrated American circus owner, is looking to cast Michelle Williams and Zac Efron in its remaining major roles.According to Deadline, Williams is in talks for a role in the film, which is thought to be that of opera singer Jenny Lind, AKA the Swedish Nightingale, who toured with Barnum in the early 1850s with considerable success. Efron is also being sought, but there is no suggestion as yet as to who he might play.The Greatest Showman on Earth is being billed as Hollywood’s first original live-action film musical in two decades (since 1992’s Newsies), and is due to be directed by commercials director Michael Gracey (best known for the Evian Roller Babies ad) with a script from Star Wars: The Force Awakens writer Michael Arndt.
