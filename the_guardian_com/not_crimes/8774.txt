Thin this The June drop is a fruit tree’s way of jettisoning excess immature fruit that it won’t have the resources to support to maturity.

It’s painful, but worth it in the long run.Read this If you know a poblano from a bird’s eye, but want to take your chilli knowledge a few more steps up the Scoville scale, check out the new book 101 Chillies To Try Before You Die, by David Floyd (£10, Cassell).Plant this When all else fades by autumn, asters come into their own.
