1 Keith TysonOnce there was a machine that made art. It belonged to Keith Tyson, who in the 1990s played with the idea of a completely random, automatic way of creating art when the digital age was still in its infancy. Two decades and a Turner prize later, Tyson is back with a display of the epic wall drawings in which he works out new ideas. These are pieces that veer between the sublime and the silly but, most of all, they are spectacular evidence of the survival of drawing as an art in the 21st century.Jerwood Gallery, Hastings, Saturday 28 Jan to Sunday 4 Jun2 Tim Noble And Sue WebsterThe shadow art of Noble and Webster is nothing if not ingenious. Their Arcimboldo-like sculptures made of grotesque stuff magically resolve into shadow profiles of the artists in a way that is technically spectacular, hugely entertaining – and perhaps a tiny bit superficial. Artists evolve, however, and in this exhibition they show colossal sculptures that started out as small wire toys. These looming images explore the nature of sexual difference under the tell-all title Sticks With Dicks And Slits.

Photograph: Richard Wilson, courtesy of Annely Juda Fine Art3 Richard WilsonIt must be strange to make a work of art so powerful that it overshadows all your later creations – especially if, like Wilson, you are an experimental sculptor more interested in responding to architecture than creating “iconic” images. 20:50, Wilson’s tank of sump oil, is a modern masterpiece but his protean art has never resulted in anything else as memorable. Here he shows new works that quirkily reimagine space. Annely Juda Fine Art, W1, to Saturday 25 Mar4 Haris EpaminondaThis artist has a complicated sensibility that embraces collecting, reading and history. Her installation includes collages of ancient Greek and Roman art, a sunset over Cyprus and objects from her collection, including pottery, brought together in a poetic and contemplative experience. Great to see contemporary art that spans world history in its imaginative reach.Rodeo Gallery, WC2, to Saturday 18 Feb5 BALTIC 39: Figure FourThis art space run in cooperation with the BALTIC Centre and located on Newcastle’s High Bridge is holding its fourth annual open submission show.
