When you buy a newspaper or borrow a book you know where you are and what to expect, roughly speaking. But remarks and writing on the internet can take you entirely by surprise, despite what is said about us being in a bubble. Sometimes what you see online is like a newspaper, sometimes a radio. And sometimes you come across things that seem much like a personal message – but, however personal, I never seem to have any idea where it came from.Of course, we’ve long received letters addressed to “the householder”, which I suppose I am, since there’s no one else except the cat living here and my young friend from Share and Care, which matches a young person who needs somewhere to live with someone older who needs a bit of help. She’s extremely useful when it comes to sorting out what is happening on the internet.It’s odd really: we live among stacks of other people and we can all – well, mostly – read. In short, we are used to being connected in any number of ways. But none of that necessarily prevents people from becoming confused or lonely. It’s a natural human instinct – whatever your age – to want to find out about new things, or to know about what’s going on. Finding friendly people, learning about new entertainment or discovering different ways of coming across work can all provide the inspiration or company we need to stave off confusion and loneliness.Life was doubtless simpler when everyone knew who they might meet and what they might read. But wasn’t that, in fact, more of a bubble? It was simpler then, but nothing like so rewarding. A confusing world is the price we pay for interesting lives.What do you think? Have your say below
