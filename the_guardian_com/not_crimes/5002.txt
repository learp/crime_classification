Snapshot: From farmers to whisky distillersThis photograph is of my maternal great-grandparents, John and Jane Howison, and was taken in 1902 at their farm at Over Fingask in the Carse of Gowrie, Perth and Kinross, where they had farmed for 33 years. The picture hangs in my office as without Great-Grandfather John, I wouldn’t be sitting here looking across the road as our farm steading is transformed into a new distillery. The young chap in the middle is my grandfather, Ian Howison, whose daughter Dorothy (Dodo) was my mother.John was a well-respected, hard-working farmer and he and his wife Jane had 10 children, eight of whom are in this picture. There were two little girls who would have become my great-aunts, Jeanie and Isabella, but they died within a short time of one another in 1883, so the family in this picture, like so many others at the time, had already known great sorrow.Ian was then the youngest and would have only been 14 when the family moved across the river Tay to take on the tenancy of Parkhill farm, then owned by the Earl of Zetland.Lindores Abbey farm, which was bought by my great-grandfather John in 1913 for £3,000, was passed on to my mother, Dorothy, and from her to myself and my brothers and sister, so the family link to the land has lasted for more than 100 years.My mother passed away in 1984 at the age of 47, five years younger than I am now, followed by my father in 2003 and my elder brother Grant in 2013, which is why my wife, Helen, and I, together with our daughters, Pops and Gee, as well as my younger brother Robbie live at the farm. `I keep the picture in my office to inspire me and to help me focus on the job in hand – building the distillery is a massive undertaking and I have been working on it for nearly 20 years. It has taken blood, sweat and tears to get it to this stage, but none of it would be possible without the people in this photograph and their descendants. Their hard work over the years has enabled us to keep the property in the family and over the next year the 300-year-old abbey steading will be transformed.The old dairy will become the still room and I love the idea that the buildings once used to milk the cows, turning the grass from surrounding fields into milk, will now become the place where barley from the ancient abbey fields will be turned into whisky.Drew McKenzie-SmithPlaylist: The DJ gave the game away on our secretChapel of Love by the Dixie Cups“Goin’ to the chapel / And we’re gonna get ma-a-arried / Goin’ to the chapel / And we’re gonna get ma-a-arried”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest In September 1967 my boyfriend of six weeks proposed to me. Well, he had actually dragged me off a friend of his who was kissing me and said “Get off her, we’re getting married.”We decided to wait until my 19th birthday in December to make it official, but we bought my engagement ring ready for the day.The night before my birthday we were going to our usual pub/dance place and as he had the ring with him we thought let’s put it on and see if any friends notice. We walked into the room … the DJ, Steve Maxted (very well known in the south-east), had obviously been tipped off as he  immediately shouted out “Congratulations!” and played Chapel of Love.Never have I felt more embarrassed as we knew nearly everyone there and they all turned round and to look at us – my boyfriend with a huge, silly grin on his face and me wanting to run away and hide.Later that night we told his family we were engaged and then told mine. Hopefully they never knew that everyone else found out before them.Just over two years later, we did go to our “chapel of love” and after 49 years together I still remember his “proposal” and later walking into the dancehall full of all those staring people to the sound of the Dixie Cups.Lesley ThomsonWe love to eat: Nancy’s Marmite pastaIngredients500g pack of spaghetti50g lump of butter200ml pasta water after you drain itMore Marmite than you think sane (1 tbspn at least)Grated cheese to topParsley (optional)Cook the spaghetti and drain when it’s ready, reserving some of the cooking water. While it’s draining, melt the butter in the same pan, and over a very gentle heat add at least 150ml of the cooking water and the Marmite, and stir until dissolved.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Nancy’s Marmite pasta.Put the spaghetti back in the pan, a handful at a time and stir it well so that all the spaghetti gets well coated with the Marmitey liquid.When all the pasta has been added there should still be a little liquid visible at the bottom of the pot. If not, add a little more butter, Marmite and cooking water. You could add chopped parsley (or anything else you fancy) at this stage too.When you dish up, take the pasta from the bottom of the pan so it brings up lots of buttery, savoury liquid with it, top with cheese and slurp up. Feeds two adults, one large teenager and two growing boys.My lovely stepdaughter, Nancy, introduced us to this splendid dish, the first meal she ever cooked for the whole family, and it went down a treat. Unfortunately, she has been in hospital far away from us for the last five months and we’ve all missed her enormously.Whenever we eat this we all think of her and look forward to when she can be with us again (maybe even this Christmas, fingers crossed). Although she’s known for her antipathy in the kitchen department, this has become one of the family’s favourite’s. Nancy, you’ve unknowingly created a dish with your name on it at the tender age of 20 (it tastes best when you make it) so thanks from all of us.
