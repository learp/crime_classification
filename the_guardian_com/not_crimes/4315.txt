I’ve been looking out of our lounge window onto a singed hay meadow all summer, which would be fine if we lived opposite a farm. But what I’m gazing at, rather downheartedly, is my attempt at creating an annual border of grasses and flowers. My vision has not, it seems, been realised. But being resilient leads you closer to your gardening utopia, so I have already observed, learned and formed a plan B. Essentially, an annual flower’s goal is to grow, flower, seed and die, and if it can do this in an almighty rush, so much the better. I sowed foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum) and Calendula ‘Sunset Buff’ back in February, the hordeum into modules and the calendula into a seedbed. Both were then transplanted into a sunny border come April. By July I’d got what I wanted – tufts of squirrel grass pinpricked by corn marigolds – it looked lovely but in the heat of August it rapidly scorched away, seeds set, job done. A combination of our light, sandy soil and stunted plants resulted in the briefest of effects. My plan B? Simple - to sow the annuals direct in autumn.How to grow your own wedding flowers There are endless annuals that can be sown now (see the list, below) – the only prerequisite is that they are hardy. The likes of nigella, field poppy and cerinthe will thrive if sown directly into the soil (they sulk when transplanted), and if started off now, they’ll germinate quickly in the still-warm soil. Hardiness will carry them through winter and their head start will encourage a much stronger root system, more robust plants and earlier yet longer flowering. Essentially, it would deliver the result that eluded me this summer.

Prairie planting akin to my annual grass and flower blend, classic cornfield annuals, a cutting garden, striking bold partners – hardy annuals are versatile plants. Pots are an option, too, as long as the seeds are sown direct. Container size can be small, but the resulting drought stress will reduce your flowering season, so opt for larger tubs if you can. Yes, you can sow into modules for transplanting out in spring, but again, you’ll get smaller, less floriferous plants in most cases.Gardening makes you feel good The most important practical aspect for this project is the sowing. For successful emergence you want a warm, wet soil. If daytime temperatures are only just starting to fall below 20C (as they are here in Essex) then the earth will be adequately warm for good emergence. If your location is cooler, covering sown areas with cloches would be beneficial to ensure your seedlings are adequately sized come winter. Moisture levels aren’t a problem for some parts of the country, but our sandy Essex plot has received little precipitation since late July. Over the weekend, thankfully, we had a very welcome 22mm of rainfall which has left our plot in prime sowing condition. Other areas, however, are still very dry so if you know there’s a moisture deficit on your soil I would strongly recommend the following plan of action:Clear the area you wish to sow of unwanted vegetation and (unless it’s rock hard, in which case this is nigh-on impossible) fracture the topsoil repeatedly with a garden fork so irrigation water penetrates the earth rather than running off the bone-dry surface.Soak the area thoroughly the day before sowing. I plan to leave a sprinkler on the border for a couple of hours the night before. You’re aiming to re-wet the soil and supply moisture for the period from sowing till emergence (which in warm weather is more or less one week), so be as generous as you can.You then ideally want a dry, sunny sowing day so that you can rake the surface to create a crumbly, not claggy, seedbed. Then either broadcast your annual seeds, or sow in swathes or lines, depending on your chosen effect. Rake over gently and give a gentle water in. The resulting seedlings will grow on a little in the autumn warmth, slowing down as winter follows to a point of dormancy. If winter frosts are particularly harsh, you can cover with cloches, but it’s not essential. Come March, your plants will gently stir back into life, ready to flower profusely summer-long. I love it when a plan B comes together.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Pot marigold (Calendula officinalis) is hardy enough to survive through the winter, ready to flower next year.
