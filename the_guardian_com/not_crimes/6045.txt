In Europe there’s a lot of couples. Over here there still a rarity, it’s still this separatist type of thing over here. I don’t know what it’d be for like for us if we weren’t known in our own right.

Here’s a statement from Mark Guiliana, who played drums on Blackstar: David, THANK YOU from the bottom of my humble heart for letting me into your life, and in doing so changing mine. It was an absolute honor to create with you. I am forever grateful. Love, MarkThere’s another from Def Leppard’s Joe Elliott who had a tribute act to the Ziggy-period of Bowie: He’s been a massive part of my life since I first heard Starman in 1972. So many of us came in at that moment, myself, Bono, Boy George, Morrissey, Gary Kemp, Jim Kerr, Brett Anderson, Pete Murphy, Gary Numan, millions of fans, all very different from each other but all with one thing in common, the belief that a true rock & roll alien had landed on earth & he was ours. I own every record he ever made, he was plastered all over my bedroom wall as a kid, he was my very first bootleg, his CDs take up 2 whole shelves in my collection. I have personally recorded over 25 of his songs either on my own, with Leppard or with the Cybernauts. I met him two or three times and always found him charming and engaging. It is said, never meet your heroes, they will let you down. Bullshit. He was open, funny, a good listener and when myself and Phil joined David on stage with Queen, Mick Ronson and Ian Hunter at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Gig in 1992 it became one of the most memorable musical moments of my life. I can’t believe he’s gone. A huge hole has opened up in my heart and it feels like my youth has been further ripped away from me. At least I have a lifetime of his music to comfort me, as we all have, as he left behind one hell of a legacy. The Starman waiting in the sky waits no longer. Rest in Peace David Bowie and thank you for giving us believers something to believe in.”Updatedat 9.16pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.05pm GMT20:05Here’s some more on Bowie’s style legacy.David Bowie’s style legacy: ‘He stole ideas from everywhere’ FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.54pm GMT19:54A tribute too far?Crocs Shoes (@Crocs)Your magic will be missed, but your inspiration lives on forever. #DavidBowie pic.twitter.com/M9SdeGynvOJanuary 11, 2016FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.07pm GMT19:07MTV News (@MTVNews)In our 1983 David Bowie interview, he criticizes MTV for not playing enough music videos by black artists. https://t.co/G2ePJFcaRNJanuary 11, 2016FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.56pm GMT18:56Bowie streaming  David Bowie Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesUnsurprisingly Spotify saw streams of Bowie songs spike by 2700% when news of his death broke.

I never felt like I fit in growing up in Michigan. Like an oddball or a freak. I went to see him in concert at Cobo Arena in Detroit. It was the first concert I’d ever been too. I snuck out of the house with my girlfriend wearing a cape.We got caught after and I was grounded for the summer. I didn’t care.I already had many of his records and was so inspired by the way he played with gender confusion.Was both masculine and feminine.Funny and serious.Clever and wise.His lyrics were witty ironic and mysterious.At the time he was the thin white Duke and he had mime artists on stage with him and very specific choreographyAnd I saw how he created a persona and used different art forms within the arena of rock and Roll to create entertainment.I found him so inspiring and innovative.Unique and provocative. A real genius.His music was always inspiring but seeing him live set me off on a journey that for me I hope will never end.His photographs are hanging all over my house today.He was so chic and beautiful and elegant.So ahead of his time.Thank you David Bowie.I owe you a lot.The world will miss you.LoveMUpdatedat 7.37pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.15pm GMT18:15'Once in a while, the world lights on fire with the music'  Lady Gaga with her Golden Globe Photograph: Splash News/CorbisWhile on the Hollywood Reporter podcast, Lady Gaga spoke about the influence of Bowie. Billboard reports: “When I fell in love with David Bowie, when I was living on the Lower East Side, I always felt that his glamor was something he was using to express a message to people that was very healing for their souls,” she recalled to THR’s Scott Feinberg. “He is a true, true artist and I don’t know if I ever went, ‘Oh, I’m going to be that way like this,’ or if I arrived upon it slowly, realizing it was my calling and that’s what drew me to him …“I just know that you can use the theater of your imagination to entertain people beyond their wildest dreams and then you can put something inside of that that changes the world, and that to me is when you make something truly great as an artist,” she continued as she connected the dots between Bowie’s career and her own.“You don’t nail it every time. I definitely don’t, with all my songs, always hit that note. You try. And every once in a while, the world lights on fire with the music.”Lada Gaga announces new album after winning a Golden Globe Updatedat 6.43pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.04pm GMT18:04  Faddy duddy: Martin Amis Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the GuardianThe New Statesman has published Martin Amis’s gig review from 1973 where he predicted Bowie would be a fad … This incongruity may be responsible for Bowie’s appeal and for what (if anything) is sinister about it. Among certain more affluent hippies Bowie is apparently the symbol of a kind of thrilling extremism, a life-style (the word is for once permissible) characterised by sexual omnivorousness, lavish use of stimulants – particularly cocaine, very much an élitist drug, being both expensive and galvanising – self-parodied narcissism, and a glamorously early death. To dignify this unhappy outlook with such a term as “nihilist” would, of course, be absurd; but Bowie does appear to be a new focus for the vague, predatory, escapist reveries of the alienated young. Although Bowie himself is unlikely to last long as a cult, it is hard to believe that the feelings he has aroused or aggravated will vanish along with the fashion built round him.

Long-time fans and newcomers to Bowie’s music gathered at his home on Lafayette Street in New York’s Soho neighborhood.Greg Petan, a 52-year-old artist who lives in the Soho area, came to leave a copy of David Live, the 1974 record, among flowers and candles at the artist’s home.“It’s in the title I guess,” about why he chose the record. “Greatfully, through the medium of recorded music people can live for ever.”Petan said he’s been listening to Bowie’s music since he was eight years old. Others who came to pay tribute at the doorstep just discovered the artist. “I’m fairly young but this past year I started getting into his music,” said Adrian Vallejo, a 21-year-old fan. “I just know his impact on everything, he’s not just some random person.

It’s well worth finding the time for. Here’s a snippet: Dozens of books have been written about him, some of them hugely illuminating, but something unknowable lurked at the centre. Almost from the start, Bowie’s career raised questions to which a definitive answer seemed elusive. If he was, as he loudly claimed in 1971, gay, then what was the deal with the very visible wife and the son he’d just written a touching little song about? If he was, as he dramatically announced from the stage of the Hammersmith Odeon in July 1973, retiring – either from music, or from live performance, or from the character of Ziggy Stardust – then what was he doing back onstage in London three months later, belting out The Jean Genie in full Ziggy drag? How does anyone in the state Bowie was, by all accounts, in by 1975 – ravaged by cocaine to the point where he seemed to have genuinely gone insane; paranoid and hallucinating – make an album like Station to Station: not a messily compelling document of a mind unravelling, like the solo albums of his great idol Syd Barrett, but a work of precision and focus and exquisitely controlled power that’s arguably his best? In a world of cameraphones and social media, how could anyone as famous as Bowie disappear from public view as completely as he seemed to between 2008 and 2013: moreover, how could anyone as famous as Bowie record a comeback album in the middle of Manhattan without anyone noticing or leaking details to the media? How does anyone stage-manage their own death as dramatically as Bowie appears to have done: releasing their most acclaimed album in decades, filled with strange, enigmatic songs whose meaning suddenly pulls into focus when their author dies two days later?David Bowie: the man who thrilled the world Updatedat 6.06pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.35pm GMT17:35Kendrick Lamar, whose album To Pimp A Butterfly was said to have influenced Blackstar, has been tweeting about Bowie’s death.Kendrick Lamar (@kendricklamar)Hoping 2 meet u after we heard the news.

The park is going to be kept open all night so fans can come pay their tributes.   The Beckenham shrine. Photograph: Hannah Ellis Petersen Standing on the Beckenham park bandstand next to the Bowie shrine, local Nigel Goodge said: “I came here because it feels nice to stand on the spot where he played when he was just 22, way back in 1969. I was 14 when I saw him do Starman on Top of the Pops – my dad was horrified but it was hugely influential on me. He was this ordinary guy filled with an extraordinary creative spirit. I’ve been reeling since I heard the news this morning, I’m still in shock. But in Bowie style, he went out with a great performance. And we are so incredibly proud that Beckenham, us, has a place in the Bowie story. That such an influential giant of a man started out in this dull suburban town.”Updatedat 5.38pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
