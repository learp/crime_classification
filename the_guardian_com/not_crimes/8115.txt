Divergent is the first instalment of the Divergent series, and upon watching the film before reading the book, I can honestly say that the book is so much better than the movie.The book is packed with detail and emotion, and as the reader I really felt as if I could relate to the main character, Tris. Divergent is the story of Beatrice (Tris) who lives in a society divided by personalities and human rights and who is part of Abnegation, one of five factions (the others being Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite). She changes her faction to be part of Dauntless after she is warned that she is a Divergent (a mixture of two or more factions) from her aptitude test. Her quest to being a true Dauntless begins as she and the rest of the new Dauntless members are forced to take part in various tests to see their passion and commitment to the faction. This involves jumping off a roof, fighting, knife throwing and more. Tris meets Four, who she is attracted to. They both learn of a secret that the government is withholding from them, and then try and save their faction from destroying the innocents of Abnegation.
