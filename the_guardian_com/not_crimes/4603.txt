When I told people I was interviewing Thomas Haden Church, the conversation went a bit like this:“Who?”“You know, the sleazebag character from Sideways.”“Oh, right, him!” Sideways, the critically acclaimed 2004 movie about two middle-aged men wining, was a defining moment in Church’s career. Church’s portrayal of Jack, a womanizing, washed-up actor who cheats on his fiancée while on a road trip with his depressed, wine-obsessed pal, earned him an Oscar nomination. It also raised his profile and brought him new opportunities – including, he says, his latest project: the HBO series Divorce, which premieres this month.Divorce review – Sarah Jessica Parker shines in bleak and bitter HBO comeback “Twelve years later, a lot of what comes my way I attribute to [Sideways] kind of kickstarting everything,” Church told me, speaking on the phone from his Texas ranch. Sideways led to a role on the movie Smart People, where he worked alongside Sarah Jessica Parker. When they were promoting the film in 2008, the two “just really hit it off”, Church said. So much, in fact, that when Parker signed on to do Divorce, her first major return to TV after 12 years, Church was her first choice for ‘man I’d most like to have an acrimonious on-screen divorce with’, it has been reported.She sent him the script last year and persuaded him to get on board. The two star opposite each other as a suburban couple whose marriage has dramatically broken down. Why did Parker think he might be such a good fit for the role, I ask? “Purely out of working together before and getting along great,” Church says before adding: “Also, I was age-appropriate.” But was there also something divorce-appropriate about his persona? Church often seems to play the guy who doesn’t really seem to want a happily ever after. In Wings, for example, he played Lowell, a divorced, dim-witted mechanic whose former wife had cheated on him. In Ned and Stacey he’s in a marriage of convenience; Stacey married him for his fancy apartment. In George of the Jungle he plays a rich villain who is duped by his fiancée into marrying a gorilla. “It seems like in most of my movies I play a loner,” Church muses. Church seems to be something of a loner in real life as well – or, at least, he holds his privacy dear. He likes to stay at home on his ranch and avoids LA and New York as much as he can. He’s also been focusing more on off-camera work such as writing and directing recently. Divorce will mark the first time in 18 years that he has starred in a television series.

The “sharpness of the script”, for one (the pilot was written by Sharon Horgan, the producer and co-star of Amazon’s Catastrophe.) The way in which the script examines divorce, he explains, was intriguing, humorous but “it wasn’t going to be a knee-slapping hilarathon. Meaning funny – not Hillary Clinton.” (There’s no escaping the election these days.) Church also cites the Divorce team’s singular commitment to collaboration as a reason for his enthusiasm. “They were immediately embracing of my ideas. Not just about Robert, the character, but about how the story was told and my perspective on examining, dramatically and comedically, what those characters were going through.”What perspective on divorce did Church bring, exactly? As he points out, he has never been divorced (or married). “But I did go through a pretty significant upheaval several years ago. I have an ex with two children. So having gone through something as sort of life-changing as that myself … ” he trails off a bit, sounding uncomfortable, and pivots to something less personal. “Also, as a middle-aged man, I would say the majority of my close friends have gone through divorce. And business colleagues, and parents at school. My writing partner has been through two divorces. My surroundings are littered with the detritus of divorce.” And Church has channeled this detritus into his art, apparently. Ultimately, he stresses, divorce is more than a legal process, “it’s a family being torn apart at its foundation”.People tend to take sides in divorces; should we expect to be Team Church or Team Parker? Part of the point of Divorce, Church explains, is to show how the breakdown of a marriage is rarely just one person’s fault. “I think initially the audience is like, OK, that’s the bad guy in this marriage,” Church says. “Then I think it’s like, wait, we were wrong about that. It becomes a card game of who did what to whom, the audience starts to keep score of who is ultimately at fault, who gets the blame.” Ultimately, he says, quoting Jim Morrison, “With any divorce nobody really gets out alive, nobody gets out clean.”Perhaps not even the audience will get out clean. What we see on-screen can often influence our real lives. Take Sideways, for example. It didn’t just have an effect on Church’s career; it had a measurable impact on people’s drinking habits. The film caused a 16% increase in pinot noir wines immediately after its release, its popularity increasing ever since. Merlot, on the other hand, was much maligned in the movie (“If anyone orders merlot I am leaving. I am not drinking fucking merlot!”), and a decrease in the wine’s popularity has been attributed to the movie.I wonder if Divorce will have any impact on US divorce rates. “Offhand, I would say no,” Church replies. “But maybe it will cause somebody to pause and reflect and re-examine the state of their marriage or relationship.” You have been cautioned: Divorce might not be the best date night viewing if you’re in a rocky relationship. And whatever you do, don’t watch it with a glass of merlot.
