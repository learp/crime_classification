The Peruvian government is planning a new law loosening the social and environmental checks on companies exploring for oil and gas, according to a controversial announcement by the Energy Minister.Current law states that companies must research and write “Environmental Impact Assessments” (EIAs) of proposed operations before submitting them to the government for approval and then beginning exploration.However, Energy Minister Eleodoro Mayorga Alba announced this week that oil and gas companies planning to explore by conducting seismic tests will be exempt from the EIA process. Speaking at an event in Lima, he said that Energy Ministry and Environment Ministry personnel are currently working on the law and had reached several agreements:[One] agreement is to eliminate environmental impact assessments for seismic operations. The [oil and gas] industry has its laws, the industry has principles, it has well-established practices, and the idea is to move away from procedures and permissions to action. The companies know what they have to do.Mayorga’s comments were reported by Peruvian newspaper Gestion which stated that the new law, according to the minister, is intended to “accelerate investment in the oil and gas sector.”“I hope to be able to sign this law, together with the Environment Minister [Manuel] Pulgar-Vidal, and propose its enforcement in the next few days,” Gestion reported Mayorga, who was sworn in as minister on 25 February, saying. At nine p.m. on Thursday the Energy Ministry issued a short statement titled “Procedure to do seismic tests for oil and gas exploration will be accelerated”, providing more details on Mayorga’s announcement but backtracking slightly: The Minister explained that seismic exploration in oil and gas lots may be carried out through an Environmental Impact Declaration (DIA), which is “a quicker and simpler procedure than an Environmental Impact Assessment.” However, he specified that, depending on the area to be explored, an EIA could still be required and that the predictability and objectivity of such studies will accelerate the approval process in areas where operations have already taken place.The Environment Ministry responded with its own statement yesterday that was clearly intended to distance itself from Mayorga and referred to “concern expressed by the citizenry” about the proposed law.“The preparation of this law is in process and still under discussion at a technical level,” the Environment Ministry states. “No final decisions or agreements [between the two ministries] yet exist.”Peru’s president Ollanta Humala has been dragged into the controversy too. The Environment Ministry’s statement was re-posted on his Facebook account with the message “Yes, there will be EIAs for oil and gas exploration”, but that was quickly deleted and replaced with “Environmental hydrocarbon law is at the discussion phase.”EIAs involve scores of researchers and can run to 1000s of pages, and include extensive details about the environmental characteristics of the region where operations are scheduled, the people living there, and the potential impacts. Getting approval for an EIA – doing the research and “consulting” with local people, writing it, presenting it to the Energy Ministry, and making changes to proposed operations required by the Ministry or others – can take a company two or three years. Seismic tests often involve huge areas of land, 100s of workers and the detonation of explosives underground, leading Peru’s ombudsman, the Defensoria del Pueblo, to call the seismic stage the “riskiest” stage of oil and gas exploration for certain indigenous peoples in the Amazon. That view is partly echoed by lawyer Juan Carlos Ruiz Molleda, from the Lima-based Institute of Legal Defence, who says the exploration stage “is the one that generates most impact in indigenous peoples’ territories.” In a Facebook post yesterday morning he wrote:The EIA is key and indispensable for the prior consultation processes [supposed to be held with potentially affected indigenous peoples] because it is the only way they have to evaluate whether they are for or against a project. [Abolishing EIAs also] ignores the ruling by the Inter-American Court on Human Rights on the Sarayacu Kichwa People v Ecuador case, which said that EIAs must be written before consultation takes place.The potential impact of abolishing EIAs on indigenous peoples is particularly serious because so many of Peru’s oil and gas concessions currently at the exploration stage include indigenous territories. According to a report by Peru’s oil and gas licensing agency, Perupetro, as of November 2013 there were 50 oil and gas concessions in the exploration stage – 28 in the Amazon, two in the sierra. In addition, Perupetro is hoping to establish 26 new oil and gas concessions in the Amazon in 2014, and in recent months has been promoting them to potential investors in Peru, Colombia, Panama and the USA. “A decision [to abolish EIAs for seismic testing] could run afoul of Peru’s obligations under international law,” says Marissa Vahlsing, a lawyer from NGO Earthrights International. “Those obligations require that the socio-environmental impacts of large scale projects in indigenous peoples’ territories be studied before the project begins, and this goes hand-in-hand with the requirement that indigenous peoples be “informed” about administrative measures that could affect their rights and territories. Abolishing EIAs essentially takes the “I” out of “FPIC” – free, prior and informed consent.”Monti Aguirre, from NGO International Rivers, told The Guardian that any such move would run contrary to efforts by international civil society to adopt higher standards for EIAs and strengthen them according to “international best practice”:It’s very worrying that Peru’s Energy Ministry is instead trying to water down existing protections, and even suggesting doing away with EIAs. When done with the interests of affected communities in mind, they are one of the best tools for evaluating the likely impacts of a proposed activity on human health and safety, flora, fauna, soil, air, water, climate, landscape and cultural resources, among other factors.For Peruvian journalist Claudia Cisneros, Mayorga’s announcement is evidence of a government “subjugated by the extractive industries’ big lobbyists to the detriment of the environment, social harmony, and those without a voice.”“This is the beginning of a plan to take apart the advances in environmental regulation in order to cash in on investment,” she says. “I think it puts the suitability of Peru as the host for the UN’s climate change talks this year in serious doubt.”The Energy Ministry’s Cesar Asin Chumpitaz did not respond to requests for comment.
