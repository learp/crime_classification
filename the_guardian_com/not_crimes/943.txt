The trolls of the Treasury, my unflattering term for the people who are the primary obstacle to green ambition in the UK, have had an unwelcome light shone into their dark world. A damning report from MPs exposes their fossilised thinking on green growth and green taxes in particular.The central charge of the report, from the environmental audit committee, is that "the UK's finance ministry has undermined public trust in green taxes by appearing to use them as a revenue raising tool rather than a serious attempt to change environmentally damaging behaviour."It cites in particular the cutting of a penny from fuel duty in the last budget, which I called "shaking an impotent fist at rising global prices", while providing no extra money to support public transport. There are more examples in our news story.The chair of the EAC, Joan Walley, has a solution: "The Treasury should start to rebuild trust in environmental taxes by ring-fencing some of the revenues raised from fuel duty to cut soaring train and bus fares."She is quite right. Consider the contempt in which many motorists hold speed cameras, or "government cash machines", as they like to call them. The evidence that speed cameras save lives is incontrovertible, yet the failure to use the revenue to cut the costs of motoring means a righteous fury can take hold and destroy reason.The report could have also mentioned the straight smash-and-grab with which the Treasury converted the revenue-neutral carbon reduction commitment into a tax.But, as important as the tax issue is, the real sting of the report is in the broadside it delivers against a battery of Treasury policies.• Subsidies for new nuclear power: The government denies these exist, but the report states: "The government's definition of a 'subsidy' in relation to nuclear ... does not hold up to scrutiny. Nuclear will be subsidised in the same way as renewable energy sources, which have no adverse environmental impacts, and nuclear will benefit the most."• The bank that can't borrow: The green investment bank "could be a driver for the green economy but preventing it from borrowing will limit its impact on renewables and the support it can provide for the Green Deal. Fresh consideration should be given to when ... the bar on the Bank's lending powers might be eased."• Green growth: The Plan for Growth "did not provide the much needed step change to aid the transition to a low-carbon economy, and in some areas - e.g. the zero carbon homes standard - the Government has taken a backwards step. The forthcoming Roadmap to a Green Economy must dispel any suggestion that a green economy is an 'add-on' rather than an integral part of the Government's sustainable development plans."Ouch. Those I talk to in and around government repeatedly cite the Treasury, and its politically-astute chancellor George Osborne, as the roadblock to a world-leading green economy. The department sits obstinately in the way, brandishing the outdated orthodoxy that "green" and "growth" cannot be paired. Some of the trolls protest: "We're pretty radical compared to most finance ministries," one told me.But with China, Germany, Korea and others racing ahead towards the low-carbon economy that represents the only sustainable economic future, that's just not good enough.
