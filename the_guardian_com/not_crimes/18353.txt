Streets of Philadelphia – Bruce SpringsteenEven though this is a song about a bloke slowly dying of Aids, Bruce keeps it upbeat and catchy. That’s why he’s the boss.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Slough – David Brent Everything in this song is factually accurate, so you can learn as you listen. Clever.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Crazy Maze – Des’ree “Money don’t make my world go round / I’m reaching out to a higher ground.” Me too, Des’ree. Me too.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Ooh La La – David BrentThis is a song about driving across America, picking up chicks on the way. They say you should write about what you know, and I know I would like to do that one day.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Every Breath You Take – The PoliceSting singing about keeping his eye on some girl. It’s a lovely tune, but someone should tell him the difference between wooing and stalking.

Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Fast Car – Tracy ChapmanA lovely song about how Tracy wants a lift out of town to get away from her lazy drunk father.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Luka – Suzanne VegaVega had a mega hit with this song about a noisy, accident-prone kid who used to live in the flat above her. I bet she was able to move out when the royalties came flooding in.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest No Woman No Cry – Bob MarleyBob bloody loved women, but no one likes it when they cry.
