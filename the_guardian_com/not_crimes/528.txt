Armed police have enforced the partial demolition of one of Egypt’s most respected art galleries, heightening fears about its future after it was closed to the public in December.Around 30 riot police surrounded the main building of Townhouse gallery in central Cairo on Monday, evicting residents and ordering labourers to start destroying the interior, according to witnesses.The destruction happened despite an order from the deputy governor of Cairo on Sunday to postpone the demolition of the recently renovated five-storey building, which also houses several families and mechanics’ workshops, pending an assessment of why a section of it collapsed last Wednesday.A curator who worked at the gallery for five years, said at least 30 police arrived at about 8.30am on Monday and oversaw around a dozen workers, who ripped up the floors with “picks and shovels and their bare hands”.“They appear to be creating significant damage throughout the whole building. It’s very hard to witness.”Huda Lutfi, an artist whose studio is in the main building, said on Tuesday that labourers were continuing to gut the interior. “They are ripping the place to pieces.”A post on the gallery’s Facebook page showing images of the destruction said: “Police forces removing windows from all the apartments of the building.”Mido Sadek, a former Townhouse employee, posted a photograph on Facebook on Monday showing some of the evicted tenants sitting amid the rubble with their possessions. “Some families will sleep in the street tonight,” he wrote. The incident comes less than two months after Townhouse staff were allowed to return to work having been ordered to comply with new legal restrictions, some of which the gallery’s director, William Wells, said amounted to state control.The contemporary art gallery and the affiliated Rawabet theatre were closed on 29 December after a raid by more than 20 officials from the interior ministry’s censorship authority, the tax authority and the manpower ministry, which found “administrative irregularities”. Prior to the collapse, it had been hoped that the theatre would reopen on 16 April with a full schedule of performances.The curator said: “The potential loss of the main building is a huge blow but the gallery will adapt accordingly.”
