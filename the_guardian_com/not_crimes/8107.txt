Despite a court ruling refusing to release her from her contract with Sony – and tying her to an imprint run by Dr Luke, whom she accuses of sexually assaulting her – Kesha has entered the studio again, and a new single will be released on Friday.The end of #FreeKesha: judge's ruling brings pop star back to square one Back in February, the EDM star Zedd tweeted Kesha the offer that he would “be happy to produce a song for you if you want my help”. Two weekends ago, she joined him on stage on the opening weekend of the Coachella festival in California, where she performed his 2015 song True Colors. That is the song the pair recorded and which will be released on Friday, according to Zedd.This week, both Zedd and Kesha posted images on Instagram apparently showing her in the studio. “It’s a miracle when someone gives you a chance at finding your voice again with no reason other than that he is a fucking beautiful person with a heart of gold,” Kesha wrote. Although Kesha was unsuccessful in her effort to end her recording deal with Dr Luke’s Sony imprint Kemosabe, a spokesperson for Dr Luke previously told Billboard: “The court repeatedly stated Kesha is already free to record without Dr Luke.”Dr Luke, real name Lukasz Gottwald, denies Kesha’s claims of sexual assault.This story was updated on 27 April to include the information about the song’s release.
