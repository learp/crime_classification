      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Relationship expert Ty Tashiro.I fell into this career by accident. I originally was studying stress and trauma, but at graduate school I ended up taking a class with one of the first psychologists to study relationships. My early work then focused on people’s personal growth after break-up or a divorce, which got me interested in what makes a relationship actually work.The answer to everlasting love is complicated. There’s so much variability between people that it’s overzealous to make prescriptions about what people should do with their love life. So if you see an article which says, “three easy steps for lasting love” it has to be a simplification and will only work for a small amount of people.What actually matters in relationships is whether the two people are kind and emotionally stable. A lot of dating services match people based on how similar their personalities are, but this isn’t predictive of long-term stability. What matters is whether the two people are secure and emotionally stable. If so, their relationship is more likely to be a success. And interestingly, if one of the pair is emotionally unstable, studies show that they will almost always be the one to break off the relationship. People don’t like that answer because being “emotionally stable” isn’t the most exciting trait in the world. If you have a partner who is emotionally stable they may be predictable, but you’ll have huge relationships advantages in the long run. You’ll continue to reap benefits from an emotionally stable partner for years to come. Choosing someone like that is a long-term investment in your relationship.Our heart rules our head when it comes to love. There’s a divide between our emotions and intellect in relationships – our emotions sometimes take us in one direction, say if we’re attracted to someone really good looking or powerful – but these things don’t matter long-term. There’s an intellectual side to love where we know we need someone with a kind heart who is committed. So the answer to finding someone like that is to go with wisdom, not fleeting impulses – there’s such an emphasis in our culture on the passionate side of love that the wise part often loses out.In my work, I’ve learnt so many strange things about love. Relationship are weird in wonderful ways. The most interesting thing is how much the small things matter in long-term love. There have been studies of people who have recently lost their spouse, and when you ask them: what do you miss the most? They always talk about small day-to-day details. One man said he missed that his wife knew he liked two lumps of sugar in his coffee, another said that they missed how their husband always forgot to take his gloves in the car. Small things that we take for granted are the driving force for loving relationships.There’s a lot of diversity of opinion about love. By speaking to people I hear a lot of different perspectives about love, and try to be as open minded as possible. I have one way of looking a relationships – the scientific way – but art, literature and other ways of explaining love all relate to how relationships function.The thing I enjoy most about my work is that I’m tackling a big question – and a mystery. You’re like a detective looking for clues in journal articles, or in the arts, or daily conversations. You take all these clues and try to find an answer you can articulate that’s useful to everyday life. There’s a divide between life and academic research. My goal is to translate complex research findings into relationship advice that is valuable to people.I thrive off the challenge of bridging science and life. Everyday people have much better questions about love than scientists. I realised this when I was teaching a class on romantic relationships. Students would have these insightful questions that tapped to core of psychological processes. That’s one of things that got me into wanting to be a relationship writer. For example “how to flirt with boy”, or “how to handle a breakup” – we don’t have access to good data on how to do these things.The most challenging aspect of the work is that you have to boil down hundreds of studies into few lines. As a relationship writer, it’s complicated because you have to have self-control by not going into details people don’t care about – while trusting yourself to report accurately on huge diversity of opinion.The psychology of relationships is a crowded field. My tip for job seekers is to get really good at something that isn’t relationships. For example, a psychology student could get really good at research methods, as it distinguishes you by having something other people don’t have. Or if you wanted to go more into writing, become a good writer, and then you have an advantage over other people. I like the analogy that to be a relationship expert you have to be good at things people don’t like to do – just like with romantic relationships. Are you willing to be persistent? Disciplined? Then you’ve got what it takes.Looking for a job? Browse Guardian Jobs or sign up to Guardian Careers for the latest job vacancies and career advice
