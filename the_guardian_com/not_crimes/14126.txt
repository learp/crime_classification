8.53pm GMT20:53So that’s another Strictly year over, and I’d like to say a massive thank you to everyone who has read and shared this blog, but particularly those of you who have rocked up every week and been entirely hilarious and brilliant in the comment box. It makes this blog an absolutely joy to write, and I really can’t thank you enough. My liveblogging duties aren’t quite finished for the year – I’ll be wrapping up The Apprentice tomorrow night at 9pm, so hopefully I’ll see some of you there. If not you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, so do come and say hello. Have a wonderful Christmas and a happy 2017 – see you same time next year? Keeeeeep dancing!
