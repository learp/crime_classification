Senders of Christmas cards to Australia, New Zealand and, bizarrely, Greece, need to get them in the post by Saturday 10 December if they are to arrive by the 25th, according to Royal Mail. Tuesday 20 December is the last date for second-class UK deliveries.Those to Germany, Italy, Poland must go next Wednesday (14 Dec) while most other European countries are either next Friday or Saturday 17. If you are yet to buy your cards, we recommend a Guardian Money best-buy – the handmade cards from Sreepur in Bangladesh.The Sreepur Village project cares for up to 100 destitute women and 500 abandoned children. Started 25 years ago by former British Airways flight attendant Pat Kerr, it helps fund itself from the sale of the cards it makes.You can hand over your money safe in the knowledge that the organisation has made a real difference: in 2009 we visited the project and were so impressed that we have promoted the cards ever since. A pack of 16 costs £14.75, delivered in the UK. British Airways flies the cards to the UK for free, while volunteers collect and distribute them here. This ensures 100% of the money spent on the cards goes directly to Sreepur.It is symbolic that the village makes Christmas cards, as 25 December is when the children celebrate their collective birthday. Most do not know their true date of birth, as they were often abandoned by parents who could no longer afford to feed them.It is currently offering Guardian readers a special offer – a free extra pack of 16 cards with every order made.For more information and to buy the cards go to Sreepurcards.org. Cards are sent within 24 hours.
