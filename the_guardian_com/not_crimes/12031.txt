8.04am BST08:04Here is where things stand on Tuesday evening as floodwaters continue to threaten parts of north-west Tasmania and another body is found in NSW:Major flood warnings remain in place in parts of north-western Tasmania on Monday evening, where authorities fear the overflowing South Esk river could threaten homes and businesses in Invermay and Longford. Precautionary evacuations are underway in both areas.Police divers searching for a man who jumped from rocks and went missing from Bondi on Monday found the body of a woman in her 20s on Tuesday afternoon, about 100m out from the shore at nearby Dover Heights. It is unclear whether the woman died as a result of the inclement weather conditions and flooding that claimed three lives in NSW and the ACT on Monday.In Tasmania, Mary Kathleen Allford was found dead in her flooded Latrobe home on Tuesday. The 75-year-old was unable to reach the rescuers who plucked her husband off their roof the previous day.Two others Tasmanians are still missing in flood waters including an 81-year-old farmer from Ouse, in the central highlands, who reportedly waded into floodwaters to check his sheep and was swept away. Another man went missing at Evandale, about 20km south of Launceston, after driving into flood water. Authorities believe the South Esk river could peak on Tuesday evening or early Wednesday morning. The Insurance Council of Australia said around 14,500 claims totalling $56m had already been lodged from across the country and would take several weeks to assess.Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, and opposition leader Bill Shorten both suspended their election campaigns on Tuesday to tour flood-affected areas.The federal and state governments have announced a disaster relief package including grants to low-income households, small business loans to replenish stock and local council grants for road and bridge work.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.35am BST07:35We’re closing up our live coverage of the aftermath of days of intense storms along Australia’s east coast, the death toll from which rose as high as five today.
