The pressure of modern life can leave many day-dreaming about jacking in their nine-to-five job for a simpler existence off-grid. But who is brave enough to make the leap?Author Vanessa Runs has written about escaping the rat-race for life close-to-nature in a New Zealand camper van, with our readers debating the merits and drawbacks of this below the line. Some were in favour, with one commenter saying: “I’ve lived like this for about five months, in remote communities in the UK. My decision was based on a strong urge to leave all of my comfort zones and do something wild and unpredictable.”Others, however, were less keen: “I like living in an apartment with the temperature that suits me. I have my books and will soon have to buy another bookcase, probably from Ikea.”Have you tried living in the wild or remotely and how did it work for you? What are the drawbacks? Did you ditch your job to live abroad? Is it hard to go back to a nine-to-five afterwards? Does living close to nature improve your wellbeing? Share your stories with us.
