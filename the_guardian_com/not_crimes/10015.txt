Protesters dressed as sausages have caused a stir at the Aactas, storming the red carpet to highlight the male domination of the film and television industries.Around 15 protesters in costume burst into the annual industry awards at the Star casino in Sydney on Wednesday.Chanting “end the sausage party”, the women fell down in formation before security guards dragged them up and pushed them out.steph harmon (@stephharmon)Protesters dressed as sausages chanting to "end the sausage party" of the Aust. film industry forcefully ejected from #aactas red carpet pic.twitter.com/8aeM0p1UdVDecember 7, 2016The protest was organised by Women In Film and Television (Wift), which is in support of a quota system to increase the number of women working in film and television, and is working to a 2021 target for parity.Sophie Mathisen, Wift founder and protest organiser, told Guardian Australia the protest was a “very loud and bold statement”.“Aacta purports to be a celebration of Australia screen excellence, and at the moment it’s a celebration of a very, very narrow part of the industry.“There are a huge number of women that are working outside of the system that don’t even get a look-in.”She said only two of the 28 films preselected for AACTA awards were directed by women: “We are looking at it as the tip of the iceberg.”Geoffrey Rush calls for more women behind the camera in Australian film Deakin University academics’ analysis of data from Aacta and the Australian Film Institute showed that, of the 334 producers who worked on feature films (excluding documentaries) submitted to the awards between 2006 and 2015, a total of 126 (37%) were women.Of the 218 men, 89 did not work with a single woman as either producer, director or writer: just under 41% of all male producers, working across a 10-year period.Mathisen noted that Australian film and television was subsidised by taxpayers.“I don’t understand why there isn’t a gender equity or diversity policy in existence. There are strong statistics to prove that there is institutionalised bias in the system, and the fact that it is not addressed head-on means we are invested in the status quo.”Wift has drafted a charter for gender equity that Mathisen was hopeful Aacta would acknowledge.She said meaningful action, such as the introduction of quotas, was needed – as well as greater transparency about how nominations for Aacta awards were reached.Australian Film Television and Radio School reports show that between 1973 and 2015, just under half (48%) of all graduates in screenwriting, production and directing were women.But there was a steep drop-off when it came to representation within the industry.According to figures from Screen Australia, 30% of producers working on Australian feature films from 1970 to 2014 were women – but 21% of writers and just 16% of directors.Thirty-two per cent of producers, 23% of writers and 16% of directors currently active were women.In December last year Screen Australia announced a five-point plan for a suite of initiatives – worth $5m over three years – to address the gender imbalance in the industry.Mathisen said more action was needed to achieve faster results.Women in Australian film: 'Change is not happening quickly enough' “It’s not good enough to sit in conferences and summits any more. Long-term, significant improvement in these numbers will not happen organically. We know with any institution that it needs to be through very rigorous and active lobbying, and, realistically, legislation.”When shooting her debut feature last year, she set a quota that 50% of the crew be female. She told Channel 7’s Daily Edition on Tuesday that, from her own experience, Australia was behind the curve globally.“I think within Australia we’re still trying to feel out how we change the industry, how we invite more women in … It was very challenging, I think, for a lot of people who’d worked on sets for a number of years. They’d never really been around that many women before.”The crew on her feature, A Film Called Drama, came to be known as “sexy crew” by some actors, Mathisen said: “They’d never seen so many females in shorts lifting camera gear. They didn’t know what to do.”
