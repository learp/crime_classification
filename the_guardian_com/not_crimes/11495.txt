This book is a collection of five brilliant short stories involving the funny Miss Petitfour. Miss Petitfour has 16 cats and using her best ‘tea party tablecloth’ they swoosh across the town heading for adventures. It’s funny seeing the picture of Miss Petitfour in the sky with all her cats trailing behind.I found the stories funny and really liked all of Miss Petitfour’s friends, especially Mrs Collorwaller the bookshop owner and Pleasant Patel the baker’s daughter. The last story made me laugh lots especially when Mr Coneybeare becomes a confetti king statue.I really liked the way that the narrator talks to you in these stories, it’s unique. For example, in the middle of the first story the narrator asks ‘Do you know what a digression is?’ then takes up a paragraph explaining the answer. I thought it was a fun way to learn some new tricky words and I think it will also help me write more exciting stories myself.This is a book I would recommend to everyone because the stories were surprising and not what I was expecting.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
