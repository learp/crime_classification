All Wrapped Up is part of the Geek Girl series. I have read many of the books and I love them. I love the way that it’s laid out, with hidden facts woven throughout the story.The book follows Harriet Manners, a geeky fifteen year old, who has just had her first kiss. Then, when she is asked to go on her first date, she has no idea what to do!This book is a Christmas special and would definitely get you in the holiday spirit. It is full of funny Christmas related scientific facts. As the book is set in the winter, if you read it under a blanket with the fire on and drinking a hot chocolate, it makes it even more special. I loved the thought that everything Holly does, I could go out and do myself. The structure of the chapters made the story flow fluently and when the chapter finished, on the next page there’s a pair of geek glasses with snowflakes around them. It always got me so excited for the next chapter! I would recommend All Wrapped Up to anyone that doesn’t want a tough read. The book is easily set out with non-complicated language. It would be suitable for eleven years old and upwards as the story isn’t aimed towards younger readers.  I would rate All Wrapped Up 4/5, as I wish it could have been a little longer even though it is only a special!Overall I think the book was a great read and I would definitely read it again. You should read All Wrapped Up if you are interested in an educational but humorous relatable story.How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
