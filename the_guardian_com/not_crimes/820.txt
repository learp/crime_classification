A Girls Is A Half Formed Thing, BristolFirst seen in Dublin and then in Edinburgh last summer, Annie Ryan’s stage version of Eimear McBride’s harrowing novel will take up residence at London’s Young Vic (SE1, 17 Feb to 26 Mar) after this Bristol run. Boasting a superb performance by Aoife Duffin as the Irish girl whom we see from birth to the end of her teenage years, it’s a tender but sometimes shocking story told in a language that recalls James Joyce and Samuel Beckett but that has a distinctive twang all of its own. It’s rare for a woman’s voice to be given centre stage, particularly a young Irish woman, and this sits as happily on the stage as it did on the page; dense but never dour, delicate but never dainty.Tobacco Factory Theatres: Factory Theatre, Tue to 30 JanLGWit, ManchesterIt turns out that even an encyclopedic knowledge of the sonnets of John Donne is no defence against the ravaging effects of ovarian cancer. That’s the discovery of English professor Vivian Bearing, a woman who has always been demanding of both herself and her students but unexpectedly finds herself at a loss in the face of death. Margaret Edson’s play won the Pulitzer prize in 1999, (although that’s not always a guarantee of real quality). Here, it’s directed by Raz Shaw, and the presence of the more than capable Julie Hesmondhalgh as the woman caught between the metaphysical and the medical should ensure that this is goes far beyond sentimental drama.Royal Exchange Theatre, to 13 FebLGJeepers Creepers, London      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   David Boyle as Marty Feldman in Jeepers Creepers. Photograph: Steve UllathorneMarty Feldman was the pop-eyed comedian who wrote for such classic radio comedies as Round The Horne, had sketch shows on TV, and finally found fame in America as Igor in Mel Brooks’s Young Frankenstein. A new two-hander, Jeepers Creepers, written by Feldman’s biographer Robert Ross, reveals the actor’s struggles with the pressures of fame, the excesses of Hollywood and his depression, and also his complex relationship with ambitious wife Lauretta. It’s directed by Terry Jones, who wrote for and appeared in Feldman’s TV show Marty in the 60s, and credits Feldman with helping the Pythons to success.Leicester Square Theatre, WC2, to 20 FebMCRabbit Hole, LondonAfter his play Good People supplied an exhaustingly barnstorming role for Imelda Staunton two years ago – likely providing a good warmup for her award-winning performance in Gypsy last year – the work of US playwright David Lindsay-Abaire makes its way back to the capital. Rabbit Hole was made into a 2010 film starring Aaron Eckhart and Nicole Kidman – who received an Oscar nomination for her performance – and this Hampstead Theatre production (the same theatre where Good People started its London run), is directed by Edward Hall, and has some equally impressive actors in Claire Skinner and Tom Goodman-Hill. They play a couple who have to deal with the accidental killing of their four-year-old child. It’s a gut-wrenching anatomy of grief manifested with great grace and wit.Hampstead Theatre, NW3, Fri to 5 MarMCThe Master Builder, London      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Ralph Fiennes in The Master BuilderWhile Ralph Fiennes has revealed some unexpected comedy chops in the past – on stage with God Of Carnage, and on screen in The Grand Budapest Hotel, as well as playing Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter films – it is for serious classical work that he is best known. He has tackled mighty roles in Shaw, Chekhov, Sophocles and Shakespeare (playing Coriolanus and directing a film version). He also has a bit of previous with Ibsen – a West End production of Brand in 2003 – and here tackles what many consider the Norwegian playwright’s finest work, The Master Builder, as Solness, the respected architect who builds high but is brought low by past indiscretions. Directed by Matthew Warchus, this is a new adaptation by David Hare.Old Vic, SE1, Sat to 19 MarMCA Raisin In The Sun, SheffieldSetting out on a tour that begins in Sheffield and will take in Ipswich, Southampton, Liverpool and Coventry, among other cities, the Eclipse Theatre company is reviving a play that deserves to be seen very widely indeed. Written by Lorraine Hansberry, the inspiration for Nina Simone’s song To Be Young, Gifted And Black, the play tells the story of the Youngers, a black American family who are awaiting the arrival of a much-needed cheque. The play was a hit on Broadway in 1959 when Hansberry was just 29 years old, though her extraordinary promise was not to be fulfilled: she died of cancer aged just 34. But this play is testament to Hansberry’s talent: it’s a big, passionate and no-holds-barred account of what it was like to live in the US before the flowering of the civil rights movement.
