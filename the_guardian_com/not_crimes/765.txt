1 When Marnie Was There (U) (Hiromasa Yonebayashi, 2014, Jap) 103 mins.Can this really be Studio Ghibli’s last film? If so, it at least displays all their cherished hallmarks: clean, vibrant line animation and a sincere, emotional story centred on a young girl. Anna is a lonely tomboy, exiled to the countryside, where she’s drawn to a mysterious child in an island mansion. Fascination and infatuation lead to some harsh life lessons.2 Embrace Of The Serpent (12A) (Ciro Guerra, 2015, Col/Ven/Arg) 122 mins.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This unique film takes a trip up the Amazon with two white explorers, their journeys separated by 30 years, both of whom lose bearings and certainties in their quest for a fabled plant. Their guide is an indigenous shaman, whose point of view makes this a sort of reverse Heart Of Darkness and, combined with the mystical tone and monochrome visuals, gives it an unforgettable impact.3 The Nice Guys (15) (Shane Black, 2016, US) 116 mins.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe make a fine double act in this madcap mystery thriller, whose plot snakes through the worst of 1970s America – porn, corporate greed, political corruption, terrible leatherwear – but leavens the sleaze with some irresistibly silly comedy.4 Where To Invade Next (15) (Michael Moore, 2015, US) 120 mins.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Less provocative than you’d expect from both the title and the film-maker, Michael Moore’s latest is more of a jovial research trip, seeing what other countries get right that the US gets so badly wrong – like education, equality, food and prison. It’s the documentarian at his jolliest, but his target, as always, is the American Dream.5 Fire At Sea (12A) (Gianfranco Rosi, 2016, Ita/Fra) 114 mins.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest A report from Europe’s migration crisis that’s commendably calm and even-handed. Set on the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa, it’s an observant study of contrasts: between the islanders’ proud, traditional way of life and the harrowing plight of their new arrivals from Africa.
