One of the best new shows on US TV this autumn is Pamela Adlon’s Better Things, a comedy drama co-written and produced with her long-time collaborator Louis CK, and closely based on Adlon’s life as a jobbing actor and single mother of three girls in LA.It has, on the basis of the first few episodes, been universally praised for its honesty about single parenting, primarily the mess, chaos and public meltdowns, all of which feels refreshingly true and a long way from slicker juggernauts such as Modern Family. There is, however, one interesting omission, and that is the depiction of a nanny.Adlon’s fictional family isn’t rich, but it is affluent in a way that makes it impossible to believe that, with three kids and a working mother, her character doesn’t have daily babysitting help. A million miles away on E!, meanwhile, Keeping Up with the Kardashians rumbles into what feels like its 90th year (but is only its ninth), still peddling the notion of no-intimacy-too-great-to-put-on-TV, with the exception of, as someone pointed out in New York magazine – you guessed it – acknowledging the presence of the family nannies.That these two shows are at polar opposites of the social and celebrity scale indicates how widespread and enduring the taboo around admitting to certain – or any – kinds of childcare still is. Part of the problem, I suspect, is the word “nanny”, with its lingering Edwardian overtones and image of women in silk dressing gowns addressing their children once a day when they’re brought down from the nursery. In 2016, when most households can’t exist on a single income and when in cities like London and New York daycare for two kids is more expensive than a nanny, this is clearly ludicrous.But it is also a prejudice rooted in undying assumptions about what women should be doing with their time, which is watching the children. It seems likely that both Adlon and the Kardashians, dissimilar as they are, paint childcare out of the picture because it is considered unseemly but, even if they have other reasons, it’s surely not because it’s too small an issue to merit notice.For huge numbers of parents, single or otherwise, a large part of one’s daily drama is finding, keeping, freaking out at the cost of and then weeping with gratitude over the people who look after your kids while you work. You can’t tell a modern story of parenting without them.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Ann Coulter on the Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe. Photograph: Latour/Variety/REX/ShutterstockIt’s a dog-eat-dog worldThe surprising thing about Ann Coulter’s much-discussed appearance on Comedy Central’s “roast” of Rob Lowe was not how vicious it was, but how, with the right treatment, even the most unsympathetic character can inspire pity. If the jokes had been funny, or clever, or remotely well told, it might have been satisfying to see Coulter destroyed. Instead, there was Jimmy Carr calling her “one of the most repugnant, hateful, hatchet-faced bitches alive”, and “a truckstop transvestite whore”. Apparently, the way to nail a rightwing commentator with abhorrent views is to attack her from further on the right.

Photograph: Andrew Kelly/REUTERSAnd talking of edible dogs …You get your kicks where you can in a city as expensive as New York and at the moment the cheapest thrill in town is the hot dog. For years, the city’s most basic culinary unit was relegated to the botulism-ridden carts from which only tourists ate. Now Nathan’s, the famous hot dog franchise with its home in Coney Island, has rolled out food carts in the city and Burger King has put hot dogs on its menu.You don’t even have to eat one; there is some small drop of joy to be had just from saying the words “Whopper Dog” and considering the hours of corporate debate that went into coming up with the name.
