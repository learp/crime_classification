The director of the forthcoming Fifty Shades movie has said that scenes were duplicate shot using virtual reality technology for marketing purposes. Speaking at a VR conference at Paramount, reported by Deadline, James Foley said he felt the use of the tech provides a liberation for both actors and directors by using a 360-degree space. Fifty Shades Darker – the first trailer deconstructed “Yeah, there’s marketing materials for behind-the-scenes [of Fifty Shades Darker],” he said “After we finished shooting for the day, the actors would stay over and VR people would re-create a facsimile of the scene.“My personal instinct is that cinema is going to move to VR because it’s an extension of the visual language. For myself, watching the material they generated expanded my brain.”However, Foley said that VR would not be included in the regular cinema versions of either Fifty Shades Darker or Fifty Shades Freed, which were shot back-to-back and are scheduled for release in February 2017 and 2018.“This all needs to be reinvented,” said Foley, adding that such change is rapid: “The train is leaving the station, I think, and travelling really fast.”Foley was brought on board to replace Sam Taylor-Johnson, who directed the first film. Fifty Shades of Grey was released in early 2015 and took $571m worldwide.
