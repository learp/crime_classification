Orange is the New Black’s Yael Stone and Game of Thrones’ Noah Taylor will return to Australia to star in an upcoming SBS crime drama, Deep Water, which will air in 2016.Set in contemporary Bondi, Deep Water is inspired by the unsolved gay-hate crime epidemic that swept through Sydney in the 80s and 90s. Stone and Taylor play detectives who are assigned a brutal murder case and find links to decades’ worth of unreported criminal activity. They are joined in the cast by Dan Spielman, Danielle Cormack, William McInnes, Craig McLachlan, Simon Burke, Jeremy Lindsay Taylor and Renee Lim.Directed by Shawn Seet, written by Kris Wyld and Kym Goldsworthy, and with SBS’s Sue Masters as executive producer, the four-hour, four-part thriller comes from Blackfella Films, the production company behind Redfern Now and First Contact. In what is being pegged as “SBS’s first cross-genre, cross-platform event”, the miniseries will be accompanied by a feature documentary and a web series.“I am utterly thrilled to be working on Deep Water,” said Stone, who called it an “incredible blessing”. Stone plays Lorna Morello in Netflix’s hit series, but is currently in Sydney starring alongside her husband Spielman in Belvoir St Theatre’s production of The Blind Giant is Dancing. “Blackfella Films and SBS have a script of unusual, epic scope with Deep Water and I can’t wait to start work,” Stone said.Yael Stone (@YaelStone)Thrilled to announce this incredible new project Deepwater.
