I always get asked how to cook tender octopus. The important thing is always to buy good-quality octopus and then cook it properly. I do have a secret, though, and that is to freeze the octopus for a minimum of two days before cooking. This breaks down the fibres and makes it much more delicate.(Serves 6–8)1 carrot, peeled and roughly chopped1 onion, roughly chopped1 celery stalk, chopped1 bay leaf8 black peppercorns400g (14 oz) large fresh octopus tentacles, cleaned (ask a fishmonger to do this for you, if need be)1 aubergine, cut into pieces1 red pepper, deseeded and cut into pieces1 green pepper, deseeded and cut into pieces75–100ml (2–3 fl oz) olive oil plus extra to drizzleSea salt and freshly ground black pepperLarge handful of parsleyBring a pan of water to the boil with the carrot, onion, celery, bay leaf and peppercorns. Plunge the octopus tentacles into the water and simmer for 50–60 minutes. Drain and slice on the diagonal into pieces 1 cm thick. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 190°C (375°F/Gas 5). Put the aubergine and peppers in a roasting tin and drizzle with plenty of oil. Season and roast for 30–40 minutes, until really tender.Blanch the parsley in boiling water for 30 seconds, then plunge into a bowl of iced water. Whizz in a processor with the olive oil until you have a lovely green oil. Push through a fine sieve into a bowl. Season and set aside.Toss the octopus in a little oil. Heat a heavy-based pan or chargrill pan over a high heat and, when really hot, sear the octopus for 2 to 3 minutes, turning once.Serve the octopus with the roasted vegetables and a good drizzle of the parsley oil.Basque: Spanish Recipes from San Sebastián and beyond by José Pizarro (Hardie Grant, £25.00).
