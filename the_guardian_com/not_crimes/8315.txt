I have never been shy of a challenge. I practise as a priest, but in my spare time I have climbed Mount Everest, sailed around the world and trekked to the North Pole.I first knew I wanted to fly around the world in a hot-air balloon in the early 90s, when the race between Bertrand Piccard, Richard Branson and Steve Fossett began. Finally, in 2002, Steve Fossett managed to fly solo after six attempts. I wanted to be the first to do it on the first attempt.For the last two years I trained extensively, spending 150 hours in balloons. This summer, aged 64, I was in Northam, Western Australia, waiting for a weather window. I chose to fly east: across Australia, over the Pacific, South America, the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.With my ground team, I spent 24 hours preparing the balloon, fuel and capsule. It took us 10 hours to spread it out across the airfield, connect all the parts and fill it with 10,000 cubic metres of helium.Thousands of people had gathered to witness the launch on 12 July and, at 7.33am, I took off. It was perfectly executed, with a smooth and steady ascent. I was wildly excited but had some doubts – I was venturing into the unknown. I couldn’t guarantee I’d see my friends and family again.My living area inside the gondola was a capsule, a carbon fibre box 2m x 1.8m. It was designed to float if I landed in water, but having sailed around the world four times I knew I wouldn’t be able to survive the harshness of the Southern Ocean in it. I didn’t stop watching the weather, communicating with my land team and changing altitude to optimise the speed and direction. As I passed New Zealand and entered the space above the Pacific, I felt an incredible sense of relief, because there is less air traffic over the sea.Above 5,000 metres you need an oxygen mask to survive. On my fifth day, I was flying over the Pacific at 8,500 metres when I noticed the safety valve on my oxygen cylinder was faulty and I was losing oxygen. It was terrifying. I managed to save myself from suffocating by climbing on to the roof of the gondola and adjusting the pressure in the cylinder to stop the oxygen escaping.I was on standby 24 hours a day, freezing cold, sleep deprived and lonely, but I never questioned why I was doing this. It is such a unique experience to see our beautiful planet from the gondola: it gave me a sense of how small it is. Being on constant watch eliminated the sense of time. It was an 11-day state of wakefulness, with half-hour naps here and there. Even when sleeping, part of my brain was still listening and sensing the situation. I had to constantly stay alert to control the flight, altitude, my oxygen flow, and to look out for cumulonimbus clouds, because they are a sign of atmospheric instability. I had to hold a spoon between two fingers to keep myself awake: if I dozed off, it would fall and clang against the floor, waking me up.Experience: I was bitten by a rabid bat Temperatures reached -50C. Over the Atlantic, the gondola was covered in a thin layer of frost. Flying at 9,000m at 200km an hour, I climbed out to chip the ice off the burners for an hour until they restarted.Nine days in, I was caught in a thunderstorm over the Indian Ocean for three hours. To avoid the lightning, I had to fly at 10,500m, a very dangerous height. I thought I was going to die. It was both physically and emotionally draining. Luckily, I managed to spot a narrow gap between the belt of huge clouds and find a calmer course.Seeing the coast of Australia again on my 11th day was a huge relief. I knew my journey was nearly over. It was to be a new world record. I could see my team celebrating below as I flew over. After a bumpy landing, my hatch was opened and I saw the faces of my friends and family. It hit me when I was finally able to stand on the ground and hug my sons Oscar and Nikolay. Flying for 11 days solo, thousands of metres above the ground, and then all of a sudden seeing familiar faces was a relief beyond words. This challenge really pushed me to my limits, but it hasn’t put me off. Next year, I want to fly 15 miles into the stratosphere, breaking the record for the highest ever hot-air balloon flight.• As told to Jack Dutton.Do you have an experience to share?
