South of Agadir, where the Atlantic coast turns wild, buffeted by the sea, is Monique Henon’s tranquil hideaway. Built on a fertile plain three kilometres from the sea, on the edge of the Souss-Massa national park, it was designed by Henon herself, a former fashion designer, in the style of local houses: a basic whitewashed cube on two levels, with sheltered terraces and central courtyard.

The white double front doors have panels inset, painted black, and walls in the hallway and bathrooms are tiled to shoulder height with striking geometric black and white tiles.

Henon found the large aluminium platters in Marrakech (trymoroccanbazaar.com for similar).
