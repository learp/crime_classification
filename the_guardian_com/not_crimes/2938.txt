Piñata was a word I never encountered before reading Nick Hopkins’ article (Why this quest for truth must go on, 15 October). But a fragile box that blindfolded children attempt to break with sticks to access the goodies inside is a perfect metaphor for our politicians – and their treatment of the NHS, the police, education and the powerless.Keith HarrisWantage, Oxfordshire • The notion that alcohol is fattening is raised in your pages (Report, 17 October). By what metabolic pathway is this achieved in the body? The only organisms I know that utilise alcohol are certain bacteria that downgrade it further to vinegar – acetic acid.

It is interesting, then, that women working on the Asda shop floor, where they are likely to encounter customers and require such skills, are being paid less than men well away from the public eye in warehouses (Report, 15 October).
