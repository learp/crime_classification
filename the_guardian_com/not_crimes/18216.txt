That BBC1 has decided to remake Evelyn Waugh’s 1928 masterpiece Decline and Fall as Friday night television is both good and bad news for viewers. The satirical novel of innocence crucified and risen is brilliantly witty. But we live increasingly in a world of social conflict that is ripe for dramatisation, yet often evades characterisation on screen. Instead we escape into a past or a fantasy imagined far in the future or just far away. We settle down to either Call the Midwife or Game of Thrones. It’s either Love & Friendship or Ghost in the Shell. What these allow is to moralise from today’s vantage point. Yet the art of yesteryear struggled with big questions: how unfair convention was; how to resolve the tension between what one was socially obliged to do and what one wanted to do. When reincarnated, the answers always seem to be what would occur in the present.With social media, the catastrophic London smog would no doubt instantly precipitate a crisis. In 1952 it did not, whatever The Crown portrayed. Similarly, science fiction is created with today in mind: Westworld’s android hookers are male titillation. Modern-day dramas – like Line of Duty – too often rely on a criminal underworld. Yet the current age poses challenges and struggles – used in Fishtank’s bitter coming of age and the podcast “faction” of S-town. The dramatic elements are here today for touching and complex art. They should be used.This article was amended on 31 March 2017. An earlier version said that Channel 4 was remaking Decline and Fall.
