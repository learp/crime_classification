A hunt to find the top 50 people, projects and organisations offering innovative ways to tackle social challenges is launched today by the Observer and Nesta, the charity that supports innovation for the public good in the UK.Britain's 50 New Radicals (BNR) was launched in 2012, with the final 50 selected from more than 200 entrants from a wide range of sectors including health, the environment, technology and community action by judges including Martha Lane Fox, the coalition's digital tsar, and campaigning green journalist Lucy Siegle.Geoff Mulgan, chief executive of Nesta, said: "In 2012, we were bowled over by the response to Britain's New Radicals. The many hundreds of nominations came from every part of the country, the great majority of them impressive and intriguing combinations of big vision and practicality. This year we have new categories and an incredible panel of judges reaching across arts, industry and the third sector. We want to put a spotlight on the many people doing radically exciting and important work in every part of Britain."Among the 2012 winners continuing to flourish were Mbnk, teaching young people how to manage their finances; Uprising, described as "a finishing school for the working class", which identifies and trains potential future community leaders and activists; and Space Makers Agency, revitalising moribund areas such as the now flourishing Brixton Village in south London.Among the judges are John Mulholland, editor of the Observer; Geoff Mulgan, chief executive of Nesta; award-winning novelist Kamila Shamsie; Morna Simpson, founder of Girl Geek Scotland Radio 1's Gemma Cairney; food writer Jay Rayner; Steve Hawkins of Local Solutions, a large and highly successful social enterprise in Liverpool; and geneticist Nazneen Rahman.The 2014 categories include employment, media, architecture and the arts, health and education. The final 50 will be celebrated at a reception in London. They will become part of the BNR network, supported by Nesta. The closing date for this year's entrants is 16 June.
