The BBC has confirmed it will not be bringing back its much-derided highlights show Wimbledon 2day, instead reverting to its traditional Today at Wimbledon format.Last year, the corporation shook up its TV highlights coverage, dropping John Inverdale and introducing Clare Balding, who took over his Radio 5 Live Wimbledon presenting duties in 2014. Balding fronted Wimbledon 2day from a studio in the Gatsby Club, a private members’ club close to the All England Club, rather than from studio facilities inside the Wimbledon grounds.The presenter and her guests sat at wine bar-style tables, offering lighthearted chatshow-style items such as viewers’ clips of babies playing tennis alongside highlights from the tournament.But viewers mocked the show for its awkward informal style and demanded that it show more tennis, while the Radio Times TV critic, Alison Graham, called it a “mess” and “a dreadful mistake” with “a terrible, terrible title”.As criticism mounted over the first week of the tournament, the BBC tweaked the format, moving Balding and guests to seated positions, keeping the audience increasingly off camera and increasing the amount of tennis highlights.At the start of the second week, it moved the show back to the traditional glass studio above Centre Court, removing the audience altogether. This year will see the return of Today at Wimbledon, with Balding and two experts analysing play each day.Today at Wimbledon, which airs at 8.30pm in week one and 8pm from 5 July, will be shot live from a new studio next to Henman Hill in the All England Club.This year’s pundits include former grand slam winners Lleyton Hewitt and Jim Courier.A BBC spokesperson said: “There has always been a daily highlights programme for Wimbledon. Last year we made some format changes to the programme which evolved throughout the championships based on feedback from our audience. “This year’s programme will have a traditional look and feel. As ever, the focus of the show will be to bring highlights of the day’s action and insight from our expert pundits.”
