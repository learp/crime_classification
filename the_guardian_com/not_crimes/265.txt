A year after the worst hajj disaster in a generation, Saudi Arabia is issuing pilgrims with electronic bracelets and using more surveillance cameras to avoid a repeat of the crush that killed hundreds of people and damaged already strained ties with Iran. The Muslim pilgrimage, which starts on Friday and will bring 2 million people to Islam’s most sacred sites in Mecca, will also be a focus of concerns about militant violence after a suicide bomber killed four soldiers in early July in the nearby city of Medina, Islam’s second holiest.Iranian pilgrims won't attend hajj amid row with Saudi Arabia Custodian of Islam’s most revered places, Saudi Arabia stakes its reputation on organising hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam, which every able-bodied Muslim who can afford to is obliged to undertake at least once in their lifetime. Its prestige was damaged by the 2015 disaster, in which Riyadh said 769 pilgrims were killed, the highest hajj death toll since a crush in 1990. Counts of fatalities by countries who repatriated bodies showed that more than 2,000 people may have died in the crush, more than 400 of them Iranians. Iran, Saudi Arabia’s regional rival, blamed the disaster on organisers’ incompetence. An official Saudi inquiry has yet to be published, but authorities suggested at the time that some pilgrims ignored crowd-control rules.This year, efforts are being made to strengthen crowd management. Thousands of civil servants, security personnel and medics have been conducting drills in preparation for the pilgrimage. The kingdom says it is deploying extra staff and increasing coordination with hajj missions from pilgrims’ home countries to ensure worshippers comply with agreed schedules for performing various rituals. Hundreds of new surveillance cameras had been installed at the Grand Mosque.Saudi Arabia under pressure to improve safety at Mecca after fatal hajj crush  “The scheduling programme is the most important part of the operational programme,” an interior ministry spokesman, Major General Mansour al-Turki, said. “This is the area we have to concentrate on, to make sure pilgrims ... comply with it once they get there.”The Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat said last month the Mecca Development Authority had set up electronic paths and gates to manage crowds heading to Jamarat, the symbolic stoning of the devil, during which many previous disasters have occurred. The kingdom is also kitting out pilgrims with electronic wristbands to enable authorities to track the flow of people and get early warnings of crowd buildups.Relations between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia, which back opposing sides in Syria and other conflicts, plummeted after the 2015 crush. Riyadh broke diplomatic ties when its Tehran embassy was stormed in January over the Saudi execution of a Shia cleric. Saudi Arabia said it would not tolerate any attempt on the part of pilgrims to politicise hajj: remarks widely seen as referring to Iran. It is worried that pro-Iranian pilgrims could still exploit the gathering to spread anti-Saudi messages. Iran said in May its pilgrims would not attend, blaming Riyadh for “sabotage” and failing to guarantee their safety. Saudi Arabia blamed Iran, saying the Shia country had demanded the right to hold demonstrations that would have created chaos.
