My kitchen is … a corner of our living room. My wife and I live in a converted Victorian school, so we’ve lovely high ceilings and big windows, but a fairly small, basic, identikit kitchen – if it wasn’t open plan, it’d be a cubby hole. The extractor doesn’t work, so I get a stern look when things smell of pork, and if I don’t keep it tidy the whole flat feels messy. Things like food processors and boxes (and boxes) of spices and exotic goods are hidden in cupboards. But we store multiple jars of dried goods and ferments on top of the kitchen units to make use of that height.My favourite kitchen tool is … a 15cm Misono UX10 knife, which is a light, elegant, easily sharpened, Japanese-made, Swedish-steeled beauty. I’m saving to replace my larger chef’s knife with the equivalent model. I’m also lost without a mandolin and one particular silicone spatula (no reason, just habit).My storecupboard staple is … anchovies, and good parmesan.When I’m starving I … boil some pasta and use up whatever vegetables (usually courgettes, brassicas, or bitter leaves, often chicory) I have in the fridge. Sometimes, it’ll be powered by the aforementioned anchovies, plus garlic, good olive oil and some toasted panko breadcrumbs; otherwise, if I’ve an egg to hand, it’ll be a pseudo carbonara.My culinary inspiration is … no one single thing. My mum’s a great entertainer and willing to try new things, which I think helped me become interested in cooking. Otherwise, I’m constantly learning from the restaurants I eat in, the ingredients I stumble across and the words I read. I’m a voracious collector of cookbooks and consume all the recipes in the weekend supplements (and digest them on my blog each Monday). Simon Hopkinson’s Week in, Week Out and Nigel Slater’s Kitchen Diaries and Tender are perhaps my most dog-eared tomes; also more recent titles from abroad like Danny Bowien’s Mission Chinese Food and Bar Tartine stand out because they open the door to modern professional kitchens and global cooking better than any recent British books I can think of.Diana Henry’s kitchen: ‘If something's missing, the answer is lemon’ | Kitchen encounters My best-kept kitchen secret is … to just give everything a go and not worry about messing up. Cooking is not rocket science; you’re just making dinner. The worst thing you can do is be afraid or refuse to experiment.When I’m invited to dinner I … always take wine. While it would be a lie to say I also always take another gift, if I’ve got a large batch of ferments I might decant some of those. Or if I anticipate a heavy night, I’ll sometimes take the hosts some good sourdough, eggs and bacon for their breakfast.Everything tastes better with … care. You can tell when a cook is bothered (or not).When I go shopping I … usually have a list, because I’m often recipe testing or gathering goods for a photo shoot. But I’ll impulse-buy things that look good too. My local greengrocer in Newington Green is remarkable, and takes much of my income; I’m pretty frugal in life, but that function seems to switch off when I’m in any vaguely food-related shop, or at a restaurant.Ed Smith is a cook, food writer and author of the blog rocketandsquash.
