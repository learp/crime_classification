But will his pranks be just as strange and unruly as we remember?Available from MondayBBC3Being Black, Going CrazyThis short but affecting doc sees Radar Radio presenter Keith Dube – who has himself experienced depression – investigate why black Britons are a staggering 17 times more likely to be diagnosed with serious mental health problems than their white counterparts.
