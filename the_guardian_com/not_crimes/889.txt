The long-rumoured biopic of the late Ol’ Dirty Bastard might actually get made, according to a report in Rolling Stone. His Wu-Tang Clan colleague RZA told the magazine there were “a few wheels in motion” on the project.RZA highlighted work done by Rayshawn, his and ODB’s cousin. “Him and ODB’s wife have been talking and he has a pretty interesting script,” RZA said. “I just saw a 12-minute teaser that he shot about a year ago and it felt pretty fucking cool. I watched it and was like, ‘Wow, you may have something here.’ He has the best thing that I’ve seen so far.”Wu-Tang Clan sell copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin for 'millions' RZA said Rayshawn had asked him to direct the movie, but he was unsure. Although he said he was the man who knew ODB best – “From the age of six, me and [ODB] used to push shopping carts around grocery stores and try to get nickels. There are very few people who know the real him as much as me” – RZA said he “wouldn’t mind doing it and he wouldn’t mind not doing it”.He added that movies about hip-hop were likely to be more attractive to the big studios following the success of the NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton. “I’m glad that a movie like that breaks out and does such numbers that it’s almost undeniable. It showed that with the proper team and marketing, many of us out here who grew up on this music would love to see the inside makings of those stories.
