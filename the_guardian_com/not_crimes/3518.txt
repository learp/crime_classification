If peak collaboration were to happen, this is surely the moment. No complaints from us, though – this Supreme x Aquascutum collection is one of the nicest of the season – and we didn’t see it coming. It works because Aquascutum’s Club Check is one of fashion’s most low-key, most flattering and most elevated, bridging the line between heritage and modern. The Supreme writing on the back, slightly raised and barely discernible, is the classy cherry on the cake – and this club jacket might just be the glaze on the cherry on the cake. It’s also made from gabardine so it’s showerproof. Showerproof! There’s literally nothing wrong with it, except the price. Well, you can’t have everything.
