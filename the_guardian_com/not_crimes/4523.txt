The first book that Ali Berg and Michelle Kalus deliberately left behind on a train was the historical love story The Bronze Horseman by Paullina Simons.“This is Ali and my all-time favourite book,” says Kalus. The pair credit The Bronze Horseman for turning them into “totally obsessed bookworms”. They left a secondhand copy on the train in the hope that someone else would pick it up, read it and be likewise transformed.Missy Higgins: how an obsession with apocalyptic climate fiction changed my life Thus began Books on the Rail, a Melbourne-based organisation that populates public transport with free books for anyone to pick up and read – a guerrilla library on the move.Books on the Rail is modelled on the UK project Books on the Underground; Ali met its founder, Hollie Fraser, while working at advertising agency in London last year. She recognised it as “a very Melbourne idea” so approached her longtime friend Kalus, who ran a bookish Instagram blog, to help make it happen at home.Books on the Underground recently made headlines when Harry Potter star Emma Watson tweeted pictures of herself dropping off copies of Maya Angelou’s memoir Mom & Me & Mom on the New York subway.

Initially conducted entirely under their own steam, with books and stickers paid for out of their own pockets, Berg and Kalus were inundated with feedback from members of the public who loved the idea and wanted to get involved. The project is now supported by an army of “book ninjas” who buy stickers off the Books on the Rail website, stick them on the cover of their own books, and stealthily leave them on empty seats in train carriages. As a consequence, Books on the Rail has gone Australia-wide.  The week I run out of data I discover this on my way to work. That's the week sorted 👍@booksontherail #booksontherailA photo posted by Scott Dell (@scottkdell) on Nov 24, 2016 at 1:58pm PSTPublishers are on board too, with companies such as Penguin, Pan Macmillan and Allen & Unwin regularly sending the duo boxes of books to distribute.Last Saturday, Books on the Rail held its first book club – in a train carriage, naturally. The book club, which met on the Frankston line, grew out of the organisation’s books subscriptions program – a “blind date with a book” – which they began as a response to reader feedback.

Photograph: John Berg“A lot of people, when we first launched Books on the Rail, said that they loved finding different genres of books on the train that they wouldn’t usually read but then loved,” Berg says. “So we decided to bring that into a subscription.”Book clubs rebooted: Emma Watson, Florence Welch and the best new online reading groups The project is still mostly a labour of love for the literary pair but they are brainstorming ways to make it self-sufficient.“It’s a concept that really resonates with the public,” Kalus says. “We want so much for it to become sustainable so that we can keep growing it, we can keep getting more books out onto the trains.”
