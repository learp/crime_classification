The broadcasting regulator has launched an investigation into a Derren Brown programme that featured the illusionist putting a plastic bag over his head and suffocating himself as part of a trick.Ofcom will look into whether the programme is in breach of the broadcasting code because it aired before the 9pm watershed, when children could have been watching.The show, called Something Wicked this Way Comes, featured Brown restricting his breathing through self-asphyxiation, walking barefoot over broken glass and saying the word “fuck” several times.Ofcom has received five complaints about the programme, which aired on UKTV’s Watch channel on 6 December.“Ofcom is investigating whether this programme, which included very offensive language and material that could be dangerous if emulated by children, was appropriately scheduled before the watershed,” said a spokesman for Ofcom.
