The South Australian towns of Virginia and Port Wakefield have been threatened with flooding after the Gawler and Wakefield rivers burst their banks.Floodwaters could breach a rail line and flood Virginia on the northern outskirts of Adelaide, authorities warned on Saturday night.The State Emergency Service issued an emergency warning to residents at 6.30pm, telling them to enact their flood plans. A flood levee protecting the small town failed earlier on Saturday when the Gawler river broke its banks.“Floodwater is flowing along the eastern side of the railway line and there is a risk the water will breach the railway line and flood the Virginia township,” an SES spokeswoman said.SA SES (@SA_SES)The #Gawler River has broken its banks at #Virginia Enact your flood plan now.

The town’s 500 residents have been told to enact their emergency flood plans as floodwaters continue to rise.In Western Australia, more than 9000 properties were without power on Saturday night as wild weather continued to lash the state. Some 24,000 customers lost power on Saturday after a front started to move across WA overnight.A severe weather warning remains in place for the Great Southern, southwest of a line from Albany to Ravensthorpe to Israelite Bay, including Esperance and surrounding areas.In South Australia, the warning for Port Wakefield was downgraded late on Saturday as floodwaters stabilised, but residents were warned a small increase in water levels was expected during the night.Road closures and diversions remained in place.Tom Angley (@TomAngley9)Wakefield River has broken its banks on Balaklava Rd.

Around 100 members of the ADF are helping with the ongoing sandbagging efforts.State premier Jay Weatherilll said about 20 structures around the town of Balaclava had been affected, but authorities were not sure if they were houses. Homes had been flooded at Old Noarlunga as well.“It’s hard for us to get into these communities at the moment and we are still getting patchy information,” Weatherill said, also thanking emergency services workers who were set to be relieved by interstate colleagues over the coming days.South Australia blackout: entire state left without power after storms “Extraordinary effort ... the care, the professionalism, the capability and the energy they have shown has been nothing short of extraordinary,” he said on Saturday.SES chief officer Chris Beattie told Sky News on Saturday afternoon that there was a “high level of operational tempo” around the Gawler and Wakefield rivers, with the Wakefield in particular continuing to rise and Port Wakefield remaining cut off.“But we have crew on the ground working closely with the community to ensure people are as prepared as they can be,” he said, adding that he was confident sandbagging would protect the town.Beattie said emergency services had to pull 12 cars out of floodwaters in the past 24 hours.“It’s incredibly frustrating for emergency service workers when people continue to put themselves and their passengers at risk by driving into flooded culverts or roadways,” he said. Adelaide suburbs affected by flooding on Saturday include Hillier, Angle Vale, Penfield Gardens, Two Wells, Lewiston, Virginia, Port Gawler and Buckland Park.The Gawler river peaked at 10pm on Friday night but the historic town was spared major damage. Australian defence force personnel joined emergency services in sandbagging properties and shoring up flood defences.They’re now focusing their efforts on protecting properties at Virginia.“It’s a very low-lying floodplain and there is a significant amount of water coming down the Gawler River and so there is every likelihood that there will be properties inundated,” Beattie told the ABC earlier on Saturday.Gawler river map“If you live or work in these areas, put your Emergency Flood Plan into action,” the South Australia SES said. “Prepare your family and home for flooding in your area. Move items of value to a safe place. If your plan is to leave, if you require time to leave or if you are not prepared, you should consider leaving now. “It is very important that residents of these areas remain vigilant for flooding. You are urged to closely monitor local conditions and listen to ABC radio for updates.”The SES said residents who had not prepared for flooding should leave if it was safe to do so.Traffic was diverted around Port Wakefield and between Virginia and Two Wells.The SES also reminded residents not to walk, ride or drive through floodwater, or allow children to play in or near floodwater.They admonished media who ignored the warning.SA SES (@SA_SES)DO NOT DRIVE IN FLOODWATER !!! https://t.co/UgS2ID3y4yOctober 1, 2016
