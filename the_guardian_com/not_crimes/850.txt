Square, the payments company founded by Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, is entering the UK market offering merchants next-day settlement and slashed prices compared to rivals.The company is taking on current market leader, Stockholm-headquartered iZettle. Both companies seek to provide a better service to small businesses than legacy card payment firms such as WorldPay and Barclaycard, whose bulky terminals and complex fee structures can lead to merchants choosing to only take cash payments.Square’s service uses mobile card readers that connect to a smartphone or tablet to enable independent traders to accept forms of payment apart from cash, including contactless, mobile and card payments.Dorsey says Square’s plan is not to spark a price war with the competition but instead to is focus its pitch on the millions of small businesses that don’t take card payments for reasons of complexity, cost, or time.Business owners will be able to buy a Square reader for £39, and will pay a flat transaction fee of 1.75% for in-person payments – figures that compare favourably with iZettle’s £29 reader and 2.75% fee, though iZettle reduces the fee as the business’s volume rises. Square also promises to deposit earnings in businesses’ bank accounts the following morning, something it hopes will appeal to smaller firms that lack the liquidity to wait months to receive their revenue.For customers, the battle could filter through to lower prices in stores. But at the very least, it is likely to result in significantly more small businesses taking card payments: Square has been beta testing in the UK with a number of different establishments, including a jazz bar, flower stand and coffee shop. Square, a publicly traded company, has deep pockets, with a market cap of $6.5bn (£5.18bn), while iZettle is valued at $500m, and neither company will want to be undercut too heavily by the competition. .Dorsey said: “Our understanding is that there’s over 5m small businesses in the UK, and only half of them accept credit cards. That’s where buyers are going, and so instead of just focusing on switching people, there are a lot of folks that just haven’t been reached.“When we went to Japan, we also faced a market that already had competitors, and we determined that we didn’t need to be first, we just needed to be best. And best to us means fastest, simplest and most cohesive.”Dorsey also pointed to a previous price war the company had successfully fought off: “We had Amazon come in to the US and significantly undercut our transaction rate, and they exited the market about nine months after that.”With widespread chip and pin and contactless payments, Britain is the most advanced market Square has launched in, following eight years in the US and previous international launches in Australia and Japan. When the company first started trading, its physical hardware was a mag-stripe reader that plugged into the headphone socket of an iPhone. The simple technology of America’s payments infrastructure allowed Square to give away the reader for free, but as contactless and chip-based payments have replaced mag stripes, Square has had to move to the more expensive wireless hardware it now uses.The company was founded by Dorsey after he had first been ousted from his position as chief executive of Twitter. In 2015, when Dorsey returned to Twitter to again become the company’s chief executive, he declined to give up his position as head of Square, and now works as CEO of the two companies simultaneously.
