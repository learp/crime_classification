Hugh Jackman has given Twitter followers a tongue-in-cheek taste of what James Bond might look like should the Australian actor step into his shoes.In a seven-second video, an apparent nod at the agent’s 007 number, Jackman sips a martini and delivers the line: “Shaken, not stirred.”Hugh Jackman (@RealHughJackman)SHAKEN, NOT STIRRED. pic.twitter.com/f0yCN6P6UhJanuary 10, 2016The video had many of Jackman’s followers asking whether the video was part of a campaign by the actor to nab the role. “Is this you auditioning for @007??” tweeted one fan.Last September Jackman told the Australian panel show The Project he would “seriously consider” playing the film spy and that he had been approached for the role about 10 years ago but the timing was wrong.He would not be the first Australian to play the role. A then 29-year-old Australian actor, George Lazenby, played Bond in the 1969 film On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. The American actor Burt Reynolds has revealed he was offered the chance to take over from Lazenby. He told the American television show Good Morning America in November: “In my stupidity I said: ‘An American can’t play James Bond, it has to be an Englishman – Bond, James Bond. Nah, I can’t do it.’ Oops. Yeah, I could have done it.” The role went back to Sean Connery instead, for Diamonds Are Forever.When the current Bond actor Daniel Craig was asked in October if he was considering donning the Bond tux for the fifth time, he said: “I’d rather break this glass and slash my wrists.” Media and fans have speculated that Homeland’s Damian Lewis, Tom Hardy and Idris Elba could be in the frame to replace him.The last Bond film, Spectre, was a hit with critics and the box office, taking in $872m worldwide.
