If you‚Äôve been out and about over the past few days, chances are you‚Äôve seen people frantically swiping their smartphones in front of places of interest, or listened with slight alarm as friends chattered excitedly about how they ‚Äúcaught a Sandshrew behind the supermarket‚Äù. You may have wondered: what the heck is happening?The answer is Pok√©mon Go, the new smartphone game from Nintendo and Niantic Labs. According to data tabled by Digital Vision, two days after the app‚Äôs launch, Pok√©mon Go was installed on 5.16% of Android devices in the US and had roared to the top of the iTunes app store‚Äôs free app charts. Nintendo‚Äôs stocks are reported to have risen to their highest value since 1983 and demand for the game was so high, with servers crashing regularly, that Amazon‚Äôs chief technology officer, Werner Vogels, even offered to share the traffic load.'There's a Rattata in my bathroom': how Pok√©mon Go can take over your life As you may have read, I have been addicted to chasing local Pok√©mon since I installed the app on Friday and consequently more than a handful of people have asked me to explain it for them ‚Äì so I have thrown together a quick ‚Äú101‚Äù guide for aspiring Pok√©masters. Catch well, catch often, comrades (and join Team Valor). What is Pok√©mon? Pok√©mon is, simply put, a phenomenon that began as an RPG for Game Boy 20 years ago. Inspired in part by Pok√©mon executive director Satoshi Tajiri‚Äôs childhood love of insect collecting, the game involved catching mysterious creatures known as Pok√©mon before training them to go into battle. This is the format that has seen Pok√©mon diversify into anime, manga, card games and various console games throughout the years.What is Pok√©mon Go?It‚Äôs a ‚Äúreal world adventure‚Äù. That means it uses GPS and augmented reality (AR) to allow you to hunt and train Pok√©mon as you‚Äôre out and about in your neighbourhood. AR functionality uses your smartphone or tablet‚Äôs back-facing camera to display Pok√©mon as though they are actually in front of you. Or on your stove: 'I've never walked my dog so much': readers review Pok√©mon Go How do I ‚Äòcatch them all‚Äô, as it were?As you walk around, Pok√©mon will appear on the map. (If you see little flurries of leaves it means there might be a rarer Pok√©mon nearby.) The little bar at the lower right corner of the screen is a loose guide to which Pok√©mon are in the vicinity, with three ‚Äúfootprints‚Äù meaning it is further away and one meaning it‚Äôs probably ‚Äì in panto terms ‚Äì right behind you. Tap on the Pok√©mon and it will appear in front of you, then you throw Pok√©balls by swiping; the best time to hit the Pok√©mon is when the coloured circle around it has shrunk. What if someone else catches the Pok√©mon before I do?That‚Äôs the beauty of the game: there are plenty of Pok√©mon to go around. Already I‚Äôve helped strangers find local gyms and Pok√©stops, or informed them of a Psyduck infestation nearby. In fact, far from causing Pok√©mon-related clashes, the game seems to be bringing people together.

In theory, you can spend a lot of Pok√©coins (and actual coins) buying Incense that lures Pok√©mon to your living room. But with anecdotal evidence that Pok√©mon Go is helping depressed and lonely people get out and about, coupled with studies that show walking in nature is beneficial to your mood, why not go for a stroll?Drew Dale (@drwdal)#PokemonGO is going to do wonders for my mental health, providing me with purpose and reason to go outside at last.July 6, 2016Where do I find Pikachu?That beloved electric mouse, the brand ambassador for Pok√©mon since back in the day, isn‚Äôt one of the ‚Äústarter Pok√©mon‚Äù that you find when you begin the game. Some reports have suggested that if you plough on past the starter trio ‚Äì in a tribute to the good old days of Pok√©mon Yellow ‚Äì you may be able to run into Pikachu. If you‚Äôd rather wait and see if fate brings you together, you can meditate on this in the meantime:    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest What do I do at the Pok√©mon Gym?Pok√©mon Go: armed robbers use mobile game to lure players into trap In Pokemon Go, improving your Pok√©mon‚Äôs stats by training them is a twofold exercise: first, you can ‚Äúpower up‚Äù using a combination of Stardust (an item you receive whenever you catch a Pok√©mon) and the breed-specific ‚Äúcandy‚Äù, which will increase your Pok√©mon‚Äôs combat points, making them stronger.Second, you make them fight. Early on in the game, you pick a team ‚Äì red (Team Valor), blue (Team Mystic) or yellow (Team Instinct) ‚Äì and your team will dictate which gyms are friendly and which are combative. Once you hit level five, you can take your Pokemon to battle at gyms, either friendly ones that are held by your team (think of this as exercise) or enemy ones where you can battle with local champs (think of this as a prize-fight). Here is a good guide to fighting and training in Pokemon Go; a successful stint at the gym can capture the gym and earn you Pok√©coins. What are these Pok√©stops everyone keeps talking about?Pok√©stops are like lucky dips for aspiring Pok√©mon trainers. Attached to places of interest ‚Äì churches, memorial plaques, statues ‚Äì they will ‚Äúdrop‚Äù loot like Pok√©balls, snacks for Pok√©mon and medicines for battle-worn Pok√©mon. Tap on the Pok√©stop when it turns into a series of concentric circles and then spin the central one, then enjoy your loot.BAKOON!

You can visit the in-app shop to bulk buy Pok√©coins, which you can in turn use to stock up on extra incense or potions ‚Äì but most other items can and will drop from Pok√©stops.Do I have to listen to that bloody music? No. Switch off music in the Pok√©mon Go settings and then listen to whatever you want. Might I recommend Land Of Confusion by Genesis or Rockaria by ELO, to really amp up the excitement levels. Help! I‚Äôve caught so many Pok√©mon I can‚Äôt keep track of them! Two things will help you here: you can ‚Äútransfer‚Äù duplicate Pok√©mon back to Professor Willow in exchange for the ‚Äúcandy‚Äù that helps to evolve Pok√©mon into their more powerful form.

Look, probably. Portable phone charger packs may be flying off the shelves but there are a number of ways you can at least minimise battery use while playing if you don‚Äôt want to lug around a charger: close all your other apps, switch on ‚Äúbattery saver‚Äù in Pok√©mon Go‚Äôs settings and switch off AR when catching Pok√©mon or battling at the gym. Is there a social aspect to the game?At this stage, in-game interaction with other people is limited to battling their Pok√©mon at gyms. But there are heartening stories from around the world of people teaming up to go Pok√©mon hunting and of people helping each other find elusive Pok√©mon ‚Äì and the app is now officially more popular than Tinder, which suggests Pokemon Go might start bringing people together in very special ways indeed.As the old song goes: ‚ÄúPok√©mon, (gotta catch them all) it‚Äôs you and me/I know it‚Äôs my destiny/Pok√©mon, oh, you‚Äôre my best friend/In a world we must defend!‚Äù
