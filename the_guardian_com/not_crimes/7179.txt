I am surprised that your Family section should carry such a gloating self-congratulatory article on how to lie, cheat and betray two marriages for the sake of a selfish thrill (My perfect affair, 23 April).My perfect affair – how I’m getting away with it As one whose marriage and family were blown apart by just such an affair, I consider the cultivation of a lover’s wife in order to provide a “smokescreen” odious. As to the author’s attempts at justifying what she is doing, the Bard put it perfectly: “the lady doth protest too much, methinks”.I would guess that the whole article is an attempt to sidestep the guilt and shame their behaviour deserves. The “lovers” might consider that there may be a heavy price to pay in risking the happiness and future emotional development of real human beings: their partners and their own children.Name and address supplied• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
