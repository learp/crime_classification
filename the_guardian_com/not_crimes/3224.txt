He was neither tall, nor dark, nor handsome. He was, in fact, none of the things we expect of a “style icon” – and yet, somehow, Ronnie Corbett, with his charm, talent, and charisma, became one of the most enduringly influential figures in British fashion. His look was one part showbiz pizazz; a kind of Euro jet set glamour, which emerged dazzling out of the post-war gloom, tempered with a classically suave and dignified Britishness that is also jolly, eccentric and effortlessly smooth.

[He was] unafraid of daring and bold colours, but always tempered with a sense of classicism.”The 1960s and 70s were a more glamorous and simpler time. Today, celebrities don’t have style – they have stylists. But back then, famous men dressed themselves; and the man they turned to once they hit the big time was Doug Hayward, who made suits for Ronnie Corbett, Michael Caine, Terence Stamp and Roger Moore.Audie Charles, now creative director at Savile Row tailor Anderson and Sheppard, worked for Hayward during that time and remembers Corbett fondly: “He had such light and charm and radiated such happiness that you just forgot how short he was, it didn’t matter.”Corbett’s close work with Hayward debunked many style maxims, such as the one that says you must be tall and slim to wear double-breasted suits. “Everything he wore was beautifully cut and well proportioned. Of course, he had no other option than to use a brilliant tailor. You can see that there is someone getting it right for him every time in terms of the width of the lapel, the placement of pockets, the cut of the collar. He looked very comfortable.”Perhaps Corbett’s most memorable style moment came during the 1980s with his colourful and loudly patterned signature jumpers made by Lyle & Scott and Pringle. Chris Modoo, a senior creative at Savile Row brand Chester Barrie, was a south London teenager during this period: “You’ve got to remember in the early 80s there was no social media, no Sartorialist, or anything like that. You got style ideas from the telly, and every Monday at school we would all talk about the jumper that Ronnie Corbett was wearing; all of us casuals did. He made it cool to wear colour.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Corbett on the set of Corbett Follies in 1969. Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockThe casuals were an aspirational working-class street-style cult who adopted the colourful clothes of upmarket sports such as golf and tennis as their uniform. “There was no irony in it. We were young working-class kids who wanted to look good, and the two sports that were glamorous to us were golf and tennis. Of course, there was no sponsorship back then, and so it was really hard to find the exact jumper that Ronnie Corbett had. But to have one of his – that would have been amazing.”In 2010, Corbett finally won some acknowledgment for his services to fashion. Esquire voted him No 2 on its best dressed list that year; No 1 was Prince Charles. The magazine’s then editor, Jeremy Langmead, praised Corbett’s devotion to argyle sweaters, and men “who have developed their own distinctive style and stuck with it”.Unlike Prince Charles, Corbett belongs to a long line of “classless aristocrats” – men of humble backgrounds whose style honed their public image. Perhaps, he’s up there, in the great haberdasher’s in the sky, comparing socks with that other unlikely style icon Fred Astaire.

The slightly wider lapels and bigger, prouder collar of the shirt is very Tom Ford. Both reference 60s and 70s jet set dandyism. Look at how he sometimes layers a cardigan underneath the blazer, giving it the appearance of a casual waistcoat.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Ronnie Corbett and Ronnie Barker in 1975.

He made it cool for young working-class lads to wear colour – even pink. Quite revolutionary in the 80s.The statement glassesHas there ever been a prouder wearer of glasses than Ronnie Corbett? Corbett wore square oversized glasses throughout his life and they became an indispensable part of his look. There’s also more than a touch of Alessandro Michele’s Gucci geek chic about them, too.

Corbett preferred his to be slightly softer in style with wider lapels – a look that is all the rage on the streets of Pitti Uomo.Colour and patternPerhaps it was his Scottish roots, but Corbett wore loud checks and pattern with great aplomb, and always looked comfortable and at ease when doing so.
