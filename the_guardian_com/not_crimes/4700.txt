8.15pm BST20:15So that’s it for the launch show! Some interesting pairings there, have a good feeling about this series. Thank you all for joining in - it’s time for a three week break now while the celebs learn to dance, the pros realise what they’ve let themselves in for, and I go on holiday. Come and say hello on Twitter/Instagram @heidistephens if you’re passing, otherwise I’ll see you on Saturday 24th for the first live show!

Danny is mostly posing, Ore is giving it both barrels, Ed looks like the uncle nobody likes at a wedding. Greg and Anastacia are giving it plenty of attitude. Tameka looks amazing, and Daisy, Naga and Will look promising too. Definitely some rhythm on show out there, which is a good thing.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.09pm BST20:09Right, nearly time for the group dance, which is the first opportunity to see who has some moves, and who appears to have put their legs on backwards. I can’t WAIT. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.08pm BST20:08So Will is paired with…Karen! Now, this is interesting. Because despite his dodgy Pop Idol audition and only managing one term at Ringer College, I suspect Will might have some secret moves. And Karen may be just the woman to bring them out, provided he ditches that dreadful suit at some point and embraces the fake tan and sparkly spandex.

Katya is Russian, and married to one of this year’s other pros, Neil. Ed is Ed Balls, of “Ed Balls” fame. They’ll be gone by Week 2, so let’s not dwell on this pairing for too long.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.05pm BST20:05Ore is paired with…Joanne! Oh. I wanted him to be paired with somebody less annoying. I thought Balls would get Joanne, and I suspect Ore wanted Karen.

Can you be a ringer on one term?

Ed Balls, less so. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.01pm BST20:01I particularly like the lyric “it leaves you blind, with no vision”. As opposed to all the other kinds of blind. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose7.58pm BST19:58I love how everyone has to squat slightly to talk to Claudia. She’s brilliantly tiny. Ooh time for Olly Murs! I don’t care what any of you think, this song is a solid gold summer banger. TURN IT UP AND DANCE.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
