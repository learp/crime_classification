It has been no surprise that women are among those keening over Donald Trump’s election victory. But they are also using the result as a platform for protest. Alison Segel is an activist and writer who started compiling a post-election zine – Forever Nasty – for aggrieved women in an attempt to galvanise them. The submissions were myriad, including fan art of Hillary Clinton, prose, poetry and, finally, a screenshot of a definition of how “femininity” is used in the Merriam-Webster dictionary. It read: “She managed to become a female CEO without sacrificing her femininity.”Horrified, Segel tweeted the screenshot with the thinking-face emoji. The tweet found its way back to Merriam-Webster’s lexicographer, Peter Sokolowski, and shortly afterwards, the company changed it. Segel was thrilled – and surprised. “I wanted to create a dialogue and was not looking or expecting to get the definition altered.” The new definition? “The quality or nature of the female sex.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Writer and activist Alison Segel.

The Oxford Living Dictionaries says: “She celebrates her femininity by wearing makeup and high heels.” The Cambridge Online dictionary? “Long hair was traditionally regarded as a sign of femininity.” And hats off to the online Macmillan dictionary for suggesting: “Qualities that are considered to be typical of women, for example, the quality of being gentle and delicate.”You might argue that to quibble with this definition is to quibble with the definition of “femininity” as a social and cultural construct. Marx once said: “The ideas of the ruling class are, in every epoch, the ruling ideas.” But the change suggests these dialogues – and the people who start them – have some gravitas. And that identity politics is very much back in the public sphere. “I think that traditional gender constructs are changing,” explains Segel. “What makes someone stereotypically male or female doesn’t really exist any more.” Segel’s zine, which is still in compilation stage, remains focused on “solution” and changing people’s minds, rather than aggression – and redefining “femininity” certainly points towards progress. Whatever authority a dictionary definition might have, Segel proved women have the power to change it.
