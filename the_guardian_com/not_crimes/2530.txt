Plump and glossy, rich, sticky and sweet ... I love dates just as they are, with nothing more than a coffee on the side. We’re talking dried dates, here, not fresh – that’s a whole other source of joy. And as you’ve proved this week, their toffee-like flavour and luscious texture means they have myriad uses in the kitchen, adding a natural sweetness to meat dishes, and moisture to many a bake. Stuffed or wrapped with something savoury, they also make the simplest of delicious starters. All hail the date.The winning recipe: Cheesy date sconesThese craggy beauties may lack the elegance required for a genteel afternoon tea, admits Margaret Spiceley, but they more than make up for it with their satisfying combination of sweet and salty.

Sift the flour, baking powder and salt twice. Add the dates, mix briefly to ensure all the pieces are separated and coated in flour, then rub in the butter until you have a breadcrumb consistency.2 Stir through the cheese, then pour in just enough milk to make the mixture damp enough to handle as a dough.3 Handling it lightly, pat the mixture out to about 2cm thick, brush with a little milk and cut into 12-16 shapes.4 Brush with egg wash, if using, and bake for 17-18 minutes.Chicken with date molassesThis marinade, says Rachel Kelly, works with any meat or fish, but is particularly good with chicken.
