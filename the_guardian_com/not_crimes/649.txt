Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga and Tigger look as good as new and are ready to go back on display after more than a year of much-needed repairs by a textile conservator.The toys, which belonged to Christopher Robin Milne when he was a boy, are back on show from Wednesday at the New York public library, where they have resided since 1987.Christopher Robin received the toys in the 1920s from his father, the author AA Milne, who based the Winnie-the-Pooh children’s stories on the stuffed animals.

He later renamed him, combining two names: Winnie, for a real black bear at the London zoo that had once served as a military mascot in Winnipeg, Canada, and Pooh for a pet swan.Pooh will be 95 on 21 August. The toys were donated to the library by Milne’s publisher.
