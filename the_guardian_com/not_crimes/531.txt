Theatre1 DreamgirlsIt’s been a long time getting here. Henry Krieger and Tom Eyen’s musical about a 60s girl band, clearly inspired by the Supremes, was first seen on Broadway in 1981. It’s not subtle, but it has a gaudy gaiety and is full of panache as it follows the fortunes of the group, including their rise, fall and rise again. The cast give it their all with powerhouse vocals, and Amber Riley (of Glee fame) is electrifying as Effie, the singer ousted from the band, and the manager’s bed, who is not going to take it lying down. Savoy Theatre, WC2, to Saturday 21 Oct2 SmashedThe opening show in this year’s 40th London international mime festival is a return visit from the miraculous Gandini Juggling, with a special edition of their cult show Smashed. It’s a Pina Bausch-inspired piece featuring a large amount of crockery, some apples and 17 male and female jugglers: if you don’t think that juggling is art, this is the show to change your mind. Peacock Theatre, WC2, Monday 9 Jan and Tuesday 10 Jan3 Wish ListLater this year, the Royal Court is reviving Road, Jim Cartwright’s 1986 theatrical cry of despair about young people with no hope for the future except in low-paid, unfulfilling jobs. Here’s its 2017 equivalent: Katherine Soper’s debut play looking at the lives of Dean and Tamsin, a brother and sister struggling to survive in a world of zero-hours contracts and benefits bureaucracy. She’s 19, he’s 17 and housebound by his OCD, which follows them as they reach breaking point. Devastating.Jerwood Theatres at the Royal Court, SW1, Tuesday 10 Jan to Saturday 11 Feb4 The Snow QueenThere are two great Snow Queens on offer this January. Vivienne Franzmann’s version (Bristol Old Vic, to Monday 16 Jan) is dark, with an icy witch who gorges on children’s tantrums. Things are a little warmer at the New Vic, where Theresa Heskins draws on the fashionable Danish idea of hygge to tell a story of friendship, self-sacrifice and adventure. If you’re in need of a pick-me-up, this exquisitely atmospheric staging is a real winter-warmer.New Vic Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme, to Saturday 28 Jan5 The Little Match Girl And Other Happier TalesEmma Rice departs the Globe in 2018, and this retelling of four tales by Hans Christian Andersen is evidence of what a terrific director she is. There are cheeky references to Rice’s dispute with the venue over lighting, but they never get in the way of an evening stuffed with theatrical invention and wonder.
