Recently I treated the neighbourhood chaffinches to a bag of RSPB sunflower seeds so tasty that my toddlers try to hang from the feeder to scoff the food.I bought it at the local garden centre, and next in the queue were a nice couple who were asking for “something to kill moles”. Between me and them, this perfectly illustrates our bizarrely polarised attitudes towards wild animals.Conservationists appalled at illegal killing of 25m birds a year in the Mediterranean “Eat a robin? I would sooner eat a child,” exclaimed a 19th-century traveller when he witnessed the Mediterranean taste for songbirds. The fate of the velvet-furred “little hermit” – as John Clare called the mole – shows there is no logic to the creatures we cherish and those we slaughter.My nice couple would once have employed a mole-catcher: as recently as 2002, the Queen revived the tradition of a royal warrant for a mole-murderer. Landowners used to slaughter moles on an industrial scale: one East Anglia estate caught 80,000-90,000 moles in 20 years. Years after the poison strychnine had been banned for other animals, it was still legally deployed to kill moles because no one would see a mole dying in agony underground.Moles may be heroes of children’s literature – from the everyman Mole in The Wind in the Willows to the fighting, romancing moles of Duncton Wood (massive in my childhood) – but we can’t seem to form a close bond with them, unlike another garden resident, the hedgehog, which routinely tops most-loved animal polls.According to Rob Atkinson, the author of Moles and the country’s leading (perhaps only) mole ecologist, their excavations are equivalent to us pushing an elephant out of a tunnel with one hand. “They have many qualities that humans admire,” he says. “They are very industrious and they work very hard at looking after their children.” Role models in their own way.A root and branch contest  Britain looks like a detached limb of Europe in more ways than one, as the continent-wide Tree of the Year contest reveals. While Hungary’s oak (44,000 votes) is going trunk-to-trunk with the Czech Republic’s thousand-year-old lime (31,000), England’s pear tree – a gorgeous old thing threatened with destruction by HS2 – has garnered just 5,013 votes. The trees representing Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland haven’t even got 1,000 votes yet.I refuse to blame our trees – a Salford tree that looks like Ian Brown of the Stones Roses must be in the running next year – or voters, because we are indisputably a nation of tree-lovers. The competition clearly enjoys a much higher profile in eastern Europe (French and German trees are similarly overlooked), but perhaps we could learn from our European friends. The Czech Republic has a national register of “memorable trees”, a fabulous concept that protects individual trees because they are amazing nature reserves in miniature. But also because human meanings and memories take root in them.Crowdfund and be damned I was surprised to see Gautam Malkani, whose debut novel, Londonstani, won many fans 10 years ago, crowdfunding his follow-up, The Story Distorted. The first chapter – published via Unbound – is gripping. Is this another miss by conventional publishers, who also overlooked Paul Kingsnorth’s prize-winning The Wake? We often breathlessly wonder if crowdfunding is the future of publishing – but wouldn’t it be better to jettison the tedious cliche of “disruptive technology,” and recognise that “the past” and “the future” usually coexist for a long time in the present?
