It’s said that we all need something to fill the hole in our lives left by the decline of organised religion, and in our flat, it is the promise of a new kitchen.Just as with religions, we have rituals – trying to work out where to put the food processor, going through a backlog of dirty crockery – and incantations: when we get a new kitchen, it will all be different.As so often with religious incantations, the dirge of the new kitchen has changed somewhat. We used to just talk about getting a dishwasher. Now – sadly inspired more by the fact that my commute takes me past a showroom, and by too many late nights playing the Sims 3, than financial reality – the incantation has taken on a life of its own. Just as the Easter service ends with the promise that He is coming soon, so does any large amount of time in our kitchen end with the idea that next year, there will be a dishwasher, a hardwood floor, and a built-in oven. (I don’t actually play the lottery, but I often think about what would happen if I won it.)For Delia, of course, her dream kitchen has already come. (I know, because sometimes when I watch her cookery school videos, I stop listening and stare at the furnishings behind her.) Mostly, this is not a problem: reading Delia, you wouldn’t think that she was in possession of a top-of-the-range kitchen with infinite storage space. But there is just one exception, and that is when it comes to grilling. I’m not sure how far to blame Delia for this and how much to blame my grill, which has three places you can put the rack: the first is too close to the heat and the third is too far from it. It’s less of a cooking appliance, more of a multiple-choice exam with only one correct answer.Delia’s guacamole recipe has inflamed my passion for avocados | The Delia project The limitations of my grill is one reason why I can’t tell you with any confidence that Delia’s jerk pork and grilled pineapple salsa is easy to cook well or not. The recipe calls for both the pork and the salsa to be grilled as close to the heat as possible. In many kitchens, I can see this might be a subject of trial and error, but as there is no practical difference between “as close to the heat as possible” or “as far from the heat as possible” in our kitchen, it was pretty simple for me.The second reason is that – without wishing to bring the pineapple lobby down on my head – I honestly have no idea what constitutes a good pineapple recipe, as I can’t see the point of pineapple. I don’t hate it – I just can’t see why, unless every other fresh fruit or vegetable has vanished from the shelves, you would ever particularly want to eat it.The only real difficulty is that Delia’s recipe is designed for six people, and if you are a household of two, there is no way that I can see of blending it all together without having lots of leftovers. (I tried at first and the blades of my processor just spun forlornly above the mixture, blending empty air.)The good news about having lots left over is, as you’d expect from a marinade, that it only improves with time and is effectively non-perishable or, at least, will last at least as long as it takes for my dream kitchen to arrive.Stephen Bush is cooking his way through Delia’s Complete How To Cook (BBC Books, £40) in a year.
