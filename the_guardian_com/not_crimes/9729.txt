This is one of the most amazing books I have read in recent times, it might even make it into my top ten. It starts off with a bang (not literally) and you can only read on as Lois Lane, Superman’s first love, is re-imagined as a teenager. She inevitably gets tangled up in some trouble when she is asked to join a reporter’s club and decides to investigate a creepy gaming group called the Warheads.Using her online chat account SkepticGirl1, she keeps in touch with her closest, most secret friend, SmallVilleGuy.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Well, when she says close they haven’t actually seen each other in the flesh. SmallVilleGuy helps her to solve one mystery after another, in the curious case of Project Hydra, a laboratory apparently experimenting on school kids.This book is suitable for ages 10+ as it has a very complex plot. Full of convincing descriptions and rich language, it is bound to hit the bestsellers list with a smash! I want to say thanks to Gwenda Bond for writing this fantastic book – I hope a sequel will be published soon!How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
