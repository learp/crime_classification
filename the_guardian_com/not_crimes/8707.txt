Enough of chefs, let’s hear it for the front of house. No matter how good the food is, without a great crew in the dining room, no one is going to enjoy their evening.I was very good at working front of house (I could probably still manage a bit of silver-service spoon-and-forkery). What is more, I enjoyed it enormously – making people welcome, putting something nice to eat in front of them, and making sure they had a good time.The one niggle of the job was the idea of being tipped. That restaurant staff should depend on the generosity (or not) of the customer to top up their wages is disgraceful. Staff should be paid a decent wage, even if it means putting up the price of the food and drink to cover it.One of the great joys of dining out is seeing a familiar face in the dining room. For our special front of house issue, we talk to some of the best in the business, including our cover star Fred Sirieix of Galvin at Windows – the star of Channel 4’s First Dates; José Etura at Barrafina, who nightly has to juggle more customers than his restaurant has seats; and Danielle Shaw from Scott’s and Gina Glennon at 34 who have to please some of the most demanding diners you could imagine. We also have a tribute to Elena Salvoni, one of London’s front of house greats, who sadly died last month. And we have a great piece from Kathleen Alcott about her time working in a San Francisco restaurant.There is little I enjoy more than walking into a restaurant for a meal. Opening the door, being given a welcoming smile, taken to my table and handed a menu, not to mention having a drink put in front of me, always feels like an enormous treat. That I feel that way is without question down to those who work front of house. The teams who make our evening just as special as those working at the stove.
