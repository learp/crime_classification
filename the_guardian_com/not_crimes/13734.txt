'Country music has become apolitical': why have acts kept quiet on the election? The Country Music Association has denied removing all traces of Beyoncé’s performance with the Dixie Chicks at its 50th annual awards after several publications reported the organisation had wiped any mention from its website and social media accounts.The pop star performed her track Daddy Lessons with the group on Wednesday night, but several publications including Billboard claimed that it was nowhere to be found in any of the award’s post-show promotion.There was speculation that the lack of any mention of it from official channels had been down to criticism of the decision to let Beyoncé perform.Critics of the decision on the organization’s Facebook page pointed to the star’s Super Bowl halftime show and support of the Black Lives Matter movement, which was described as anti-police by some, and the Dixie Chicks’ criticism of George W Bush as disqualifying factors.
