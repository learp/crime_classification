In the time it takes you to read this blog post, eight fluffy climate policy teddy bears with cute little green hearts on their chests will have been stabbed to death and their stuffing pulled out for use as a pan scourer by your friendly neighbourhood coal mining magnate.Now I don’t really know what I mean by any of that, but it seems to fit the surrealist circus sideshow mood of the climate policy debate in Australia right about now.And by the time you have read this blog post who knows what the policy outlook might be?Will we have a price on greenhouse gas emissions, or will we not?Will we have a policy that charges polluters for the waste emissions they pump into the air or, as is the wont of the Abbott Government, a policy that asks taxpayers to pay for polluters to cut their emissions?Will the public get a guaranteed refund on any costs of the carbon price… you know, like the one that already exists under the current legislation and compensates the vast majority of taxpayers for minuscule cost of living increases?One thing that can never be taken away, however, is the surrealist vision of climate campaigner and former US vice president Al Gore standing with Clive Palmer to endorse the fickle policy hopes of the latter - a man who wants to mine 40 million tonnes of coal from Queensland’s Galilee Basin and in so doing liberate an estimated 3,291 million tonnes of CO2-e into the atmosphere over 30 years.You just couldn’t make it up.But if you’re desperate for a little sliver of stability from this climate policy fandango, then fear not.Because the phrase “the more things change, the more they stay the same” could just about define the last few months of Australia’s climate policy debate.In real terms, nothing has actually changed at all, regardless of what happens in the coming days or over the course of me typing out this blog post.That’s because Australia’s target to cut emissions by the year 2020 remains at just five per cent based on their levels in 2000.When the statutory Climate Change Authority reviewed Australia’s current target, the group described it as “inadequate” and recommended it should be tripled.This level of cuts would mean Australia’s entire budget for emitting greenhouse gases between 2013 and 2020 would stand at 4,193 tonnes of CO2-e (or to put it another way, a carbon budget eventually two thirds-swallowed by one proposed Palmer coal mine).Remember too, this is the same Climate Change Authority (CCA) now apparently supported by billionaire Clive Palmer – the man who emerged as a policy powerbroker thanks to the eponymous political party he created out of thin air and his personal mining fortune.The chances of the Abbott Government heeding the advice of the CCA appear as distant now as ever.If the Abbott Government is successful at getting its “direct action” policy legislated, then the Prime Minister has already said there’ll be no extra cash if his policy falls short the five per cent target (most analysts would replace my conjunction ‘if’ with the word ‘when’).But back to the Faustian pact, of sorts, negotiated between Palmer and Gore to retain Australia’s renewable energy target and save the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.The deal was described by those who made it happen as a chance to avoid “a big step backwards” as both measures are seen as vital to supporting growth in renewable energy.The fact that this was apparently achieved by putting Al Gore in a room with a coal miner must have left some climate campaigners scratching their heads.But regardless of the outcome of the coming days, the Australian Government must still take its “inadequate” five per cent target, its dislike of clean energy financing and its unwavering support for the coal industry into rooms of international negotiators over the next 18 months.There, Australia will still likely be viewed internationally by many as a climate change turncoat. A nation once praised as a leader but now viewed as a laggard.The fact that Australia was seen as a climate change ‘leader’ while it was (and still is) shooting for the top of the world’s coal and gas export charts should be seen for what it was.Prime Minister Abbott probably still won’t be going to the summit of world leaders being convened in September by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to try and boost ambitions on greenhouse gas cuts.But while Abbott can choose not to show his face in New York, the Australian government cannot conceivably avoid having to front up to UN climate change meetings in Lima, Peru, at the end of this year.That’s when it is hoped the bulk of the work will be done to draft a new global agreement on cutting greenhouse gas emissions to be signed a year later in Paris.As a process that works on consensus, Australia has the option of placing a veto on anything it doesn’t like and in turn slowing down the entire global negotiating progress.If that happens, then the enduring images of the PalmGore sideshow will quickly fade (well yeh OK, some things cannot be 'unseen', but you get my drift).
