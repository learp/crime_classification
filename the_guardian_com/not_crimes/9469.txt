It is an odd, but intriguing, fact that Oh! What a Lovely War and Half a Sixpence opened within two days of each other in 1963. On the face of it, you could hardly have two musicals more radically different.One is an ensemble piece attacking the horrendous sacrifice of life in the first world war; the other was clearly conceived as a vehicle for Tommy Steele as a cheery Kentish draper. But happening to reread Lovely War and see the West End transfer of Chichester’s refurbished Half a Sixpence on the same day recently, I was struck by how much the shows have in common. Both start with an evocation of Edwardian seaside England; both take a dim view of the starchy upper classes; and David Heneker, who wrote the original music and lyrics for Half a Sixpence, co-authored one of the best musicals to come out of Joan Littlewood’s Theatre Workshop, Make Me An Offer.Both shows share another important feature: they are palpably British. In his excellent 1997 book, Broadway Babies Say Goodnight, Mark Steyn sniffily writes: “British musicals? It STILL sounds like a contradiction in terms.” Steyn concedes the success of the Lloyd Webber canon including Cats, Evita and The Phantom of the Opera, but all of these transcend national barriers and are in no way peculiarly British. Indeed, what we seem to have witnessed in the last 40 years is the emergence of the global musical that has as much resonance in Brisbane or Birmingham as it does in Berlin or on Broadway.

One could point to a pre-Cats tradition that stretches from Gilbert and Sullivan to Lionel Bart. In recent years we have seen, although it’s hardly been noted, the re-emergence of the musical with firm roots in its native soil. The outstanding example is Billy Elliot, with a score by Elton John and book and lyrics by Lee Hall, that took the 1984 miners’ strike as its setting. You might add Matilda the Musical, although the score is the work of Australian Tim Minchin, but there has been a string of shows that, even if they have not been as popular, prove that the British are hardly musical duffers. My own list of favourites includes Howard Goodall’s The Hired Man, George Stiles and Anthony Drewe’s Betty Blue Eyes and George Fenton and Simon Chamberlain’s Mrs Henderson Presents, which cheekily celebrated the wartime survival of the Windmill theatre. Half a Sixpence has the key quality any musical needs: a moment of pure ecstasy Stiles and Drewe, along with Julian Fellowes and Cameron Mackintosh, are also the team behind the reworked Half a Sixpence, which has many of the qualities that define the British musical. It is palpably about class. Far from being a snobbish put down of an uppity draper, however, it suggests there is more camaraderie, cheer and good nature to be found in the pub parlour than in the posh drawing room. It relies on the music-hall tradition, most obviously in the rumbustious Flash, Bang, Wallop. But it also has the key quality any musical needs: a moment of pure ecstasy. That comes in a new number, Pick Out a Simple Tune, when Charlie Stemp, a 22-year-old who has the engaging quality of a young Michael Crawford, whips out his banjo and gets a roomful of snooty toffs to rattle the spoons, whirl like dervishes and even swing from the chandeliers. I am not arguing the show is likely to cause a social revolution. What it proves, though, is that the British musical, far from being a lost cause, perkily thrives even in an age of theatrical globalisation.
