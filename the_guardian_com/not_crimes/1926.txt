It’s rare that a range of clothes comes out that is a) really desirable b) actually quite highbrow and c) more sustainably made. But that’s the case with H & M’s Conscious Exclusive collection, which launches today. Designed to coincide with the opening of Fashion Forward: 300 Years of Fashion at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, the designers behind this collection had a rummage in the museum’s archive to find inspiration. A painting by Gustave Moreau was the basis for a print on one dress, while another uses an image from Botticelli’s Three Graces as a starting point. Materials used include organic silk and recycled linen, while some beads are made of denimite, a substance made from recycled old denim. This dress, worn by Julia Restoin-Roitfeld with such aplomb, is the one with the Moreau reference. Buy now to look fabulous and have loads to talk about too.
