It’s National Absinthe Day tomorrow, so let’s celebrate the “green fairy”: here, its fresh, aniseed note lifts the robust mezcal. Demerara syrup is just sugar syrup made with demerara instead of caster sugar. Serves one.30ml mezcal (Del Maguey Vida, ideally)20ml Aperol35ml pineapple juice25ml lime juice15ml demerara syrup (see introduction)½ tsp absinthe20ml egg white (ie, from 1 small egg)1 slice dried pineapple (optional)Shake all the liquids, add ice and hard shake. Double-strain into a chilled coupette and garnish with pineapple. I spray extra absinthe on top.Bobby Fitzpatrick, London NW6
