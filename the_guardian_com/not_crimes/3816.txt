Young people could be putting their chances of becoming parents later in life at risk because of a lack of understanding about their fertility, according to the British Fertility Society (BFS).Doctors warned that most people donâ€™t consider their reproductive health until they are trying to conceive, unaware of any problems that they may then encounter. This has led to the BFS to call for children to be given fertility lessons.Men in their 30s were singled out, with the BFS saying that they were putting off parenthood to enjoy themselves, without considering the impact it would have on their chances of having a baby.Are you worried about your fertility, and making lifestyle choices based on these concerns?
