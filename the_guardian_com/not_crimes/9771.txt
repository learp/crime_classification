It was disappointing that a study into the lack of diversity of Oscar nominees didn’t include disability in its analysis (Report, 23 February). One can only imagine how low the figures would have been. It is still far too difficult for disabled people to make it in the film industry, both on and off screen. This is particularly ironic given the high number of (non-disabled) actors who play disabled characters and go on to win Academy Awards.In the UK, broadcasters have committed to increasing the number of disabled people on our screens, to make TV more representative. Hollywood needs to do the same. The first step is to acknowledge disability in the current debates about diversity.Mark AtkinsonChief executive, Scope• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
