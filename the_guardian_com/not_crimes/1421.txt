Thomas Hardy is best known for his grand tragedies, but the chance discovery with an iPhone torch of an altarpiece believed to have been designed by the writer for a Windsor church reads like the start of a crime caper.The author of Tess of the d’Urbervilles and Far from the Madding Crowd trained as an architect and worked as a draughtsman in the 1860s, working on designs for a number of churches. In the 1970s, a collection of designs was discovered behind the organ of All Saints church in Windsor, many of which featured the work of Hardy. Although three of the drawings were kept in the church, until Stuart Tunstall and his fellow churchgoer Don Church embarked on a search for the building’s foundation stone, it was believed that none of the designs had been realised.

I didn’t see a foundation stone, but I saw a carved motive and a decorative panel.”Tunstall realised the design on the altar-stone resembled a design hanging at the back of the church – the one, he said, that had been designed by Hardy. “The discovery shows it did exist, but that it had been covered over some time in the 1920s,” he said. “It’s every little boy and little girl’s dream, to discover hidden treasure.”Tunstall gave a presentation about the finding to the Thomas Hardy Society’s conference earlier this month. “They were extremely excited,” he said. “It appears to be completely undamaged and there’s absolutely no doubt about the designs [being Hardy’s work]. The only issue I needed to be clear about was if Hardy came up with the designs himself or if he, as a gothic draughtsman, was drawing what others had instructed him to draw. But the view of the experts is that he was involved in designing it.”All Saints is now looking to raise £9,000 in order to take away the panelling and restore the altarpiece. The church called the ornamental fixture – known as a reredos – magnificent, and said in its JustGiving appeal that “once made visible again, the Hardy reredos will be of great interest to the thousands of Hardy devotees around the world, will put our church on the tourist map of Windsor, and will restore this outstanding example of Victorian gothic religious art to the sight of all who worship at or use this fine building”.Bones found at prison may belong to real-life Tess of the d'Urbervilles The church’s rector, Reverend Ainsley Swift, said: “It’s got to be done really carefully – the wooden panelling is from the 1920s and 30s and has some fine woodwork detail on it, so we’re not allowed to just rip it out. But the joiners have managed to remove certain panels and it looks very impressive … I’ve been here for 18 years and nobody knew it existed.”
