 “Feel as if I’m living in a bad dystopian political thriller,” tweeted the writer Robert Harris at 8.50am on 24 June, a response echoed 10 minutes later by the agent Jonny Geller’s “don’t need to read dystopian novels anymore”. Their reaction was shared by other leading figures from the book world, with prominent independent publishers – Canongate’s Jamie Byng, Faber’s Stephen Page, Bloomsbury’s Alexandra Pringle – joining authors such as Malorie Blackman, Philip Pullman, Michael Rosen and JK Rowling in voicing or retweeting horror and alarm on the morning after. Dismayed executives from the big conglomerates were less visible, but Gail Rebuck, chair of Penguin Random House UK, called it “a disastrous night” and Hachette UK boss Tim Hely Hutchinson was “disappointed”.Even harder to spot were publishers thrilled by the Leave vote (a pre-poll Bookseller survey of the book trade found 78% planning to vote Remain v 18% for Leave), although Biteback’s Iain Dale – publisher of Nigel Farage and the unauthorised Cameron biography Call Me Dave – could predictably be found tweeting enthusiastically. HarperCollins’s chief executive Charlie Redmayne has yet to make a public comment since the result but was reported during April’s London Book Fair to be “equivocal” on the issue, as well he might be since his company is part of pro-Brexit Rupert Murdoch’s empire.To their credit, those who put their heads above the parapet were reacting to what they thought the result said about Britain, and anticipating how quitting the EU would transform the country (Rowling’s first reaction, at 5.25am on Friday, for example, was simply “Goodbye, UK”, expecting that Scotland would seek a second independence vote and “Cameron’s legacy will be breaking up two unions”). Focusing on the repercussions for their industry instead of gazing glumly at the big picture would come across as myopic and narcissistic, so companies and individuals alike have largely avoided doing so, on Twitter and elsewhere.However, the likely immediate implications for the trade had been set out by Waterstones boss James Daunt in a pre-poll email to his staff: the dire economic consequences forecast by the IMF would entail “a significant retail downturn”, he warned, with falling book sales harming publishers and booksellers alike (meaning “cost-cutting” at Waterstones, with “job losses and stagnant wages”). For publishers, though, this downturn has a possible upside in the form of the weakening of sterling – better for exporters, Bloomsbury’s Richard Charkin has suggested, although Oneworld’s Juliet Mabey disagrees.On the other hand, a punier pound will make paper and print imports more expensive, as Neill Denny noted on BookBrunch (small publisher Little Toller Books tweeted “printing costs will soar, we won’t be able to afford to print books anymore. Thanks!”). Other “negative impacts” he projected included “higher costs for prices and contracts denominated in dollars and euros”, and “loss of EU grants” for translations and (especially science) research, hurting both publishers specialising in foreign-language books and academic presses.“If there’s an upside to this, I’m failing to see it,” lamented Bookseller editor Philip Jones, similarly setting out reasons to be woeful in a post that began “publishing’s nightmare scenario has come true”. Others have claimed more luck in discerning silver linings, such as Denny’s contention that UK publishers could “play a starring role again” in “the Anglophone world” that Brexit will “push us back into”. The British Council and culture minister Ed Vaizey (and niche publisher Peirene, which tweeted “foreign lit’re now more important than ever for UK”) were among those floating the idea of literature and the other arts as a kind of divorce mediator, vitally repairing our relationship with continental Europe as we prepare to leave the EU.No one, though, managed to identify a concrete positive consequence; like a Boris Johnson speech, the straw clutchers have stuck to vague, broad assertions that all will be well – or at least less dystopian than the gloom-mongers prophesy.
