Look I’m a complete feminist, probably been a feminist longer than you, so my point is, speaking totally in support of females’ equality and their gynae matters and whatever, you all made complete fools of yourselves, don’t get me started on the language, not clever not funny. So go on, what was your point – no, let me finish – because what I took away was a few potty-mouthed wimmin marching down a road that wouldn’t even have been there if men hadn’t built it.Basically you should be glad almost no one turned up – no wait – I saw a few hundred, max, because do you want people to think feminists have a problem with democracy? Protest? So will marching change anything, what were you even protesting about because if I as a registered feminist thought you looked like a pathetic handful of gobby manhaters – no, listen – it can’t have been a feminist march, can it?Don’t interrupt, I’ve always loved women, love ’em to bits, but if you must march, don’t shout, don’t bloody swear and for Christ’s sake march against something sensible, march against the way they treat women in Saudi, that’s what I call disgusting, but do your lot ever think about that, excuse me if I can just get a word in?Modern tribes: the media boycotter My point is, if you’d stop interrupting, I think we should have a men’s march, against Madonna, saying we wouldn’t for £100m, not if she was the last rabid old freak on earth – joke! – you just proved my point, absolutely typical feminazi humourlessness.Wait, if you wouldn’t mind not speaking since you’re making zero sense, I don’t fancy you. Thank you, my point is – pipe down – what was your point? Because admit it, if you weren’t marching about something I want you to march about, like MGM – OK, FGM – whatever, it was just a bunch of wimmin blocking the road. Word of advice, love, next time check you’re being properly feminist before you start getting ideas.
