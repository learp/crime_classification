It’s that time in the gaming year when we all look back on the myriad of entertainment treasures that the industry has provided and ask, why am I still playing Destiny?With this is mind, the Guardian is holding a “games of the year” event on 17 December, where games editor Keith Stuart will be discussing the most interesting releases of 2015 with journalists Simon Parkin and Jordan Erica Webber as well as author and narrative designer Cara Ellison (Dishonored 2) and Mike Bithell, creator of PC and PlayStation 4 stealth game Volume. We’ll also cover some of the talking points and controversies of an intriguing year, and welcoming other guests too.In the spirit of Christmas, there will be mince pies and a tombola where every attendee gets the chance to win one of the frankly amazing prizes, including rare press-only editions of the year’s best games, Namco Bandai gift vouchers, beautiful promotional T-shirts and other wonders from underneath Keith’s desk. It’ll be the perfect chance to see out the year – and kill some time before you go to see Star Wars later. The event takes place at the Scott Room in the Guardian HQ near Kings Cross and tickets are £10. They’re available below.Guardian Live: Games of the year
