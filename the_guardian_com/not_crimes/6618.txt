George Osborne is putting 6,000 coal mining jobs at risk, despite new technology potentially transforming the fuel into a clean source of energy, a new paper by a right-wing thinktank says.The report, called The Atomic Clock, due to be published by the Centre for Policy Studies next month, examines the impact of Osborne's plans to increase the cost of burning fossil fuels with the introduction of a carbon floor price. It says the proposals will make the remnants of the British coal industry uneconomic and force the energy industry to import foreign coal – even if efforts to develop carbon capture and storage systems prove successful.In what some may argue is the Tory party's third attempt to close down the British coal mining industry in 30 years, the report's author and CPS research fellow, Tony Lodge, says: "This collapse in the market for coal could come as new cleaner coal power stations are possibly under construction by the mid-2020s – or in sight of opening – but by the time they are commissioned the UK coal industry would have effectively ceased to exist."UK mining still looks after a third of our coal demand, supplying 18.4m tonnes last year, and this is expected to hit 19m tonnes this year. This collapse would lead to Britain needing to import all of its coal demand and it would no longer have home production to help mitigate erratic import prices. It would also lead to the loss of up to 6,000 coal sector jobs."British coal tends to be more expensive and dirtier than imports, but it has a captive market in the UK as many pits are located extremely close to the power stations where the fuel is burnt. If the pits are closed, mining industry sources say they would never be economically viable to open again. The chancellor's proposals make it difficult for mining companies to raise money to invest for the future, Lodge argues.In his March budget, Osborne announced plans for a new unilateral UK carbon floor price to supplement the European Union's emissions trading scheme. Currently the price is about €11 per tonne, but that would add up to a levy on carbon emissions that is due to be increased substantially by 2020.The employers' body, the CBI, has already begun lobbying against the scheme, arguing it will put the UK at a disadvantage to other European countries, where the carbon price is entirely decided by the markets.Carbon capture and storage technology has been touted as a potential solution to the energy crisis as it will allow plentiful but dirty fuels such as coal to be burnt while not pumping more CO2 into the environment.However, the technology has its critics. Last month, proposals for the UK government to spend £1bn to retrofit CCS equipment to Longannet power station in Clackmannanshire, and Europe's third largest coal-fired power station, collapsed in a row over escalating costs.
