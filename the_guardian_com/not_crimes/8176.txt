Jonathan Ross’s chatshow will take a break from ITV next year, fuelling speculation that the broadcaster may look to permanently cancel the show.Ross’s contract with ITV expires at the end of the year, meaning the autumn run of the chatshow, and a Christmas special, will be the last to air until at least the end of 2017.The 55-year-old is to take a break in the US next year.Jonathan Ross backs Danny Baker's plan for crowdfunded radio station “Jonathan is extending his hiatus into the early part of next year to travel to the US,” said a spokesperson for Ross. “The chatshow will return in the autumn of 2017.”However, according to a report in the Mirror, the show may well end up being quietly axed. Ross is thought to be paid £1m a year for a show that attracts an average audience of 2 million viewers, about half the ratings for BBC rival Graham Norton.Ross joined ITV in 2011 after a decade at the BBC, where he took home about £6m a year. He left the corporation following his suspension over the Sachsgate scandal involving Russell Brand, saying: “I think it’s not a bad time for me to move on. It’s possibly not a bad time for them either.”The BBC was fined £150,000 by media regulator Ofcom over the scandal.Kevin Lygo, recently promoted to the role of director of television at ITV, lent his support to Ross but did not unequivocally confirm the chatshow would return, just that the broadcaster would do more projects with him.“Jonathan Ross is very important to ITV and we look forward to the new series this autumn and the Christmas special and working with him again next year when the chatshow returns in autumn 2017,” he said.
