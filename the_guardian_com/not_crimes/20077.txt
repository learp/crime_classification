The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor Midland: Final Credits It mops up everywhere; not a dry eye in the house, garden, field, basement, warehouse…The track that currently gets the most rewinds Travis Scott: The Ends Heavyweight opener from his new album that features André 3000 and James Blake somewhere under the layers of vocals.The track I wish I’d signed to my label Aphex Twin: Xtal Indescribable emotions whenever I hear this, but that’s par for the course with so much of Richard’s work. I’m still struck by how almost out of time so much of it sounds. A visionary.The track I’d play to show off my eclectic tastes Miles Davis: Chieftain Intense, uptempo, funk-induced Miles going all the way through the rabbit hole and out the other side. It’s quite rough and ready. The eagle-eyed will note this is only available on the On The Corner box set, but it’s well worth seeking out.The track that should have been a crossover hit Half Man Half Biscuit: National Shite Day “I finally made it to the station, where I found the bus-replacement service had broke down”. Doesn’t that just perfectly encapsulate the mood of the nation right now?The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding Neil Diamond: Sweet Caroline You’ve got to go in with the big guns on such an occasion; don’t try and soft-soap it with 90s pop-dance fluff.The best track by my favourite new artist Aleksi Perälä: UK74R1512110 To me, this sounds like an all-time classic. Utilising his own scale so sometimes the harmony sounds frayed and ever so pleasingly discordant, this really is like nothing else.The track I’d play at my funeral Manuel Göttsching: E2-E4 A masterpiece of harmony and emotion stretched out over an hour. Gives enough time for my ashes to cool and the assembled bods to piss off to the pub.Paul Woolford plays Bugged Out Warehouse Project, Store Street, Manchester, Fri
