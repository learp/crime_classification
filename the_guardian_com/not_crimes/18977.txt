Samantha Cameron’s win on BBC1’s The Great Sport Relief Bake Off cooked up 4.6 million viewers on Wednesday night.Despite the extensive coverage her appearance generated, it was no match for the long-running ITV drama Midsomer Murders which has gained a new lease of life this series. Samantha Cameron and Ed Balls to mix it up in Great British Bake Off special While Cameron’s baking battle against comedian Jason Manford, goalkeeper David James and EastEnders actor Maddy Hill whipped up an audience share of 20.3% at 8.30pm, it was beaten by the ITV crime series, which notched up an audience of 5.1 million and a 23.3% share between 8pm and 10pm. The Great Sport Relief Bake Off, which has three more episodes to air over the coming weeks, more than doubled the audience it inherited from Dickensian, which scored 2.4 million at 8pm. Unlike in the regular series of The Great British Bake Off, each of the 16 participants in the charity version only appears once, with a star baker crowned during each of the four episodes.
