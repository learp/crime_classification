The Abbott government has reacted defiantly to a stinging UN rebuke to its plan to remove world heritage protection from Tasmanian forest, claiming the rejection will result in job losses in the state.Unesco’s world heritage committee took just eight minutes to reject the Coalition’s request to strip 74,000 hectares of Tasmanian forest from the internationally protected area at a meeting in Qatar on Monday night.Portugal’s delegate to the committee said the government’s justifications for the reduction were “feeble” and would represent an “unacceptable precedent”. A representative of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which advises Unesco, said the Coalition’s proposal was “extremely sparse”.The government has said it accepts the committee’s decision, but it has not ruled out attempting to revisit the issue.Tony Abbott said he was disappointed with the response to a request that was “self-evidently sensible”. The prime minister added: “We’ll be carefully looking at the decision and deciding what's best now.”Richard Colbeck, the parliamentary secretary to the agriculture minister, who has posted dozens of photographs which he claims show the degraded nature of the 74,000ha area, said the decision would cost jobs.“There’s no questions that livelihoods will be damaged, businesses will be lost as a result of this,” he said. “The people in the high-value end of the forest sector, the wooden boat builders, the furniture makers, they will lose access to their resource.“It’s a matter of having sensible access to a resource. This extension is basically a Labor-Greens move which will damage the forest industry. The whole listing in 2013 by [former environment minister] Tony Burke and the Greens was an ideological one aimed to destroy the forestry industry.”Colbeck said the government “will look at the decision further from here” but added “I don’t think community values would accept logging in wilderness World Heritage areas. We’re not saying we’ll go back to them.”Colbeck said the rebuke by Portugal was “unfortunate language” and rebuffed suggestions that he was embarrassed by the World Heritage snub or that he should stand down following a vociferous campaign which saw him send photographs of disturbed forest to the embassies of countries represented on the World Heritage Committee.The Coalition argues that the 74,000ha, part of a 170,000ha World Heritage boundary extension announced by the previous Labor government, contains areas which have previously been heavily logged. It applied for the boundary to be changed, claiming that loggers should have access to the resource.However, the move was staunchly opposed by those involved in the peace process which ended the lengthy dispute over the use of Tasmanian native forests. The Forest Industries Association of Tasmania, a peak body for loggers in the state, wrote to the World Heritage Committee to oppose the reduction in protected area.An IUCN analysis, which helped inform the World Heritage Committee’s decision, found that 85% of the 74,000ha area was pristine forest, with just 4% being heavily disturbed by roads, logging and other infrastructure."Tony Abbott lied about the forests being degraded,” said Bob Brown, the former Greens leader. “That lie has been rejected at international level. It is a diplomatic fiasco for the prime minister and Australia."This is the lowest point in the history of Australian environmental diplomacy. Abbott's failed mission has sullied the nation's great history of upholding the World Heritage Convention over the last four decades.”Mark Butler, Labor’s environment spokesman, said: “Tony Abbott has been telling Australians the area is not worthy of World Heritage status. This is disingenuous, at best.“The government’s own departmental advice doesn’t even back up this claim. This caps off months of national and international rejection of Tony Abbott's anti-environment agenda.”The Unesco annual meeting in Doha has been a bruising one for the Coalition, following a world heritage committee warning that the Great Barrier Reef may be listed as “in danger” next year.The committee expressed concern over a plan to dump 5m tonnes of sediment within the reef’s marine park and questioned the Coalition’s plan to devolve oversight of the coral ecosystem to the Queensland government.
