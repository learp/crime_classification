I was born and raised in the coastal area of northern California known as West Marin, about an hour from San Francisco. My parents didn’t own a house when we were young, so we moved a lot from town to town. When I was about six or seven, we lived in a little wooden house with a red front porch that had a few fruit trees in the front yard and unruly blackberry bushes in the back. At the tail end of winter, sweet violets and four-leafed clovers would spring up in the grass. It was a very magical place.One summer, my mother planted a raspberry patch out back and the girl who lived next door snuck into the garden and pilfered the one handful of berries the plants managed to produce. Mom was so mad she couldn’t speak for the first half of breakfast, but then we all just had to laugh about it.Raspberries were always prized in our home. We mostly ate them fresh from a pretty bowl or pureed and poured over just about everything from oatmeal to scones to chocolate cake.When I first became a pastry chef, ice-creams and sorbets were my favourite things to make, because they capture the season probably better than anything else. I like my sorbets simple: just frozen pureed fruit and a little sugar with a tweak of seasoning. Making infused sugar syrups to flavour the fruit can give you many options. Here, I have steeped lemon verbena leaves into the syrup, but you can try mint, bay, geranium, a cinnamon stick and so on Another thing I learned in restaurant kitchens was to coat berries in a little of their own puree. It sweetens them a little, or adds acidity if they are lacking. It also makes them shimmer in the nicest way.Raspberry lemon verbena sorbetServes 6300g caster sugar100ml water20-30 fresh lemon verbena leaves (or 15 dried)900g raspberries (about 750g after pureeing and straining)1 First, make a sugar syrup to flavour the sorbet. In a small saucepan, heat the water and 250g of the caster sugar over a medium heat, stirring occasionally until dissolved. Turn off the heat, drop in the verbena leaves and cover with a lid for at least two hours, or up to a day.2 Puree the raspberries with the remaining 50g caster sugar, then strain into a large bowl to remove all the seeds. Use a spoon or rubber spatula to stir in the verbena syrup. Taste. This is the one time you want something to taste a little too sweet, because this sweetness will fade when frozen. If it is still too tart, add a teaspoon of sugar until you like it.3 Pour the mixture into an ice-cream freezer and churn. If you don’t have one, you could make granita instead, by putting the mixture into a shallow container in your freezer and whisking every 30 minutes until you have a beautiful, slushy granita.Raspberry-buckwheat crepes with mascarpone creamServes 6For the crepes100g plain flour75g buckwheat flour½ tsp fine salt1 tsp caster sugar3 eggs1 tbsp olive oil500ml semi-skimmed milk25g unsalted butter, melted and cooledFor the filling100g unsalted butter, soft50g raspberry jamFor the cream200g mascarpone200g creme fraiche1 tbsp icing sugarFor the raspberries500g raspberries2 tsp caster sugar, plus extra for sprinklingFramboise liqueur (optional)1 In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flours, salt and sugar. Make a well in the middle and crack in one egg. Whisk to a paste, then add the remaining eggs. Whisk well before adding the oil and milk. Whisk 2 tbsp of this mixture into your melted butter to temper it, then whisk that mixture back into the large bowl. This avoids creating tiny lumps of solidified butter that will mess up your otherwise silky batter. Rest, covered, for at least two hours and up to two days.2 To fry the crepes, wipe a skillet, nonstick or heavy cast-iron frying pan with an oil-soaked sheet of kitchen towel to coat the pan. I have French crepe pans, which I recommend, because the pan is the size of the crepe and you get perfect round shapes every time. I also use a 30ml ladle to get the perfect amount of batter into the pan, but you could use around 2 tbsp instead. Fry each crepe for 1-2 minutes on one side and just a few seconds on the other. When they are cooked, you can stack them neatly on a plate next to the stove to pull apart and use later. You should get about 18-20 good crepes (after losing two or three).3 Next, make the raspberry butter filling. Whip the ingredients together with a wooden spoon or in a mixer. This can be made in advance, but keep it at room temperature, so the butter stays spreadable. When ready to assemble, spread each crepe with about 1 tsp butter, loosely fold the crepes in half and then into quadrants. Place each crepe slightly overlapping on to a paper-lined baking tray. Once you have finished buttering and folding all the crepes, wrap the entire tray in clingfilm until 10 minutes before it is time to serve.4 For the cream, whip up all the ingredients and keep covered and in the fridge until ready to serve.5 Puree 200g of the raspberries and strain them well to remove the seeds. Stir in the sugar and framboise, if using. Taste and adjust with a touch more sugar or liqueur, if necessary. Set aside.6 Heat your oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Sprinkle about 1 tbsp caster sugar over the folded and filled crepes, then bake them for 10 minutes in the oven.7 Toss the remaining raspberries gently in the puree and remove the cream from the fridge. Using a spatula, carefully place 3 crepes on each plate. Using two dessert spoons, put a dollop of cream in the middle, then finish off with the coated raspberries.Claire Ptak is an author and food stylist and owns Violet Bakery in London.
