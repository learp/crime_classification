Logan actor Patrick Stewart says that he plans to apply for US citizenship to “fight” President Donald Trump and his administration.Speaking on The View, Stewart said that his citizenship application “might be the only good thing as the result of this election”. Asked why, he said: “Because I want to be an American, too. All of my friends in Washington said: ‘There is one thing you can do. Fight, fight; oppose, oppose.’ But I can’t do it because I’m not a citizen.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Stewart was elaborating on a tweet he had posted on 10 February, which had said: “Had the worst sleep of my life last night. But I was sleeping less than 300 yards from where Donald Trump sleeps. Could there be a connection?” He explained that he had been visiting Washington to seek advice from “insiders” as to what to do in the wake of Trump’s election victory.Stewart was born in 1940 in the West Yorkshire town of Mirfield, and lives in Brooklyn, New York, with his wife, Sunny Ozell.
