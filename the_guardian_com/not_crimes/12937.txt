Guardian contributor MalcolmthePublisher 25 March 2016 1:10pmI always think that more people should know about Alan Furst, whose thrillers based in Europe in the late 1930s and very early 1940s I've been publishing for over 20 years.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.09pm GMT13:09The editor should improve the work and then step backSaorsa also asked:It seems to me that editors, like translators, often have a critical influence on the final shape of a work, and yet tend to remain in the shadows, hidden from public view and public appreciation. Can you say anything about your experience of this?  Guardian contributor MalcolmthePublisher 25 March 2016 1:06pmI think that's the territory. Your job is to improve, if possible, the author's work, and then step back.Updatedat 1.19pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.08pm GMT13:08samjordison also asked:Are there any other editors you have particularly admired... or indeed envied?

Guardian contributor MalcolmthePublisher 25 March 2016 12:59pmAs far as I know he never went on the internet in his entire life, though he said he relished it for the unlimited possibilities it promised. But I stopped being his editor in 1997, which was still the internet Stone Age.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.03pm GMT13:03Curt Phillips asked:1) To what degree (if any) do you think that classic science fiction – which for this question I’ll loosely define as “published prior to about 1960” – is influential to the leading British SF writers working today?2) The current world situation would seem to make many of J. G. Ballard’s writings from decades ago seem unusually prescient. If Ballard were alive today, what do you think he might make of the world we are living through today, and how do you imagine he might further envision the future that awaits us?  Guardian contributor MalcolmthePublisher 25 March 2016 12:56pmHi Curt1) I think most British sf writers are aware of classic sf, and whether or not it's an influence, it's part of their writerly DNA. Some, like Stephen Baxter, go further -- he is a Wells and Stapledon scholar. And I've yet to find a book that China Mieville hasn't read.2) Ballard wrote in this autobiography: "The United States is now fast becoming a theocratic state run by right-wing political fanatics and religious moralisers". That was obviously completely wrong! I wish he was around to give his views on the current state of Europe.Updatedat 1.04pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.01pm GMT13:01MythicalMagpie also asked:Is there one that got away, a book you wonder if you should have published but didn’t?  Guardian contributor MalcolmthePublisher 25 March 2016 12:49pmI'm sure there are lots, but at this precise moment I can't think what they are! I have certainly turned down my share of novels which went on to be hugely successful, but I don't actually regret any of those. I always say to editors that if you truly believe in a writer's talent you should think very carefully before turning them down.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.00pm GMT13:00Wordnumb asked:What did you think of the fairly recent collection of Ballard interviews edited by Simon Sellars, Extreme Metaphors? And I grew up reading Ballard, Burroughs, PKD, Lem – authors writing ideas you wouldn’t find elsewhere. Am I right in thinking that there are fewer novel ideas being published as fiction currently / recently? If I’m not right, would you be able to recommend anything?  Guardian contributor MalcolmthePublisher 25 March 2016 12:45pmI think EXTREME METAPHORS is very much a book for the diehard Ballard fan. There is a lot of repetition in it. Jim definitely liked to formulate and polish his opinions on most subjects, and once he was satisfied with them, he would produce them verbatim.I'm probably the worst person to ask for recommendations, as currently I mostly reread books we're thinking of reprinting. The Finnish author Hannu Rajaniemi has ideas so clever they make my brain hurt.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.55pm GMT12:55Ballard read virtually no fictionhemingway62 asked:How do you think Ballard saw himself against his contemporaries and which of his books was he most happy with?  Guardian contributor MalcolmthePublisher 25 March 2016 12:41pmThe thing is, Jim read virtually no fiction. In the roughly fifteen years I worked with him, I believe the only novel he read was THE WASP FACTORY, which he enjoyed. Latterly, he may have read some of Will Self’s work – he certainly says in his autobiography that he had – but I wouldn’t bet on it. One of his most polished anecdotes, which I heard him recount a few times, described the satisfying noise a copy of MIDNIGHT’S CHILDREN (sent to him by the publisher) made as it hit the bottom of his dustbin.I think he thought that CRASH was the novel which most completely succeeded in what he set out to do, but that may be projection as that’s what I think. He didn’t really talk about his work much.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.53pm GMT12:53philipphilip99 asked:What’s the biggest disagreement/argument you’ve had with a writer over a small thing - such as the placement of a comma? Have you ever suggested a major change expecting a battle but then been surprised by the writer’s immediate agreement?  Guardian contributor MalcolmthePublisher 25 March 2016 12:39pmI wouldn’t say ‘disagreement’, but I have certainly had extended discussions with at least one writer about the placement of a single comma.On the other hand, I once phoned a writer, who was way behind his deadline, with some trepidation on a Saturday afternoon, to suggest that he take the novel he was struggling to finish and split it in two; and he virtually tore my hand off in his haste to agree.But as I’ve said, an editor has to remember that it’s the author’s book. It's a poor editor who tries to intrude their personality into the equation.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.51pm GMT12:51BMacLean asked:Was Ballard aware of PKD’s work? Did he ever express his views on it? Did PKD have anything to say about Ballard? They both used a flat, deadpan tone (though their styles were in other respects quite different) that contrasted effectively with the strange ideas and characters they described in their books. Was this a conscious decision, or just the only way they knew how to write?  Guardian contributor MalcolmthePublisher 25 March 2016 12:37pmBallard will certainly have been aware of PKD (in the mid 1960s Jonathan Cape published two Dick novels – THE THREE STIGMATA OF PALMER ELDRITCH and THE PENULTIMATE TRUTH – at roughly the same time as they were publishing THE DROUGHT and THE CRYSTAL WORLD. But I’m as sure as I can be that he never read any of his novels (he may have read a short story or two). He’ll have approved in theory of at least some of Dick’s work. I can’t recall anything PKD said or wrote about Ballard.I think they both have very personal and distinctive styles, which they may have refined as their careers (and lives) continued, but I think both had their 'voice' almost from the outset.Updatedat 12.52pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.48pm GMT12:48MisterX777 asked:Did JG Ballard require many drafts of his novels, or were they almost perfectly formed from the start? What editorial revision or support did he require? I have not yet seen the movie High Rise, but would it equate to JG Ballard’s vision, or to what you might have hoped from the movie? JG Ballard’s experiences as a child let him see how fragile was the thin veneer of civilisation, and how, once that was stripped back, there was barely scaffolding in place. Do you think his novels were his attempts to process the devolution of a society, or as others have asked, were his writings somewhat misanthropic or pessimistic about the limits of virtue in human nature?  Guardian contributor MalcolmthePublisher 25 March 2016 12:32pmHe certainly did revise and polish a lot before being satisfied enough with a novel to submit it for publication. (Until very late on, he never sold a novel to a publisher until it was finished.) So every typescript I ever read of his had an almost perfect surface. I gather that CRASH was fairly extensively cut, and a much longer draft is in the British Library’s collection, but I’m not sure at what point in the publication process that happened. He knew what he wanted to say, and by the time he was ready for anyone else (I guess apart from Claire Walsh) to see it, he was pretty satisfied with it. That said, he was always eager to receive suggestions for micro-improvements from his editor (there’s a distinction often drawn in publishing these days between structural editing, line editing and copy editing – with a writer as polished and self-aware as Jim, they blended into a single process). There is one sentence in EMPIRE OF THE SUN which I can proudly say is mine, but that’s about the extent of it.I think he’d mostly have loved the film of HIGH RISE. It’s a long time since I read the novel, but my impression was that it was quite faithful to the spirit of the novel. My only problem with the film is that the events seemed quite unconnected – the narrative thread of the novel wasn’t there.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.46pm GMT12:46Ben Holloway asked:There are several times in Ballard’s career where he wrote “trilogies” of novels, which weren’t trilogies in the normal sense, but in the sense of being almost identical in plot, archetypes and themes. This strikes me as almost obsessive, as if Ballard was using writing as a way of trying to understand something – and when he didn’t quite get it the first time he wrote the same thing again, going over the same ground again, trying to understand something just beyond his reach. I guess my questions are firstly, do you think this is an accurate view? And if so, what fundamental truths do you think he was trying to grasp?  Guardian contributor MalcolmthePublisher 25 March 2016 12:31pmI don’t think that’s quite right. I think that with certain of his ideas he thought there was enough to explore that he had two or three different approaches from alternative directions. So, for example, he explored many of his ideas about the modern media landscape and our obsession with celebrity in THE ATROCITY EXHIBITION. Then (as he describes in MEMORIES OF LIFE) he decided to go all out in CRASH. Then CONCRETE ISLAND was an idea which (I suspect) came up when he was writing CRASH.But I don’t think you need the qualifier ‘almost’ to describe his obsessiveness!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.40pm GMT12:40Snoring also asked:Could you talk about what it was like to work with Philip K Dick, please? I read that he would speed write novels over a weekend in binge sessions at his typewriter. Was he interested in honing his prose and structure or did he just want to get the ideas out? Many if his books seem poorly written but that helps to make them so odd.  Guardian contributor MalcolmthePublisher 25 March 2016 12:30pmI think his days of amphetamine-fuelled binge writing were over by the time I had my first contact with him as a publisher, which was over A SCANNER DARKLY. And as the British publisher, we basically left the editing to the Americans. (This is something which has changed a lot in recent years, but before the internet, and before cheap telephone calls, the Atlantic was very wide.) I never met him, sadly, though I had a few phone conversations in 1978/79. I had persuaded a consortium of his British publishers to come up with the money to fund a visit, but sadly it never came to anything. I find his – shall we say? – convoluted sentence structure part of his novels’ distinctive charm. You can recognize his work from a single paragraph, the one main characteristic he shares with Ballard. But I can see how some readers would find it off-putting.I do know that A SCANNER DARKLY and THE TRANSMIGRATION OF TIMOTHY ARCHER – the two new novels I was involved with publishing – were quite extensively revised and rewritten, which I think shows.   Snoring 25 March 2016 12:46pmThanks for the reply. A Scanner Darkly and Transmigration of Timothy Archer are two of my favourites. I also found VALIS fascinating and bewildering- it appears to me that it was compulsively reworked and reworked and clearly meant a lot to him. I tried dipping into the compendium of his 'Exegesis' that was published a few years ago - it's too daunting to take in one go, but to me it reads as a primary source to VALIS as he was obsessively trying to work through what he had experienced.  Guardian contributor MalcolmthePublisher 25 March 2016 1:19pmVALIS divides the readership down the middle -- those who think it's his masterpiece, and those who think it confirms that he'd gone off the rails. I'm afraid I'm in the latter camp. My main correspondence with him was before I got a job in publishing, and he wrote me a succession of long and (to me) frankly loopy letters, some of which are included in the EXEGESIS. When he said that as she was dying his cat turned into the Lamb of God I didn't know what to say...Updatedat 1.21pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
