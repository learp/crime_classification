Avry Zaltana is the last healer in the fifteen realms; she has been hunted, killed… which she survived. She needs to prevent her nemesis King Tohon from winning control of the Realms with his mighty army, more terrifying than Avry’s death experience: an army of undead soldiers.The book sucks you back into the fifteen realms, continuing from the previous book, Touch Of Power; it is also brilliant because if you had forgotten some of the action or the details previously Snyder fills us in, but it’s not over-done. In Scent Of Magic all the characters have matured lots; the relationship between Kerrick and Avry was more intense and real. When some of the group slip off we are given some different points of view; the chapters alternated between characters which is mainly done on cliffhangers which was amazing and gripping! The plot was full of twists and turns which were very enjoyable especially for more of the playful jokes between the main characters, (Flea, Belen, Kerrick, Avry, etc). Even though Avry’s character has developed significantly, she is still determined and brave; you would think that after dying and endless battles Avry would be moody and have grown a bit foul from the evil she has faced, however she was still patient and helpful and pretty much up for anything, which was refreshing. If you didn’t think that Touch Of Power was enjoyable, read this and the next instalment because you’ll be eating your words! I am in absolute awe of this series!
