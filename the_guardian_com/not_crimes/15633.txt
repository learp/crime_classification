The author of Trainspotting, Irvine Welsh, is adapting his novel Crime for television. The story of a cocaine-using, alcoholic Edinburgh detective who runs into trouble when he goes on holiday to Florida is widely regarded as Welsh’s best since Trainspotting.Danny Boyle confirms Trainspotting sequel at Telluride film festival Having had his world turned upside down by a child abuse case in his native city, DI Ray Lennox runs into a paedophile ring protected by corrupt police almost as soon as he arrives in Miami.“The story is one of a classic journey from darkness into light, and despite the troubling subject matter, I think an uplifting one,” Welsh said as the series was launched on Sunday at Mipcom, the world’s biggest entertainment market, which has been taking place in Cannes on the French Riviera.The Scottish actor Dougray Scott, who was in Mission Impossible and Taken, has been signed to play Lennox. Producer Tony Wood said the drama was “Welsh’s toughest yet most life-affirming to date”. He said the series would be shot mostly in Florida, intercut with flashbacks to the previous child abuse case Lennox investigated in Edinburgh that would highlight the “stark contrast between the glistening paradise of the sunshine state and Welsh’s beloved sordid, infernal home city”.Wood, head of Buccaneer Media, which made the crime drama Marcela for Netflix, said Welsh is “a true literary buccaneer whose work defines our generation. It’s thrilling to be bringing talent of this calibre to television drama.” He said Welsh was writing the series’ six hour-long episodes with his long-standing screenwriting partner, Dean Cavanagh.
