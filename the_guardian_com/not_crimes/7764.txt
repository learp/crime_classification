I love my garden. My mum lives in London and has a 3ft x 6ft balcony, but since my fiancee Vicky and I moved here, I’ve got so much space to sculpt and design, to create. It’s doing something to me: it’s making me really calm and happy.I used to be in the boy band 5ive. There were so many parties, people wanting your attention – it was full on. I wasn’t prepared for it first time round. My coping mechanism was to get out of it by drinking and taking drugs. Now, after half a glass of wine, I have to go to bed.Gardening grounds you. When you’re in that moment you’re not thinking about anything else, just doing. This natural stuff is what helps us thrive; everyone should do it.Vicky is a lot more practical than me. She grows the edibles and I do the landscaping: planting flowers and making the garden look pretty so that it uplifts the soul. Vicky’s like a scientist, putting the seeds on damp tissues to see them germinate, whereas I just chuck them where I want them – it’s random. The greenhouse is Vicky’s domain. Every time I get near it I can see her thinking, “Keep your hands off my carrots.”I’m growing black-eyed susans, lupins, poppies, verbena and lots of sunflowers. We’ve got white and blackcurrants, blackberries, gooseberries and plans for lots more in the field. I just found out we’ve got rhododendrons; we’d been calling them “fairy skirts” because the flowers look like a skirt a fairy would wear.Me and my garden: ‘We planted a rose garden with our daughter’s ashes’ I love getting my hands dirty, and I’ve developed a bit of a fetish for working with stone. I spent ages digging out a fire pit and moving stone, but then it rained so much that it flooded, so I thought OK, it wants to be a pond – I’ll go with that. It can be a little Zen pond for me and the ducks.One thing I don’t get is slugs. I know they have a purpose, but what is it? Slugs, you are thugs, but you take a risk if you come here: we’ve got khaki campbell ducks and you’re gonna get chewed up.Everywhere I look, I see potential. I swear the sun comes out whenever we’re in the garden. It can be gloomy everywhere else but it feels like we’re in this little sunspot.My favourite spot Sitting by my Zen pond, either looking up at the stars or down at the reflection of the sky in the water.• How does your garden grow?
