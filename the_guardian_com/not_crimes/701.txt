Here in the UK we are all too familiar with rain, and this winter we seem to be having more than our fair share. In recent weeks it has been frontal rain – formed where cold air meets warm tropical air – that has repeatedly flooded northern areas. Its process of formation is well understood.Other kinds of rain are less straightforward. In particular, the sudden downpours that spring from innocent looking fluffy cumulus clouds don’t seem to obey the laws of physics. Inside a typical cumulus cloud the average droplets are about 20 micrometres wide. But to become raindrops that can fall to the ground they need to grow to about 2mm – which equates to a millionfold increase in volume.Hence the chances of ordinary droplets bumping into each other and growing to this size are slim: the average droplet inside a typical cumulus cloud can easily float around for one hour before colliding with another one.Yet observations show that intense rain showers can develop in the space of about 20 minutes. How on earth does it happen? Michael Wilkinson, a physicist at the Open University, in Milton Keynes, has used “large deviation theory” – a way of looking at extremely rare events – to understand the process.His results, published recently in Physical Review Letters, suggest that raindrop growth is driven by a handful of “lucky drops” which grow much faster than the others and then initiate the growth of other drops.Down below, the inevitable deluge created by these lucky drops often feels decidedly unlucky.
