City in the Sky 9pm, BBC2Nervous flyers will welcome the end of this three-part series, an engaging barrage of statistics and cool – if vaguely terrifying – airline facts. A million people are airborne at any one time (hence the “city” of the title), all of which makes one appreciate the industry’s high standards. Tonight Dallas Campbell and Dr Hannah Fry take a look at landing, with Dallas experiencing an approach to Bhutan’s Paro airport – a radarless slalom that only 26 pilots are qualified to attempt. John RobinsonEscape to the Chateau 7pm, Channel 4It’s au revoir to the French fantasy as Dick and Angel make final preparations for their wedding at the chateau. With 200 guests due to turn up, it will take more than Dick’s eco-friendly sewage system to impress them. Meanwhile, with only two weeks to go, Angel is putting her unique stamp on the interior decor. Property porn with enough va-va-voom to make you start browsing for a chateau of your own. Hannah Verdier Top Gear 8pm, BBC2Viewing figures for the regenerated ’Gear may have a slow puncture, but the perennial premise might just keep remaining bums strapped to their seats. Chris, Matt and Sabine thumb through classifieds to procure pre-owned jalopies for a joyride to Venice, presumably laden with a laboured bantz-quota somewhat lighter than the show’s previous custodians. Meanwhile, this week’s Stars In A Rallycross Car are BBC brainsmith Brian Cox and alfresco enthusiast Bear Grylls. Mark Gibbings-JonesPenelope Keith At Her Majesty’s Service 8pm, Channel 4Continuing her jolly excursions around the Queen’s official residences, the actor heads for Hillsborough Castle, Northern Ireland. There, she meets those responsible for turning down the beds when a wandering Windsor calls. There’s a scrapbook of menus that dates back to 1925, a meeting with the Queen’s bugler and, in a reminder of the Troubles, the tale of how a royal road crossing in 2012 helped unify communities in Enniskillen. Jonathan WrightSchönbrunn Summer Night Concert From Vienna10pm, BBC4Katie Derham introduces the annual performance by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra from the grounds of the Schönbrunn Palace, the vast baroque ornament that plays host to an event that now attracts crowds in excess of 100,000 each summer.

Andrew MuellerThe Challenge: My Ironman Dad7.30pm, DiscoveryA few years ago, Alex Smith was your regular, wine-guzzling couch potato. However, when he discovered his son Harrison was suffering from Duchenne, a particularly cruel form of muscular dystrophy, he gave up his work and set up a charity to fight the disease. He also resolved to complete a triathlon, with his son in tow on every leg. We follow his progress and his family’s moving efforts to lead a “different normal” life. David StubbsParks and Recreation 11pm, DaveIt has been neglected by UK broadcasters in the past, but the show that launched the careers of Chris Pratt and Aziz Ansari and cemented Amy Poehler’s place in the US comedy firmament is finally getting a consistent airing via Dave’s weekly double bills. As season six continues, Ann and Chris are leaving Pawnee, but not before Leslie insists on throwing them a party. In the second episode we see her attempt to put a positive spin on the Eagleton-Pawnee merger. Hannah J DaviesFilm choice      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Masterly supernatural thriller … Don’t Look Now. Photograph: Moviestore Collection/REXDon’t Look Now(Nicolas Roeg, 1973), Sunday, 10.40pm, Horror ChannelGrief, guilt and a nasty serial killer inhabit out-of-season Venice in Roeg’s masterly supernatural thriller. Based on a short story by Daphne du Maurier, it has Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie as a couple resting in the labyrinthine city after the accidental drowning of their daughter. They meet two old ladies, one a blind medium who foresees danger, towards which the sceptical Sutherland runs. Fragmented visual clues – splashes of red, a funeral procession, a cry in the night – meld into an awful sense of impending doom: a chronicle of a death foretold. Paul HowlettAugust: Osage County(John Wells, 2013), 9pm, Channel 4An A-list Hollywood ensemble gathers at the home of Meryl Streep’s bitter, newly widowed Oklahoma matriarch Violet Weston for this somewhat dour screening of Tracy Letts’s play – and director John Wells pretty much lets them get on with it. Among the family chewing over Letts’s ripe dialogue, Julia Roberts excels as daughter Barbara, terrified of ending up like mum. PHThe English Patient(Anthony Minghella, 1996), 10.35pm, ITV3This stunning romantic epic was adapted from Michael Ondaatje’s novel and sees Ralph Fiennes’ cerebral count Almasy drawn into a passionate wartime affair with newlywed Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas) in north Africa. Minghella won best picture and best director Oscars, and Juliette Binoche won best supporting actress, as the nurse who cares for the stricken Almasy. PHIntruders(Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, 2011), 12.30am, Channel 4A creepy story in which a boy in Spain and a girl in London are haunted by a hooded figure. The strands develop in parallel, the girl and mother seeking help from a priest, the boy and father (Clive Owen) contacting a psychotherapist. There’s an eerie atmosphere, although it lacks the dark brilliance of Fresnadillo’s debut, Intacto.
