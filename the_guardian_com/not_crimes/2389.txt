When I was 15 years old, in September 2004, I went to Sunday mass at my local church in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, with my mother as I usually did. During the service a bat started flying around the church and members of the congregation began flapping at it. An usher eventually hit it with a prayer book and it fell to the floor. I could see it was only stunned, so, being an animal lover, I asked my mum if I could take it outside. I picked it up by its wings and it began screeching, so I hurried out. As I went to throw it into a bush it sank its fangs into my left finger and I felt a sharp pain. When we got home my mother dressed the wound.My dad wasn’t pleased, but no one thought anything more about it. Three weeks later I noticed my left finger felt a bit numb, with some tingling, too. Within a couple of days I felt tired and nauseous. We thought I had flu. About 24 hours later I had double vision and my family took me to hospital. By the time I got there I was semi-delirious and vomiting. I was asked to stand on one leg, but I couldn’t keep my balance. They began tests but couldn’t find anything.Then we mentioned the bat bite. I was taken to the children’s hospital, where rabies was diagnosed. At that point my memory is virtually blank. I later learned that I began producing masses of saliva and my arm started jerking. My parents were told I had hours to live.No one had ever survived rabies without a vaccination, but Dr Rodney Willoughby, a paediatrician and infectious disease specialist at the hospital, decided he had to do something. He consulted various books and used his experience to come up with an impromptu treatment. He made it clear he had no idea whether it would work and that there might be many other complications as a result, but my parents agreed to give it a go.I was put into a coma to isolate my brain and allow my immune system to fight the virus. I was also given ketamine to protect my brain, another drug to reduce its side effects and two antiviral medicines.A week later they slowly brought me out of the coma. I was too weak to open my eyes but when Dr Willoughby held my eyelids open and told me to look over at my mum, I did. Mum was elated because it showed that I was still “in there”. I had become the first known person ever to survive rabies without a vaccination; the treatment became known as the Milwaukee protocol.I spent 11 weeks in hospital, where I had to take 17 pills a day to help my recovery. I felt lucky to be alive but I was frustrated, isolated and desperate to go home. The whole left side of my body was affected, I had balance issues and my speech was badly impaired. Rehabilitation took months. It was so slow to begin with that I despaired that I’d never recover.Experience: I inject myself with snake venom Over a decade on, every day is another day of therapy for me; my speech is still slightly affected and I have to maintain physical exercises because even now one side of my body reacts more slowly than the other. Otherwise I am healthy. I became a kennel assistant, and I’m ambassador for the Global Alliance for Rabies Control. I found it hard to think about what happened initially because I had come so close to death but now I give talks about the disease to raise awareness.Dr Willoughby is now a family friend and I invited him to my wedding two years ago. He says that the day I looked over at my mum from my bed was one of the happiest of his life.Oddly, I had another brush with rabies two years ago. I keep huskies, and I went out to feed them one morning and found a dead bat in their cage. I had it tested and it proved positive for rabies; the dogs had to be vaccinated. Less than 1% of bats are rabid, so it was really disturbing. But I don’t have a problem with bats. I even go to bat festivals where there are educational talks and presentations.I feel so grateful for my survival and the life I’ve had since the bite. I don’t take anything for granted. Four months ago, when I gave birth to twins, it felt like a triumph.• As told to Mike Pattenden.Do you have an experience to share?
