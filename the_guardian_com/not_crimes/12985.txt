Thetford Forest runs for at least 15 miles from the Norfolk village of Munford to Suffolk's River Lark and must be one of the largest timber plantations in southern England. You can walk and walk and experience nothing but conifer block after block, made more monotonous by the gentle tilt of the ground and the confusing rectilinear grid of firebreaks. Yet in this place of sameness we came upon an extraordinarily particularised moment.With its straddle of wooden buildings and the pleasing muddle of its garden, the dwelling called Shaker's Lodge seemed an unexpected fragment of human wilderness hidden among all this marching and militarised nature. And there on the shingle path by its gate was a small puddle to which hundreds of bright birds poured down like fallen blossom.They were finches come to drink and dominated by bramblings, cold-weather migrants that arrive from boreal Scandinavia. The male's breast is suffused with the exact orange of the winter sun at dusk. His back is a complex interlacing of dark and light shades ("brambling" is thought to derive from "brandling", an old word for various animals with this pattern). He has the distinction in spring of a solidly black head that is acquired by the gradual rubbing away of frosted white tips to each feather. Come April he is a magnificent two-tone beauty and I know people for whom it is a favourite bird.Yet the song is one of those rudimentary non-songs, a weird aspirant monosyllable, a brief rattle of metal or the rubbing together of something hard. Here, each song from a hundred birds overlapped with its neighbour's until it seemed, as my companion so aptly put it, as if the whole wood were wheezing. Then there were the nasal chattering sounds of redpolls, the rubbery fizz of siskins and the precise soft chip call of crossbill. They formed a glorious cacophony of mechanical notes, a dry music from which all possible moisture had been squeezed and a unique spring chorus played out on winter's instruments.
