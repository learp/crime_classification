Former Crimewatch presenter Rav Wilding is suing the production company behind ITV’s Splash!, saying an injury he suffered while training for the diving show has derailed his career.The ex-Strictly Come Dancing contestant said he had to cancel his wedding and has now put his home on the market because of the accident, which occurred in pre-show training in 2013.Wilding underwent surgery after snapping the hamstring tendons in his left leg during a somersault dive on the third session of training for the now defunct ITV show.The ex-soldier and policeman was discharged from hospital on Christmas Eve but readmitted on New Year’s Day 2014 after suffering from a pulmonary embolism at home.His injuries meant he did not appear on the diving show, which was made by production company Twofour.Legal firm Irwin Mitchell said Wilding now has one leg shorter than the other and cannot walk or stand without pain.He needs a lift in his shoe to walk properly and has been told he will never be able to run or play rugby again.Wilding called the injury an “absolute nightmare” which has “completely changed my life”.He added: “It breaks my heart that Jill (Morgan) and I had to cancel our wedding.”He said of his TV work: “I have been in a few things here and there, but the active physical work is no longer possible.“I used to play rugby every week, go running, and, having been in the army and a police officer in the past, my fitness was pretty high.“I used to get active jobs based on my fitness, but now I can’t do those things, the opportunities aren’t really there any more, so it’s changed the entire course of my career.”He said: “I’m still in pain every day. It has turned my world upside down.”Lauren Hurney, a serious injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: “Sadly Rav appears to have been let down during his training for Splash!.“He has been left with a life-changing injury which has already had a profound effect on his career, relationship and finances. We have written to Twofour and are currently awaiting a response.”Wilding left Crimewatch after seven years on the BBC1 show in 2011 and took part in the 2009 series of Strictly Come Dancing.He previously had a relationship with ex-Big Brother star Chantelle Houghton.Twofour has been contacted for comment.
