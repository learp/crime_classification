A cargo ship that has already spilled hundreds of tonnes of oil stayed perched on a New Zealand reef on Thursday while salvage crews debated whether the remaining fuel could be pumped from the vessel before it broke up.Environmentalists have warned of a disaster for wildlife if all the ship's 1,700 tonnes of oil and 200 tonnes of diesel is allowed to spill into the ocean.Rescue crews have to stabilise the ship, which is slowly being battered to pieces by pounding waves, before any transfer of oil can start – but its severe structural damage is making the task harder.Meanwhile, several of the 88 containers that have fallen off its deck had washed ashore by Thursday, and authorities confirmed one container that toppled overboard contained a hazardous substance. However, an official said it should not pose a major threat.Heavy seas had kept salvage crews away from the 236-metre vessel for days, but a break in the weather allowed three team members to be winched aboard the Liberian-flagged Rena, which ran aground on 5 October on Astrolabe reef, 14 miles from Tauranga harbour on New Zealand's North Island.Ewart Barnsley, spokesman for Maritime New Zealand (MNZ) which is managing the emergency response, said the salvage crew found oil hoses and pumps for transferring fuel largely undamaged aboard the ship. They also concluded that the ship was safe to work from.Barnsley said a barge was moored nearby to receive oil, but a decision on when that transfer might start would not be made before Friday.The MNZ salvage manager, Bruce Anderson, said the vessel had apparently stopped moving, which was necessary before the oil could be pumped out. "While this is good news, we shouldn't get too excited," he said. "We already had a complex project to start with. It's even harder now that we've sustained damage aboard this vessel."His comment referred to a vertical structural crack in the ship running around the entire vessel.This crack means the ship is now only held together by its internal components, according to Steve Jones of MNZ."The reality is the vessel could break up at any point," he said.Six vessels have been mobilised to intercept the drifting containers and other debris in the water.There were 1,368 containers on board, 11 of which contained hazardous substances. One of the hazardous containers is among those that have fallen overboard, Jones said.Nick Bohm of MNZ said the container held alkyl sulphonic acid, which can be harmful but becomes less toxic when diluted with water. The whereabouts of that container is unknown.Some of the contents of containers that had washed ashore were strewn across the coastline on Thursday, including thousands of meat patties.The ship's 44-year-old Filipino captain was charged on Wednesday with operating a vessel in a manner causing unnecessary danger or risk and released on bail.The ship's second officer appeared in the same court in Tauranga on Thursday on the same charge.Judge Robert Wolff ordered that the defendants' names be suppressed to protect their personal safety.If convicted, each could face a fine of up to NZ$10,000 (£5,000) and a year in prison. Their next court appearance will be on 19 October, when more charges are likely.The government has demanded to know why the ship crashed into the well-charted reef in calm weather but Costamare, the Greek company that owns the vessel, has given no explanation.Costamare released a statement apologising for the incident and said it was investigating."Our captain is an experienced master and has an exemplary record," Diamantis Manos, Costamare's managing director, said. "The ship was fully certified and had recently been inspected … They found no problems."Obviously something went very wrong and we will co-operate with the transport accident investigation commission of New Zealand to find the answer."MNZ estimates that at least 350 tonnes of heavy fuel oil has spilled from the hull, leading New Zealand's environment minister, Nick Smith, to call it the country's biggest maritime environmental disaster.Oil has washed up on pristine beaches near Tauranga and hundreds of oiled birds have been found dead.Another 51 birds were being cleaned at a wildlife emergency centre, along with three seals.Several miles of coastline had been closed to the public and some beaches were beginning to experience severe oiling, Jones said. "I was down there this morning," he said. "It was just black coming in – just black, black, black."Witnesses said dead fish were also washing ashore as local volunteers with buckets worked to clean the oily clots from the sand.
