You may have finished your holiday gorging, but your skin… your skin is still hungry. Feed it with the kind of moisturisers recommended for Arctic explorers with hangovers. Start with Aveda’s new Wedding Masque, which promises that you’ll wake up with soft, glowy “wedding-day skin”, then apply Avène first thing, and that evening, if your skin is still feeling dry, the Glycerin-based Yu-Be from Japan is comforting, and not too greasy.How to get the lookPerricone MD OVM Cream, £135, perricone md.co.ukRodial Dragon’s Blood Cream, £75, johnlewis.comAvène Extremely Rich Compensating Cream, £17, boots.comAveda Tulasara Wedding Masque, £48, aveda.co.ukYu-Be Moisturising Skin Cream, £15.99, asos.comGuerlain Orchidée Impériale Cream, £295, guerlain.comBalance Me Overnight Repair Mask, £50, balanceme.co.ukOlay Regenerist Age Defying Cream, £29.99, sainsbury.co.ukSkyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream, £41, feelunique.comEmail Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman
