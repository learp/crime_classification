Summer is nearly here and wild roses are just starting to bloom. These are some of our most elegant but sorely under-rated wild flowers, probably because they get upstaged by their showy garden cousins. Yet wild roses are stunning in their own right.There are many species of wild rose, and they are rather similar and difficult to identify because all have white or delicate pink flowers, thorns and red hips in the winter.But they carry a fascinating range of smells, including apple, musk and honey. As Juliet said in Romeo and Juliet, “What’s in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet.”Shakespeare made famous another rose, “with sweet musk roses and with eglantine”, which describes the bank where Titania, Queen of the Fairies in Midsummer Night’s Dream, sleeps.The commonest wild rose is the dog rose, a scrambling shrub found in hedgerows, at woodland edges, and in scrub and grasslands. It has sweet-scented pink or white flowers that are rich in nectar and it is heaven for bees. In the second world war the chronic shortage of citrus fruits led the British government to encourage children to collect dog rose hips for making into syrup with potentially a vitamin C content more than 20 times richer than that of oranges.More recently dog rose hips have been found to ease the pain of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis by reducing inflammation and helping prevent joint damage.
