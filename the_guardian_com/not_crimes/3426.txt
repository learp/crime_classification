Even people who don’t favour kings and queens admit that other people do, and – the current Queen of the United Kingdom being of an age – there are many who are working out how things should go when she does.They are particularly concerned about the ceremonial colour and character, given that it is believed her departure will shake the nation and pomp will be needed.Plenty of us are old enough to remember the last coronation, and have learned enough to wonder why we have kings and queens at all. Which is, in the view of many of us, that we want them to be about the historic, and not involved in the politics of now.The queen has been very good at this, and so will be greatly missed. Those of us who spent the last coronation lying on the pavements from the early hours waiting for the moment to cheer still believed the British had ascended to the highest point of the nations of the world.I wonder what will happen this time. It’s a long while since royals did everything – we don’t want dukes and princesses laying down the law.But we do value the way they can support some old values and admirable charitable opportunities. We can have any amount of that and, when the Queen’s reign finally comes to an end, I hope we will do going forward.What do you think? Have your say below
