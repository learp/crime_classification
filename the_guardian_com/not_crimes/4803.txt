Thirty years after his move to Wapping killed off Fleet Street’s connection with the newspaper business, Rupert Murdoch is to marry Jerry Hall at St Bride’s church on his old stamping ground.The 84-year-old owner of News UK, the biggest newspaper group in Britain, is set to marry Hall on a Saturday in early March. The church he has chosen describes itself as the “spiritual home of the media”.Murdoch’s marriage, his fourth, comes after a five-month courtship with the 59-year-old former supermodel. Their engagement was announced in the Times newspaper on 12 January. Murdoch’s first two marriages – to Patricia Booker in 1956 and to Anna Torv in 1967 – took place in Australia while his third, to Wendi Deng, was held on a yacht moored off Manhattan in 1999. This will be Hall’s first marriage. Her 1990 Balinese wedding ceremony with former partner Sir Mick Jagger was declared invalid, even though the couple were together for 22 years before splitting in 1999.

Born in Texas, Hall has lived in London for 25 years.While the couple’s former partners are not expected to attend the wedding, Murdoch’s six children and Hall’s four are all expected to do so. The Murdoch family are known to be close and his two young daughters with Deng, Grace and Chloe, are close in age to some of his 13 grandchildren. Other guests will include all his senior executives including Rebekah Brooks, the UK chief executive, and Robert Thomson. As St Bride’s holds about 150 guests, there could also be space for the odd politician. The prime minister, David Cameron, attended a small party at Murdoch’s Mayfair flat at Christmas.It is not yet known which readings will be chosen, but the church’s own history pages are unlikely to be quoted, especially the passages about Murdoch himself. Chapter nine includes the detail of 6,000 newspaper workers who went on strike on 24 January 1986 after “the breakdown of negotiations with Rupert Murdoch’s News International, parent of Times Newspapers and News Group Newspapers”.It goes on: “They were unaware that Murdoch had built and clandestinely equipped a new-technology printing plant in Wapping. When they struck, he moved his operation overnight. Within months the printing dinosaur that was Fleet Street was dead.”“Many people at that time feared that the diaspora of the Fourth Estate might result in St Bride’s losing its title of the cathedral of Fleet Street. Some even considered that the great church would lose its parishioners. “Might Rupert Murdoch’s vision bring about what pestilence, fire and the Luftwaffe had failed to achieve?”Happily the outcome was less bleak and the church still proudly holds ceremonies of all kinds for journalists, as well as the new congregation of local lawyers and publicists.“Twenty-five years after the last newspaper left, the large number of memorials and carol services we hold every year are evenly split between the “old” and the “new” Fleet Street,” says the St Bride’s website.
