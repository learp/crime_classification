1 Ghostbusters (12A) (Paul Feig, 2016, US) 116 mins.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The spirit of the 1980s original loomed disproportionately large over this female-powered reboot from the outset, and it still does. The comedy doesn’t always fire on all proton blasters, but if it’s not a new classic it’s still a fun night out. Led by a quartet of capable comics (chiefly Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig), it also has a neat line in women’s-eye humour (Chris Hemsworth’s bimbo receptionist is a hoot).2 The Neon Demon (18)(Nicolas Winding Refn, 2016, Fra/Den/US) 117 mins.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It is certain to divide opinion but Refn’s fashion nightmare is consistently captivating and carries a palpable charge – all the way into the gory realms of occult horror. Elle Fanning is the rabbit in the LA fashion world’s flashbulbs, climbing her way through a predatory industry that’s short on trust but high on narcissism – and worse.3 Weiner (15)(Josh Kriegman, Elyse Steinberg, 2016, US) 96 mins.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The fall, then rise, then fall of New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner is captured in excruciating detail in this fly-on-the-wall doc, which chances upon a great story when Weiner’s past sexual misconduct comes back to derail his campaign. It’s a textbook study of 21st-century trial by media.4 Maggie’s Plan (15)(Rebecca Miller, 2015, US) 99 mins.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Modern screwball comedy intelligently done, as schemer Greta Gerwig hatches a somewhat ruthless life plan, then attempts to re-strategise when it doesn’t work out. The writing is classy and the cast is terrific: Ethan Hawke, Maya Rudolph, Bill Hader and a scene-stealing Julianne Moore.5 Men & Chicken (15)(Anders Thomas Jensen, 2015, Den/Ger) 102 mins.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Mads “Hannibal” Mikkelsen and David Dencik play dumb and dumber Danish brothers in search of their biological family – who turn out to be even dumber. Livestock, slapstick and bestial human behaviour make for an agreeably eccentric comedy.
