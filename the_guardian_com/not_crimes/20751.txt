The first wave of artists confirmed for V festival have been announced, with Jay Z and Pink headlining the event, which will be held in Chelmsford and Staffordshire. It marks a return to music for both artists. Pink has been working on her film career, and the rapper has been relatively removed from the limelight in recent years. Since his last album Magna Carta Holy Grail was released in 2013, Jay Z has been expanding Tidal, the music streaming service he bought in 2015. Last week, he became the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.The festival’s press release states that Jay Z will perform decade’s worth of hits. But if rumours are true that he and his wife, Beyoncé, will release a joint album, this headline performance could include new music. The festival, which is on 19-20 August, will also include a large lineup of pop, grime, dance and indie acts this year. Those announced so far include: Ellie Goulding, Stormzy, Craig David, Jason Derulo, Rudimental, Sean Paul, Pete Tong, Jess Glynne, Clean Bandit, Madness, Dizzee Rascal, Gorgon City, George Ezra, James Arthur, Anne-Marie, Jonas Blue, Sigma Live, the Vamps, the Wombats, Calum Scott, JP Cooper, Jack Savoretti, Scouting for Girls, Busted, Krept and Konan, Hannah Wants and Raye. More acts are yet to be announced.Last year’s V festival, featured Justin Bieber and Rihanna. Tickets for this summer’s event go on sale at 9am on 3 March.
