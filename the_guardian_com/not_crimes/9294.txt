Brian Eno is the latest pop musician to caution against voting Brexit. In a Facebook post the composer, producer and former Roxy Music member has said that the European Union has, on balance, been a “net force for good”. Eno joins Bob Geldof, Jessie Ware, Johnny Marr and Alex Kapranos in favouring Britain remaining in the EU. Brexit explained: current pollingHe said: “I have a lot of misgivings about the way the EU is run, but they don’t make me want to ditch the whole idea. I feel the EU is one of the only restraints on the kind of neo-liberal market fundamentalism that has seen inequality rising throughout the world. I feel that it has been a net force for good in promoting enlightened social and environmental agendas. It could and should be doing a better job at all these things, but to do any job at all it needs our support.”He added: “The only good outcome of this referendum is that it might remind us what the original mission of the EU was, and might motivate us to actually make it happen.”The referendum is due to take place on Thursday 23 June. Johnny Marr has previously spoken out about the tactics of the Leave campaign, describing UKIP’s “breaking point” poster as “Nazi tactics”. Several culture figures signed a letter in favour of staying in the EU, including Alex Kapranos, Alexis Taylor and Jessie Ware.
