My mother, Pamela Majaro, who has died aged 83, was a pianist, artist and, as founder of the Cavatina Chamber Music Trust, a champion of the cause of bringing chamber music to a young audience.Pamela was born in Llanelli, south Wales, daughter of Beatrice (nee Davies) and Harry Cohen. Her father worked in the family business selling textiles and household goods, and was the president of the local Jewish community. Pamela attended Llanelli girls’ grammar school. She devoted her spare time to playing the piano and became highly proficient.Pamela studied law at University College London, where she met Simon Majaro. They married in 1954, shortly after her graduation. Due to the difficulty of working in the law at the time as a woman, Pamela did not pursue this as a profession. She did, however, inspire her cousin, Lawrence Collins, to study law and was immensely proud when he later became a supreme court judge. Pamela and Simon had two daughters; my younger sister, Nicola, was born with cystic fibrosis, which meant that throughout her short life she needed very intensive levels of care, which Pamela handled with fortitude.After Nicola’s death in 1969, Pamela decided to devote time to music and the arts. She pursued a career as a sculptor and obtained a diploma in fine arts. In addition, she painted and became an accomplished photographer. She continued with her piano playing and became increasingly involved in the world of chamber music.Pamela and Simon were both frustrated by the lack of young faces at chamber music events; in 1998, they founded the Cavatina Trust. Through 50 school concerts a year, funded by the trust, young people in schools were exposed to the beauty of this music. In addition, a Cavatina ticket scheme was introduced in more than 30 venues around Britain so that children and young people aged eight to 25 could attend chamber music free of charge. The trust paid a subsidy for every young guest. In many venues, including the Wigmore Hall in London, the resulting change in the age profile of audiences has been dramatic.Pamela was also the driving force behind the intercollegiate chamber music competitions, initially at Trinity Laban in London and later at the Royal Academy of Music. This has become an annual event, with competitions for string quartets and piano trios. These competitions have helped to raise the profile of chamber music in the UK music scene and identify exceptional talent. The trust sponsors an annual fellowship for outstanding ensembles. Both Pamela and Simon were appointed MBE in 2010.Pamela is survived by Simon and me, and by two grandsons, Ben and Jonathan.
