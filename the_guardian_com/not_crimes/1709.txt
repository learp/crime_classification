My earliest memory is of swimming with my family. I learned to swim at the age of three and we went every weekend. My two older sisters could already swim and I have happy memories of them throwing me about and playing with me in the pool and my dad taking me down the slide, then getting out and going to the cafe to have chips.Growing up, I was closest to my sister Laura. She is two years older and so she was always the one in charge when we were playing. I still remember her making me take a register of all the teddies. Now, I am really close to my sister Chloe, who is five years older than me. We used to have flats opposite each other in Nottingham. I would come back from swimming in the evening and go over to her flat, and she would have made me tea.My dad has always loved that I am into sport. He is too, so it was great for him to be able to go to all my competitions and be a sports fan. My mum was 28 when she had me. She used to work for my father’s company, but when I was 11, she gave up her job to take me swimming. We had to leave the house at 4.30am each day and would only get back at 8pm because I trained morning and night, with school in between. So my mum and I would spend three hours in the car together most days. I am very close to her because of that.My medals are partly my family’s because they have been incredibly supportive throughout my career. Even my sisters – when my mum and I got home at 8pm, my sisters would have made sure they had done their homework so they could cook us both tea, and then they would help me with my homework.My parents have created a little shrine to me in my bedroom at home. They have got both my world record certificates and my suits framed from my races, and we always joke that my dad goes to work with my medals on, underneath his suit. He absolutely loves them and shows them off to everyone.My grandparents are very proud of me. I gave them the DVD of me competing in the Beijing Olympics eight years ago and my nana has watched it every single week since. My grandpa, who is 82, is the cutest man ever. Every Christmas Eve, he used to read The Night Before Christmas to us. He would take me to training once a week, and he always came to watch me swim. Whenever I competed, he used to shout: “Dig in, Becky! Dig in!” I don’t know why he used that phrase and eventually it became hilarious in our house.My parents have travelled the world to watch me swim. But they’re not pushy at all. It has always been me saying, I want to do this. When I was young, my dad would try to take us all swimming in the morning but my sisters used to throw the alarm clock at him and argue. I would be standing there, saying: “Dad, let’s just leave them and go.”My daughter Summer is one and is a mini-me. She’s Miss Independent, a little fighter who wants to do everything herself and get everywhere as fast as she can. She acts so much like me that when my sisters see her, they hold her up and say: “Becky, Becky, are you in there?”Becoming a mother has massively changed me. I loved my life before, but I love being a mum even more. It is the best thing in the entire world. There’s nothing you can compare it to. I’d choose being a mum over my four Olympic medals any day of the week.• National Lottery-funded athletes, including Rebecca, share their recipes and nutritional tips for sporting success at thefoodchampions.co.uk
