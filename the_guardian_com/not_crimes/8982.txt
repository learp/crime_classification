The UK will be represented by the duo Joe & Jake at this year’s Eurovision song contest after they won Friday night’s live selection show at London’s O2 Forum.The pair’s song, You’re Not Alone, was praised by the show’s three panelists and the public gave them more votes than the other five acts: the soloists Bianca, Matthew James and Karl William Lund; the band Dulcima; and fellow duo Darline.Eurovision Song Contest: nul points could disappear in voting shakeup But, despite their success in the UK heat, the bookies were offering long odds on Joe & Jake’s chances of ultimate victory in May. William Hill offered 20/1 for a win but just 10/1 for a “nul points” result in the final on 14 May.“There is a theory that Europe will be behind the UK entry this year as a tribute to Sir Terry Wogan but sadly we fully expect that we will finish in the bottom half of the table,” the bookmaker said.Vocal coach Carrie Grant, who was on the panel for BBC4’s selection show Eurovision: You Decide, said she believed the pair would attract a lot of young fans. Katrina Leskanich, the lead singer Katrina and the Waves – the last entrant to win for the UK, with Love Shine a Light in 1997 – said she could not get the melody out of her head.And the third panelist, the choreographer Jay Revell, said the singers had “absolutely awesome stage presence” and joked that they would benefit from some Bucks Fizz-style moves.The selection show, presented by Mel Giedroyc, featured a tribute to Sir Terry Wogan, who died last month and who was a regular presenter of the BBC’s Eurovision coverage.From Eurovision to Radio 2: Terry Wogan's best quotes Joe Woolford and Jake Shakeshaft both competed on BBC1 talent show The Voice as separate acts and each said they enjoyed a good relationship backstage during filming.The competition has undergone a format change this year. At the Stockholm final, the professional juries and the public voters from each country will award a set of points with both sets then combined.The juries’ points from each of the 43 participating countries will be revealed, before the televoting points are combined and the scores presented by the hosts.
