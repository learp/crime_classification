Last month, 14,000 peasants in the Catatumbo region, in the department of Norte de Santander, took to the streets to demand the declaration of a peasant farmer reservation zone (ZRC) and the implementation of a rural development plan for an economically viable alternative to the production of coca.Their desire to have the area declared a ZRC, which would give them enhanced rights to the land, dates back years but has been consistently rebuffed, with the government, they claim, authorising mining concessions instead.The protests were organised by Ascamcat, the Peasant Farmer Association of Catatumbo, and supported by Christian Aid partner the Luis Carlos Pérez Lawyers' Collective (CALCP) – an organisation that provides support and legal advice to forcibly displaced people, and helps peasants and indigenous communities defend their land rights.According to CALCP and Amnesty International (pdf), security forces opened fire on protests on 22 and 25 June, leaving four dead and 50 wounded. At least 10 members of the security forces were also injured.With tensions rising in Catatumbo in the runup to the demonstrations, Colombian civil society organisations set up verification missions to monitor developments.CALCP representatives who were present when the violence began say they contacted the verification mission when the shooting started. The mission called the authorities and human rights groups, including Christian Aid, to intervene.Mission members, however, came under attack from security forces, who harassed and intimidated those seeking help at a local hospital, according to reports from farmers.The events in Catatumbo are all too typical of Colombia's conflict over land, which has left the country with the world's highest number of internally displaced people and a rising death toll.Concentration of land ownership has increased, fuelled by the forced displacement of rural communities, which has affected an estimated 10% of the population.More than 16,000 people have "disappeared" in land disputes and there have been an estimated 1,600 extrajudicial executions. Many of the disputes centre on claims to land that communities were forced to abandon, which subsequently fell into the hands of businesses.Unequal land ownership deprives rural farmers of a livelihood and perpetuates income inequality. Additionally, by reducing the land available for small-scale farmers to produce food for subsistence, unequal land ownership contributes to food insecurity, resulting in malnutrition, anaemia, calcium deficiencies and hunger.In theory, the government has adopted measures to return land to internally displaced people. However, in practice, those resisting such land claims have been able to act with impunity and no land has yet been returned under the new land restitution law.Many individuals and organisations, including Christian Aid, our Colombian partners and the British ambassador to Colombia, are calling for dialogue between the peasants' association and the government to resolve the economic and social challenges, and to investigate the deaths and injuries in Catatumbo.The protest continues, with about 6,000 peasant farmers blockading the main road to Cúcuta, the capital city of Norte de Santander. The events in Catatumbo have prompted support from other indigenous and peasant movements in the country, which are threatening further blockades.The government has been quick to claim that the protests are being fuelled by rebel organisation Farc. This is an argument that has been used before, however, and has been rejected by those demonstrating, who say they are simply trying to preserve a future for their families.Catalina Ballesteros Rodriguez is Christian Aid's programme officer in Colombia
