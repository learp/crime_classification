A Conservative MP who claimed that a book prize set up to address the lack of diversity in British publishing was discriminatory against white people has had his complaint dismissed.Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, wrote to the Equality and Human Rights Commission in January, claiming that the Jhalak prize for writers of colour discriminated against white writers.A spokesman for the EHRC said: “After investigating, we were satisfied that the prize did not breach equality law.” He added: “As the UK’s independent equality regulator, the Commission has a duty to consider complaints by individuals about potential breaches of the Equality Act 2010.”Literature report shows British readers stuck in very white past But one of the founders of the prize, author Sunny Singh, criticised the decision to follow up on Davies’ complaint, claiming it had caused “enormous stress” and wasted resources.Singh said she was baffled at Davies’ action. “I really cannot understand why an MP for an extraordinary constituency like Shipley would do a thing like this,” she said. “I am heartbroken because I would expect more responsible behaviour and better use of his time from a member of parliament.”The prize was established in 2016 to reward non-white authors for their work after the 2015 Writing the Future report from Spread the Word found that only 8% of people working in British publishing self-identified as coming from a black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) background, creating a cycle where the authors picked up by publishers were also overwhelmingly white. Since the report, several of the UK’s largest publishers have introduced new schemes and mentorship programmes, with chief executive of Penguin Random House UK, Tom Weldon, warning the industry in October that it would “become irrelevant” it did not begin publishing a range of authors that better reflected British society.Davies said that he had launched the complaint because of his strong opposition to “positive discrimination”. “I don’t believe in any discrimination and don’t believe that we should have prizes and competitions which discriminate on the basis of race,” he said.In one letter to the EHRC, as well as complaining about the Jhalak, Davies also asked for the equalities regulator to investigate the Fourth Estate/Guardian prize for short stories by writers of colour, which was launched last year. In 2009, he had the Decibel Penguin prize, an Arts Council initiative aimed at writers from Asian, African and Caribbean backgrounds, shut down under race discrimination law.Davies said: “If someone set up a literary prize for white people only, there would rightly be outrage from the same people who are defending this competition.” He added: “As far as I am concerned, there is no difference between a prize for white people only and a prize for ethnic minorities only. Both discriminate on the grounds of race and both should be rejected.”Asked if he had complained about literary prizes that select on the bases of gender or sexuality, such as the Baileys women’s prize for fiction, he was unable to answer. “I’m not concerned about literary prizes,” he said. “I am concerned with racial discrimination.” However, in 2008 he complained that the Orange prize, as the Baileys prize was then named, did discriminate against men.Women’s Equality party leader seeks backing for a clear run to beat ‘misogynist’ MP Davies, who has been on the parliamentary Women and Equalities Committee since December, made news recently after the Women’s Equality party announced it would field its leader Sophie Walker against him in the forthcoming general election. The WEP candidate is standing against the sitting MP over what she described as his “anti-equality agenda”, which includes voting against same-sex marriage and for the repeal of the Human Rights Act.In 2009, it emerged that over an 18-month period Davies had sent the then equalities watchdog head Trevor Phillips 19 letters, with questions ranging from whether the Metropolitan Black Police Association discriminated because it limited membership to black people, to whether anti-discrimination laws ought to be extended “to cover bald people (and perhaps fat people and short people)”.The inaugural Jhalak prize was won in March by author Jacob Ross and his novel The Bone Readers.
