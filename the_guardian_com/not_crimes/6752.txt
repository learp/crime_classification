A Back to the Future fan has been clocked speeding his DeLorean at 88mph in Essex. Nigel Mills, 55, who paid £22,000 for his cult vehicle, denied that he had been attempting to break the space-time continuum in his efforts. In the 1985 film, Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) manages to transport himself back to 1955 after hitting 88mph in the machine invented by Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). “I wasn’t trying to time travel,” said Mills, despite his top speed being recorded as 89mph, heading north on the A12 near Margaretting. “It was at 11am on Sunday and the road was completely clear.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Back to the Future: Doc Brown explains the significance of 88mphMills said he only takes the two-seater out a few times a year and had taken the DeLorean out for a bit of “run around” when he was caught speeding.He appeared before Chelmsford magistrates but the case was thrown out after the two officers who clocked him speeding were absent from the court date.DeLorean to go Back to the Future by making cars again He explained that he’d purchased the vehicle as he was “a car fan and me and the rest of my family enjoyed the Back to the Future films. When I’m out in it a few people recognise it, they slow down and take pictures – drivers take pictures out of their windows or try to film you and I get approached at petrol stations.”No details on whether or not Mills had kitted his car out with a flux capacitor – essential for time travel – have been released.
