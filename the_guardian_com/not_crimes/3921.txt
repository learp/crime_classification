Following Glastonbury’s tradition of fusing pop music and politics, a Labour party source has confirmed that Jeremy Corbyn will appear at the festival’s 2016 event.The line up of speakers and groups at the Left Field stage is being organised by singer and activist Billy Bragg. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also been invited to speak. In previous years, union leaders have taken part in debates at Glastonbury; however, Corbyn’s cameo would make him the first Labour leader to appear. It is not known what the pair will address, though reports have linked Corbyn’s invitation to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. A statement by Bragg, who curates the Left Field Stage, meanwhile praises Corbyn’s impact on activism.“The election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader has galvanised a new generation of activists, and this year at Left Field we aim to give them a platform to discuss issues around social justice, the economy, gender and the possibilities for genuine change under a Corbyn government,” Bragg said. Last year’s event saw the Dalai Lama address thousands of festival-goers, endorsing the pope’s radical message on climate change and calling on fellow religious leaders to “speak out about current affairs which affect the future of mankind”.This year’s Glastonbury will be headlined by Coldplay, Adele and Muse. The event takes place from 22 to 26 June. • This article was amended on 5 April 2016. It previously stated that Corbyn would become the first party leader to speak at Glastonbury. In fact, Green leaders Caroline Lucas and Natalie Bennett have appeared on the bill in previous years.
