Forget the zombies on The Walking Dead, the white walkers on Game of Thrones, and Cookie Lyon on Empire: the famed 14-foot Warped Wall on American Ninja Warrior is one of the scariest things on television. The inwardly curving wall that competitors have to scale to complete the qualifying course has been the signature challenge of this gruelling obstacle course for seven seasons – and it’s about to get even harder when the show premieres on Wednesday 1 June at 8pm ET.“We had a winner last season, and that has affected us in a variety of ways,” explains the executive producer Arthur Smith, referring to Isaac Caldiero, the show’s first winner. Both he and Geoff Britten were the first to complete Mount Midoriyama, Ninja Warrior’s four-stage finals course, but since Caldiero finished it more quickly, he won the $1m prize. “This off-season, the [research and development] was crazy. There are 28 new obstacles this year. The iconic warped wall is 6in higher. Those who just made it over the wall last year won’t make it this year.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Yes, the show’s response to someone winning was to make it even harder for anyone to win again. Based on the Japanese show Sasuke, the original Ninja Warrior aired on the now defunct cable channel G4 for several years before American Ninja Warrior was launched in 2009. Starting in 2012, it was drafted to air on NBC (which owned G4), where it got larger audiences each year. Last season, the summer competition averaged about 7.3 million viewers a week, a sizable amount for a show during the warmer months. Smith and the co-executive producer Anthony Storm said that the first season, they were impressed to get 5,000 submissions from people seeking to be on the show. This year they got 75,000 submissions for only 600 spots. Applications are also up among women, having more than doubled since a video of Kacy Catanzaro completing the qualifying course went viral two years ago. “Not to give anything away, but we’ve had two women go further than ever before,” says Storm, who is in the middle of filming this year’s show.

The show rode the zeitgeist of obstacle competitions like Tough Mudder and Spartan Race, as well as America’s general obsession with the fitness lifestyle. Now other obstacle course shows, such as NBC’s Strong and Fox’s American Grit, are trying to capitalize on the success of Ninja Warrior. “I’m not going to refer to someone’s show as a rip-off, but they might have been attracted to this because of Ninja Warrior,” says Smith of those other shows. Smith and Storm aren’t standing idly by, either. They’re launching Spartan: Ultimate Team Challenge on Monday 13 June at 10pm ET. Based on the Spartan Race obstacle course franchise, this show features a mile-long course full of insane obstacles that co-ed teams of five compete to finish faster.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest “In Spartan, the emphasis is on the team,” says Smith. “Every obstacle is built so that the only way you can conquer it is with everyone contributing. We saw time and again when we were taping Spartan that you’re only as strong as the weakest link. We saw people carrying their teammates over the obstacle.”If American Ninja Warrior is about ordinary people doing extraordinary things, then Spartan is about a bunch of ordinary people compelling each other to greatness. “The soundtrack of Spartan is crazy,” Smith says. “People are encouraging and yelling and some are nurturing and some are screaming.”       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Flip Rodriguez, another contender in American Ninja Warrior.

Storm tells the story of a family of five dairy farmers who gave up their land for a Spartan race – so they thought they should try to compete. “They are literally farm strong,” Storm says. “All their strength comes from throwing hay bales and working with the cows. They banded together and competed as a team and they did things that you never would have expected. They are shocking and amazing and awe-inspiring. This team had something to prove.”When asked whether either of them had run the course for either American Ninja Warrior or Spartan, both Smith and Storm demur. “I can’t. I have a family,” Smith jokes.Storm says he tries out individual obstacles while they’re being developed but doesn’t try them all together. “The courses are so hard now I would never dare,” he says. And that’s just the way fans – and competitors – like it.
