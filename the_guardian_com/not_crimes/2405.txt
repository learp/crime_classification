Around one in eight women reported unwanted sexual touching of their breasts, buttocks or genitals or attempts to kiss them at work, according to a study by the Trades Union Congress and the Everyday Sexism Project.Almost a fifth said they had been harassed by their boss or someone else with authority over them. But four in five women said they did not report the incidents to their employers, with many fearing that it would harm their relationships at work or that they would not be taken seriously.The findings are described by the TUC as the biggest study of its kind for a generation. Labour are backing the union’s call to reinstate parts of the Equality Act, which would make employers responsible for protecting staff from harassment by third parties such as customers.We’d like you to share your experiences – anonymously if you prefer – of sexual harassment in the workplace, from personal experiences to your company’s policies. We’ll use a selection of responses in our reporting.
