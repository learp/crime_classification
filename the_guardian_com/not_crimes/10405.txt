Hedi Slimane has announced he is leaving Saint Laurent after four years as creative director.According to WWD, his contract with the legendary fashion house expired yesterday.Kering, the group that owns the fashion house, said in a statement that Slimane’s exit has ended a “four-year mission, which has led to a complete repositioning of the brand”. With his history of popularising the skinny jean, indie rock look at Dior Homme, Slimane brought this aesthetic to Saint Laurent, giving a contemporary edge to the label.

The first goodbye, his lavish autumn/winter 20016 show in Los Angeles, was staged at the Hollywood Palladium and seemed to pay tribue to LA’s legendary music scene. It featured a frow that included Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga and featured a rare appearance by Slimane himself, who walked during the show dressed like a Romantic poet. In stark contrast, his Paris fashion week show last month featured no music at all, but had a thematic music video aesthetic – a Roxy Music model muse. His final act was masterful: Cara Delevingne’s much acclaimed new adverts for the label, seen as a “return to modelling” after an acting hiatus.Slimane’s successor is rumoured to be Anthony Vaccarello, said to be starting his new role on 1 May.
