Writing isn’t as solitary as people think. When I’m writing fiction my mind is whirling with characters, and often I find they’re more real to me than the people out the window.I had a problem after Captain Corelli’s Mandolin. To promote it, I had to go out so much my train of thought was constantly being interrupted. I worried whether I’d go back to writing properly. And I needed to – the film didn’t make as much impact as people believe. You don’t get as rich as you hope.All sorts of eminent writers get forgotten. I’d like people to read Birds Without Wings forever, but I’m not so much bothered about the others. My parents were of a wartime generation who were brought up to be Spartan warriors and not cry I always thought I’d be a poet. My father would recite Shakespeare at meals, and still writes poetry. He’s 92 and says he’s got one more poem in him. It was only when I was older that I felt I grasped things like metrics, that I had the sufficient knowledge to actually write it.My parents were of a wartime generation who were brought up to be Spartan warriors and not cry. I think it takes a long time to shake that off and go back to being a natural human being.I inherited one of my cats from Elizabeth Jane Howard. They’re annoying, and often get on the keyboard and chase the cursor around the screen. One of them once reformatted a column and I had no idea how to undo it.I was glad that on her deathbed my mother said to me: “We did have a lot of fun, didn’t we?” Fun is such an important thing and I’d love people to remember me for being fun.I have nightmares about losing my children. I’ve gone through a difficult separation [from his partner of 11 years, theatre director Cathy Gill, in 2009] and a process of sorting out custody, and even though I get to have them half the time, I still have dreams.I don’t look in mirrors. I just hope that young women will still fancy me, even though they don’t.God and I get on extremely badly because I think he should do a better job. Up until the age of 18 I was very religious. But I strongly disapprove of organised religion now. It just does so much moral and intellectual damage.In my garden I’ll grow anything that the pigeons won’t take. It’s easier to grow things, like potatoes and leeks, that they’re not bothered about. I did once shoot a pigeon that was stripping my Brussels sprouts.I don’t play the mandolin much now. I’ve always been more of a guitar player although I’m probably best on the flute. I was in a group called the Antonius Players. We toured halls and parish churches for about 10 years.Once you get to a certain age you start thinking of the world in the mode of saying farewell. There comes a point when most of the people you really love are dead, but it doesn’t make them any less real.A lot of what I write about myself is fictional, but no one knows the difference. Whoever reads it, it doesn’t mean they actually know you.Louis Bernières’s second collection of poetry, Of Love and Desire, is out now (Harvill Secker, £12.99).
