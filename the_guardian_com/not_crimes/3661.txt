Can you believe it, it feels like five minutes since I went round putting them forward, I mean back, complete and utter insanity. I still haven’t done the microwave, don’t know why they call it daylight “saving” time, it’s a total waste of time. And it’s all down to Scottish farmers stealing our vitamin D just to keep their cows happy, I’m glad they’re having a bloody referendum, they can have their own time zone, stop the rest of the country living in pitch dark.Twice a year for 15 years I’ve written to my MP, she didn’t even reply last time, it’s an establishment stitch-up, follow the money, it’s the energy companies, who do you think profits from making us switch to darker mornings, then sleep through light they could use up in the evenings, that’s why I would dump WET, Western European Time, not to be confused with UTC, Coordinated Universal Time. Simple, I put it in my petition, we should stay on BST – British Summer Time – that’s GMT, or standard time plus one – in the winter, then change to GMT plus two in the summer, think of it as double BST. We would get light until 10 plus all the advantages of being in GMT plus one or CET, Central European Time. RoSPA wants GMT plus one, anyone with half a brain wants SDST, Single/Double Summer Time, you’d have more sunlight all year.Modern tribes: the boot camp bore They say “more exercise, less seasonal affective disorder (SAD)”, but you try getting anything done. I’ve been saying this for years, we’ll lose an hour’s sleep this weekend, that’s a whole day of sleep every quarter-century! Simple theft, and that’s not counting the time to change all the clocks, and we’ve got to do it all over again tomorrow, I still haven’t changed the answering machine clock, or the one on the sprinkler – lost the instructions, that’s another thing.
