Paris, 1930. A young orphan roams the cramped passageways and secret paths behind the vents and walls of a grand twentieth-century train station, hiding from the cruel Station Inspector. This scene shapes the backdrop of The Invention of Hugo Cabret, where Brian Selznick transports us to a world of action, adventure, mysterious engineers and bookish heroines.At first glance, you’ll notice the story is told through many beautiful sketches with no words at all. Much of the plot is unraveled through these drawings, which gives it a lot of visual detail, and is an interesting format for a novel.Out of all the protagonists in popular adventure books, Hugo wouldn’t be the norm. A secretive thief who is shy and lies to even his friends isn’t exactly the courageous and honest Harry Potter many of us expect. I came to love Hugo though, because of his cleverness and his quiet unconventional, yet brave, personality.Hugo is left alone to his wits in a train station, and has to constantly avoid the Station Inspector. The solitary Hugo is not used to having companions, and therefore even when he finds a friend in Isabelle, he ends up losing her trust. I can’t blame her. I wouldn’t trust a boy who lives inside a giant clock in a railway station and steals from my godfather’s toy store. But I relate to Hugo’s curious and independent mind, his silent attempts to find answers all by himself. Unfortunately, most of the time in his search for answers, he ends up getting caught by the authorities. Despite being offered second chances, Hugo doesn’t usually take them, which is why I think he’s unconventional. Selznick’s character development of Hugo is solid - he doesn’t fall into a particular stereotype of a hero.The plot is as complex and intriguing as the characters are. Hugo has been stealing from a specific toyshop. But is he really a thief, or does he have a motive for his stealing?How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? My advice to you is, whilst reading this fantastic novel, don’t skim past the pictures; in fact, you should pay very close attention to them - I found myself confused when I didn’t do that! I think that Selznick’s drawings and words are symbolic, and paint and spell out an admirable novel, teaching us about how those who are in tough circumstances can find the light at the end of the tunnel. More importantly though, we learn that people with different behaviours should be understood first, then judged.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
