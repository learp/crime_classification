The first teaser trailer for Danny Boyle’s long awaited sequel to cult smash Trainspotting has been released, though it doesn’t reveal any new footage.Instead, the 45-second promo offers a reminder of the joys of the original 1996 movie, soundtracked with Iggy Pop’s evergreen Lust for Life, to mark the start of shooting.Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are back as Renton, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie for Danny Boyle’s sequel. Apparently titled T2, with apologies to James Cameron’s dystopian sci-fi sequel, the film is expected to be loosely based on Irvine Welsh’s 2002 novel Porno, the Scottish author’s followup to his 1993 tale of Edinburgh heroin addicts.

It sees Sick Boy, Spud and Renton embarking on a pornography venture as the latter does his best to stay out of Begbie’s way and avoid a violent confrontation.Trainspotting screenwriter John Hodge is also back for the sequel, which is expected to arrive in cinemas in January next year. While the trailer may not offer much in the way of footage, Coming Soon has posted some photos of the returning cast in character for those who just can’t wait to see what Renton, Sick Boy, Spud and Begbie look like 20 years on.
