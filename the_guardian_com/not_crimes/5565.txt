Since then, Malik has found success on his own as an R&B solo artist. Despite support from fans, Malik has been sparing in his public statements since leaving the pop group. He told Beats One radio host Zane Lowe when he released his solo album, Mind of Mine, that he had been craving a more challenging artistic life, but has described his struggle with anxiety after it forced the singer to cancel a live performance in London earlier this year.Penguin also said Malik’s book would explore his “normal childhood” in Bradford.
