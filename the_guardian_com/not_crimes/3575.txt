for Tom DuhigA Sixties man thing: Dad, us, circling to bondas hard as Ingemar Johansson’s glue in the adaround our huge box, its screen a snow globeof American static. The night Johansson won,a commentator summarized Floyd Patterson:the feet of a ballet dancer, the chin of a poet.Floyd knocked out Ingemar in their rematch;his brilliant smile shone through his glass jaw.Later, I learned how outside ring lights boxingwas darkened by money. Abroad, Henry Coopersaid you needed to knock out locals for a draw.Some Yanks dived so as not to swim in concreteboxing boots. My poet’s foot is in my mouth now,Tom, Middleweight Champion of the Royal Navy,but I remember Freddie Mills staring down a rifle in the back of that car on his soul’s darkest night.You might counter with Dick “Tiger”, born Ihetu,burning bright despite suffering the ‘blacklights’,those galaxies only battered fighters can explore.Generous, Dick gave away age, weight or heightbut never heart, slipping cannibal taunts to win;Biafran civil warrior later, yet a hero to both sides – another trick of boxing: it can also make more love.Square that ring, poet! Brother, raise your hands.• From The Blind Road-Maker by Ian Duhig (Picador, £9.99). To order a copy for £7.99 go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846.
