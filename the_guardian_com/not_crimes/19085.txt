1 | Hildy Johnson, His Girl FridaySuggested by: TopQuark, AugustaG, ID8729015, Albini, AlexJonesWhile commenters balked at Lois Lane’s inclusion, they were just as adamant that Rosalind Russell’s fast-talking Hildy Johnson, who starred opposite Cary Grant in His Girl Friday, should have been included. The screwball comedy was released in 1940 to roaring reviews and has garnered a cult following ever since. Hildy was sensational: a star reporter with wit, style, and the inability to turn down a good scoop — even if it meant missing her own wedding day.

And he has a cute dog.” On top of a grand journalistic career, Tintin books have sold more than 200 million copies in 70-plus languages. What other journalist on our list boasts such lofty commercial success?      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Clark Johnson as Augustus ‘Gus’ Haynes in The Wire. Photograph: HBO3 | Augustus ‘Gus’ Haynes, The WireSuggested by MantisToboggan, David_J_ShawWhile much of The Wire focused on the drug trade and Baltimore’s complex web of public institutions, commenters praised the HBO drama’s insightful depiction of newsroom politics in its fifth season. At the centre of the series was Gus Haynes (played by Clark Johnson), a tough-talking editor whose unrelenting morality clashed with higher-ups, forcing budget cuts and dubious editorial decisions.

James Woods was nominated for an Oscar for his role as the American journalist, who descends into hellfire as leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads clash violently. While Stone was criticised for his dramatic rendering of the 1980 Salvadoran war, Woods was praised for his complicated and contrary Boyle, a capricious freeloader with a conscience, “who’s not afraid to get his hands dirty”.

While notorious for his principled reporting, Danny is probably best known for his on-again, off-again relationship with White House press secretary CJ Cregg. As one commenter put it: “Don’t know much about his journalistic skills, but his chemistry with CJ was fantastic.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Linda Hunt as Billy Kwan with Mel Gibson as Guy Hamilton in The Year of Living Dangerously.6 | Billy Kwan, The Year of Living DangerouslySuggested by MoreNotLessIn The Year of Living Dangerously, a drama set in mid-1960s Jakarta, American actor Linda Hunt made a career bet that paid off: she cut off her hair, shaved her eyebrows, and threw herself into the role of male photojournalist Billy Kwan, a Chinese-Australian cameraman. Billy helps Mel Gibson’s character, an Australian journalist, weave through the political landscape of a country on the brink of revolution. Kwan’s portrayal of the ethical, quick-witted Kwan was ahead of its time, and celebrated with an Oscar for best supporting actress.

Downey depicts the San Francisco Chronicle reporter’s obsession with the manhunt for the Zodiac murderer with finesse — including the moment the real-life Paul Avery received a death threat from Zodiac himself.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Jeff Daniels as the TV anchor Will McAvoy in The Newsroom. Photograph: HBO8 | Will McAvoy, The NewsroomSuggested by Steve H, Valerio FiandraThe Newsroom’s Will McAvoy begins the series as a complacent, disgruntled anchor who declares that the United States is no longer the greatest country on earth — a cardinal sin in America — in a video that goes viral. Forced to rebuild his reputation, Will’s show is overhauled by producer and former flame MacKenzie McHale, who revives the anchor’s passion for reporting. As the series goes on, Will serves as the moral epicentre of the newsroom by refusing to air unsubstantiated and frivolous stories, inspiring his team with grandiose speeches, and taking a stand against upper-management meddling.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Holly Hunter as news producer Jane Craig in Broadcast News.9 | Jane Craig, Broadcast NewsSuggested by AugustaGIn Broadcast News, Holly Hunter plays Jane Craig, an uncommonly multidimensional female character for the time (1987) and the genre (romantic comedy). Jane is an idealistic, talented news producer — but she’s also neurotic, blunt, and does not have a clue how to reconcile her personal and professional lives. When faced with the choice of romance or career, Jane ultimately chooses the latter — in an ending that was decades ahead of its time.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Patrick Fugit as the 15-year-old aspiring rock journalist William Miller in Almost Famous, with Kate Hudson as Penny Lane.10 | William Miller, Almost FamousSuggested by BewilderedMarkIn the iconic 2000 rock film Almost Famous, Patrick Fugit plays William Miller, a 15-year-old aspiring music journalist who gets his big break right before graduating from high school: an assignment from Rolling Stone to cover a stadium rock band’s first tour. As the endearingly awkward William gets closer to the band — and its groupies — he grapples with the blurred line between friend and journalist. The character of William is famously based on director Cameron Crowe’s own experience as a nascent rock journalist.
