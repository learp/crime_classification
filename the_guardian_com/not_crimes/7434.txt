It takes me a lot less time to get ready than it takes my wife. I just have a shower, use some Lynx deodorant, moisturise my face and put a bit of wax in my hair. I’m very, very keen on perfume (currently Gucci by Gucci) and use it four times a day. My wife thinks I’m obsessed.With my 5ft 4in frame, I haven’t got the range of clothes of a normal-sized person, so I stay with Italian designers – Armani, Gucci, Prada – because Italians are smaller than English people. I do enjoy dressing up; it makes me feel that I’m doing something important, even though it’s just sport.Part of the appeal of horse racing is that everyone makes an effort, so you mingle with well-dressed men and women. My dad was a champion jockey in Italy, and my mother was very strict about me keeping up with the family look. Even at a young age, I wore a jacket, trousers and smart shoes.I have about 15 pairs of very expensive leather shoes – it’s one of the ways I treat myself. My son Leo is 16 and he used to wear all my clothes, but he’s too big now, thankfully. I have a very flamboyant side – I have a white suit, a mustard suit: it’s part of my culture. I have a grey one, too, for normal business, or to meet the Queen.Frankie Dettori wins his second Derby at Epsom on board Golden Horn In the 1990s, I had an Al Pacino look, with my hair slicked back. It was a pain, because I had to gel it all the time. Now I wear it short, because I spend most of the day with a helmet on. I have a few more wrinkles than I used to; I work outside, so I’m weathered. If you don’t get old it, means you’re dead, so what do you do? Plus wrinkles can look rather good on a man.• Frankie Dettori is an ambassador for the Investec Derby Festival, 3-4 June
