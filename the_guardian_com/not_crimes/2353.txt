One morning on the reading carpet in infant school, around the time of the silver jubilee, I realised everyone was staring at me. I glanced down nervously. Had I done an accidental wee like Jane Cripps sometimes did?Actually, Mrs Maloney was telling the class my mum and dad had “separated”; I was soon to be (stage whisper) A Child of Divorce.Aged five, I don’t think I quite understood, and divorce being pretty rare in the 70s, it just made me more interesting. Though, sadly, not even that interesting – my arch-rival was already a A Child of Divorce. She also kept trying to nick my best friend using Spangles – frankly, more upsetting than the family split. I never got Spangles. (Looking back, I imagine my sweet fixation was some displacement of emotion.)But to me, divorce and stepfamily just weren’t all that weird. My Austrian dad’s parents had divorced in the 1950s. Well, they were exotic – my grandmother a glamorous, chain-smoking beautician; my grandfather a charming rogue. Both had remarried, resulting in four grandparents in Austria. Quite the result: lots of Milka chocolate sent for birthdays.It didn’t take long to suss that this double present thing might happen at home; we’d even get two Christmases.Both my parents were remarried within four years. More stepgrandparents, more presents: get in! A dream blossomed from the split – that I’d marry for life, exactly as my parents failed to I lived with my sisters, mum and stepdad. My next sister down and I usually saw my dad once a week, and I liked my stepmother (who was much younger than my dad). After all, she’d brought orange Smarties to our first meeting. A foil to my father’s rather volatile temper, she liked baking and Diana Ross. And she didn’t seem evil, like the fairytales claimed.Truthfully though, it wasn’t always lucrative or easy being a stepchild. It’s hard enough being bossed around by your own parents as a kid – it’s harder yet to be bossed around by adults who’ve only just arrived. Plus they were always being congratulated for “taking on the girls”. Wasn’t it jolly good of us girls to take them on? I’d think indignantly. Apparently not.By 16, most of my good mates’ parents had divorced. At least in my family set-up, unlike some, everyone was civil (on the surface, anyway).But … I grew up with a sense of being different; an outsider. A dream blossomed from the split – that I’d marry for life, exactly as my parents failed to. Obviously some people succeed at this, but when I did marry at 29 the writing was already on the wall. I was trying to create something perhaps I was incapable of finding at that stage of my life.It was hard to disentangle myself from the chains of my childhood expectations, but when my own marriage failed, mostly I was gutted for my own kids. How badly I’d wanted them to have the perfect family. How badly I’d failed them.Then a weird thing happened. I got very ill. On the day I started treatment, I discovered my little boys had already met my ex’s new girlfriend. Would she be their (step)mother if I pegged it, I kept thinking manically? Luckily, I didn’t die, and when my ex and his girlfriend split a while later, a stranger thing happened – I realised I really like my boys’ (ex)stepmother. She still sees them, via me; she’s very cool and she loves them. And it’s the continuity that counts.After all of this, I finally met the love of my life. Already seven years out of his first marriage, he had a teenage son and daughter, living equally between him and their mother.Excited and in love, I left London with my boys and moved in with them. Now, although I didn’t exactly think it’d be the Brady Bunch, I was relatively optimistic – I’d always wanted four kids (and a girl, too) – and, after all, I knew all about stepmothers, didn’t I?In hindsight, perhaps I was ill-prepared for being a stepmother precisely because I felt so well-prepared. What a fool. The household buckled under the strain, and my stepchildren decided to live with their mother full-time. My partner was devastated – and so was I.I offered to move out instead of them – but it was too late; they’d voted with their feet. Thank God, somehow, we weathered that storm.Nowadays, we all meet up sometimes, but it’s a work in progress. Often, my partner sees his children alone.Over time, I learned that it wasn’t personal. I was just a threat to the status quo; it was about what I stood for, rather than who I am. And I realise now, if there’s any sort of acrimony on the birth parents’ side, it’s far harder to unite a “new” family (I don’t like the word “blended”, it makes me think of pulverised stuff in a NutriBullet).My own parents subscribed to the “seen and not heard” school; as kids, we had no say in events. This generation of youngsters are listened to far more – generally a good thing, I imagine. But I think there are ways of handling this sense of entitlement without it becoming unhealthy.Recently I joined a radio discussion on step-parenting. One lady told of being interviewed by her future step-kids on her first date. What precedent does that set those children? We don’t stop having needs just because we become parents and, much as I want my own kids to have more agency than I did, they can’t dictate everything (though believe me, they try).In defence of stepmothers | Clare Conville My boys moan about their stepdad being strict sometimes. But they love him really, he brings things to their lives that were missing before, and I’m far less pushed than as a single mum. A happier parent makes for happier kids.I’ve learned that the perfect family doesn’t exist – but good communication can. Talk to each other. Inevitably, there’s enough love to go round; we just might have to get used to sharing a parent or a child, as long as we’re sure they’re being well cared for.Most crucially, never use the kids as pawns. It happens so often, but after divorce, creating harmony for our children is vital and I’d advocate subjugating acrimony if possible. And one day, you might foster a worthwhile relationship somewhere unexpected, as I did with my ex’s ex-girlfriend.And my own stepmother? Well, she left my dad after years of marriage. It was turbulent – and I briefly had another stepmother – but I kept in touch with the first one; she’d been part of my life growing up.Meanwhile, I’ve come to understand that there is no normal. There’s only life – and family – where you find it.The Stepmother by Claire Seeber is published by Bookouture, £9.99. To order a copy go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
