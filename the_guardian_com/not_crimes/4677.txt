An additional Australian director will be added to the credits of the upcoming TV adaptation of Picnic at Hanging Rock after the Australian Directors’ Guild publicly admonished the production company for enlisting a Canadian director to helm half the episodes.Three episodes of the Foxtel series based on the 1967 novel by Joan Lindsay were to be directed by the Australian Michael Rymer and three by the Canadian Larysa Kondracki – a decision that “appalled” the ADG, as it reduced opportunities for local directors.On 15 December, the advocacy group Women in Film and Television (WIFT) staged a protest in front of FremantleMedia’s office in Sydney and released a video lambasting the hire.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The director of drama at FremantleMedia Australia, Jo Porter, said on Friday that the company now welcomed the engagement of a third director – a woman – to direct one episode of the six-part series. It was unclear how Rymer and Kondracki would split the other five episodes between them.Earlier this month the chief executive of the ADG, Kingston Anderson, said the hire of Kondracki went against the “net employment benefit” test that accompanied a 420 working visa and underlined a more general lack of support that Australian talent received from the industry and government. “Australian directors are amazed and astonished at the choice of a foreign director to work on a classic, especially as it is not a co-production and is being fully financed in Australia,” he said in a statement.He said the ADG believed no female TV directors currently working in Australia were approached for the role. The series’ script comes from two female writers, Beatrix Christian and Alice Addison. The Australian film industry is a sausage party. Here’s what we can do about it | Anna Broinowski “In light of the recent Screen Australia figures stating that only 17% of Australian feature films were directed by women and Screen NSW’s figure that only 22% of TV dramas were being directed by Australian women, this is a slap in the face to all the good work that is being done by the industry to redress the balance.”In a statement on Friday, Porter said the company “acknowledged the sensitivity around the selection of the creative team” and said the decision was made following consultation with Screen Australia, Film Victoria, the ADG and Foxtel. Sophie Mathisen, the New South Wales president of WIFT, welcomed the move.“Given the disproportionately low instance of female directorship of significant works of dramatic film and television, WIFT NSW welcomes the addition of a third, female director … we are pleased with this outcome that will provide a meaningful credit on a domestic project of scale.”
