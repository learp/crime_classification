Glastonbury has announced its first swath of artists for this year’s festival at Worthy Farm from 21-25 June, with 83 acts confirmed in addition to the three headliners, Radiohead, Foo Fighters and Ed Sheeran.Michael and Emily Eavis: ‘The Variety Bazaar won’t be like Glastonbury – it’ll be unique’ Joining the headliners are a selection of pop and indie royalty – Katy Perry makes her Glastonbury debut, and Barry Gibb is taking the Sunday teatime “legend” slot that drew huge crowds for Dolly Parton in 2014 and Lionel Richie in 2015.He is not the only legend on this year’s bill. The Jacksons make their Glastonbury debut, Chic return, country star Kris Kristofferson will appear, and the Can Project – featuring original Can members Irmin Schmidt and Malcolm Mooney – will be joined by special guests including Thurston Moore.Lorde, whose second album is due this spring, had teased an appearance during a Radio 1 interview, saying she did “love a farm”, and she will indeed be down at Worthy Farm. On a bill featuring plenty of notable female artists, she is joined by Solange, Laura Marling and Haim, among many others.

Rock fans – at a festival that traditionally does not embrace the heavy – get the chance to see Biffy Clyro and Royal Blood.Grime day on the Silver Hayes stage was one of the highlights of last year’s festival, and that genre is strongly represented again this year, with appearances by Stormzy, Kano, Boy Better Know and grime godfathers Wiley and Dizzee Rascal. Though there are no plans for Glastonbury to end, its future form has been clouded by uncertainty. The event is due one of its regular fallow years in 2018, and Worthy Farm’s owner, Michael Eavis, has spoken of the possibility of an alternative event at a different site, called Variety Bazaar, possibly in 2019 or 2021. Emily Eavis, the festival’s organiser, remains confident that Glastonbury will return to Worthy Farm in 2019. “I think we’re most likely going to come back here in 2019 after the fallow year in 2018,” she told the Guardian in January. “Then 2020 is our 50th anniversary. And 2021, we may then do a show somewhere else, which we’re calling the Variety Bazaar. But none of this is set in stone.”Michael Eavis has said the long-term plan is to put on Variety Bazaar every fifth year, in Glastonbury’s fallow year.Both Eavises – as well as the 135,000 ticketholders, and the tens of thousands who work at the festival – will be hoping for more clement weather than last year, when heavy rain in the run-up to the event caused problems in the car parks, with a spillover effect in the form of massive traffic queues on the approaches to the site, as well as fields of mud on the event itself. Many stages kicked off late on the opening day, as woodchips were dispersed to make the area at the front of the stage safe for fans. Eavis said of the conditions: “I’ve never seen mud like it in my whole life.”Full list of confirmed actsRadioheadFoo FightersEd SheeranThe xxThe NationalBiffy ClyroKaty PerryBarry GibbRoyal BloodStormzyChicMajor LazerAlt-JBoy Better KnowLordeSolangeRun the JewelsLaura MarlingKris KristoffersonThe JacksonsEmeli SandéPhoenixFirst Aid KitJusticeAanderson .Paak and the Free NationalsHaimToots and the MaytalsFather John MistyThe Flaming LipsDizzee RascalWarpaintBadBadNotGoodMetronomyAnnie MacKanoGoldfrappSleaford ModsKate TempestWileyDynamoThe Can ProjectThundercatThe AvalanchesClean BanditGeorge EzraGlass AnimalsThe CourteenersSamphaDJ ShadowLondon GrammarRideSonghoy BluesLittle DragonKaiser ChiefsWild BeastsAngel OlsenThe Lemon TwigsNinesModeratRag’n’Bone ManCraig DavidCirca WavesFuture IslandsAni DiFrancoNadia RoseShaggyBritish Sea PowerMark LaneganThe MoonlandingzFrank Carter and the RattlesnakesTemplesHalseyThe Cinematic OrchestraTove LoSasha and John DigweedJoe GoddardBoys NoizeKurupt FMNoisiaDeclan McKennaLoyle CarnerLisa HanniganBirdyMartha WainwrightAll We AreGirl RayBustedSophie Ellis-BextorKiefer SutherlandThis story was amended on 30 March 2017, after two artists were removed from the list of performers, and on 28 April 2017, after further artists were added to the lineup.
