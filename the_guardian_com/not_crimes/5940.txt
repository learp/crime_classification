Jam-making by members of the Women’s Institute is normally seen as a fun and essentially benign activity – not a way of killing Nazis.The Hay festival heard that during the second world war WI branches vigorously debated the consequences of a German invasion and jam was central.“They got very worked up about their jam,” said the academic Maggie Andrews, author of a revised history of the WI called The Acceptable Face of Feminism. “There are lovely descriptions and debates about what they would do if an invasion happens in about 1940-41, which didn’t look unlikely.”One woman, she said, decided she would smash her jars of jam and deliberately kept a hammer nearby “because starved Germans would kill themselves by trying to eat jam with glass in it”.Another wrote that it was good for the spirit as well as having obvious practical benefits.Cecily McCall wrote: “Jam-making was constructive and non-militant … for the belligerent, what could be more satisfying than fiercely stirring cauldrons of boiling jam and feeling that every pound was one step closer to defeating Hitler.”Women's Institute at 100: as pleasingly bolshie as ever More seriously, the WI successfully campaigned for equal compensation for war injuries, correcting rules that said a man’s leg, for example, was worth more than a woman’s.They also got heavily involved in postwar housing, demanding that female architects were used and working-class women were included on housing committees.Andrews was arguing that the WI has always had a strong political and campaigning side to it – it is not all “jam and Jerusalem” and never has been.Describing the WI as the “acceptable face of feminism”, Andrews said its origins were heavily intertwined with the women’s suffrage movement.Even in the early days the WI debated important issues and its members were as likely to be listening to a talk on bolshevism as they were sightseeing in Italy.Different institutes have different views, however, a situation that still exists today.Andrews gave the example of the subject of venereal disease, an important topic in the 1920s which the leadership said should be discussed. A branch in West Sussex decided there was no need while a branch in Cambridgeshire, near military bases, decided they must and needed to invite the whole local community.Andrews, a professor of cultural history, sympathised with one questioner who had avoided joining her institute because she found it too conservative and Conservative.She said that had always been the case because it was a federal organisation. In the early days there were even some institutes where the members sat in rows according to their social class.Somewhat controversially, she added: “My jury is still out on whether you can be a rightwing feminist.” A statement which would make a great debate at the next institute meeting.
