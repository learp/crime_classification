I have met more than 50 women who have decorated their skin with ink. Some of them got their first tattoo impulsively, others planned their design for years until they found the right artist. Some women just like the way tattoos look when they see their reflection in the mirror, others feel a deep connection to the symbols they have chosen to mark on their body.

But mainstream engagement with tattooed women seldom explores this. We may think tatoos are no longer taboo, but positive representations of tattooed women are few and far between.

It began in 2013, when my friend Christina Theisen and I created a photography series to show that there was more than one type of woman who expresses herself through tattoos. The people we photographed came from around the UK and my hometown, Athens, Greece.

By exploring the layers that lie under the surface of our skin, this project has helped me understand how we navigate life through our bodies.

I stand taller. I am conscious of how I move. I love this body for the art on it. At 62, this a gift.”womenwithtattoos.co.uk      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Beccy Rimmer.
