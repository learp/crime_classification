Singer Adele was forced to temporarily halt a concert in Sydney after a fan suffered a cardiac arrest.Footage of Friday night’s concert at the ANZ Stadium filmed by fans attending the Australian leg of her tour shows the singer becoming concerned when medics arrived to attend to a woman in the audience. She can be heard asking the band to stop, saying: “I’m sorry, there’s fireworks in this one and I don’t want to scare them. “Is it OK to carry on? OK. Sorry, someone got hurt. I’m really sorry.” The 47-year-old woman was taken to hospital and was confirmed to have suffered a cardiac arrest. Concertgoer Daniel Lowe told Australia’s 9 News: “Security staff were trying to rouse her because they assumed she fainted. It took a full song for the actual on-site medics to respond. “They then started performing chest compressions for a good 15 to 20 minutes until ambulance officers arrived with proper equipment.” Lowe added that Adele was “visibly upset for the rest of the show”.“She wasn’t as perky and smiley as she was as before,” he said. Another fan, Meg Rylance, told Daily Mail Australia that she was sitting near the woman who collapsed. She said: “Adele stopped the concert. She actually seemed really tearful.” 'Married now': Adele confirms she has tied the knot with long-term partner Also during the performance, Adele explained to the crowd that she might struggle to hit some of the low notes in her Oscar-winning James Bond theme tune Skyfall, as she had written it during pregnancy when she sounded “like a man”. She said: “When I wrote that song, I was heavily pregnant. “And a side effect or symptom, however you felt about your pregnancy, was my voice got a lot lower, so my larynx dropped. “Any other females here sound like a man when they were pregnant? No, just me? OK. “Basically, that’s why the verse is so very low. That’s the reason, and these days I do struggle to get down there, so do bear with me, all right?”
