Authors, librarians and gallery staff joined thousands of campaigners on a protest march against widespread cuts to cultural services.The children’s laureate, Chris Riddell, and the former children’s laureate Michael Rosen, who has been a vocal critic of government cuts, were among those who massed outside the British Library in London on Saturday before marching to a rally in Trafalgar Square.Some libraries deserve to close, says 'digital inclusion' charity Since the government started cutting council funding in 2010, 340 libraries have closed nationwide as non-essential services bear the brunt of local authority cuts.Three public sector unions – Unite, Unison and the Public and Commercial Services union – spoke out over library closures before the march, issuing stark warnings over a “national crisis” in the state of free-to-use, well-stocked and well-staffed libraries, museums and galleries. Alex Flynn, Unite’s head of media and campaigns, said: “It’s been very good natured, but people have been clear in the message that libraries are vital to our communities; they are vital for education and empowering people and that libraries should not be cut.

We would hope the government takes note.”Speaking before Saturday’s demonstration, Unite officer Fiona Farmer described the cuts to local government funding as “an act of cultural and educational vandalism”.“Libraries are the gateway to knowledge, learning and enjoyment for all ages of people from all walks of life,” she said. “Yet more and more communities are seeing their library disappear or service diminish because of librarian cuts or failed privatisation.”The unions have warned that in addition to cutting swaths of services, museum and gallery visitor services are being privatised as a way of cutting costs in the short term.PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: “Given the clear benefits arts and culture bring to our society and our economy, cuts to libraries, museums and galleries represent everything wrong with the Tories’ approach to public spending. “While institutions are closing, privatising services or charging for access, the staff who guard our nation’s cultural treasures are languishing on low pay and insecure contracts.”A spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: “Libraries are important to communities not only as places to borrow books, but as spaces where people can access a wide variety of information and services. “That’s why local authorities will have almost £200bn to spend on local services, including libraries, over the lifetime of this parliament. Local authorities have a statutory duty to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service and we have powers to ensure they comply.”
