The journey of science fiction from niche to mainstream popular culture is to be explored in a major exhibition that will run the gamut from Jules Verne to Godzilla to Star Wars.The Barbican centre in London announced the details of a sci-fi exhibition, which would, it said, be unprecedented in terms of scale and ambition using film, music, literature and visual art to explore the subject across the art centre’s full estate.It will be curated by the sci-fi historian and writer Patrick Gyger, director of  “le lieu unique” arts centre in Nantes, France. He said science fiction had lost its fringe status: “It is very strange and striking that when I was a teenager it made me an outcast and a nerd, I was a prime geek and now I’m director of a mainstream cultural institution and doing shows at the Barbican.“It is almost unbelievable how this fringe culture has translated in to the mainstream.”How Ray Harryhausen's animation has the edge on CGI | Brendon Connelly The summer 2017 show will borrow objects from the vast sci-fi collection of Microsoft’s co-founder, Paul Allen, whose museum in Seattle owns things such as Captain Kirk’s command chair from Star Trek.What will travel to London is not being revealed although curators said there would be almost 100 items from Allen’s collection.Confirmed exhibits for the show include concept art and models from the films Godzilla, Stargate and Dark City; and original art for Ray Harryhausen films such as Earth vs the Flying Saucers and The Valley of Gwangi.There will also be an outdoor screening of Stanley Kubrick’s classic 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and work by contemporary artists including Eija-Liisa Ahtila and the Australian two-person art collective Soda_Jerk.The show will be called Into the Unknown, not a reference, Gyger joked, to last week’s vote and will be part of the Barbican’s wider programme in 2017 celebrating film.Other 2017 highlights include Jude Law directed by Ivo Van Hove in Obsession, John Malkovich in a one-person music-theatre piece, and a celebration of the composers Steve Reich, Philip Glass and John Adams.Gyger said his show would offer much for diehard sci-fi fans to enjoy but added: “It is not an exhibition for fans only; it is aimed at a wide audience and also an art audience.”The immersive exhibition follows a model the centre established with its James Bond show in 2012 and its Digital Revolution exhibition in 2014.Neil McConnon, head of Barbican international enterprises, said: “We’re not taking the usual approach to a science fiction exhibition; this is not just models and maquettes behind glass, it is a much more experimental take on the subject. We’re coming at it from lots of perspectives and lenders and artists seem to be excited by that.”The popularity of science fiction as well as Game of Thrones-type fantasy seems as high as it ever has been, and Gyger said we were living in times where storytelling was particularly needed and craved. “In western Europe at least we are living the dystopian and utopian dreams of our great grandfathers and -mothers. We are in a world people imagined and also not so.“We are also in a world which has very few alternatives, there are no utopian projects out there … [apart from] having another car or new phone. The crisis we live in today is a crisis of ideas and what science fiction brings is our perspectives of other futures or at least another present – things could be different and I think that is needed at the moment.”• Into the Unknown: A Journey through Science Fiction is at the Barbican Centre 2 June-1 September 2017.
