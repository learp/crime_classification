Black Grape – Big Day in the NorthBig Day in the North is one of my favourite tracks. It also kicks off the Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe movie Virtuosity, and, if I say so myself, it looks and sounds great.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Echo and the Bunnymen – The Killing MoonThis track takes me back to the early to mid 1980s. Ocean Rain – what an album. I like The Cutter, too. The Bunnymen are one of my favourite bands.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Cast – Fine TimeI think all of Cast’s singles are great, especially this one from their album All Change. Looking forward to seeing them live.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Bentley Rhythm Ace – Bentley’s Gonna Sort You OutI remember hearing this song a lot in the 90s – what a tune!   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The House of Love – Shine OnOne of the releases from the early years of Creation records, from the late 80s. Another good song and with a pretty apt title for Shiiine On festival’s playlist!   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest
