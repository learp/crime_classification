My routine takes about an hour and a half. I like to play a classic Brazilian album called Elis and Tom by Regina Elis and Tom Jobim. It makes you think you are driving through Italy in a convertible in summer; it’s an instant mood-changer. When I do my own makeup, I limit my options: I have one Mac eye colour, a neutral shade with a bit of shimmer, plus eyeliner and subtle mascara. I wear a little foundation and put Laura Mercier concealer around my nose, underneath my eyes and on any dark spots. I love the French philosophy that everything starts with great-looking skin. For lips, I like Mac’s Ruby Woo, which I dab on my hand then rub in, so it looks as if your lips are tinted, rather than painted. I’m a fan of the upside-down blow dry and then smoothing out the top layers. My easy hair style is a low ponytail, but I’ll usually wear my hair down if I’m performing.Gizzi Erskine: ‘I have a few go-to outfits I dress up or down in’ I’ve started making my wardrobe a uniform: I find that the fewer options I have, the better my state of mind. I love a classic, white silk shirt with dark trousers or jeans or a dark, knee-length skirt: timeless clothes that are not too fussy always work. I used to wear heels, but I want to give them up. I’ve discovered this great French brand, Repetto, which does classic flat shoes in different colours. I’ve worked with many stylists, but they are all about giving you lots of ideas and shaking up your wardrobe; these days I want to go minimalist. Making a decision on even the smallest things, such as what shoes or what colour top to wear, is brain fuel spent – I’ve other things that I love to think about, to do with my music.• Katie Melua’s new album, In Winter, is released on 14 October.
