The track that currently gets the most rewinds Motörhead: Just ’Cos You Got the Power   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This constantly gets a rewind, but I’m usually at home by myself when it happens. I think it needs to enter the club realm soon.The track I wish I’d signed to my label Planetary Assault Systems: Return   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I remember flipping out so hard the first time I heard this. The melancholy sits so eloquently with the drive that keeps it going. Every time I hear it, I wish it would never end. The track that’s been unfairly slept on this year Sleep D: Karingal   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Very spicy stuff from my boys Sleep D. The whole EP is top dollar but this one in particular has that trippy ethereal vibe that makes you feel the high spirits.The best track by my favourite new artist Luis CL: It’s Getting Better   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Really glad we were able to have the honour of putting this one out on our label Superconscious. Luis is one of my favourite producers and a bit of an unsung hero in my opinion, and this song perfectly demonstrates his diversity.The track that should have been a crossover hit Jake ’The Snake’ Roberts: Snake Bit (WWE entrance theme)   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Vince McMahon’s wrestling enterprise might be “staged” or “faked”, but this rawkin’, wavey, Italo potential club banger is not.The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding Loredana Bertè: Number One   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This one really captures the feeling of sloppy drunk relatives and it’s so saucy. What’s not to like?The track I’d play at sunset in Ibiza E.V.O.E.: Este Amor   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This is probably one for the classic 80s Café del Mar-era Ibiza that I’d like to think exists but sadly doesn’t any more.The track I’d play at my funeral Neil Young: Rockin’ In The Free World   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I want my time to end with guns blazing. I want my casket put on to a rocket and fired into space while this is blasting over a big sound system.Francis Inferno Orchestra plays Sneaky Pete’s, Edinburgh, Fri
