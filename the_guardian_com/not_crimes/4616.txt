A red clay brick designed and sold by skateboarding brand Supreme is on sale on eBay for up to $1,000 (£772), after selling out in a single day.The item, part of the New York brand’s accessories line that has previously included a hammer, calculator and fire extinguisher, is branded with Supreme’s logo and has been highly anticipated by fashion gurus since its preview last month. How skatewear grew up It sold out at its original price of $30 within minutes on Thursday, and has since appeared online with extremely high price tags. While it is unclear whether the brick was released as a statement, a joke or as part of a secret endorsement, some have speculated that Supreme might be playing on the term “bricking a fit” – to put together a failed outfit.“I don’t know why, I just think having a Supreme brick would be funny. I’d also like to store it in this lucite box,” Max Berlinger, GQ style editor, said in August.One Reddit user has also taken the time to point out that it would cost millions of dollars to buy enough Supreme bricks to build an actual house. “So I did the maths and calculated how many bricks it’d take to build a 2,400-square-foot home, which is 117,600 bricks. I then just took the cost of the Supreme brick, I made it $40 to include the shipping and such. So, 117,600 x 40 = $4,704,000. Thank you.”Another user commented: “That’s just for a bare ass house. No insulation, no electric wiring, no cable wiring, no internet wiring. That doesn’t event account for floors. Either you’d spend extra money to have brick floors, or it would just be dirt. I know exposed brick drives up the price of living spaces, especially in apartments in New York … I wonder if the resell price for bricks would affect the Supreme brick housing market? I mean, you’d figure that a brick could very well go for like $60-70 resale if it’s extremely hyped. That would make your house worth a little over $7m at $60 per brick. This might be a good business investment.”Though the point or purpose of the brick might never be revealed, social media users have been quick to share their thoughts and pictures of their purchase.
