The wind strengthens and a few spots of rain begin to fall. The long grass and reeds sway and rustle to provide a soundtrack of washing waves, incongruous here on this marsh in the middle of the Arun valley, beside the South Downs. Only the falling qwa-qwa-qwa calls of a large group of mallards, dirty and unkempt in their eclipse plumage, can be heard above the swooshing grass. Otherwise it's quiet. As is usual at this time, rare birds are popping up along the Sussex coast, but at Waltham Brooks it seems like a long wait for new arrivals, a sort of phoney autumn.Red admiral butterflies flick up from the grass and waft in the wind, tossed along like little pieces of blackened newspaper blown from a fire, wing tips glowing white and ember-red. A large, dark-brown shape moves low over the long grass, suspended in the air from its broad, sail-like wings. It looks down as it gently strokes the air with its wing tips, before flapping and floating on across the field. It's a "cream crown" – a young or female marsh harrier with splashes of creamy white on its head and throat. This bird is an adult female, with pale leading edges on her wings.Extinct in Britain by 1900 as a result of habitat loss and hunting, the marsh harrier recovered, only to be reduced to one breeding pair in the 1970s. But the ban on organochlorine pesticides and habitat restoration have seen the birds return in their breeding strongholds in eastern counties. Although a few pairs now breed in Sussex, it is more likely this bird has come from East Anglia or northern Europe. Gradually she moves away, until she disappears behind some trees. I stay for a while, waiting for her to re-emerge, but she never does. She must have moved down the valley towards the coast. She will winter there, or fly on to Spain or north Africa.
