I don’t want to tell you what this look is inspired by. Because you have to admit this dress is pretty, yet I know you are going to hate me once I tell you whom I’m channelling. It’s going to be like that moment when someone compliments you on the miso clams you made for dinner and you say you found the recipe in a Gwyneth Paltrow cookbook, and they look as if you’d admitted you found the clams in a skip. You know the look. The one when you can tell by the eyes that someone is willing themselves not to wrinkle their nose.The Coco Chanel quote about fashion reflecting the world we live in is a cliche, yes, but a cliche because it is true. If you had been asleep under a rock for a decade, and you woke up in 2016, the element of modern life that would strike you as even weirder than people still wearing skinny jeans would be how obsessed we are with our phones. So it makes sense, really, that the new style icon making her influence felt on the way we dress lives in our phones. Yes, 1954 had Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina, 1967 had Catherine Deneuve in Belle de Jour; 2016, meanwhile, has the dancing lady emoji in her ruffled red dress.I don’t believe it is a coincidence that the flamenco-styled crimson dress is suddenly as ubiquitous in fashion as winky-face keyrings and smiley cushions are on market stalls and at souvenir shops. At the Cannes film festival, no red carpet was complete without scarlet ruffles. And this dress is by no less than Self Portrait, the thinking woman’s party dress label; you will see it around this summer, mark my words.What I wore this week: the boho blouse | Jess Cartner-Morley The point about the dancing lady emoji is not just that when you spend your day staring at your phone she is the most glamorous person in your orbit, it’s also about what she represents. A single dancing lady means: this is going to be fun. She says, I can’t wait. She stands for joie de vivre and party spirit. Repeated dancing ladies mean: I got stuck into the pink wine early, and am already a bit drunk. What’s not to love?PS: those miso clams are good, too. I also recommend the chicken piccata.
