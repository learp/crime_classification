Inarritu Photograph: Paul Drinkwater/APIt was a night that started with a load of crass jokes, which then delivered its fair share of shocks before finishing with the familiar sight of Alejandro Inarritu holding a golden object over his head.The TV categories were full of shocks, mostly provided by surprise winner Mozart in the Jungle which won two awards, while Steve Jobs took a brace as well.  Branded as “the biggest party of the year” by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globe Awards are traditionally viewed as the fun, slightly tipsy cousin of Hollywood’s awards show circuit.That didn’t lessen the delight of the team behind the night’s big biggest winner, The Revenant, which won a fleet of top prizes:, awards for director Alejandro González Iñárritu, star Leonardo DiCaprio, and the top award of the night: best dramatic motion picture.Read our roundup piece from Scott Bixby.
