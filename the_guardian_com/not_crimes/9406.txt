The track that currently gets the most rewinds Oren Ambarchi ft Ricardo Villalobos, Joe Talia and Will Guthrie et al: Hubris Part 1   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest So effortlessly beautiful, with the sickest chord combinations. How I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall during the production.The track I wish I’d signed to my label G Marcell: BeatBr8ker    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Comprehensively swamping the two biggest bases in my quest for dancefloor badness, this track is at the same time quite weird and very banging.The track I wish I’d never playedJoy Orbison: Fuerza   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Everything about this track is exactly what I would give my right arm to be able to do and it kills me that I can’t even touch its shifty little details. It’s like a teasing, greasy piglet.The track I’d play to show off my eclectic tastes Barney Wilen: 14 Temps A drifting journey through 70s Africa, full of overwhelming generosity and occasional tragedy. The story behind the recording of this and the rest of the tracks on the wonderful double LP Moshi is as incredible as the music, and the lovely liner notes don’t even tell it all.The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding Charanjit Singh: Raga Megh Malhar   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Judging by her bafflement-turned-enthusiasm for the profusion of dancefloor oddities at my wedding, my aunt would be happy to lose a few degrees of dignity to this one.The ideal festival track Claude Young: DJ-Kicks    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest One of the meatiest, most beautiful techno tracks there ever was, this would be my ideal tune in a parallel world where I’m a big dance crowd DJ. It whips up a frenzy, then it’s time for a little breather, and finally the whole thing pounds back in.The track I’d play at my funeralChopin: Nocturne in E Flat Major Op 9, No 2    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest When I was small, my mum would often play this and the other Nocturnes on the piano. It’s one of the first pieces of music I can remember hearing, and still so beloved. Perfect to go out on.Karen Gwyer plays The Cellar, Oxford, on 16 April
