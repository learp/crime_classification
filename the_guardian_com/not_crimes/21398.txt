Johnny Marr has unveiled details of his autobiography, entitled Set the Boy Free. The guitarist says his aim in his debut book is to channel the experience of “transcendence”, writing in a statement: “I wanted to convey a feeling of breaking free, that has been a constant throughout my life.”It is, he wrote, “a feeling that expresses itself as escape and discovery … I found it through rock’n’roll and art, and a journey living both in the modern world.”Born in 1963 in Manchester to Irish parents, Marr set up his first band aged 13 while living on a council estate in Wythenshawe. In the early 80s, he met and formed a band with Morrissey. Their inimitable song-writing partnership defined the Smiths until Marr left the group in 1987.
