Zakąski are what I call Polish party food. Meaning simply “a bite of something”, these are dishes to be shared in a spirit of celebration, most often washed down with vodka. They are the tapas of Poland, a reflection of our national hospitality culture – “a guest in the home is god in the home”, as the old Polish proverb dictates. Even now that Polish restaurants are having a revival (and a very exciting time it is in that arena), the tradition of welcoming guests to the home is alive and well. And when there are guests, there are always zakąski on the table.Back in the communist days of my childhood, people were always having parties. There was always a wedding, a christening or a birthday to prepare for. Of course, once the vodka was flowing, the complaints would be too, but these gatherings were a way for everyone to focus on positive things rather than the dire social realities of the time.Each person would cook a dish or two (and plenty of it); chairs would get dragged over from other apartments and arranged in tight spirals so that as many people could fit in as possible. Tables would be laden with myriad dishes – breads, pickles, cold cuts of meat and kiełbasa (Polish sausage), various different herrings and smoked fish; all sorts of salads. And as the party progressed, more dishes would keep appearing – soups, warm dishes, cakes – with shots drunk at regular intervals.Drinking vodka isn’t just for fun, it’s seen as a commitment, a journey, in the slavic culture – and not always a pleasant one. It’s more of a search for truth – though whether anyone finds it or not is another matter. I remember as a child often being cornered by some distant family member and being forced to listen to their life story on repeat, while trying to find eye contact with someone who could rescue me.Depending on the season and availability of ingredients, a spread of zakąski can comprise many different things. You need at least four or five dishes, even if it’s a very small party, as it’s all about variety. Your array should also include some good quality bread, pickles and cold cuts (all available in Polish shops). Other than that, my approach is fairly untraditional.Herrings are very popular in Poland but are rarely eaten with something sweet. The prune sauce is a twist on a regional sauce with raisins I came across in the northern province of Kaszuby, and it’s become one of my favourites, if a curious one. The millet groats salad is an adaptation of the mayonnaise-laden salads of my childhood. It has some mayonnaise in it - for flavour - but isn’t drowned in it. While we love kasza (grains) in Poland, they are not traditionally used in cold salads, which in my eyes is a waste – they are perfect for this salad, which works with any seasonal vegetable. The creamy dressing with dill makes everything taste undeniably eastern European.Ending the meal with a dried-fruit soup is always a good idea after a day-long feast – it’s incredibly good for your digestive system. Children love its sweetness too and my nine-month old daughter, Delfi, can’t get enough of it.Polish parties are family-orientated and inclusive. There’s always a spare seat at our Christmas table for an unexpected guest. And this is the true spirit of zakąski, whether the party is crowded and riotous or quiet and intimate. You can prolong any occasion for a very long time while trying new dishes, drinking vodka or champagne, and talking.Indeed, these parties would go on until the last person left, which at times could even be the next morning. My partner, Delfi and I have just moved into a new home with Kaspar and Coco (our two cats). And even though it’s still a construction site, I envisage having zakąski parties here in the future, with everyone pitching in to help prepare cocktails and pile the tables high with plates full of small bites.Marinated herrings with prunesDelicious on top of sourdough toast.Serves 41 large shallot, finely choppedRapeseed oil, for frying100g prunes, pitted and chopped3 tbsp tomato puree½ tsp paprika220g soused herring fillets Sourdough toast, thinly sliced, to serve1 Fry the shallot in the oil under a lid for about 5 minutes, or until softened.2 Add the prunes and a splash of water, then continue to fry for a further 2-3 minutes.3 Add the tomato puree, the paprika and some more water – about 50ml.

Mix well and transfer to the fridge for at least an hour – preferably overnight.Millet grain salad with squash and a creamy dill vinaigretteMillet is an ancient and very popular grain in Poland. It’s versatile too – you can even make veggie burgers out of it. If you can’t get hold of millet, feel free to substitute it for buckwheat (untoasted) or pearl barley. Sarepska mustard is one of our Polish secrets – it works beautifully in any vinaigrette.Serves 4200g millet grainA pinch of salt1 tbsp butter1 small squash, peeled and chopped1 green or yellow courgette, choppedMild olive or rapeseed oil3-4 heirloom tomatoes or other good quality tomatoes, choppedFor the vinaigrette 4 tbsp olive oilJuice of half a lemon1 tsp mustard (ideally sarepska)Salt and white pepper1 tbsp mayonnaise2 tbsp fresh dill, finely chopped1 tsp garlic salt or ½ tsp garlic granules mixed with ¼ tsp sea salt1 Cover the millet in 2cm of cold water, add a pinch of salt. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer for 20 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed. Add the butter and leave to steam, then cool. Set the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.2 Put the squash and courgette on a baking tray. Drizzle them with the oil, season, then roast for about 40 minutes. Cool.3 Make the vinaigrette by combining the olive oil, lemon juice, mustard and salt and white pepper. Whisk in the mayonnaise and, when the mixture is smooth, add the dill and the garlic salt, then stir to combine.4 Pour the vinaigrette over the millet, then combine with the chopped up tomatoes and roasted vegetables.Dried fruit soupThis is the ideal way to finish a zakąski meal. We always eat this at the end of our meal on Christmas Eve. There would be two other soups at various points in the evening before this one, which is served with the desserts.Serves 4 200g prunes, pitted and halved200g dried apricots100g dried apples2 cinnamon sticks1 tbsp cloves1 vanilla pod, cut open1 Put all the ingredients in a large pan and cover with 2.5 litres of water.
