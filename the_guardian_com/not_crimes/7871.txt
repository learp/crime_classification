The Weeknd has won a Grammy for best urban contemporary album. The Toronto singer’s second studio album Beauty Behind the Madness triumphed at the ceremony in LA, beating releases by The Internet, Kehlani, Miguel and Lianne La Havas.Abel Tesfaye, who creates the atmosphere of a decadent, debauched after-party with his R&B hybrid, first received critical praise for his mixtapes and debut album, Kiss Land. He was heralded as the fresh new voice of murky, melancholic soul, but it wasn’t until his follow-up, Beauty Behind the Madness, that the Drake associate’s profile elevated into the mainstream; most notably with the crossover success of Can’t Feel My Face and Earned It, a track featured on the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack. The Weeknd: Beauty Behind the Madness review – a dark seduction of the mainstream With his sultry tales of late night lamentation and delicate, falsetto vocals, the enigmatic musician cites Michael Jackson as his key influence on his music. “When Michael died, it felt like part of my family died. I want [my fans] to know that my music is for them and if, god forbid, anything happened [to me], it would be like a piece of them is gone. That’s what he made me feel,” he told Pitchfork in 2015. “That’s what I want to do. I’m grabbing that side of me and putting it out to the world—and the R. Kelly side, and the Prince side. All three are my inspirations, and you hear all of that on this album.”Described as “creepy psychosexual narco content”, the Weeknd has become known as the dark prince of emotional R&B. “He walked a fine line between celebrating excess and undercutting it with deep self-loathing. He let the listener fill in the blanks,” explains Ben Rayner, pop critic of the Toronto Star.Aside from his urban contemporary album award, Tesfaye is up for a further six awards in total at tonight’s ceremony: record of the year and best pop solo performance for Can’t Feel My Face, album of the year, best R&B performance, best song written for visual media, and best R&B song for Earned It (50 Shades of Grey).
