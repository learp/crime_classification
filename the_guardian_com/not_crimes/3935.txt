The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with Alice Coltrane: Galaxy In Turiya   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I like the idea of a grand spiritual opening. As every DJ says, I like to take the people on a journey. Sometimes I think of my journey as transcending any defined existence: a spiritual or intergalactic place.The best track by my favourite new artist Yussef Kamaal: Lowrider   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest These guys have exploded these past 12 months. They’re a very modern jazz band that have emerged from hip-hop, grime, broken beat, house and dub.The track that currently gets the most rewinds Sir Spyro: Topper Top   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This is massive. It’s like the underground version of Skepta’s Shutdown. It strongly defines a scene that’s been building in and around the UK for some time.The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding Burning Flames: Workey Workey   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This will be heard at many an auntie’s wedding. I can’t recount the kind of moves and shapes I’ve seen. It’s not something a younger family member should have experienced.The track I wish I’d never played Julio Bashmore: Au Seve   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It sounds like I’m dissing this track but I’m not… I love it and think Julio is a great guy. But I played this at Fabric a few years ago, then when I was in the taxi home they played it on a really awful radio station. I felt so dirty.The track I’d play to show off my eclectic tastes Kim Jung Mi: Now   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I was out in Korea last year with Peanut Butter Wolf, Earl Sweatshirt, Knxwledge and the Egyptian Lover. We went record shopping and all bought a copy of this album as soon as the record store owner put it on. I then played it at Form festival in Arizona. The mood suited the desert as much as Seoul.The track that should have been a crossover hit Ray BLK: 50/50   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest She’s so heavy. Yet another artist that represents the vibes and energy right now in the UK. A young woman with her own identity to be seen, heard and felt.Thris Tian plays Soup Kitchen, Manchester, Fri
