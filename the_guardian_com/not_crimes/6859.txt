Much like the European Court of Human Rights, Eurovision doesn’t have much to do with the EU. If the UK votes for Brexit in June, its continuing place in the international song contest will be assured, not least because Britain is one of the “big five” Eurovision countries who contribute the most funding to the event.Nevertheless. Founded by the European Broadcasting Union back in 1956, Eurovision is a symbol of pan-European cultural celebration, even if they let Australia take part nowadays.And even Eurovision is not immune to the wider political mood. While political statements are banned from Eurovision song lyrics, the contest doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Voting patterns still reflect old geopolitical rivalries and alliances.If you’re a Eurovision fan, let us know your views. What does Britain’s relationship with Europe mean to you?
