At the opening night of the Archibald prize in July, one painting commanded more double takes than the rest: Nick Stathopoulos’ portrait of Sudanese refugee and lawyer, Deng Adut – so real to life it could have been a photo. On Wednesday Stathopoulos was awarded the public-voted people’s choice award for the hyperreal piece, which took him four months to complete – more time than he has ever taken on a single painting. The portrait, titled Deng, is Stathopoulos’ first public choice winner and his fifth entry to be selected as an Archibald finalist. A “clear winner” among the pool, it comes with a $3,500 cash prize.Archibald finalists 2016: from artists to activists to celebrity chefs – in pictures The win is something of a vindication for Stathopoulos. In 2014, the artist was “astonished and disappointed” when his portrait of the author Robert Hoge, titled Ugly, did not make the finals of the Archibald or the Doug Moran prizes; it went on to win the people’s choice at Salon des Refuses, which features work that did not make the Archibald’s finalists exhibition. “I tend to think it’s all a bit of a crap shoot,” he said at the time.In a statement to the press on Wednesday, Stathopoulos said he has spent his whole life developing his style and process, which he described as “time-consuming, laborious and painstaking”. He commended the public for their selection of his work.“I don’t think we give the general public enough credit when it comes to matters of art. In my experience they are very clued in. And when it comes to the Archibald prize people’s choice award, they seem to get it right every year,” he said. “The critics may balk, but the public always manages to pick my favourite paintings. So I’m delighted they chose my portrait of Deng Adut. It’s a great affirmation.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Archibald prize finalist Nick Stathopoulos’s portrait of Deng Adut, titled Deng Photograph: Mim Stirling/AGNSWThe Art Gallery of New South Wales director, Michael Brand, said: “This vote of appreciation by visitors to the Archibald recognises both the meticulous skill of artist Nick Stathopoulos and the wonderful contribution Deng Adut has made – and is making – to Australian life.”Archibald prize 2016 review – a typically debatable portrait beats some very worthy work Deng Adut was a child soldier in Sudan before fleeing the country, arriving in Australia in 1998, putting himself through law school and becoming a refugee advocate, lawyer and community leader. Stathopoulos first came across his name through a marketing campaign for Western Sydney University, where Adut studied. “It must be some sort of magic, but Nick really captured what’s underneath my skin in his painting,” said Adut on Wednesday. “It can be hard for me to look at – not least because my nose looks so big!”The Archibald exhibition, which was won by Louise Herman for her portrait of Barry Humphries, is at the Art Gallery of New South Wales until 9 October.
