Sarah Wood, who founded tech firm Unruly, has been named Veuve Clicquot businesswoman of the year.Unruly, which works in 15 countries with more than 200 staff, helps video adverts go viral. Wood champions diversity in the workplace – half her employeesare female – and has set up mentoring programmes to help women become more confident in business.The judges cited her continued success and status as a female role model as two of the key reasons why she was awarded the title.Wood is a London tech ambassador, an associate lecturer at the University of Cambridge, and co-founded City Unrulyversity, a free pop-up university in London with a mission to inspire the next generation of Tech City entrepreneurs.Wood said she had no specific guidance for girls considering a business career: “Advice is overrated – it’s much better to trust your own convictions and have role models a few months older than you so you can learn from what they have achieved.”Wood sold Unruly to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp last year for £58m. Wood and her two co-founders said they would stay on at Unruly, which now operates as part of News UK and reports to Rebekah Brooks.Veuve Clicquot’s New Generation award went to Cassandra Stavrou, who founded popcorn company Propercorn. Since After launching in 2011, Google was her first customer and she now sells to leading supermarkets, airlines, shops and schools and the business now works with more than 15,000 retailers as it has emerged as one of the fastest growing brands in the UK.Stavrou said she always wanted to run her own business and believes people should be prepared to take a risk if they think they have a good idea.
