Andrew Weatherall’s new album, Convenanza, is released on Friday 26 February – and we’ve got an exclusive stream of it for you to hear. As you might expect from a man who refuses to be bound by convention and tied to style, it’s a record of restless invention. As Alexis Petridis writes in a piece to be published tomorrow: “He’s singing again on Convenanza, a dubby, dark album that once more bears the influence of post-punk as well as Weatherall’s esoteric reading habits, this time involving early 20th-century central European literature: ‘I’m quite proud of the fact that I’ve made the first disco record to mention Hans Fallada and Robert Walser.’” Have a listen, and let us know what you think.
