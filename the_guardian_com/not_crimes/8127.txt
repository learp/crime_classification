An enormous, curvy, mushroom-like pavilion designed by the late architect Dame Zaha Hadid has been installed in the grounds of one of Britain’s grandest stately homes.For the last two weeks, workers have been unpacking and erecting the 23m-long structure, called Lilas, on the south lawn of Chatsworth House, the Derbyshire home of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire.It is a highlight of the annual Beyond Limits sculpture exhibition organised by Sotheby’s at Chatsworth and is for sale – although buyers without a substantial parcel of land might need to think twice.Simon Stock, the Sotheby’s specialist curating the show, said the pavilion and the historic backdrop were clearly very different, but “they don’t clash, they complement in a way the pyramid does at the Louvre. It is a very beguiling structure, it draws you in, it is an extraordinary thing”.The pavilion was an unexpected addition to the roster of temporary pavilions commissioned each year by the Serpentine Gallery in London. When rising steel prices meant the 2007 pavilion coming from artist Olafur Eliasson and architect Kjetil Thorsen was delayed, Hadid offered to step in with a stopgap      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Lilas pavilion was created for the Serpentine Gallery’s summer party in 2007.

But the timing undoubtedly added emotion to its exhibition.“It is very poignant,” said Peyton-Jones. “But all the more marvellous that this master work should be presented to remind us what an extraordinary contribution she made.”Stock said Chatsworth was an appropriate venue because of a historic precedent in the remarkable great conservatory that was built there in 1840 by the architect Joseph Paxton.It was in effect a vast greenhouse, 84m long, 37m wide and 19m high, and was the largest glass building in England until Paxton went further and created the Crystal Palace in London in 1851.Paxton’s conservatory, created when architects were using metal structures for the first time, was cutting edge; as was Hadid’s Lilas, a metalwork frame with a tensile fabric stretched over it.The conservatory lasted until the first world war, when a lack of coal meant it could not be heated and many plants died. It was demolished in 1920.Stock said installing Lilas had taken about two weeks and had been a challenge. “This is certainly the most complex undertaking we have done at Chatsworth, it is also one of the most imposing and beautiful.”He said there were many ways to describe Lilas and it was probably best to let visitors decide. “Is it principally sculptural? Is it a piece of architecture ... do you see it as a building, in other words? Do you see it as something organic that has grown out of the ground? It is all of those things combined.”It will be for sale, although Sotheby’s is not publicly saying for how much. If previous Serpentine pavilions are anything to go by, the price could be upwards of £500,000. That was the figure for which the gallery reportedly sold its 2013 pavilion designed by Sou Fujimoto, and Smiljan Radic’s 2014 pavilion was sold to the Hauser & Wirth gallery at Bruton in Somerset for £450,000. • This article was amended on 30 August 2016 to correct the size of the pavillion.
