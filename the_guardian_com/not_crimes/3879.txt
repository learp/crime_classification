      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Deluxe figurine playset, £22.95disneystore.co.ukTo adult eyes, this simple set of the film’s main characters might seem lacking in child appeal because it has no moving parts. Those eyes would be wrong. The children absolutely loved it, creating their own storylines and providing voices. “I found Dory!” said Charlie, seven. “Does that mean they have to cancel the film?” Others were too busy being growling sharks (yes, they growl, OK?) to comment.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Change & Chat Hank, £30.95disneystore.co.uk“Is that a bath toy?” asked Isabel, five, initially looking underwhelmed, possibly at the prospect of bathing. That was before the magic occurred. When you put this toy on a block of solid colour, the centre of Hank the Octopus changes to match. “Is it real magic?” asked Isabel. Naturally it is – even if it does need the help of three AAA batteries.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Happy tin, £5amazon.co.ukA great gift to share between siblings, this tin contains the story of the film, a colouring book, an activity book, pens, a large poster to colour in and stickers. And, as every young child knows, you can never have too many stickers. “Mummy, can I keep this for our holiday, for the plane?” asked Jack, five. “Err, we’re going to Devon, but, yeah, sure, if it keeps you quiet in the car …”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Filled pencil case, £12.95disneystore.co.uk“Wow! Can I use this underwater,” asked Sophie, seven. “It’s so cool!” Alas, this stationery set does not come with a bottom-of-the-ocean guarantee, but it has a charming porthole-like design and is filled with coloured pencils and other stationery staples. Well, except actual staples. Great for creating new Finding Dory art or writing their own fishy tales.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  My Friend Dory, £24.99amazon.co.ukThis sweet rendition of Dory reacts to touch with different sounds and phrases from the film. She even changes facial expression, though do be careful that mini fish fiends don’t put her in water, as this is not a water toy. “She’s my best friend!” said Charlie, seven. “Even if she will forget me in three seconds.”
