You think of the great actor/director teams, like Scorsese and De Niro …”In a statement sent to Vanity Fair, Cameron said: “The world is a lesser place for his passing.” He went on: “I hope that amid the gaudy din of Oscar night, people will take a moment to remember this wonderful man, not just for all the hours of joy he brought to us with his vivid screen presence, but for the great human that he was.”       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt in 1996 hit Twister.
