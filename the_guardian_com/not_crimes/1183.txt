Victoria’s Environment Protection Authority has charged four companies with air pollution offences following a comprehensive investigation into the devastating Hazelwood mine fire which occurred in February 2014 and burned for 45 days. Hazelwood mine manager charged with 10 offences over 2014 Morwell fire Surrounding suburbs were left encased in ash and smoke and the EPA alleges residents were exposed to toxic carbon monoxide which can cause serious tissue damage and death. The EPA alleged that as a result of the fire, the atmosphere in the La Trobe Valley became noxious and harmful or potentially harmful to people’s health, welfare, safety or property.The companies charged under the Environmental Protection Act were National Power Australia Investments Limited, Hazelwood Pacific Pty Ltd, Australian Power Partners BV, and Hazelwood Churchill Pty Ltd.The charges allege the companies, as occupiers of the Hazelwood coalmine when the fire occurred, caused pollution of the atmosphere in breach of the Act.“As this matter is now before the court, and the Environment Protection Authority’s investigation is continuing, it would be inappropriate to make any further comment,” the EPA said in a statement.Morwell after the mine fire: fear, anger and an independent streak Last month, WorkSafe Victoria also charged the Hazelwood Power Corporation with 10 breaches of the Occupational Health and Safety Act.This included five charges of failing to maintain a workplace that was safe and without risks to health, and five charges of failing to ensure that people other than its employees were not exposed to risks to their health and safety arising from the conduct of its operations.The haazelwood mine fire inquiry was due to deliver its final report into the rehabilitation of the coalmine on Tuesday, but on Monday its board sought an extension due to one of its board members suffering from a medical condition. The Victorian Labor government reopened the inquiry into the fire after being elected in November 2014, to investigate whether the fire contributed to an increase in deaths in the Latrobe Valley.
