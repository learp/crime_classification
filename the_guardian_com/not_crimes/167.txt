"A penny for them?" repeated the elderly gentleman, echoing my question. "Nay, lad, that would be telling." He was seated on the bench above St Margaret's church at Beck Wythop and wore a Herdwick wool jumper that was the colour of Skiddaw slate. Resting his gnarled hands on the ram's-horn handle of his walking stick, he continued taking in the Arcadian view across the northern end of Bassenthwaite, the only so-called "lake" in the Lake District, and out towards the "pudding basin" mound of Binsey, a favourite of Melvyn Bragg.There was so much to see from all around the emerald flanks of Sale Fell, which was also one of Alfred Wainwright's choice areas. "Nothing pleased me more then the shy Wythop Valley," he wrote. "It is so easy to walk, so charming and unspoilt, a little tranquil world apart."The buttercup yellow flowers of celandines were starting to appear, soon to be followed by the snow-white lather of hawthorn and blackthorn on the lower slopes – adding to the pink froth of wild cherry in bloom. As it was, a breeze fanned the lake to create cat's-paws, and the white sails of boats close to Scarness Bay across the water below Ullock Pike and Dodd Wood appeared to be in danger of capsizing. It was near here Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote in the poem Le Morte d'Arthur about the sword Excalibur being thrown.Above Wythop Wood, which overlooks the ancient coaching inn, the Pheasant, a buzzard wheeled high into the azure blue, making its plaintive call and, in the direction of Embleton, a kestrel hovered above an unsuspecting vole suddenly plummeting as the musty scent of coconut wafted up from a blaze of yellow gorse nearby. "A penny for my thoughts," repeated this Cumbrian veteran. "Nay, lad. Sometimes I sits and thinks and sometimes I just sits."
