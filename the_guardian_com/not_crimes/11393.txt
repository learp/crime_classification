Authors Patrick Gale and Mark Billingham have slammed a government fund to support innovation in public libraries as “a sop, a smokescreen and a whitewash” that does nothing to help the fundamental crisis facing the sector. They were joined by Horrid Henry creator Francesca Simon in criticising the ability of the £4m scheme to rescue the beleaguered sector.Though Billingham welcomed investment in libraries, he said: “It is hard not to view this as a smokescreen – a sop – to those who have long fought the cause of libraries while their funding nationwide continues to be slashed.” Describing himself as increasingly depressed at the state of the sector, Gale told the Guardian: “This is a kind of whitewash and it makes me cross.”Their comments followed Arts Council England and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport announcing that 30 local authority library services would receive a total of £3.9m from the Libraries Opportunities for Everyone Innovation fund, which was launched in December as part of the government’s libraries taskforce to create a sustainable public libraries service in England.Recipients of the money include £125,121 for a soft-play facility built around the theme of children’s literature in Greenwich and a state-of-the-art digital and electronic centre to help users of Hull central library explore their creativity in arts, science and technology, which received £50,000. Other recipients of the cash include emergent readers in Norfolk, who will receive £98,020, and £50,000 to trial a whole family “learning hub” in the Wrekin.Billingham said he was sceptical these schemes could change the fortunes of a sector that has lost £25m through local authority spending cuts in the past year, and where closures are predicted to double over the next 10 years. “A new soft-play area in Eltham does not make up for the closure of an entire library elsewhere, and a little support for emergent readers in one area cannot possibly compensate for the cuts that have robbed entire communities of this opportunity,” he said.According to Gale, who lives in Cornwall, the plans offer local people little help in combating longstanding issues. “This area has pretty major literacy problems and is one of the most deprived in the country,” he said. “I get fed up that we’ve been given bouncy play areas as if that should make up for the lack of books on shelves.” The failure to invest in opening hours and book stock was compounding problems of generational literacy in an area where the number of illiterate adults was above the national average, he added. “Libraries in Cornwall fill a really important gap for children and adults who want to catch up on reading and can do it in their own way and without feeling judged.”Simon lent her support to Gale, saying: “Libraries first and foremost need to be open, with professional librarians and well-stocked shelves.” She welcomed the initiatives rewarded by ACE and the DCMS, but added: “They are also window dressing against a background of £180m-worth of funding cuts since 2010 and over 400 libraries closed.”Crime writer Peter James also welcomed the initiatives, saying it was vital for libraries to move with the times, but he added the schemes should not be seen as an alternative to libraries’ role as beacons of literacy within local communities. “The UK astonishingly and shockingly has one of the lowest literacy levels in the developed world – recently ranking 22 out of 24 countries examined – and the average reading age for 50% of prisoners in our jails is below 10 years old,” he said. “Our libraries are a key to improving these figures for all our futures.”Library campaigners welcomed support from authors, and added that the focus of government input should be to formulate a coherent national strategy to promote the core activity of libraries – lending books – and provide a long-term blueprint to enable the sector to survive swingeing cuts by councils trying to shore up other frontline services. Pointing to the fact that a third of library users had stopped using the service over the past decade, campaigner Desmond Clarke said: “There is a lack of strategic planning and rigorous assessment as to the effectiveness of projects.”At the professional librarians body Cilip, chief executive Nick Poole welcomed the money being pumped into individual schemes, but added: “There still remains an urgent need for effective leadership through a fully funded and evidence-based national public library plan for England to provide quality library services that meet the needs of communities.”
