Doctors at Sydney’s Royal Hospital for Women have reportedly complained to the board about the decision to appoint supermodel Miranda Kerr ambassador because she has been associated with views promoting a more “natural” approach.Kerr was appointed an ambassador of the Royal Hospital for Women Foundation in December and, in a large photo on the foundation’s homepage, invites visitors to “join me and save a baby today.” In the accompanying video, Kerr explains that she was born premature and encourages people to donate to pay for more humidicribs, saying, “as a mother, I know every baby’s life is worth it.”Miranda Kerr (@MirandaKerr)Proud 2 b ambassador 4 @royalforwomen.

Professor John Dwyer, president of Friends of Science in Medicine, told Mamamia that Kerr’s “scientifically naive” opinions made her an interesting choice.“She supports a whole of pseudo-scientific concepts and she’s the face of a foundation raising money for an academic, prestigious, orthodox medical hospital,” Dwyer said.Guardian Australia has contacted the Royal Hospital for Women Foundation for comment.
