A pewter plate that is the oldest European object to be left on Australian soil has been loaned to a Perth museum 400 years after it was originally nailed to a wooden post in Shark Bay, Western Australia.The flattened engraved plate was left by the Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog in 1616 in the Dutch East India company ship Eendracht, meaning unity or concord, which had arrived there en route to Java. It's not 'politically correct' to say Australia was invaded, it's history | Paul Daley In 1696 another Dutch explorer, Willem de Vlamingh, visited the same area and discovered the plate, taking it back to Batavia – modern day Jakarta – from where it found its way to the Netherlands.The Hartog dish, as it became known, is now usually held at Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum, but has been loaned to the Western Australian Maritime Museum to mark the 400th anniversary of Hartog’s visit. The plate was marked with an inscription, which translates as:  1616 the 25 October is here arrived the ship Eendraght of Amsterdam, the upper merchant Gillis Miebais of Liege, skipper Dirck Hatichs of Amsterdam. The 27 ditto (we) set sail for Bantam, the undermerchant Jan Stins, the first mate Pieter Dookes Van Bil. Anno 1616Hartog was the second recorded European to visit Australia after Willem Janszoon in 1605. The plate, made out of a flattened dinner bowl used on the ship, was left as a proof of the visit and was a practice taken up by later explorers.De Vlamingh who produced the first detailed map of the region, left his own plate to mark his explorations, which is now held permanently by the WA Maritime Museum.Indigenous treasures, briefly on loan to Australia, are about to be taken away – again The WA culture and arts minister, John Day, said given the fragility of the dish, it would probably be the last time it travelled outside the Netherlands.“This will be a unique opportunity for West Australians and visitors to WA to share in a precious piece of history that marks the beginning of our enduring connections with the Dutch people and their culture.”The exhibition, Accidental Encounters, also features artefacts from four Dutch wrecks found along the coast of WA, the Zeewijk (wrecked 1727), the Zuytdorp (wrecked 1712) and the Vergulde Draeck (wrecked 1656), as well as the earliest recorded Dutch wreck, the Batavia (wrecked 1629).
