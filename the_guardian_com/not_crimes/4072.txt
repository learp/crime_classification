What is it? A single move that combines a squat thrust, a push-up and a jump. Also, unequivocally the least amount of fun you will ever have in your life.How much does it cost? A burpee is free. The only price is the one you pay psychologically.What does it promise? The burpee is a functional full-body movement that works your arms, chest, quads, core, hamstrings and bum all at the same time. It is a very good way to improve conditioning and get fit.What’s it actually like? God, I hate burpees. I hate them with the strength of a thousand suns. I hate how easily they can be fitted into any class. I’ve done burpees in HIIT (high-intensity interval training) classes. I’ve done burpees in boxing classes. I even went to a spin class once where they made you get off your bike, do 10 burpees, then get back on the bike and keep pedalling. I never went back.The first burpee you ever do will be agony. You start off standing, then you squat down, putting your hands on the floor. You kick your legs back into a plank position, do a push-up, get back into the squat, stand up and jump. That’s just one burpee, and typically you will be expected to do several of them. They’re exhausting. However, they’re perhaps the best test of basic fitness around. If you can do 20 burpees with relative ease, you’re golden.Is it worth it: weighted squats – exercise review Best and worst bits They’re the worst at first – and they pretty much continue to be the worst for ever – but it’s an exercise you quickly improve at, and nothing makes you feel fitter than quick improvement.Is it worth it? Yes, but you’ll hate whoever made you do them.
