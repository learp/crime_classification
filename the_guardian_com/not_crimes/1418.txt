The BBC is aiming to bring some of the ingredients that have made The Great British Bake Off a hit to its revamp of Gardeners’ World, which returns to BBC2 on Friday.Earlier this year the corporation drafted in Paolo Proto, the producer responsible for the record-breaking last series of Bake Off, as well as a number of new presenters and strands such as “extreme gardening” .A major change is doubling the length of Gardeners’ World, which will remain anchored by popular host Monty Don, to an hour.Rav Wilding sues makers of Splash! after diving injury 'changed my life' “Gardeners’ World will be extended to hour-long episodes which will run from September until to the end of the series in late October,” said Proto, in a recent blog on the BBC website. “We are going to introduce a range of new strands with some new faces.”The new presenters include Frances Tophill from ITV’s Love Your Garden, who will “meet gardeners who garden in extreme conditions”. Others include “garden doctor” Nick Bailey; designer Adam Frost; Florence Headlam, who will cover city gardens; and Nick Macer, who will look at tropical plants.“These [new] strands will cover topics as diverse as tropical plants to city gardens and inspirational garden designers to the science of gardening,” said Proto. “We’ll spend time with head gardeners from some of the country’s leading gardens and meet passionate amateurs.”Gardeners’ World has a loyal following, attracting up to about 2.5 million viewers.Proto said that plans were currently being drawn up to mark a milestone next year.“Next year Gardeners’ World will celebrate its 50th anniversary and plans are being made to ensure it’s an unforgettable year for gardeners and our legion of loyal viewers,” he said.In 2009, the BBC extended Gardeners’ World to an hour and introduced a “cool wall”, but the revamp failed to impress viewers and the show returned to its 30-minute format.
