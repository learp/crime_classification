The furore over Google’s £130m deal with the UK taxman has triggered outrage among politicians, business figures and tax campaigners. It has also raised questions over the search engine group’s proximity to the corridors of power in Britain. An analysis of meetings between Google executives and senior politicians, as well as the regular appointments of political figures to major positions within the company’s PR machine, shows how the California-based tech company has become deeply entwined within the British political landscape.Senior politicians and GoogleMay 2006 Six months after becoming leader of the opposition, David Cameron speaks at the Google Zeitgeist Europe conference, telling delegates: “What Google has achieved is truly amazing”. He adds that he is “incredibly proud” the company chose London for the summit.

Although he tells the Financial Times his appearance is not an endorsement, he calls George Osborne “the voice of a new generation”.2007-2009 Various senior politicians attend the annual Google Zeitgeist conference, including then environment secretary David Miliband, David Cameron, whose speech begins with a clip of him tearing into Gordon Brown, and Brown himself, who lauds Google’s success: “10 years ago a research organisation, now a $180bn company”. Osborne also attends, sharing a platform with top bankers including Santander’s Emilio Botín. May 2010 Nikesh Arora, Google’s global sales boss, introduces London mayor Boris Johnson at Google Zeitgeist, saying: “Boris has proven himself to be different, inspiring and one of the most capable leaders in getting things done”.July 2010  Cameron leads a delegation to India that includes a Google hackday in Bangalore as a “key event” of the tripJanuary 2011 Hunt tweets: “Looking forward 2 mtg Eric Scmidt later, wonder if like Mark Zuckerberg a Downing St visit means he’ll break habit of lifetime & wear a tie”.Early 2011 Jeremy Hunt, then culture secretary, has dinner with Eric Schmidt at Google’s Mountain View headquarters in Silicon Valley, securing funds for a London technology hub in Old Street.March 2012 Osborne speaks at the launch of Google Campus in east London, set up to provide facilities for startups. “Back in 2010, some members of my team travelled to Silicon Valley and met with Eric Schmidt, now executive chairman of Google,” Osborne claims. “And from that initial conversation has grown this incredible new facility”. May 2013 Labour leader Ed Miliband takes on Google at its Big Tent gathering at the five-star Grove Hotel in Hertfordshire, saying the group went to “extraordinary lengths to avoid paying its taxes”. Hunt uses his keynote at the same event to call for faster internet.May 2013 Schmidt attends Cameron’s business advisory forum at Downing Street. He is tackled by the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, also present, who says Google will continue to come under huge pressure to “pay their fair share of tax”. November 2015 London mayor Boris Johnson rides a scooter and tries on virtual reality goggles during a visit to Google Campus in Tel Aviv. The company is happy to provide photo opportunities as Johnson attempts to boost his international profile and, possibly, his chances of becoming Conservative leader.
