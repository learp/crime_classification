We had huge admiration for John Kennedy, and I was fascinated that the son of an Irish exile could become president of America, but also that he had the same surname as my mother, Honora Kennedy. The president’s people were from Dunganstown, County Wexford, in the south-east; my mother’s people were Kennedys from County Galway, in the west. So when we found out his helicopter would be landing in Phoenix Park in Dublin, outside the American embassy, we made an afternoon of it. I was a teacher at the Army Apprentice school and happened to have a half-day, and I wanted to give Helen, my two-year-old daughter, a bit of a treat.It was only a small crowd, as it was a weekday afternoon. We waited about a quarter of an hour for him to land. You can see from the photo there was almost no security. We even knew what time he was landing in the park because his itinerary had been published in the papers. It’s hard to imagine now. When he got out of the helicopter, it was just a matter of dashing over to shake his hand.My wife, Anne, was four months pregnant with our second baby; when she saw people rushing forward she didn’t want to get knocked over, so she stayed back. Little Helen clung to me for dear life; you can see her stuck to my shoulder. I couldn’t have a word with the president because he was so busy. If I had got to speak to him, I would have said, “Welcome back!” and, “You have the same name as my mother!” He made his way through the side gate into the embassy. It was over so quickly.We forgot about it after we came home, but my wife’s uncle was the art editor at the Irish Independent. He went to her father, who also worked there, and said, “Look who I saw going right up to President Kennedy?” and handed him the photo to give to us.I was delighted. It was a fleeting moment that I could treasure for the rest of my life. We have a big framed print of the photograph on one of the dressers in our dining room. Visitors are fascinated by it.Kennedy was dead five months later. He was killed just 11 days after the birth of our second baby. I remember sitting down with two friends, as we were planning to install central heating in our home here. When we got the news, everything just went dead. We scrapped the meeting. None of us will ever forget that moment. It took the ground from underneath us.Jane Rangeley is snapped by Henri Cartier-Bresson, Paris, 1973 It absolutely changed the way we looked at the picture. It has been said that he claimed afterwards he was never as happy as when he was in Ireland during those few days – we made him feel so welcome, so at home.When I look at it now, aged 88, I feel wistful for the good old days. It’s a glimpse into a world that is gone now. It went when he was shot. I see my little girl, whom I saw grow up to be a fine young lady; President Kennedy was denied that in his own family. It’s strange to see myself face to face with him. I was lucky to have that gift.• Are you in a famous photograph? Email thatsme@theguardian.com.
