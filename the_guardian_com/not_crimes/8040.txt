You’re so pretty!” All parents of daughters make such throwaway comments at some point. It seems innocent enough but statements like this can have a devastating effect on a girl in the long run. But why?It may seem obvious, but is easily forgotten, that teaching girls that appearance is the first thing we notice about them gives them the powerful message that looks are their most important quality. We don’t feel the need to tell our sons how handsome they are or how much we like their clothes, yet the unconscious biases we carry around means that we say things to daughters that we wouldn’t dream of saying to sons. In a survey I conducted of 400 girls for my latest book, 70% said they were worried about their weight. Some said they skipped breakfast and lunch to stay slim, others that they hoped to have plastic surgery when they were older. In a world obsessed with image, commenting on your daughter’s looks, clothes or related subjects can only exacerbate her already growing belief that image is everything, that how you look – not who you are or what you say – is important.Shallow praise linked to looks can have a negative effect on a girl’s ability to deal with adversity. These off-the-cuff remarks can imply that looks, goodness, talent and even intelligence are things you either have or don’t have. If you grow up believing that ability is innate, then you are less likely to try when things get a little difficult. You will be more likely to give up rather than stick with it because you think that effort has little impact on overall success.These innocent comments to a daughter can make her think her self-esteem is linked to certain traits or attributes. She may grow up valuing being pretty more than being strong and independent. This might lead to her apologising for her intelligence, her outspoken nature or any other quality about her that is seen as undesirable for a girl. When we think our self-esteem is linked to something external it becomes very hard to build ourselves up when we are feeling low or down and therefore we become depressed more easily. This can lead girls to give up more easily, be less determined and feel incompetent. In later life, this may cause her to turn down career paths or job promotions because she doesn’t feel able to carry them out.During a school day, boys are, on average, corrected eight more times than girls, according to research by the psychologist Carol Dweck. This starts from as young as four. Because girls develop self-control earlier, they tend to be praised for good behaviour, whereas boys are encouraged to try harder. The result is that girls develop a mindset that limits them – they may believe they can’t change. When girls develop fixed mindsets, they can stop trying because they fear they may fail, believing that ability, not effort, is the key to success.So what should we be saying to our daughters? Instead of talking to them about how they look, we should be commenting on what they are doing and asking what interests them. Instead of telling them they are good girls, we should be saying how patient they are or that they listen intently. Instead of commenting on how a girl should or shouldn’t behave, we should be telling them that we love the fact that they can express themselves and stick up for themselves. A subtle shift in language can ensure your daughter grows up much more prepared for success and the adult world.• Sarah Newton is the author of Help!
