The Last Kids on Earth is about a boy and his friends surviving a monster-zombie apocalypse.The main character is thirteen year old, Jack Sullivan, who is the hero of the story. Then there is Quint Baker, the hero’s best friend, and June Del Toro, the hero’s love interest. The villain is Dirk Savage: the bully. The main setting in The Last Kids on Earth is a city called Wakefield. The story starts out with zombies terrorising a middle school and Jack having to escape to a tree house.This is an illustrated novel. I would recommend The Last Kids on Earth for people who like video games because it is equally as fast-paced.Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
