The Saudi visual artist Ms Saffaa is a petite woman with cropped hair framing a pixie face. Her mural, plastered on a studio wall at Sydney University’s College of the Arts almost dwarfs her.It is a riotous mix of calligraphy, graffiti and portraits featuring the women’s rights activists Manal Al-Sharif and Samar Badawi, both part of a nascent movement protesting Saudi Arabia’s guardianship laws. The protest gained steam after the July release of a Human Rights Watch report, which was critical of the laws prohibiting a woman from travelling, marrying or even leaving prison without the permission of a male guardian. The movement gave birth to a hashtag, #iammyownguardian, and a petition signed by thousands, part of a growing online campaign protesting against the laws.Thousands of Saudis sign petition to end male guardianship of women The 39-year-old artist, who moved to Sydney to study at the SCA in 2009, says the inspiration for her art came from continuous run-ins with Saudi authorities over her visa. A condition of Saffaa’s now lapsed government scholarship required her brothers to fly in to Australia to vouch for her. But it was the hours of humiliating pleading with Saudi bureaucrats in Canberra that fuelled the rage behind her protest art.“You have to play their game,” she says. “You have to act like the weak woman and say, ‘Thank you for doing this for me, it’s a huge favour.’ You have to play that role in order to get your shit done.”Saffaa’s posters, featuring a face shrouded in the Saudi shemagh and the hashtag #iammyownguardian, became emblematic of the movement. They were plastered on Saudi streets, retweeted and sold online.  الفنانة والكاتبة النسوية مولي كرابآبل ترتدي (أنا ولية أمري) بفخر وتدعم السعوديات في حملتهم لإنهاء الولاية.

Many were housewives, sharing stories of life in the regime. Saffaa says Saudi women defending the laws were generally from the ruling class with ties to the government.“Those who have really good jobs, really good pay and connections to government have a lot to lose,” she says. “They will tell you we’re content.” For Saffaa, speaking up has its costs. The artist, who uses only her first name, has suffered harassment and been reported to Saudi authorities by trolls. “[They say], ‘Let’s all report her, let her rot in jail, let’s see her make art behind prison bars.’ I thought I was immune to online bullying and harassment but it got to me.”At an exhibition at Melbourne’s Islamic Museum of Australia, the artist was accosted by a man demanding to know why she was exposing Saudi’s dirty laundry to the west.  I was thinking, ‘That’s exactly why I make this art, because of people like you.’ “Before I could even speak I could feel the anger inside me,” she says. “I was sweating. I felt the heat coming out of my face ... a man comes with all his privilege and entitlement, and asks me why am I airing our dirty laundry to the west?“First of all you’re admitting that it’s shameful, there’s shame behind the question. But you’re coming to me and telling me not to do something, trying to censor me. “I was thinking, ‘That’s exactly why I make this art, because of people like you.’”  Printing done. Packing. Shipping next week, I promise :)) Then my friends and supporters around the world will receive their very own I Am My Own Guardian stickers and tshirts. #سعوديات_نطالب_باسقاط_الولايه #iammyowngaurdian #saudiwomen #urbanSaudi #urbanSaudi #screenprinting #stickerporn #انا_ولية_امري #politicalart #TogetherToEndMaleGuardianship #asos #asosstyle #ilovesca #madeatscaA photo posted by Ms Saffaa (@mssaffaa) on Sep 23, 2016 at 1:50am PDTThe sneakers-wearing activist uses street art and social media to promote millennial-style political protest that is transnational and cyber-driven but still rooted in the street.This Sunday, Saffaa will unveil a new street mural in Melbourne’s Brunswick East, a collaboration with several female artists as a tribute to Saudi women. The launch will be hosted by Moroccan Deli-cacy cafe owner and community activist Hana Assafiri, known for hosting public salon-style conversations at her Melbourne restaurants, including the hit speed-date-a-Muslim series. Saffaa says her work is motivated not only by political injustice but a visceral need for self-expression. “What the role of the artist is goes back to the question of, what is the role of art?” she says. “It goes beyond trying to raise awareness.” There's a bit of me in a few Australian homes. And there's so much awesomeness in this photo. I forget sometimes how good my girls look beautifully framed and hung. #madeatsca #إرحمونا_من_الوصاية #المرأة_السعودية #iamstillmyownguardian #سيدني_استراليا #جداريات #انا_ولية_أمري #انا_ولية_امري #أنا_ولية_أمري #politicalart #RadicalMuslim #blackandwhite #printmaking #permasetaqua #urbanstyle #urbanart #urbanwalls #ilovetheinnerwest #scamuststay #istandwiththearts #ArtChangesLives #SaudiArtist #australianportraits #iluvubut #MuslimAustralian #sossca #feministartA photo posted by Ms Saffaa (@mssaffaa) on Aug 2, 2016 at 1:10am PDTPart of her activism is borne out of subverting the western framing of Saudi women as victims, rather than as agents of their own liberation. This co-opting, she says, only furthers the infantilisation they were fighting against, with women used as pawns in a cultural battleground of rising Islamophobia.“Don’t say Saudi women don’t have a voice. We have a voice. You just haven’t been paying attention.”Saffaa says the fight for women’s rights in Saudi Arabia is part of broader struggle against state authoritarianism, for the rights of all minorities. As a believer, she questions the way the kingdom sought legitimacy through a hardline Wahhabi interpretation of religion.“There’s so much policing of women’s bodies and even men,” she says. “I think faith is a personal thing and in Saudi they make it a public thing. You have to display your faith everywhere you go.”• A new work by Ms Saffaa and several other female artists – in tribute to Saudi women and women in conflict zones – will be launched on 4 December at Moroccan Deli-cacy in Brunswick East, Melbourne
