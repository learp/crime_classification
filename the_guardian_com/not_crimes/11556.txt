It was never a case of if but when Rupert Murdoch would unleash a new bid for control of Sky (Report, 12 December). We didn’t actually stop the planned takeover in 2011 – only the furore around phone hacking led to the media mogul dropping his bid. This time it isn’t just the perfect timing for the bid, in terms of the fall in sterling, but also because of the fractured post-Brexit political situation. Where will the SNP, which the Sun supported in the 2015 election, stand on this?Two aspects are depressing. First, the same old game of surreptitious meetings behind closed doors is still very much alive. Have we forgotten the close links revealed between Cameron, culture secretary Jeremy Hunt and the Murdoch machine during the BSkyB takeover? Surely it’s no coincidence this time that the announcement is made after Murdoch had a meeting with Theresa May in New York, and moves are afoot to stall phase two of the Leveson inquiry.Second, it’s as if Leveson didn’t happen. An inquiry and weighty report have changed little. We have a press regulator, Ipso, that is subservient to the powerful bloc of rightwing national newspaper proprietors and has only the prospect of a public interest intervention notice, which it is the prerogative of the culture secretary Karen Bradley to issue. Media ownership laws to protect a diverse media were already badly weakened with the passage of New Labour’s 2003 Communications Act, which also created Ofcom.What are the chances of a bid being blocked this time? We have no alternative but to give it our best shot. The online activists, media reform organisations, trade unions and unaligned individuals uncomfortable at the disruptive role Murdoch’s media plays in our democratic life are still out there. We need to mobilise them urgently.Granville WilliamsPontefract, West Yorkshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
