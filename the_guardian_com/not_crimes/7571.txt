Terry Gilliam finally has the go-ahead to restart shooting on his long-delayed adaptation of Cervantes’ Don Quixote 17 years after it was abandoned, it has been announced.According to the Hollywood Reporter, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote will begin filming in September after financing was provided by Cosmopolis producer Paulo Branco. The budget has been set at €16m (£12.8m), and the film will feature John Hurt and Unbroken’s Jack O’Connell in roles originally occupied by Jean Rochefort and Johnny Depp.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Gilliam and Johnny Deep on set in 1999, as seen in Lost in La Mancha Photograph: Icon Film DistributionAs suggested by Gilliam in 2014, it would appear that the film’s plot has substantially evolved from the Depp/Rochefort version, which involved a time-travelling commercials director who meets Quixote in the 17th century. Now it seems O’Connell will play a film-maker in a modern day setting – a self-reflexive theme in which Gilliam references his own failure to make the film the first time around. “It’s more about how movies can damage people,” Gilliam said at the time.Gilliam’s crisis-ridden first attempt to make the film was chronicled in the 2002 documentary Lost in La Mancha, which revealed the series of disasters that hit the production, including flash floods and constant aircraft noise and culminating in Rochefort becoming too ill to continue. The film was shut down and a $15m insurance claim was made.Terry Gilliam says he will finally get his Don Quixote film off the ground Subsequent attempts were made to revive the project with Ewan McGregor and Robert Duvall in the two lead roles, but came to nothing. The production was further delayed after Hurt was cast, when the actor was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, but after he was given the all-clear in 2015, the film could once again be revived.
