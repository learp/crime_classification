Doughnuts are delicious and whoopie pies are great, but nothing can beat an eclair – they’re delicate, well proportioned and chic. I could happily eat one every day, but I’ve limited myself to buying some each Saturday from a brilliantly named local stall, The End of the Eclair – it reminds me of when I started a market stall 10 years ago, standing there, rain or shine, hoping people would buy the cakes I had spent the past day making. It was a gamble, but rewarding too.We’ve only made eclairs once or twice over the years at Violet Bakery - the temperature in the bakery is too high and we don’t have a refrigerated case. The classic eclair would have a vanilla pastry cream filling, but I started making chocolate pastry cream some time ago and now I can’t go back. Custard fillings are dense and rich, so I prefer to lighten them with whipped double cream. The choux is a standard recipe, and easy once you get the hang of it. The glaze must be rich, chocolatey, not too sweet, but still have a lovely gloss to it. This one has a few steps, but is totally worth it.Chocolate eclairsSpecial equipment: piping bag, but no tip. You can just use the opening, as it is the correct size. If you have a disposable one, then cut the opening to about 15mm. Makes about 12 small eclairsFor the filling240g whole milk50g caster sugar2 tbsp cornflour¼ tsp fine sea salt3 egg yolks100g dark chocolate (70%), chopped into small pieces100g double creamFor the pastry120g water60g unsalted butter¼ tsp fine sea salt½ tsp caster sugar70g plain flour2 eggs, plus another for egg wash1 tbsp milk, for egg washFor the glaze150g dark chocolate (70%), chopped 100g double cream50g soured cream or creme fraiche100g water4 tbsp caster sugar1 tbsp vanilla extract¼ tsp fine sea salt1 Start with the filling. Prepare an ice-water bath large enough to fit your saucepan. Separate the eggs, putting the yolks into a medium-size bowl and the whites in a sealed container in your fridge for other uses.2 In a heavy-based saucepan, bring the milk to just under the boil. Meanwhile, whisk the sugar, cornflour and salt into the yolks. Once the milk is hot, whisk half of it into the yolks to temper them, then pour the tempered yolks back into the saucepan with the remaining hot milk. Whisking constantly, return to the heat until thickened – about 5 minutes.3 Drop in the chopped chocolate and stir briefly to melt it. Remove from the heat and place the pan over the water bath to cool down. Spread a piece of clingfilm directly on to the custard so that it does not form a skin. Put in the fridge overnight to chill.4 The next day, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6 and line 2 baking sheets with parchment.5 In a heavy-based saucepan, combine all the pastry ingredients except the eggs and egg wash. Heat over a medium flame, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. After 5 minutes, the mixture should come together and a film should form on the bottom of the pan. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and set it aside to cool for a few minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring thoroughly after each addition.6 While the pastry dough is still warm, fill a piping bag with the mixture and pipe 8cm-long logs on to the prepared baking trays – make sure you space them about 4cm apart. Make the egg wash from 1 egg and 1 tbsp milk, then brush over the tops of the logs. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden and nicely puffed up.7 Meanwhile, whip the double cream until thick, then gently fold it into the cool chocolate pastry cream.8 Remove the pastry from the oven and pierce with a skewer to release any trapped steam. Cool completely before slicing open with a serrated knife and filling with the pastry cream.9 To make the glaze: put 100g of the dark chocolate into a heatproof bowl. Heat the double cream in a saucepan to just under the boil. You will know it is at the right point when it starts to foam on top and steam escapes. Then pour the double cream into the bowl of chopped chocolate and set aside for 5 minutes, then stir it into a smooth ganache.10 Wash out the saucepan you used to heat the cream and to this, add the remaining 50g of chopped chocolate. Add the remaining ingredients and heat the mixture over a medium-low heat to melt it all together.11 Once the mixture has melted, turn the heat up to high and boil for a few minutes to thicken. Take off the heat, combine with the ganache and whisk until smooth. Spoon over the tops of your assembled eclairs.Claire Ptak is a pastry chef, author and food stylist and owns Violet Bakery in London.
