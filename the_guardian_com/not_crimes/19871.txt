A new David Bowie EP has been released to mark what would have been the star’s 70th birthday.The No Plan EP includes Lazarus, which appeared on Bowie’s final album Blackstar, as well as songs written for the musical Lazarus: No Plan, Killing a Little Time and When I Met You. They are believed to be Bowie’s final recordings, completed around the time of the Blackstar sessions.Of the new material, Killing a Little Time crackles with abrasive heavy rock, while When I Met You is chugging guitar pop that opens with the line “You have just everything / But nothing at all / Now the moon is dark / Feels like pain again.” No Plan is melancholic and jazz-infused, and comes with a video directed by Tom Hingston that references Bowie’s first starring film role in The Man Who Fell to Earth.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Elsewhere, stars have paid tribute to the late musician, including legendary producer Tony Visconti, who tweeted: “Happy Birthday dear old friend. Forever.” along with a rare photo of the iconic musician.
