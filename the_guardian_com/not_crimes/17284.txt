Catherine Shoard (Sex, suicide, torture: is arthouse really so sophisticated?, 5 January) takes a very select view of arthouse films amid her confusing lambasting of fireworks. Chichester Cinema at New Park has recently programmed Embrace of the Serpent, a Mark Kermode 2016 favourite from Colombia, Paths of the Soul, a Tibetan masterpiece and Bridge, an Indian film, a first for its child psychiatrist director, and another tale beautifully told. Sure, there is a would-be suicide in the latter but, in common with all good films that may contain the vexed subjects Catherine decides to take on, it’s how it’s done. And, no, fireworks are not boring as she states. Reach for your inner childlike wonderment, Catherine – and avoid combining two highly disparate subjects.Carol GodsmarkChichester, West Sussex• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
