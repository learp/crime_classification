The ratings for the first season, which followed Jenner’s new life as a trans woman, dipped as the series progressed.Season two struggled to sustain a large audience, with the lowest-rated episode bringing in 480,000 viewers, according to Variety. Jenner’s controversial support for the Republican party may have accounted for some viewers turning off.
