The funniest standup I’ve ever seen Not exactly standup, but Monty Python at Drury Lane in 1974. I had to leave my seat to compose myself – I genuinely thought I might die.The funniest book I’ve ever read I’ll add the word “lately” here or it’ll be Wodehouse again. So, Adam Resnick’s Will Not Attend.The funniest person I know My sometime broadcast partner Danny Kelly. He can coax from me a strangulated falsetto screech that once heard is never forgotten no matter how much therapy/hypnotism you pay for.The funniest meal I’ve ever had We rarely went to restaurants growing up. When we did once my mum scraped all our plates at the end of the meal and stacked them up ready for washing.The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had I’ve never caved in to fads but the funniest description of a hairstyle is in Bob Newhart’s returning a wig sketch: “Style 52a: The crew cut with the widow’s peak.”The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funny My dad’s behaviour at my uncle’s funeral. Without being a tease, that story closes my show every night.The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen Fry & Laurie’s Comedy Masterclass: “How small would that be?”The funniest TV show I’ve ever seen Mystery Science Theater 3000. The Jack Frost episode nearly killed me.The funniest film I’ve ever seen Woody Allen’s Love and Death. My current favourite line? “Sidney Applebaum!”The funniest word Crisps, when said aloud. It’s that odd manoeuvre your lips have to do at the end.The funniest joke I’ve ever heard By day she dispensed justice, but by night she was Queen of the Music Halls. Tonight at eight it’s Tara Raboom, DA.Danny Baker: Cradle to the Stage is touring to 30 April
