The broadcaster, which shares the rights with Sky Sports, has the rights to air 10 live races and extensive highlights of all 21 grand prix, starting with Melbourne on 20 March.“I’m very proud to be a part of this exciting line up which will give F1 fans who choose to watch the most creative and innovative free-to-air coverage of the season a totally fresh perspective,” said Coulthard. “This season promises to be the most competitive for years and viewers can look forward to extensive coverage of all the races, expert punditry, unrivalled paddock and pit access as well as exhilarating stunts and features throughout to bring the audience right into the heart of the race action.”Travel search engine Kayak has signed up as the exclusive sponsor of Channel 4’s F1 coverage.
