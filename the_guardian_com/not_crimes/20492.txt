Matthew Evans, one of the most important figures in British publishing and the man who led Faber and Faber for several decades, has died aged 74.Evans, or Baron Evans of Temple Guiting as he became in 2000, died peacefully on Wednesday morning after a long illness, said his wife, the literary agent Caroline Michel.“He was a glorious man and the love of my life,” she said. Evans’s friend Melvyn Bragg led tributes to someone he considered “one of the most remarkable men of his generation”.Lord Evans of Temple Guiting obituary Bragg said: “His great gifts included bringing on authors like Ted Hughes, Seamus Heaney, Hanif Kureishi, Kazuo Ishiguro, William Golding, Paul Auster and many others, some of whom had been there in Matthew’s early days but all of whom were devoted to him and deeply respectful of his rigid integrity. “There was not the slightest move to self-enrichment in any way – he stood for Faber and Faber and his authors.”Stephen Page, Faber and Faber’s current chief executive, said the company was saddened by the news. “He was one of the most singular and important publishing leaders of his generation. Passionate, energetic and articulate, his contribution to Faber is incalculable.“From the moment he took charge of the company, he launched a new publishing era creating an extraordinary community of some of the most important writers in world literature. He was brilliant at spotting talent for the company and surrounding himself with exceptional colleagues.“Every day in the company, we feel the great benefit of all that he did. His loss will be deeply felt by all the staff both past and present, and especially by the many authors he championed during nearly 40 years with the company.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Carol Hughes, pictured in 1984 with her husband, the poet Ted Hughes who died in 1998, said Evans’ death was a ‘huge loss’. Photograph: PAEvans was a pivotal figure in the lives of many writers and was the man who helped persuade TS Eliot’s widow, Valerie Eliot, that a musical version of Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats was a good idea.Evans hit upon the idea of inviting Eliot to Andrew Lloyd Webber’s house so he could play a few Cats songs on his piano. She was won over and Cats went on to be a stellar success, providing the company with a valuable income stream that kept it in business – protecting it at a time when other independent publishers were being taken over or going bust.He was one of several Lord Evanses, but the novelist Peter Carey recalled: “He was The Lord Evans, so he claimed.”Carey added: “I remember him with enormous fondness, particularly his powerful sense of mischief, his pleasure in throwing “Cats” amongst the pigeons.”Carol Hughes, the widow of the late poet laureate Ted Hughes, said Evans’s death was a “huge loss to all who know and love him”.She added: “Ted and I always deeply valued Matthew’s friendship and kindness, and he has long been a champion of Ted’s work and his legacy. Indeed, Matthew was instrumental in persuading Westminster Abbey to honour Ted with a memorial in Poet’s Corner in 2011.“Since Ted’s death, Matthew has remained an important influence, professionally and personally, offering good advice and unconditional support through what have occasionally been difficult times. He was a loyal friend and counsellor, and I will miss him greatly.”        Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The original cast of the musical Cats.

Evans served as a Labour government whip in the House of Lords from 2002-07, and in 2010 Labour made Evans a spokesman for the arts.
