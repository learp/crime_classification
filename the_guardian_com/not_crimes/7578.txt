Paul Haggis, director of the Oscar-winning drama Crash, is to produce a documentary about the Flint water contamination scandal.According to Deadline, Haggis is working with director William Hart on Lead and Copper, a film that aims to investigate the ongoing crisis, which began in 2014 after the city in Michigan changed its water supply. As a result, untreated water found its way into people’s homes and locals were exposed to drinking water with high levels of lead. A state of emergency was declared in January 2016, and a series of city officials were subsequently charged with a range of offences, including misconduct in a public office and evidence tampering.Lead and Copper appears to be Hart’s feature debut, while Haggis’s most recent film as director was the 2013 feature Third Person, starring James Franco. Haggis’s recent career, though, has been dominated by his very public break from the Church of Scientology, which he left in 2009 after 35 years.
