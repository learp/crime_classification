This summer marks Beatrix Potter‚Äôs 150th birthday, and as part of the celebrations, a series of new ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù covers have been launched for some of her most loved stories. These new designs have been created by a handful of the UK and Ireland‚Äôs most successful fashion designers, including Henry Holland and Orla Kiely. However, far from paying tribute to the delicate illustrations that make the likes of Peter Rabbit and Mrs Tiggy Winkle so charming, these brash and bold new covers remove the classic illustrations almost completely, replacing them with modern ‚Äúedgy‚Äù covers, aiming to make the books seem cool.

And with the calibre of designers creating them how could they not be? But I can‚Äôt help feeling that someone has missed the point when they got rid of the original illustrations and decided that it was about time Peter Rabbit became cool. Peter Rabbit is not cool. Peter Rabbit is not supposed to be cool. He‚Äôs a mischievous baby rabbit who likes eating lettuces.

Running through muddy puddles in leaky wellies and sneaking through the gap in the garden fence - activities about as far removed as you can get from sophisticated, cutting edge design. Why then, do these tales need a facelift? Part of the love for Beatrix Potter‚Äôs work is the memories and the charm. The new covers conceal those innocent illustrations behind a glossy, stylised veneer. That‚Äôs not a celebration of their success. It seems that these days nothing can get away with growing old gracefully. It must be tweaked, primped and polished and made shiny and new.

For an author who has sold over 100 million books and had her works translated into more than 35 different languages, flagging sales isn‚Äôt an issue. But there are people out there who spend an awful lot of money on Beatrix Potter. Last month a rare edition of Peter Rabbit was auctioned for ¬£18,000. Original first editions are estimated to be worth up to ¬£50,000.

Although inside the covers the original illustrations are still included, by taking them off the cover it seems almost like a false sell, and a misunderstanding of why Beatrix Potter is so successful. The new covers are excellent works of design, and they‚Äôre really beautiful creations in their own right ‚Äì but they don‚Äôt add anything the stories at all. Beatrix Potter‚Äôs sweetly mischievous illustrations have captured the hearts of generations, and hiding them away feels like an injustice. You wouldn‚Äôt try sell a book about chocolate cake with a picture of some soup on the cover. That would be just as weird.

Probably not fans of the originals as these editions seem to be nothing to do with the tales of childhood. Neither will parents buy them for young children - the designs hardly scream approachability. And why would they appeal to a younger, cooler audience? The young and cool readers seemingly targeted aren‚Äôt going to want to read picture books about sewing mice. These editions seem destined to lie unopened, gathering dust on a bookshelf, nothing more than an ornament.To give Peter Rabbit tattoos and a beanie hat, or to replace Mrs Tiggy Winkle‚Äôs apron and bonnet with a stylised print motif, misunderstands the joy that so many of us found in Beatrix Potter‚Äôs stories when we were growing up. It messes with their nostalgic appeal and hides the beautiful illustrations that make her so worthy of a whole year of celebrations in the first place. Don‚Äôt mess with the classics. Leave Peter alone. What do you think of the new covers?
