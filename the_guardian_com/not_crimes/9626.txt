After 12 years judging the show together, 51-year-old Torode told the Mirror: “It’s funny, we’ve never been friends.MasterChef review: mince with ketchup, custard ravioli and … a new market “We’ve not been to each other’s houses ... If we go away to somewhere like South Africa, we do things separately ... If we do go out for a drink, I’ll invariably be at one end of a big old table and he’ll be at the other.”The Australian chef was best man at Wallace’s wedding to Anne-Marie Sterpini last year.Wallace, 52, told ITV’s Lorraine on Thursday: “I film with John six or seven months of the year, so we are very close to each other physically, and emotionally we are very close to each other. What’s great about having a partnership is that if one of you is a bit off, a bit down, the other one naturally steps up, so I rely on John a lot.”The pair reportedly met during Torode’s early career working at central London restaurant Quaglino’s, which served vegetables supplied by Wallace. They began presenting and judging the popular BBC cooking series when it was revamped in 2005.But Torode said disagreements over MasterChef contestants’ dishes have been known to continue away from the cameras.Describing a “massive fight” they once had over a contestant after a few too many drinks, he said: “We’ve had a couple of standoffs over the years … I’ve just had to walk away from him.”
