The winner: Kung Fu Panda 3With most UK schools not breaking up for the Easter holidays until Thursday, DreamWorks Animation and distribution partner Fox can look forward to at least 17 days of great business for Kung Fu Panda 3, beginning on Good Friday. And the film has already grossed £7.08m, holding the box-office crown again at the weekend in its second week of release.The family animation faced competition on Saturday and Sunday from Disney’s Zootropolis, which played nationwide previews. Those numbers are not officially reported yet, but they are lower than Kung Fu Panda 3’s weekend takings of £1.74m, and also a bit lower than its rival’s Saturday/Sunday grosses. Worldwide, Zootropolis (or Zootopia as it’s known in many territories) has grossed $593m so far, as against $398m for Kung Fu Panda 3. In the UK, Kung Fu Panda 3 still has a long way to go to catch the first two films in the franchise (£20.3m and £18.3m).The runner-up: 10 Cloverfield Lane   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Predicting box office on 10 Cloverfield Lane wasn’t easy. On the one hand, it has the value of the Cloverfield brand, reinforced by the cachet of producer JJ Abrams. On the other, Paramount made it clear that this was a “spiritual successor”, not a sequel, to Cloverfield, that the film had been repurposed from a kidnap thriller screenplay called The Cellar, and was achieved with a lower production cost than its predecessor. In other words, whatever intriguing delight 10 Cloverfield Lane was offering, it wouldn’t be all-out monster mayhem for 100 minutes.The result: 10 Cloverfield Lane opened in the UK with £1.60m from 488 cinemas. This compares with a debut of £3.49m from 386 cinemas for Cloverfield back in February 2008. Obviously the comparison doesn’t flatter 10 Cloverfield Lane, since the number is less than half its predecessor, on 26% more screens, and with cinema tickets at least 30% more expensive than in 2008.On the other hand, a £1.60m UK debut for a relatively low-budget genre film, essentially populated by three actors, none of them marquee names, and largely set in a basement – most studios would like the economics of that proposition. The film has already grossed $45m in US cinemas. Even allowing for the revenue split with the theatres, and Paramount’s marketing costs, that puts 10 Cloverfield Lane well along the road to profitability.The indie hit: High-Rise   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Ben Wheatley’s JG Ballard adaptation High-Rise has begun in the UK with £543,000 from 153 cinemas, including previews of £104,000. Stripping out the previews, that yields a healthy site average of £2,866. For comparison, Wheatley’s Sightseers debuted in November 2012 with £213,000 from 92 cinemas, including £28,000 in previews. A year earlier, Kill List kicked off with £88,000 from 47 screens, including £1,000 in previews. A Field in England premiered simultaneously in cinemas, on DVD, on VOD and free-to-air television (on Film 4), so comparisons are not relevant – but it was theatrically modest.High-Rise review – Tom Hiddleston shines in social-surrealist film of the year High-Rise, from established source material and starring Tom Hiddleston, Sienna Miller, Elisabeth Moss and Luke Evans, is significantly Wheatley’s biggest film, by budget, scale of release and box office. It has already overtaken the UK lifetime total of Kill List (£265,000) and will cruise past Sightseers’ final cume (£662,000). Reactions to High-Rise have polarised, with 5.4% of IMDb users awarding it 1 out of 10, and 15.2% grading it 10. Average is 6.7. MetaCritic offers it a score of 62/100, although that includes the Guardian’s two-star Toronto film festival review rather than Peter Bradshaw’s subsequent four-star assessment.Secret Cinema ends run on £1.2mThe latest edition of Secret Cinema: Tell No One ended its run on Sunday, and the title on this occasion was revealed to be Stanley Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove. The event ran for 25 nights over five weeks at the fictional Burpelson Air Base (in fact an abandoned factory warehouse in south London), generating box office of £1.24m – just under £50,000 per night. Venue capacity was 950 people.A night at Secret Cinema: forced fun gives way to immersive extravaganza Last year, Secret Cinema Presents The Empire Strikes Back grossed £6.32m during its 100-date run throughout the whole summer – an average of £63,000 per show. Secret Cinema will be satisfied that box office sustained for a major event that returned to the original “Tell No One” branding, ie with an undisclosed film title.The Boy crowds genre field   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest In January and February, during awards season, there was little on offer in UK cinemas for genre fans. In March, it’s been a different story, with big-budget action films London Has Fallen and Allegiant plus horror titles The Other Side of the Door and The Witch. The weekend saw not just 10 Cloverfield Lane join the party, but also The Boy, about a nanny employed to look after a life-size doll.The Boy review – gimmicky horror forsakes suspense for stock shocks The Boy opened with an acceptable £726,000 from 397 cinemas – not bad, given the competitive environment. But you do wonder if The Boy might have done better on a different release date.The flops   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Sony quietly pushed two of its less-favoured children into cinemas at the weekend, releasing both Risen and Rock the Kasbah. The former, a biblical-themed Roman drama starring Joseph Fiennes, always looked a tough sell in the relatively secular UK, despite an Easter-topical story hook. The film achieved just under £70,000 from 162 cinemas, yielding a mediocre £432 average. But that looks like a joyous success when placed next to Rock the Kasbah. The Bill Murray comedy went out into 68 cinemas, grossing a negligible £3,800, for a woeful £56 average. It’s a bit of a comedown for director Barry Levinson, whose past hits include Rain Man and Good Morning, Vietnam. To quote the title of one of his less-regarded efforts, from 2008, What Just Happened?Rock the Kasbah review – Bill Murray tanks in catastrophic caper Awards movies updateA few of the awards-season titles achieved personal milestones at the weekend. The Revenant crossed £23m, for example, with takings of £70,000 pushing it to £23.03m. The Revenant will continue to play second-run cinemas and film societies, and could conceivably catch The Martian, which is currently the biggest-grossing of all the best picture Oscar nominees in the UK (with £23.59m).Spotlight cracked £6m at the weekend, with takings of £70,000 pushing it to £6.06m. Three of the best picture Oscar nominees are crowded near this benchmark, with The Big Short (on £5.85m) overtaking Brooklyn (£5.84m) at the weekend. Brooklyn is still chugging away in select cinemas, despite becoming available on DVD three weeks ago.Two films that picked up acting nominations but missed out on best picture at the Oscars are also neck and neck. The Hateful Eight, with £7.39m, recently overtook The Danish Girl, on £7.36m. Both should enjoy a healthy afterlife in film clubs.The future   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Disorder: watch the trailerWeekend takings are 33% down on the previous frame, and also 32% down on the equivalent session from 2015, when Home and Divergent sequel Insurgent were the top new entries. These comparisons are actually not that valid, as differences in the dating of Easter have caused disparities in the release calendar. In any case, cinema bookers now have big hopes pinned on the arrival this Friday of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, plus Disney Animation’s Zootropolis. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 offers a comedy alternative for adults who don’t fancy Zootropolis. Disorder, starring Matthias Schoenaerts and Diane Kruger, looks set to lead the charge among arthouse new releases.Top 10 films March 18-201. Kung Fu Panda 3, £1,740,695 from 590 sites.
