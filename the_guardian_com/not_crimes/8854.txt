Inexpensive, thirst-quenching and very old-fashioned: keep a jug in the fridge as a pick-me-up for when you can’t face yet another boozy Christmas drink. Keep the cooked barley and use as pearly ballast in savoury wintry salads. And use lemon instead of orange, if you prefer. Serves four.2 oranges, washed, zested and juiced 65g pearl barley1.5 litres cold water1cm piece ginger, peeled and sliced2-3 tbsp caster sugar, to tastePut the zest in a pan with the barley, water and ginger. Bring to a boil, skim, then turn to a simmer and cook until the barley is tender: 15-20 minutes. Strain into a jug, add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Add the juice, chill and serve in tall glasses over ice.• Claire Thomson is the author of The Five O’Clock Apron (Ebury, £20).
