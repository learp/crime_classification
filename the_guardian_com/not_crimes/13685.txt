Theatre1 This HouseIt’s almost your last chance for James Graham’s play about the Westminster village and its absurdities, and you should take it because this is a sharply observed look at democracy in action. Set in the period between 1974 and 1979, it focuses on the shadowy machinations of the whips. In the process, it raises pertinent questions about how the House of Commons operates 40 years later.Garrick Theatre, WC2, to 25 February2 Heads UpSomething exciting is happening in Glasgow this week with the arrival of Take Me Somewhere (22 February to 11 March), a citywide festival of contemporary performance, building on the legacy of much-missed venue the Arches. It’s helmed by Jackie Wylie, who has recently been appointed artistic director of the National Theatre Of Scotland. The terrific programme kicks off with Heads Up, Kieran Hurley’s compelling tale of connections and disconnections, set in a city on the brink of destruction, which moves to Edinburgh later in the week.Tron Theatre, Glasgow, 22 February; Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh, 23-25 February3 Meet FredThis collaboration between puppet masters Blind Summit and Hijinx, the Cardiff-based company that makes inclusive theatre featuring disabled actors, was a hit at Edinburgh. It’s an irreverent and witty show featuring a puppet called Fred who has an existential crisis when he realises that he is, in fact, a puppet and is in peril of losing his PLA (Puppetry Living Allowance). The Hull dates form part of the City of Culture’s Back To Ours festival.Theatre Royal, York, 21 February; Archbishop Sentamu Academy, Hull, 23-25 February4 Funny GirlThis production of the 1960s musical about Fanny Brice – who rose from music hall singer to Broadway star – hit the headlines during its West End run when Sheridan Smith had to withdraw for several weeks due to exhaustion. Natasha J Barnes stepped into the role and did brilliantly, so it’s nice to see that the two of them will be sharing the part on this tour.Palace Theatre, Manchester, to 25 February; touring to 19 August5 Les MisérablesLong-running musicals tend to get overlooked in critical roundups, but there’s always a reason why they are so successful, and few have been more so than Boublil and Schönberg’s show, based on Victor Hugo’s novel of crime, punishment and redemption in 19th-century France. It’s easy to sneer at such a huge hit, but only the terminally high-minded could object to a show that proves popular doesn’t have to mean pap.Queen’s Theatre, W1, to 14 OctoberDance      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Exhilarating ...
