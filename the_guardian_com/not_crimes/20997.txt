I am usually late for everything, except my performances – they are sacred. The one thing I can do that a lot of people can’t is catnap. If I am thinking, “Oh God, I don’t know if I am going to have the strength for tonight”, I lie on the floor – it can’t be a bed – and put my feet up on a chair. Lie like that for 10 minutes and it’s as good as four hours’ sleep.I have very dry skin, so I have to put on cream every day; Clarins for the body and men’s Clinique for the face, which gives a bit of lustre. My hair is a problem. I have bits of dark grey, bits of brown and bald spots. I look like a mangy cat. I also have white hair, so I go to a salon once a month, or once every two weeks if I am working, and I get it bleached all the same colour – white. It takes two hours, and it’s so boring.TV presenter Gethin Jones: 'I love a good suit' I am 5ft 2in, so I have to have everything taken up. Armani does small sizes, but we can’t always go to Armani couture. My favourite place to shop is Naples because there are small Italians living in the south. Footwear is difficult, too: I have the worst big toes you have ever seen. It’s hard to find comfortable shoes and they don’t do size six for men any more, so I have to wear insoles.I used to love my footwear. My first salary with the Royal Ballet in 1966 was 15 guineas. I spent 14 on a pair of shoes and had one guinea to live on for the rest of the week.• Visit Men United and join Wayne Sleep in the fight to beat prostate cancer.
