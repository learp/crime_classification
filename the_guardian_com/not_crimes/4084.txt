A cinema in California has apologised for accidentally screening a trailer for the “adult” animated comedy Sausage Party before the new family Pixar film Finding Dory.After the mishap at the Brenden Concord, the company’s vice-president of operations, Walter Eichinger, said: “Playing that trailer was a one-time, honest mistake by a theatre manager moving screens around in an effort to accommodate several large, last-minute groups wanting to see Dory. The wrong movie was started by mistake.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Sausage Party trailer. WARNING: contains swearingSausage Party is directed by Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon, and is co-scripted by Seth Rogen – who also features in the leading role (as a sausage) alongside Kristen Wiig and James Franco. Due for release in August, it does not yet have an Motion Picture Association of America rating, but the copious swearing in its trailers suggest it will almost certainly be given an R. Finding Dory, on the other hand is rated a PG, and is a huge hit with family audiences.Eichinger blamed human error, demanding audiences and easily triggered computer systems for the blunder. “We regret it, apologise for it and we are not happy that it happened. We fully realise that this trailer is not appropriate for Dory and we would never schedule something like that.”
