The winters of 2009–10 and 2010–11 in the UK were the coldest in the previous 25 years. This has been taken by some commentators and members of the public as evidence that global warming isn't happening. In truth, however, cold UK winters are entirely possible within broader global warming trends.Scientists have determined that the Earth's climate is warming by averaging measurements from all over the globe over many decades. Indeed, 2010 was one of the warmest years on record. But natural climate variability means there are plenty of local or temporary events – such as cold winters – that appear to contradict the warming trend.Consistent with this is the fact that not everywhere in the Northern Hemisphere was unusually cold over in the winters of 2009–10 and 2010–11. While the UK, northern Europe and the eastern US have been subject to two very cold winters, the last two winters in northeast Canada and Greenland have been unusually mild. Climatologists put this regional temperature pattern down to the position of the jet stream – the current of air high in the atmosphere that steers weather systems in the Northern Hemisphere. At the surface, these changes appear as variations in the pressure difference between high pressure mid-latitude and low pressure polar air.Some years see smaller pressure differences than normal – a condition scientists call the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This causes the jet stream to weaken and to shift south to the Mediterranean, cutting off our supply of mild, Atlantic air and allowing more frequent incursions of cold air from continental Europe and Russia.Scientists are still investigating what causes the negative NAO that brings us cold winter weather. Studies show an influence on the NAO from El Niño and La Niña – the spreading of warmer- or cooler-than-normal waters across the equatorial Pacific that is known to influence global climate patterns. There's also evidence that low phases of the sun's 11-year activity cycle might influence the NAO and thus bring cold winters to Britain.For more information, see the Met Office or NASA.This article was written by Carbon Brief in conjunction with the Guardian and partnersThe ultimate climate change FAQ• This answer last updated: 01.12.2011• Read about the project and suggest a question• Report an error in this answerRelated questions• What is the emissions trading scheme and does it work?• What is the economic cost of climate change?• Is the world really getting warmer?This editorial is free to reproduce under Creative CommonsThis post by The Guardian is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England & Wales License.Based on a work at theguardian.com
