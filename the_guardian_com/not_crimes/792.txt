Have you ever watched a show that keeps you in thrall the entire time you’re watching, but reveals itself – 15 minutes after – to be largely empty calories? That’s how I feel about Mr Robot, which leaves me wheezing at times, before further scrutiny gives me my breath back. It’s not as deep and revelatory as it thinks it is – and I blame a captivating central performance from the riveting Rami Malek.Malek, 35, is a big talent. I first saw him in Night At The Museum, as Ahkmenrah (the Egyptian mummy who turned out to be perhaps the most handsome boy in the world). It was a rare case of Hollywood casting matching actual heritage: Malek is Egyptian-American, the fractionally older of twins born in California. Subsequent roles have been acclaimed but small, in critical darlings such as Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master, The Pacific (and, um, the Twilight saga), as well as stints on Gilmore Girls and 24. Malek has that knack of seeming to occupy space against his will. There’s that deep voice, which doesn’t sound as if it belongs in his slight body. That lantern jaw. And his eyes: there is no gaze more compelling on television, and Malek uses it to great effect.Why I love Sarah Jessica Parker As Elliot, the master hacker who has depression and social anxiety disorder, he strides the city, head beneath hood, eyes burning with terrors both within and without. It’s such a complete performance, and only hints at more to come.He recently won an Emmy for lead actor in a drama, beating Kevin Spacey and Matthew Rhys. Mr Robot has been renewed for another series, and soon he’ll star in a remake of Papillon. Everything’s coming up Malek.
