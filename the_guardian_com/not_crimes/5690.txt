Following outcry from authors including Philip Pullman, Francesca Simon and Joanne Harris over literary festivals that do not pay writers, the Oxford literary festival has said that it will “discuss how to achieve payment of fees for all speakers” in 2017.The Oxford event was hit with a barrage of criticism last week when Pullman resigned as a patron over its failure to pay the authors that feature on its lineup. Pullman said last week that “expecting authors to work (because it is work) for nothing is iniquitous, it always has been, and I’ve had enough of it”.His resignation brought the issue to the fore, with the novelist Amanda Craig writing an open letter to the Bookseller calling “for all authors and publishers to boycott literary festivals which expect authors to work for free”. Her missive, signed by names including Harris, Simon, Jon McGregor and Linda Grant, said that “we are the only people in festivals who are not paid, and yet without us the festivals could not exist. Writing is a vocation but it is also a profession, and it is time we all stiffened our spines, dug in our heels and said No.”In a statement issued on Tuesday morning, the Oxford literary festival said that it “recognises and understands the strength of feeling in the literary community regarding the payment of speaker fees to authors and writers and we are sympathetic to this cause”.Book festivals are worth far more than fees | Claire Armitstead But, adding that it is a registered charity that receives no public funding, with no full-time staff, supported by a team of 40 unpaid volunteers, the festival said that “for every £12 ticket sold, a further £20 in support has to be raised from our generous sponsors, partners and donors in subsidy”. The festival’s current supporters include FT Weekend and HSBC.“We have of course been aware of the debate regarding author payments for some time, but given the limitations of the tight budgets we run to (the festival’s last audited accounts show a loss of £18,000 in 2014) paying each speaker would require an additional 15% in costs or £75,000 for the 500 speakers across our 250 events planned for 2016,” said the festival.Once this year’s event in April is over, organisers have nonetheless said that they “will meet with all interested parties to discuss how to achieve payment of fees for all speakers – while safeguarding the presence of our record levels of unknown writers for 2017 and beyond”.The festival also thanked Pullman as an “extraordinary supporter and ally”, saying that it had “always had enormous respect for his views and commitment”. Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, said the statement was a “very tentative start”, but that her organisation would “be delighted to speak to Oxford about payment of fees”. “They could perhaps take guidance from the many other festivals of similar size that do manage to pay authors,” said Solomon. Last week, Solomon highlighted small and large events – including festivals in Edinburgh, Cambridge, Marlborough and Wigtown – that do pay their speakers.
