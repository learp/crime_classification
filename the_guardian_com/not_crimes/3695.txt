Griefbergs ahead! Surveying the usually calm waters of my desk diary, I see difficult days poking through the weeks ahead. Emotional pinnacles whose hidden pathos may rip holes in the side of the good ship Golightly’s recent positivity.Unlike the Titanic’s hapless lookouts whose binoculars were locked in a cabinet the key of which was left in port, I can see at a distance grief’s peaks and so plan around them; particularly the two days whose sharp edges I fear most.I tell my counsellor Heidi that although ostensibly the most difficult day is the anniversary of Helen’s death, I fear it the least: “It’s just a date and one that I see no reason to mark.” It’s not even the worst day, such was the inevitability of death by then. That accolade belongs a few days earlier when I was ushered into a side room: “You do understand what’s happening here? Helen is going to die in the next few hours or days.”So burst the bubble of hope that Helen might pull out of her downwards spiral. It had prompted the truly worst conversation a few hours later when I had to tell Millie and Matt that their mum was dying, so smothering Matt’s “There’s always hope, Dad.” Worst day. Best forgotten.Helen’s birthday by comparison will be impossible to ignore, so I plan to embrace it by planting a tree in the garden whose blossom will in time mark the passing of the seasons, replacing short-term grief at her death with long-term memories of her life. I’d already spoken to the sympathetic nursery which would make every effort to make special the kids’ selection of a sapling.For them, the date to hate may be bleeding Mothering Sunday, which rises up like a tombstone with all its weeks of high-street build up. I’m going to embrace “keeping friends close and enemies closer” by this and every Mother’s Day re-enthusing the kids about the memorial stained-glass windows we are having made featuring their mum’s favourite things. Through them each year I hope they’ll see afresh Helen’s passions and personality.The day of dread is Valentine’s Day, not that Helen and I paid too much attention to its cheesy celebration of a love that should matter as much the other 364 days. For good reason therefore was My Funny Valentine one of Helen’s favourites, especially and bizarrely when sung by Matt Damon in The Talented Mr Ripley. Its last line speaking no lies: “Each day is Valentine’s Day.”Valentine’s Day this year carries embedded images of our last together. Helen and I, in an unspoken attempt to populate her remaining time with beautiful memories, had decided to eat at a restaurant having seen it featured in The Trip. En route we’d stopped at Carnforth where Brief Encounter was filmed and had tea in the Refreshment Room recreated there. So it was in tribute to our own happy trip, which she’d booked ages ago to watch the film on Valentine’s Day, not thinking that by then she would have been in hospital a week already with husband and children given “the talk” of her impending passing. This 14 February I’ll seize the day as Helen seized every day and spend time at her memorial But fate, fucking cancer, her consultant and I had not reckoned on Helen’s love of life, as she lay there so very ill, drips dangling and life ebbing, “I will go to the cinema tonight. I absolutely will, Adam.” We’d all been sceptical but go we did, against advice and in a borrowed wheelchair to sit at one of the cabaret tables, which the lovely old art deco cinema offered me with much kindness on hearing of the situation. There we’d drunk gin, eaten cheese and watched Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson lost in love but separated by circumstance …I’d seen in the eyes of the people who had moved over to let us through, both shock and compassion at Helen’s clearly emaciated and dying state but it didn’t dent the moment and has somehow inscribed the memory.This 14 February I’ll seize the day as Helen seized every day and spend time at her memorial, knowing with certainty the truth in Carol Ann Duffy’s words carved so beautifully into the Welsh slate: “Somewhere on the other side of this wide night and the distance between us, I am thinking of you.”Adam Golightly is a pseudonym@MrAdamGolightly
