1.29pm GMT13:29That’s all for today! Thanks to everyone who posted questions – and to Beth for her time and her hilarious answers. Until next time!  Guardian contributor BethDitto 18 February 2016 1:24pmThank you for all the questions. I especially liked the really difficult ones, and the funny ones. If you need me, I'll be looking up who won the FA Cup for the last fifty or sixty years.Updatedat 1.39pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.27pm GMT13:27guv111 asks:My question: Why?

Guardian contributor BethDitto 18 February 2016 1:22pmCan't they just get together and make a perfect combination? Why must we divide and conquer? It's whoever is getting the most momentum for me, honestly. I like the idea of Bernie, but I don't know if America is going to go for it. I liked Ralph Nader. I love Bernie. But I just don't trust the right wing at all - I'm such a conspiracy theorist, "the damn right wing are trying to rip us to shreds!" It's hard to know who to trust.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.24pm GMT13:24'I have plans for a solo record. It's mostly a lot of harp; I play the spoons really well'Johnston asks:Would you be interested to return to your earlier sound at any point, now that you have the platform to make it viable? I need Movement part II in my bones...  Guardian contributor BethDitto 18 February 2016 1:19pmAh, I would love to do something as raw as that was, it was a fun record to make. Hopefully yes, give me some time. It's my favourite Gossip record. Because it was so lo-fi, and it was the first time we had ever written songs - before it was a job.I have plans for a solo record. It's mostly a lot of harp; I play the spoons really well. And songs like Bobby McFerrin's Don't Worry Be Happy, but sad.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.21pm GMT13:21MidnightGrowler asks:Any plans for menswear?  Guardian contributor BethDitto 18 February 2016 1:18pmI would love to do a menswear line, a basic line that's good for everybody. An androgynous line. I just think that's it better that everyone can wear it, and I don't know enough about menswear to do it yet.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.21pm GMT13:21Sidfishes asks:Any tips for dealing with Septoria Leaf Spot? It completely wiped out my tomato crop last season.  Guardian contributor BethDitto 18 February 2016 1:17pmLeaf spot! Is it a problem due to it not getting enough sun and it being too damp? Do they also have bottom rot? Be sure they're in a sunny enough spot, and to maybe even check the pH in the soil. I used to grow tomatoes - they're quite easy, they're literally a weed. A problem is they fruit too early, and get bottom rot.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.20pm GMT13:20NatSpink asks:Hi Beth! Which three people (famous or otherwise) would you most like to invite to a dream dinner party and what would you cook?  Guardian contributor BethDitto 18 February 2016 1:15pmI would make a lasagna. I would invite Roseanne Barr, my best friend Jerry, and someone completely ridiculous, like Linda, the mom from Bob's Burgers. It would be amazing. The game would be to guess the one who said something, because Linda and Roseanne sound exactly alike.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.19pm GMT13:19lifeisajoke asks:Do you still live in London?

It's a sweet-ass life.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.18pm GMT13:18Cussutduck asks:I like the tulips. Do you think the biosphere stands a chance, or have we gone too far?  Guardian contributor BethDitto 18 February 2016 1:12pmThank you. It does stand a chance - hope is everything. Anyway, aren't we going to live on Mars soon? Who cares about the biosphere! Am I right folks?I listened to a podcast about picking people for that Mars mission... it was like in Napoleon Dynamite: do you have any skills? Yeah, I turn waste gases into oxygen... I would not want to go. Fuck no. No way. Imagine. You've got to be someone who's really not got anything going on in their life on Earth. I wouldn't mind a trip into space with Karl Pilkington though.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.17pm GMT13:17ItGetsWorser asks:What sort of music are you listening to these days?  Guardian contributor BethDitto 18 February 2016 1:09pmFor the most part I listen to country music. I love Paul Simon too. And we listened to David Bowie all day the other day.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.10pm GMT13:10'I didn't know my last name was a word until the movie Ghost came out. Patrick Swayze is like: "ditto"'FullaeIt asks:How often do people make a joke out of your surname?  Guardian contributor BethDitto 18 February 2016 1:08pmNot as often as they should. My name is actually Homer Ditto. I didn't know my last name was a word until the movie Ghost came out. Patrick Swayze is like: ditto. I had one teacher who called me Ditto Machine because I was so loud - it was like a photocopier before a photocopier, you had to crank it. That's how broke the school I went to was.Updatedat 1.11pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.09pm GMT13:09torjs99 asks:White or black T-shirt?  Guardian contributor BethDitto 18 February 2016 1:06pmWhite, all the way. It depends, if it's a smaller tshirt, it lays better. If it's a band tshirt, I want it to be white; if it's a sports tshirt, or oversized, it's black. Lefty-loosey, whitey-tighty.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.08pm GMT13:08Kate Halton asks:It was my partner Liam’s birthday yesterday...

It's my birthday tomorrow - I hope to live another year with all this weight on my bones. Just kidding... I wish my best friend could be here. And a cake, that's all I want.

I'm working on part two, Sitting in the Way of Control. My legs don't support my weight any more. It's so weird that people think that about me... like I'm walking with a cane!

Guardian contributor BethDitto 18 February 2016 1:01pmNo. Well, considering my family takes up half of the state, then maybe. I just made a list of the most known people in Arkansas - I was in at 10. Bill Clinton was one, Johnny Cash at two.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.05pm GMT13:05ste137 asks:I’ve always wanted to know what city you’re singing about in Love In A Foreign Place?
