The Twits is about the life of a disgusting couple, Mr and Mrs Twit.The book follows their revolting habits. For example, one of Mr and Mrs Twit’s favourite food choices are ‘worms in spaghetti’. Also, interestingly, they dislike children and torture animals. Sometimes the descriptions of their repulsive life went too far!The part I liked best in the book was when the captured monkeys escape from their cages. I think The Twits is a quick and easy read.
