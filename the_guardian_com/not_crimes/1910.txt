Arwa Mahdawi (My plea for gluten tolerance, 7 September) appears to be unaware that many people requesting gluten-free foods are suffering from food intolerances. Such sufferers do not have coeliac disease, which is an example of food hypersensitivity. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is such a condition that can be much relieved by the low-Fodmap (fermentable, oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet as described by Monash University, based on the work of Dr Sue Shepherd and Dr Peter Gibson.The research includes the group of poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates, which include lactose, fructose, polyols and fructans. Fructans include many wheat-based products. Therefore relief of IBS symptoms can be eased by trying gluten-free foods. Rosie KeeganLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
