Francis Ford Coppola has struck a deal to be the official wine sponsor to the Oscars. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Francis Ford Coppola Winery has signed an agreement to supply the Academy Awards for the next three years, as well as the 2017 Sundance film festival.The deal covers the Academy Award ceremony from 2017 to 2019, as well as allied events such as the Governors Ball, the official Oscars after-party, for which Coppola and the winery’s director of winemaking, Corey Beck, have created custom blends and commemorative labels.Coppola, an Oscar-winner for his screenplays for Patton, The Godfather, and The Godfather: Part II – for which he also won best director – as well as receiving the Irving G Thalberg Memorial award in 2010, began winemaking after buying a vineyard in California’s Napa Valley in 1975. The Francis Ford Coppola Winery is one of the film-maker’s ventures, a vineyard-cum-amusement park he describes as “a wine wonderland”, located in Geyserville, California.Brangelina nouveau: Pitt and Jolie enter the wine business The Sundance sponsorship involves the Winery hosting parties and a venture called The Big Picture which involves the commission of a custom, oversized wine cork mural which will grow in size during the festival.
