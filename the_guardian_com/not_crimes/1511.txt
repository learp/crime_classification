By the time you read this, the Rio Olympics will be over, but I linger on the subject because they will probably be the last Olympics I ever see, and I think they might have had a better press. Back in Australia, the press was bitching because too many of the Aussie female swimmers faded. Let the journalists suggest a better schedule for the runup to the games, then; and perhaps they could suggest that the swimmers might be pestered a bit less before the race.The Aussie female swimmers are high in my admiration because, when I was young, I had to get used to studying their times and realising that the least of them could go twice as fast as I could. Though reluctant to admit this fact, I was lost in awe, but couldn’t help noticing that the largely male press found it less congenial to admire the dedication of the women. I can remember the startling achievements of Dawn Fraser being belittled in print on the grounds that she was a natural athlete.Decades went by, and I was asked home to help raise funds for the swimmers of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Two moments stand out in my fading memory. I was just telling Shane Gould about the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins when a couple of men in suits swept me away to pose in front of a car, and by the time I got back to her she unaccountably wasn’t there. But it was another female swim champ who made the lasting impact. She said that the 12 years she had spent coming second to eastern European drug robots had been a waste of life. Her quiet bitterness stayed with me.Clive James: 'I won't get to Barry Humphries' new show, but I can tell he’s in total command' My long-term conclusion was that top-level sport was worth doing as long as it wasn’t me that had to do it. The best way out of doing it was watching it, and even now, as my brain fades, I follow the coverage. The local media, rather grandly, has expressed satisfaction at Britain’s share of the Olympic effort. I should think so. There are few male press personnel who would look as good as Max Whitlock in the floor exercises. He looks like Tom Cruise without the mania. Here is a handsome hero who will never jump up on to a studio couch, point two fingers at the presenter and cackle like a hyena.Not even Laura Trott, an exuberant soul, went nuts with the thrill of stacking up gold. But my favourite brilliantly sane Brit of the Rio games turned out to be Andy Murray. When he and Del Potro, having played each other to rags, collapsed into each other’s arms, the Olympic spirit looked alive and well despite all.
