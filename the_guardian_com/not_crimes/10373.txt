Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston is in Britain promoting his autobiography, A Life in Parts. I demurely took to the stage with him in London this week, in front of all those superfans and Heisenberg lookalikes, to introduce his talk for the Guardian Live series. He gave a storming one-man show, and sitting next to him gave me a sense of what it must have been like for Jimmie Nicol, the stand-in drummer who toured with the Beatles for a fortnight in 1964 when Ringo Starr got tonsillitis: standing in a wave of adulation for which one is superfluous.Bryan Cranston: 'I was Walter White – but I was never more myself' Cranston is respected for researching his roles, so I naturally asked him what it is like to take crystal meth. He replied that he had not tried it, but conceded that at a Californian dinner party he was prevailed upon to try one of the popular “suckers” or exotically flavoured narcotic lollipops (they were much favoured by the late pop legend Prince). Bryan insisted on cutting the lolly to a fraction of the size that enthusiasts generally prefer, and even at this reduced level it gave him a benign feeling.As for crystal meth, Cranston has a certain expertise. He said he watched a recent, solemn TV news report on the subject of a drug bust, in which the journalist said the meth recovered was tinged with blue, “famously the sign of good quality”. Cranston revealed that they tinged their crystal with blue on Breaking Bad so that it would look better on camera.Overhead overheads If Boris Johnson is heroically run over by the bulldozer and the third Heathrow runway goes ahead, but with no extra terminal space, then we can look forward to an extra portion of that essential airport experience: standing submissively yet resentfully in a line.My colleague Stuart Heritage this week wrote about how people with boarding cards and designated seats queue unnecessarily at departure gates. Why are they doing it? Is it just a masochistic love of queueing, and being seen to display your right to be on the plane? Not quite. Those people barging to the front are the ones with items of wheeled “carry on” luggage the size of Smart cars. They want to get them in the overhead lockers. If you’re not quick getting on a plane these days you’ll find the overhead lockers are taken up by these monsters and your bag will have to be crushed against your legs. A pain on long-haul.So it won’t be long before Ryanair and EasyJet offer a new way of paying: reserved overhead luggage lockers at, shall we say, 30 quid a flight? It has to come.Down with the clowns The approach of Halloween brings with it the prospect of adults giving us their zombie impression: autopilot parent-trudging behind excitable little kids who are getting sweets door-to-door in scary dress-up. But the toxic scary-clown fad means that Halloween this year is a trickier prospect than usual. In Germany, the craze has swept the nation, leading to a 16-year-old in clown costume getting stabbed. In the UK we are bound to see something similar on Monday.For me, this phenomenon is the result of generations of bad faith. Baffled kids dragged to circuses assumed grown-ups knew what they were talking about, vis-a-vis the officially accepted funniness of clowns. Adults assumed the kids enjoyed it. But in a convulsion of boredom and discontent, the clown morphed into a stock horror figure.We need a new anthem to be sung by magistrates – Send Down the Clowns (with apologies to Stephen Sondheim):Isn’t it rich? / Aren’t they so sa-a-d / Ruffians dressing as clowns, it’s really too ba-a-ad. / Why are they clowns?/ Send down the clowns.
