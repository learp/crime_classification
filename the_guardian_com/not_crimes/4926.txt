As an Academy award-nominated writer, he made his first foray into television and built a riveting and critically acclaimed series, establishing his place in TV history. The producers, cast and crew join us in wishing Beau the best in his next creative adventure.”Willimon said in a statement: “I’m grateful to Netflix and MRC, my fellow executive producers, our two incandescent stars Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, our talented writers, as well as the incredible cast and crew with whom I’ve had the privilege to work. “After five years and four seasons, it’s time for me to move on to new endeavours, but I’m supremely proud of what we’ve built together, wish the show much continued success, and leave it in the hands of a very capable team.”Netflix is yet to announce a replacement for Willimon, but the show has a large team of executive producers, including director David Fincher, who could potentially step into the role.
