John Kerry has met with the heads of Hollywood studios to discuss ways in which they can provide an alternative to the Isis narrative.The Deadpool effect and John Kerry's Isis plan – the Dailies film podcast The US secretary of state tweeted a picture of himself with the heads of Universal, Fox, Sony, Warner Bros and other major companies, with the words: “Great convo w/ studio execs in LA. Good to hear their perspectives & ideas of how to counter #Daesh narrative”.Daesh is another term for Isis and is an acronym for “al-Dawla al-Islamiya fil Iraq wa al-Sham”, an Arabic phrase which translates as Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (Syria). However, it is close to the term “Dahes” (one who sows discord) and is therefore used to insult the group.John Kerry (@JohnKerry)Great convo w studio execs in LA.

The organisation has already showed an interest in cinema by controversially using clips from Oliver Reed movie Lion of the Desert in their propaganda.They have also produced a number of films with high production values, aimed at recruiting a younger audience. “These videos are key,” said Roger Stahl, associate professor of communication studies at the University of Georgia. “They are necessary in Isis’s effort to paint itself as a continual target of the west’s enmity. The group has learned that, in order to cut through the clutter and noise of the infosphere, it must continually up the ante.”
