The death of Nicholas Mosley (Obituary, 2 March) leaves Gordon M Williams the only surviving member of the six finalists of the inaugural Booker prize of 1969. Now in his 80s, Gordon Williams is alive and well and living in Hammersmith. His novel, From Scenes Like These, remains a significant novel of the postwar period, while he also wrote the novel on which Sam Peckinpah’s Straw Dogs was loosely based. Walk, Don’t Walk was a lively account of a writer on a Dylan Thomas-like tour of America to promote a novel. With Terry Venables he also created the TV detective Hazell. Might not a feature on him be of wide interest to the readers of the Guardian, as well as being a contribution to the national archive?David EvansExeter• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
