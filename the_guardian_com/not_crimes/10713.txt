There’s a new biscuit in town… and he goes by the name of Alan Taylor. He’s got a tin full of cash, not to mention electric muscles!When this news reaches Mr Gum, he simply can’t stop himself from trying to bamboozle clueless Alan Taylor out of his fortune. After a sidesplitting failed attempt however, Mr Gum is determined as ever to get his grubby hands on that money. When Mr Gum and his partner in crime, Billy William III, do manage to steal the tin of cash, they go so far as to make plans to move to France. But will do-gooders Polly and Friday make it in time to save Alan Taylor’s money?My favourite character is Jonathan Ripples because he’s fat, daft, but all together, he’s a big softie! I would strongly recommend this book for 7-10 year olds because of the big text and many illustrations. This book will have you blubbering with glee!Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
