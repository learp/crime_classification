As Oscar season reaches its inevitable anticlimax this weekend – congratulations Team Revenant – cinemas across the country are littered with so-called prestige pictures, all eager to soak up the last few ounces of credibility that come with being an Oscar hopeful, before settling into a lifetime as Oscar failures. Any self-respecting film fan will be hoovering up the last of the nominees in an effort to fine-tune their predictions for Sunday night, yet I’m guessing only a few will make the effort to watch the 15 short films in contention at this year’s ceremony.The problem isn’t one of access. This week, all the nominees in the live-action and animated short categories were released on VOD (the documentary short category is still being held hostage by HBO, which has exclusive rights to three of the five nominees). You could watch every single one of them in the time it takes to endure Leo’s gritty voyage across the Great Plains, so why are so few people willing to do so?The shorts themselves must shoulder at least some of the blame. A dispiriting number of short films feel suspiciously like trailers for yet-to-be-made features, as though they’re aimed more at studio financiers than general audiences. With an increasing number of feature-length indie hits starting out as acclaimed shorts (including Damien Chazelle’s spectacularly successful Whiplash) it’s no wonder film-makers are starting to see short film-making as a stage of development, rather than an art form in its own right.In practical terms, this means an avalanche of shorts that would rather hint at a story than actually tell one. Take Stutterer, a film nominated in the live-action short category, which follows a London man with a speech disorder as he courageously takes a chance on love. After 12 minutes of character exposition, the film ends on a meaningless cliffhanger, slamming to a halt just as the story threatens to get interesting and the storytelling threatens to get complicated.This kind of noncommittal plotting is an all too familiar trait of contemporary short films, which is maybe why so many viewers find them unappealing, even as they bemoan the increasingly mammoth runtimes of the movies vying for best picture.The best short films allow their stories to determine their runtimes, and not the other way around. World Of Tomorrow, the likely winner in this year’s animated short category, takes a dazzling array of thoughts on what it is to be alive and compresses them into a tea break, not because they couldn’t be spread across a feature, but because they needn’t be. In doing so, the film seems to ask why we’re so concerned with running times in the first place, and why more films can’t – or won’t – distil their ideas down into 17 perfectly formed minutes.Also available      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Courtesy/REX ShutterstockBradley Cooper acts the shit out of alcoholism in failed Oscar bait Burnt.Acclaimed US indie James White becomes the latest Sundance favourite to shuffle quietly past UK cinemas and straight to DVD.Hilariously po-faced biblical romp Noah lands on Netflix tomorrow.
