1 Gavin TurkFrom posing as Sid Vicious to dabbling in psychoanalysis, the not-so-Young British Artist has long put himself in the picture. But there’s a dry wit to his work that makes it more than mere posturing; his sense of reality is tough and thought-provoking. Those who made British art famous in the 90s are often unfairly dismissed, so it’s good to see Damien Hirst showcase one of his contemporaries at his gallery.Newport Street Gallery, SE11, to 19 Mar2 The Bauer Brothers Collection      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Photograph: Kevin Webb/The Natural History Museum, LondonThese Austria-born artists of the Romantic era portrayed nature with sensitivity and scientific rigour. Working when Linnaeus’s system of classifying species had brought a new discipline to natural history, the Bauers were at the forefront of scientific art. Franz worked at Kew Gardens making accurate studies of orchids and drawing microscopic phenomena, while Ferdinand explored Australia as a ship’s artist. Their detailed images are marvels of discovery.Natural History Museum, SW7, to 26 Feb3 Martin Boyce      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Martin Boyce’s Do Words Have Voices, 2011 Photograph: Colin Davison/Courtesy of the Artist and The Modern Institute, Andrew Hamilton/Toby Webster Ltd, GlasgowMartin Boyce creates places halfway between the lost utopias of early 20th-century avant-garde architecture and derelict old playgrounds. These abstract yet all too brutally real worlds are vaguely threatening and electrically exciting. Above all, he captures the feel of city life; streets and parks poised between optimism and despair. This is the modern art of modern Britain, and it stays in your mind like a rusty nail in the foot.Tate Britain, SW1, to 30 Sep4 Trade Routes      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Artist Christopher Jarratt worked with Sheffield social enterprise Green Estate on this bold experiment in community and craft. Youngsters designed and built their own seaworthy boat, with designer Paul Reardon and carpenter Tom Collier helping to make the dream a reality. The resulting canoe symbolises their effort and skill, with the project documented here from sketches to maiden voyage.Site Gallery, Sheffield, Sat to 14 Jan5 Wynford Dewhurst      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Wynford Dewhurst’s Evening Shadows Photograph: Dan BrownThe impressionists frequented places where they could paint modern middle-class pleasure: cafes by the Seine, gardens, the beaches of Normandy and... Manchester? Yes, it’s true: Dewhurst published the first English-language book on the movement in 1904, and claimed that it was secretly British anyway, because Turner did it all first. His own art was an enthusiastic attempt to ape Monet. Of course, by the time Dewhurst had discovered the style, the French had already moved on.Manchester Art Gallery, to 23 Apr
