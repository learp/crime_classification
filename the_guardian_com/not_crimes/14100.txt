First there was Zoolander 2, Bad Santa 2, Dumb and Dumber To – not to mention the forthcoming Trainspotting sequel. Now studio New Line have announced a follow-up to the 2005 hit comedy Wedding Crashers. The original film starred Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn as divorce mediators who turn up uninvited at weddings to prey on vulnerable single women. Speaking to promote her film Nocturnal Animals last week, Isla Fisher – who plays a conquest of Vaughn’s who becomes set on continuing their relationship – said she had been told about the sequel by Vaughn at a recent party. The studio confirmed the news on 21 November.The original movie made took $285m (£228m) and had a $40m budget. Wedding Crashers was a breakthrough film for Fisher, and featured Bradley Cooper in an early role as the aggressive boyfriend of Rachel McAdams, who Wilson’s character pursues. Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour played Fisher and McAdams’s parents. No deals have yet been made with the cast, nor with director David Dobkin, who had apparently collaborated with the two leads on a sequel treatment in 2014 in which the pair were intimidated by the “ultimate wedding crasher” Daniel Craig. In the original film, Will Ferrell had a cameo as an early pioneer of the technique who had moved on to funerals. Wilson also has another long-awaited sequel in the works: Shanghai Dawn, the third in his action-comedy series with Jackie Chan, which began with Shanghai Noon (2000) and was followed by Shanghai Knights (2003).
