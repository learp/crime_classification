The radical economist Swasti Mitter, who has died of cancer aged 76, pioneered the investigation of how global changes in work and technology have affected women in developing countries.She applied the skills of a hard-headed, mathematically inclined economist, plus an exceptional capacity for empathetic social investigation, to the human consequences of shifts in the international division of labour. Beginning by collecting the testimonies of Bangladeshi immigrant homeworkers in the clothing industry in the East End of London in 1982, she went on to trace connections between the casualisation of labour in Britain and the operations of transnational corporations in developing countries.The result was Common Fate, Common Bond: Women in the Global Economy (1986), which described the growth of export processing zones, together with the spread of low-pay sweatshops and homeworking, producing goods sold by large outlets in Europe and the US. Swasti argued that changes in the organisation of production, made possible by new technology, were contributing to the emergence of “a third world among the first”, and called for the creation of a new labour movement in the developed world that was prepared to learn from methods of empowering poor women in developing countries. The book drew on work by feminist economists such as Ursula Huws, and on emergent networks of resistance, including Women Working Worldwide, formed in the first half of the 1980s; but the thoughtful clarity of its influential synthesis was Swasti’s own.She pursued similar themes in the book she edited with me, Dignity and Daily Bread: New Forms of Economic Organising Among Poor Women in the Third World and the First (1994), which detailed attempts to organise labour in free trade zones, in clothing sweatshops in Mexico, among homeworkers in India and West Yorkshire, and in small businesses run by women in Tanzania. The research was made possible by the United Nations University’s World Institute for Development Economics Research and led to Swasti’s involvement with the UNU’s Institute for New Technologies (Intech) and another edited work, Women Encounter Technology (1995). This showed the contradictory effects of new technology upon women workers while exploring the relations between tacit “knowhow” and theoretical knowledge.The International Labour Organisation (ILO) published Women in Trade Unions: Organising the Unorganised (1994), which she edited with Margaret Martens. Swasti was a cooperative scholar, researching and writing with activists and feminist economists such as Anneke van Luijken, Naila Kabeer, Nirmala Banerjee, Cecilia Ng Choon Sim, Carol Yong, Diane Elson and Ruth Pearson. I found working alongside her both stimulating and joyous.She was born in Baharampur in West Bengal, India, to Sasanka Sanyal, a leading nationalist and lawyer, and his wife, Ushararini. Her mother not only had a strong belief in the need for women to receive education but great faith in her daughter’s scholarly abilities, and was able to persuade Swasti’s father to allow her to study economics first at Presidency College in Calcutta (now Kolkata, 1956-57) and then at Khrishnath College in Baharampur (1957-58).Swasti’s first struggle was to overcome her parents’ opposition to her marrying Partha Mitter, whom she met in 1957. They married three years later in 1960 and moved to Britain, where Swasti studied at the London School of Economics and Cambridge University. Her initial research ranged from an account of the demand for food and agricultural products in the UK to an oral history of how peasant movements in West Bengal altered agrarian class relations.Employed by Brighton Polytechnic (later the University of Brighton) from 1974, she was appointed professor of gender and technology there in 1993. Between 1994 and 2000 she was deputy director of Intech, where she continued to study the human consequences of economic transformation, focusing particularly on new technology in Europe and in Asia. She never abandoned her commitment to opening up new opportunities for democratic participation of poor women by expanding the narrow circuits through which economic knowledge is exchanged internationally.Opposed to all forms of injustice, she wanted to enable poor women to develop their voices so they could assert their needs. She understood that this involved access to information and the transfer of economic and social resources from the powerful to the vulnerable. She also played a key part in linking grassroots activists and trade unionists with academic researchers and large-scale organisations such as the United Nations.She is survived by Partha, by their children, Rana and Pamina, and by two grandchildren, Iskandar and Malavika.• Swasti Mitter, economist, born 22 May 1939; died 1 May 2016
