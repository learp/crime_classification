Clarke Peters, 65, is best known for playing detective Lester Freamon in HBO drama The Wire and Albert “Big Chief” Lambreaux in Treme. He grew up in New Jersey, then moved to London in the 1970s, where he formed soul band the Majestics and worked as a backing singer on Joan Armatrading’s Love and Affection and Heatwave’s Boogie Nights. His West End credits include Porgy and Bess and Chicago. In 1990, Peters wrote the Tony-nominated revue Five Guys Named Moe. He is currently creative director of new musical Stormy, about the American singer, actor and civil rights activist Lena Horne, who was known as Hollywood’s first black sex symbol and whose 70-year career also spanned Broadway musicals, Grammy-winning jazz albums and appearances alongside Martin Luther King at political rallies.Why I celebrate Lena Horne | David Thomson 2017 is the centenary year of Lena Horne’s birth. Is she a heroine of yours?In one aspect I feel she is America, with all that she had to battle with inside of herself. She was trying to find her identity, just as America was trying to find its identity. I grew up watching her, and I saw this very sophisticated lady who was very attractive, but it wasn’t until you look at some of her interviews that you catch the mischievousness in her. She’s not this sweet, demure woman. She’s got a sassiness. It’s her defiance, her coping mechanism in the world. Her way of saying: “Up yours, I’m not who you think I am. I carry more inside of me than you could ever imagine.” Many people are not really aware of her struggle and what she did in America to break down certain barriers. And then she had to deal with her own identity – she carried African American and Native American descent in her genes; that’s what blew my mind.

Photograph: Allstar/CinetextHorne found it painful that she was given roles by Hollywood because they considered her lighter-skinned?Yes, and also within the African American community there were divisions that she didn’t want to have foisted upon her. Then you have her Native American side. Who are you? Where are you in this whole picture? At the end of the day she is America. She is all of those things.Stormy stars Camilla Beeput as Lena. She also co-wrote the music and lyrics. How did you get involved?I was sitting on set with Camilla one day filming BBC1’s Agatha Christie drama Partners in Crime, and she said she wasn’t sure what to do next. I suggested she do a one-woman show. So she went around looking at key women with stories to tell – the Mary Seacoles of the world. And when she landed on Lena: it was the right thing. I directed the first couple of workshops and encouraged her to go ahead. Because how many subjects are there for black women to do historically? And Lena had one hell of a journey. She maintained her modesty, to a large degree, even in the face of great adulation. She never lost sight of that when the world was trying to seduce her away from herself and all the genes running through her body.What timescale does the piece cover?We go from her childhood with Grandma Horne right up to her playing Glinda in the film The Wiz (directed by her then son-in-law Sidney Lumet) and receiving the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People) award for outstanding jazz artist, up to her demise in 2010, aged 92. Camilla said to me: “I feel like I’m dealing with some of the same issues as Lena, in particular the business.” And I said: “There’s the key. That’s what you want to go on with. Because these are the issues that we are still grappling with today.” Camilla shares so much of herself in the role. Her truth will vibrate through Lena’s words.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Camilla Beeput as Lena Horne – photoshootAs a performer, you’ve managed to avoid typecasting. Was that a conscious thing?Yes, I refuse to be pigeonholed. When I realised that I was being cast as the song-and-dance man, I thought, wait a minute. And it was Peter Hall who said: “Come to the National, we’ll have things for you to do.” It might have been easy for me to be complacent, but easy doesn’t work for me.Was there a different energy when you performed with your Wire co-star Dominic West in the Sheffield Crucible production of Othello in 2011?Yes, I think as actors we need to use that energy in many ways. We’re here to serve, entertain and educate audiences. And if they see an actor forever in the same role, I’m afraid that will wind up, subliminally, sending the message that when you find that character, well, you can have a great life but you effectively put the business in the role of a pimp. And the actor is just the prostitute who has this one trick. But the actor is trained to observe life and all the facets that are in a personality. I always refer to Sam Jackson as the angry black man, well that’s how Hollywood has cast him. But actually he’s a fine actor who would love to do Shakespeare.

I think it’s the first original psychological drama that is so totally American. I don’t think there has been anything like it before. That’s why it’s grossed so much money. It plays off all the psychosis that goes on here. It doesn’t pull any punches. It goes right where you hope it doesn’t go. And can I recommend Black-ish [on Channel 4 in the UK]? What an intelligent piece of television for the black community in America. They don’t hold back on anything.What are you filming now?I’m working on a piece for Hulu with my old friend Hugh Laurie called Chance. It’s a psychological drama in a genre called surf noir - I kid you not. It’s set in California, and Hugh is the psychiatrist and I’m a gay antiques dealer. No danger of being typecast! I said: “Clarke will do a lot of things, but I’m not going to bed with a man and I’m not going to be kissing a cat on screen.” Unless it’s Dominic West, of course.• Stormy: The Life of Lena Horne premieres at Norwich Playhouse on 17 May and is at the Komedia, Bath on 24 May as part of the Bath festival
