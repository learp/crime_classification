If I say that I have seen my first spring migrants it is only fair to add that they had probably not been out of England this winter. The birds were a pair of blackcaps, which I watched for about an hour in a sheltered spot in Torquay; close to them an almond in full bloom and other spring flowers evidenced the mildness of season and locality. The blackcap is known to winter occasionally in Devon and Cornwall, and twelve months ago I received one which had been killed by a cat in Somerset. The most interesting thing about the birds I watched is that they were evidently a pair. If it is the rule for paired birds to remain together in their winter quarters oversea, how is it that the cocks are said to arrive here in spring some days, or even weeks, before the hens? A possible explanation is that here are paired birds which remain together and travel together, and young or unmated birds which travel alone and seek a mate when they arrive. The sex impulses, intimately connected with the migratory instinct, may be strongest in the males, and urge them homewards before the hens. The female blackcap was feeding busily upon the berries of ivy.
