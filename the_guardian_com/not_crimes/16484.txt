The Hollywood screenwriter Max Landis has denied defending the casting of Scarlett Johansson in a “whitewashed” remake of the classic Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell.Landis, writer of films such as Chronicle and American Ultra, took to YouTube on Friday to explain why studios chose Johansson over Asian actors for the part of cyborg policewoman Major Kusanagi in the controversial live action reworking.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest “The only reason to be upset about Scarlett Johansson being in Ghost in the Shell is if you don’t know how the movie industry works,” he said, arguing that there were no “A-list female Asian celebrities” capable of getting a major Hollywood movie green-lit in 2016.“It’s infuriating,” added Landis. “There used to be, in the 90s, diversity in our A-list actors. Jackie Chan and Jet Li were famous at the same time, they could both get movies made. We don’t have that guy any more, we don’t even have Lucy Liu any more.Why Max Landis is wrong about Scarlett Johansson's 'whitewashed' Ghost in the Shell remake “That is not the fault of the movie industry, really,” continued the film-maker. “That’s culture and movies getting more and more afraid because movies make less and less money.”The blogosphere hummed with articles describing Landis’ comments as a “defence” of Johansson’s casting over the weekend.
