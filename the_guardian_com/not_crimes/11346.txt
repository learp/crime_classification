No Longer at Ease is written by Chinua Achebe, and is autobiographical in nature. It brings awareness to African society, when their countries (specifically Nigeria) are going through a transition period – a period in which Nigeria, along with 17 other African nations, were about to get back their independence from Great Britain.The writer explains the complexity of the situation, as it is very delicate. An average African man needs to be mentally strong enough to take the governance back in his hands. But tragic problems like corruption, bribery and loss of African values interfere with a man like Obi. Obi, a young man with the appropriate tools such as a foreign education, can bring about a change for the better. But as the story progresses, his illusions are transformed into disillusionment.Achebe clearly states the difference between tradition versus progress, and the divided society of Nigeria on the basis of caste, race, language and religion. Obi is trapped between the tradition, and the new ways of the west. Obi ends up being caught taking bribes of 20 pounds to repay back his debts.
