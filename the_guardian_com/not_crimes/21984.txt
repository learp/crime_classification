1.57pm BST13:57And that's all …Thanks to Marr for joining us, and thank you to everyone who posted questions.  Guardian contributor Andrew Marr 12 April 2017 1:52pmThanks for all the questions – I hope I've managed to answer a fair range of the topics that you've raised. However angry you are with me, try us again one Sunday morning, and don't forget, The History of Modern Britain - post-Brexit edition! Goodbye, and good luck.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.56pm BST13:56 Shanvaus asks:Do you believe that the UK would gain from a significant push towards placing more economic power in the hands of the regions post-Brexit? Would an economic treaty incorporating Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the EU but linked politically to the UK work?  Guardian contributor Andrew Marr 12 April 2017 1:51pmYes. I think London is grossly overheated and other parts of the country under-resourced and supported. We will only be a happy nation when the north and West Midlands of England are properly buzzing again.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.54pm BST13:54 Prashant Kotak asks:Do you have a view on why politicians globally are avoiding discussing the impact of large-scale automation, and the impeding automation-driven unemployment tsunami that is going to crash over all countries within a decade?  Guardian contributor Andrew Marr 12 April 2017 1:50pmEver since the Luddites, there have been predictions of mass unemployment caused by automation, and so far, overall, we have mostly found new ways to employ ourselves. But I think this may be about to change. I'm particularly concerned with the effect of driverless vehicles, on the million-plus people who currently drive for a living. For a lot of people, this has been the default employment, and it may be coming to an end quite soon. Automation needn't be a problem, so long as the huge profits it brings are usefully and widely distributed... so we are back to politics again.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.51pm BST13:51 Ian Batch asks:How much do you think the financial crisis in 2008 is still shaping politics? Are Brexit and Donald Trump and the rise of populism due in large part to the economy not working for the many but the few? And do you draw parallels with the Great Depression and the rise of fascism?  Guardian contributor Andrew Marr 12 April 2017 1:46pmAs I have argued in the new book, I think the 2008 crisis continues to reverberate very loudly everywhere except for a small group at the top. I think the combination of the financial elites disgracing themselves, and then the political elites doing likewise (MPs expenses; wars, various etc) by and large explains why the Brexit vote happened. That – and a completely unprecedented level of immigration, particularly into communities which already felt economically forgotten. I think populisms around the word - from Trump to Hungary, Italy's Five Star, to Le Pen – are connected with a failure of the system to deliver for enough people, as vast amounts of manufacturing were outsourced to the east. In general, capitalism works well in delivering new goods and services, but only when there are strong countervailing forces from government/politics to clear up the mess and mitigate its unfairnesses. That's been lacking. And that's why we are in a bit of state, though, at least on several days a week, I am not expecting world war three.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.43pm BST13:43 RidleyWalker asks:Tell us about music. It’s obviously important to you, given that you bung it on to the end of a current affairs programme. How did that come about? Have you ever asked Jools Holland if you can present Later… if he’s off sick?  Guardian contributor Andrew Marr 12 April 2017 1:42pmI can't remember how it started. I always wanted the show to be a mixed, general, serious conversation, rather than an annexe or garden shed for political obsessives. The music allows moments of pleasantly understated surrealism which I much relish. There was a glorious early occasion when the entire political lineup were made to shake maracas and tambourines; and then there was the moment when Squeeze ambushed David Cameron. For myself, my tastes run to Nick Cave and Shostakovich - that kind of thing. Screaming violins and lurching arpeggios.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.42pm BST13:42Who was the best Beatle? heraclitus123 asks:Paul or John – who was the best Beatle?

After joining various Facebook groups, I’ve discovered a whole world of quacks offering dubious treatments for lots of money. For those without your financial resources, what advice would you give about seeking alternative treatments?  Guardian contributor Andrew Marr 12 April 2017 1:38pmFirst, don't give up on the state: every area in the country ought to have NHS physiotherapy to which you should be entitled. Second, find a local gym – I now go three times a week and it is central to my recovery. Third, get in touch with ARNI – Action on Rehabilitation for Neurological Injuries. This is a private charity which offers excellent physical support at a lower price that your average neuro-physiotherapist.

Guardian contributor Andrew Marr 12 April 2017 1:35pmThe late 18th century – the period of the Scottish Enlightenment, and the American and French revolutions, completely fascinates me. It was a period of enormous intellectual optimism when the old aristocratic world was visibly falling apart; it's also where our modern ideas about truth and progress really come from. The music wasn't bad, either.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.38pm BST13:38The BBC is under siege – the country is divided nellieknox asks:Do you ever get the feeling that the Beeb & BBC News is under siege from all sides and, as a result is damned either way?  Guardian contributor Andrew Marr 12 April 2017 1:33pmYes I do! I think we are living through a period where the country is divided and unusually angry. It's happened before – during the late 70s, then the early years of the Thatcher government, then the Iraq war. But as we try to be a calm and factual voice, we are heavily buffeted: there are more and more people who simply feel it's an outrage that politicians they disagree with should be given airtime at all. We have fairly clear rules about balance, party political balance - I can't do a series of shows that are biased towards one side or the other in terms of guests. I have to balance across the parties, and the Remain vs Leave position. We have to try to get some gender balance, and we make sure that the shows are not all white. We try to bring in voices from parts of Britain far outside London... when you put that together in the context of a weekly show it becomes very hard to cover all bases – and then remember you should be covering the main story of the day, and properly. It's a political Rubik's Cube every Friday afternoon!Updatedat 2.04pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.33pm BST13:33 David Smith asks:I believe youhave interviewed only one French presidential candidate - Marine Le Pen - on your Sunday politics show. Why haven’t you interviewed the others? And why her on Remembrance Sunday? Have you made serious attempts to book the other candidates?  Guardian contributor Andrew Marr 12 April 2017 1:29pmWe are desperate to interview other candidates – Fillon and Macron (who I have interviewed before) again. But so far our pleas are falling on deaf ears. We take who we can get. Because Marine le Pen has a chance of becoming the next French president, I thought it was right to interview her, and challenge her, for instance, about her views on French Muslims. I thought Le Pen was steely, and has left behind her father's more extreme verbiage... We've been criticised for putting the interview out on Remembrance Sunday. Given that many people fear she is a fascist, I can't think of a more appropriate time. But we certainly want all sides – it's an election which may put Brexit in the shade.Updatedat 2.07pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.29pm BST13:29 Jo Whitehouse asks:Why do you always patronise and denigrate left-wingers when they come on your show? I find it hard to watch your programme (or a lot of BBC news shows) any more as you seem to be siding not only with the Tories or the Labour right but also trying to uphold a system that stopped working for a lot of us long ago. As the BBC is paid for by licence holders and has the claim to be impartial, how do you defend denigrating those supporting Jeremy Corbyn’s rise so much? Do you not think the left (not New Labour) but actual leftwing ideas and policies, and those who support them, deserve to have those ideas and policies properly debated? I’m the lone parent of a disabled child. My impression of well-paid journalists like yourself is you’re alright jack, in a neo-lib, upper-middle-class bubble while the poor, the young, the disabled, the NHS, social housing and public services can go to hell. Why don’t you try listening to those offering an alternative instead of patronising and denigrating them when they come on your program? Since you’re supposed to be impartial and all that. I don’t think Corbyn has the necessary qualities to be Labour leader, but my god we need some of his policies, and I’m disgusted by how undermined he’s been by the BBC.  Guardian contributor Andrew Marr 12 April 2017 1:25pmI don't patronise and denigrate - I hope I don't. I don't feel that I do. It's been a really rough time for the Labour left, and when a party is fighting amongst itself, that will be reflected, inevitably, in conversations with its leaders. But, for the record, I like Jeremy Corbyn, and much enjoy our encounters; and so far as I'm aware, he hasn't complained about any of them. I like his frankness, I like his ability to listen to a question and genuinely try to answer it.Updatedat 1.40pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.25pm BST13:25 Steve Reed asks:Are there any grounds for optimism?  Guardian contributor Andrew Marr 12 April 2017 1:21pmYes! We remain an essentially pluralistic, socially liberal, law-abiding and prosperous country. Our party political system may seem pretty skewed at the moment, but a sense of history reminds us that nothing is forever. I can remember very vividly the feeling during the Thatcher years that the Conservatives would be power for ever - and a very similar, deluded sense that "political history is over" during the Blair ascendency. When things go wrong in this country, we tend to find a way of kicking them out pretty hard and fast.There are some really important economics and political thinkers around at the moment – such as Kate Raworth's "doughnut economics" – and I get the sense that a major period of new thinking and political creativity is coming, in terms of our approach to turbo-charged capitalism. I have no idea how this will break out in concrete political terms, but generally, when there are big new ideas and a sense of urgency around, they find a way.Old economics is based on false ‘laws of physics’ – new economics can save us Updatedat 1.40pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
