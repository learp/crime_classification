Will Smith has criticised Donald Trump and the “absolute collective insanity” of his support.Four films that predicted the rise of Donald Trump The actor, currently promoting his role in Suicide Squad, spoke about the Republican candidate’s many divisive statements in an interview with news.com.au.“For a man to be able to publicly refer to a woman as a fat pig, that makes me teary,” he said. “And for people to applaud, that is absolutely fucking insanity to me. My grandmother would have smacked my teeth out of my head if I had referred to a woman as a fat pig. And I cannot understand how people can clap for that. It’s absolutely collective insanity.”Smith also said that if any of his children said what Trump had about a woman, there would be severe consequences. “If one of my sons – I am getting furious just thinking about it – if one of my sons said that in a public place, they couldn’t even live in my house any more,” he said.The Oscar nominee spoke about his concerns over the “separatist, non-inclusive, xenophobic, racist wave that is sweeping the globe” but believes that, ultimately, the US will see sense.“I have faith in America,” he said. “America has had really critical times, but the good [people] tend to make their way to the top.”Smith is one of many actors speaking out about Trump. More than 120 stars, including Julianne Moore and Lena Dunham, have signed a pledge urging Americans not to vote for him on 8 November.
