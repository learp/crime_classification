1: The FatherSeventy-one-year-old Kenneth Cranham beat both Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Rylance to win this year’s Olivier for best actor, and it was the right decision. Cranham is extraordinarily moving in Florian Zeller’s brilliant play that takes us inside the head of a man who is suffering from dementia. It is the most discombobulating experience and one that is played out with real aplomb in James Macdonald’s astute production.Theatre Royal Brighton, Mon to 30 Apr2: The Book Of MormonIs The Book Of Mormon a great musical? Probably not, but it’s undoubtedly a really great night out. Irreverent but essentially quite wholesome, this clever show about a group of Mormon missionaries in Africa is full of enjoyable numbers that neatly pastiche the Broadway musical form, while sizzling with the kind of whiplash wit that you’d expect from the creators of South Park. Pricey, but worth it, and the Prince Of Wales is one of very few West End theatres to seat everyone in comfort.Prince Of Wales Theatre, W1, to 23 Jul3: People, Places And ThingsDenise Gough’s performance as actor Emma, who is addicted to drink and drugs, has deservedly been praised to the heavens. An enthralling, often viciously funny evening, and one that makes you question notions of addiction and its treatment while highlighting just how seductive the illusions of theatre can be.Wyndham’s Theatre, WC2, to 18 Jun4: In The HeightsEarlier this month, Drew McOnie deservedly carried away an Olivier for best choreography for this rough and ready but spirited production. In McOnie’s extraordinary routines, the characters dance as if their lives depend on it. Combining Latino rhythms with hip-hop and rap, the show focuses on the impoverished community in Washington Heights, and makes up for what it lacks in sophistication with heart and exuberance.King’s Cross Theatre, N1, to 30 Oct5: King LearDon Warrington acts up a real storm in Michael Buffong’s plain but effective revival for Talawa, the company led by black actors. Warrington is a majestic king who loses both his authority and his mind as Cordelia’s truth-telling punctures the trappings of power. It’s one of several Lears that will be seen this year – including Glenda Jackson in a version at the Old Vic – but Warrington’s heart-breaking turn will be the one to top.Royal Exchange, Manchester, to 7 May
