This refreshingly citrussy cocktail is named after Mount Fuji because the sesame seeds on the rim of the glass make it look a bit like a rocky, snow-capped peak. Serves one.1 slice lime½ tsp each black and white sesame seeds mixed with ½ tsp sugar50ml vodka25ml lime juice20ml pear liquor (such as Lejay)25ml pear puréeRub the lime around the outside rim of a tumbler, then turn the top of the glass in the sesame seed and sugar mix, so it sticks. Hard shake all the liquids over ice, then double strain into the glass over more ice.• Nico Peratinos, bars manager, Aqua London
