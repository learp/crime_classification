The funniest standup I’ve ever seenI once seriously worried about myself watching Greg Davies perform Firing Cheeseballs At A Dog in a tiny room in Edinburgh about six years ago. I felt I might simultaneously wet myself and choke to death and everyone would think I was just pissed rather than just laughing too much.The funniest TV show I’ve ever seenI don’t think you can beat Frasier for sheer scalpel-sharp writing and performance.The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever hadEveryone always laughs at the word “perm” so probably when I had a perm, even though I thought I looked fantastic.How I get ready: Jenny Eclair The funniest sketch I’ve ever seenCal McCrystal’s direction of Stiff, again in Edinburgh, yonks ago, had me totally beside myself, which is weird because slapstick doesn’t really do it for me; I tend to like my comedy quite wordy. We Are Klang’s debut hour also made me honk like a big goose.The funniest person I knowMy mother, sometimes unintentionally, and my daughter. But, until he died a couple of years ago, it was my father. He was hilarious and funny even when he was meant to be dying. Once, after his kidneys packed in, he came round and nicked a bar of chocolate off a nurse.The funniest heckle I’ve ever heardIn the old days it used to be: “Show us your tits”. It would be hilarious if someone shouted that now. In fact I’d be very tempted to get them out.The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funnyMost bodily functions. Yes farting still does it for me and I’m 56; however I find burping objectionable.The funniest numberEleven or 150 billion gadzillion; I don’t tend to be too cut-and-dried about these things.The funniest wordAll words are potentially funny, you’ve just got to get them in the right order. That’s the hard bit.Jenny Eclair: How To Be A Middle Aged Woman (Without Going Insane) is touring to 18 Mar
