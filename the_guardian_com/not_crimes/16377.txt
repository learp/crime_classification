They’re scathing. They’re unhinged. They are, according to those who’ve seen them, one of the best live acts in Britain. The south London band’s reputation as squat party-throwing, willy waving hedonists may precede them but Fat White Family’s taste in music is just as gnarly as their image. Their second album, Songs for Our Mothers, released last month, is testament to that: full of bilious, sleazy tunes that channelled Throbbing Gristle and the Fall and everything from surf-rock to barbed blues, recorded with Sean Lennon in New York.But back to London: Saul and Lias joined us on the Guardian Radio Hour to trawl through their favourite outsider ballads, numbering bleak 15-minute jams, Celtic ditties and the kind of freaky folk you’d probably least expect to hear from them.Listen to Lias and Saul debunk some of the myths around the band (no, Lias never rode a donkey into a gig); why they’re still proud to revel in their own misery; and how their new album will be a concept album about a racist crooner that lives in a dive bar in Las Vegas.You can listen to the full show above or you can subscribe to our Music Weekly podcast to get a shorter version delivered to you every week.
