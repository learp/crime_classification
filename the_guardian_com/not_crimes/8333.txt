On the street, Gorman is the astonishingly successful fashion brand behind offbeat raincoats, lobster-print dresses and clothes that many women love – and most men “don’t get”.How to look good in green: the best ethical fashion | Alice Fisher Online, Gorman is the recipient of a devotion that can border on fanaticism. “Gormies”, as they call themselves, are primarily women devoted to the brand who ensure items sell out within 45 minutes of being stocked across Australia and trade advice, clothes and commiserations over missed “unicorn” pieces in Facebook groups.“Unicorns” are incredibly popular pieces from previous seasons – such as the summer 2014 lobster dress or the autumn 2015 greenhouse puffer jacket – which regularly sell for about $600 on eBay, such is the fervour surrounding them.The Facebook groups range from friendly and fun to occasionally militant – comment threads on rules have been known to end in Nazi and Third Reich references. Recently one woman sought advice when her new boyfriend asked her to stop wearing the brightly coloured and loud-printed brand because it made him feel “uncomfortable”. (“Leave him” was the gist of many of the responses.)In the past fortnight, however, there has been a tear in the fabric of the Gorman community in the form of a report on the supply chain and workers’ rights at various fashion labels. The 2016 fashion report by Baptist World Aid Australia graded companies from A to F on their policies to prevent exploitation of workers in overseas factories.“Fast fashion chains” Zara and H&M received an A and B+. Kmart was graded with a B. Factory X, which owns Gorman, received an F. Prices for Gorman dresses hover around the $250 mark while coats can sell for $400.A spokeswoman for Gorman said the F grading was because the brand chose not to be “affiliated” with the survey as it did not know Baptist’s “real processes”“The F grading was a failure to reply not a failure to comply. Our customer’s have been misled,” she said.“As a business we continue to address our social and ethical responsibility and take it very seriously.”Low wages, unsafe conditions and harassment: fashion must do more to protect female workers What has ensued is a genuine searching of Gorman fans’ brightly coloured and matchy-matchy souls. Links to stories covering the report have been posted across Gorman groups, sparking hundreds of comments.The discussions have been earnest, courteous and furious. “It used to be this cool, groovy brand that made nice cuts and had personality but now it’s showing it’s basic, just like the rest and only concerned with $$$$,” Hayley Hewitt said.Gorman fans see the clothes as an extension of themselves and for years they have complained about creeping prices and perceptions of slipping standards (easily frayed hems, colours that run). These issues have remained grumbles but Gormies, while usually from a middle-class background, are “woke” and will not tolerate the exploitation of workers in another country in their name.Gorman’s response to the building anger came on Tuesday night when it posted a photo to Instagram of what the brand claimed was one of the workers in the factory talking about how much he loves Gorman knit designs as part of the #WhoMadeMyClothes campaign.Gorman’s Instagram post after being given a F for supply chain and working condition practicesThe post has intensified the backlash, attracting more than 450 comments, mostly angry.One link to a story reporting the F rating posted to a Facebook group with a tentative “I’m not sure if I should be posting this” has more than 100 distressed comments on it, spawning a change.org petition that has more than 1,000 signatures and an email campaign. There are also multiple links to other Australian ethical brands that have been received with glee.“This whole thing just shows how powerful Gorman’s marketing is and how easily we all believe lies by omission,” Darcy Ellen wrote. “Such a shame considering the humble roots of the brand and how it takes its loving, loyal following for granted. Now they have a wave of angry Gormies to contend with. If they’d stayed honest they wouldn’t have this problem!”Gorman has a social and ethical compliance policy posted on its website that states: “We are committed to the communities in which we live and operate, ensuring that we integrate good corporate behaviour into all aspects of our operations. We believe in looking beyond financial results and include social, environmental and ethical indicators in the measure of our performance.“To be a supplier to Gorman, companies must pass through a strict evaluation process including social and ethical compliance audits. We work to build and maintain long-term manufacturing partnerships both locally and overseas with like-minded vendors who maintain the high standards that we set.”“We closely monitor the entire supply chain and all stages of production, with senior management completing both scheduled and random audits on suppliers.”Hidden child labour: how Syrian refugees in Turkey are supplying Europe with fast fashion The policy has been mocked by Gormies and adds to the sense of betrayal, with one user saying they had been “outright lied to”. The most ubiquitous Gorman Facebook group, Gorman Buy and Sell, has 6,200 members who have been continuously posting about how let down they feel by the brand and vowing to shop elsewhere.“I’ll definitely avoid buying new Gorman clothing etc until they commit to fairer pay and working conditions for their workers,” Susie Godfrey wrote. “It’s too easy to look the other way in the name of fashion but doing so makes us as culpable as Gorman/Factory X themselves – it basically means we’re willing and knowing participants in abuses of basic human rights.”Gorman’s founder, Lisa Gorman, said the company’s social and ethical policy must be adhered to by the factories that manufacture Gorman.“In the coming months we will be publishing our audits online. It is clear that this is what our customer wants most and we are happy to provide this,” she said in a statement.
