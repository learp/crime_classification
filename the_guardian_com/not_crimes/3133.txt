Asking For It is a novel about an eighteen year old girl named Emma O’Donovan, who goes to a party and is gang raped by a group of boys from her school’s football team. She finds herself not remembering anything that happened on that night, and only has the photos uploaded to Facebook to help her refresh her memory.Throughout the novel, the reader sees Emma having to come to terms with what has happened to her, and having to process the opinions and responses of the people around her.Asking For It was an extremely difficult read, but a very important one. For me, this was mainly because Emma is a horrible human being, but a relatable human being; constantly making herself appeal more to boys (was she asking for it then?), and she was jealous of her own friends.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The issue is that Emma is much more horrible than the normal teenage girl, and girls like Emma exist; I’ve met them.Not many YA authors have the courage to create an un-likeable protagonist; someone who is popular, but then let something horrible happen to their character, and through her own choices. The reader must accept that the event was not Emma’s fault, no matter what choices she makes, which could influence the reader into thinking that the event was her fault, which is why I think that this book is extremely successful.The hardest part of reading this novel was being close to thinking that Emma was asking for it. It makes you question what consent really is and the controversy behind it. Yes, Emma did drink too much and yes, she did take drugs, but then, I thought that whatever Emma did had no importance. The boys in the novel took advantage of Emma without her consent, therefore it is rape. Unfortunately, it is not as simple as that in other people’s eyes.Louise O'Neill: my journey to feminism The novel quickly progresses to a year after the event, and this is when the readers really see how social media and other people’s opinions affect Emma’s state of mind, which is extremely raw, emotional and authentic. Readers will witness Emma’s spiral into a deep wave of depression, constantly repeating in her mind the harsh comments her peers made towards her. Emma’s psychological state of mind is brutally realistic and Jeanette Winterson was correct that O’Neill ‘writes with a scalpel’ – her writing is so realistic towards today’s current affairs that I want to hide away from and pretend it isn’t happening everyday.In today’s society, most people believe that women are equal, so we should be able to go out and drink as much as we like without being judged, right? Women should be able to wear whatever they want without being judged for it, right?How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? This novel is the most insightful novel that I have ever read. Louise O’Neill tackles the questions that we all are afraid of discussing and answering, but we really should. I have a lot of hope that this book will be read by future generations and that they will see the importance of consent and the issues with rape culture, and tackle them, head on.#NotAskingForItBuy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
