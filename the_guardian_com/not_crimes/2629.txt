Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.This week’s question:We’re thinking of getting our recently bereaved, but still young, dad the dog he always wanted – but we know nothing about dogs. What’s a good breed? Where’s the best place to buy one? And how much does it really cost to own a dog? Any top tips? Do you have a problem readers could solve?
