Copies of William Shakespeare’s first four books, dubbed the “Holy Grail of publishing”, have sold for almost £2.5m at auction.Christie’s said they were sold as separate lots on Wednesday but were all bought by an anonymous private American collector.William Shakespeare: 2016 is the 400th anniversary of his death The £2,479,000 sale in London included the bard’s first folio, which is widely considered to be the most important literary publication in the English language. The book, published in 1623, contains 36 plays, 18 of which had not appeared in print before. It fetched £1.87m, well above its pre-sale estimate of between £800,000 and £1.2m.Christie’s book expert Margaret Ford said it was “exhilarating” to bring the newly recorded book to the public’s attention on the 400th anniversary of the playwright’s death. It was sold along with later editions published in 1632, 1664 and 1685.Ford said: “We are pleased with the results achieved in the sale especially since all four books were acquired by the same private American collector. The universality and timelessness of Shakespeare’s insight into human nature continues to engage and enthral audiences the world over.“Even four centuries after his death, his plays touch and transform lives and continue to be read and performed from Albania to Zambia.”
