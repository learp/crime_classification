Hands up who needs some motivational help to spring clean their wardrobe? *Puts own hand up*Help is at hand. Fanny Moizant, founder of fashion resale site Vestiaire Collective, is a woman who practises what she preaches, clearing out her wardrobe and selling most of it on at the end of every season. And while I’m never going to be that woman, I want to break out of my current state, which is that I open my full-to-bursting wardrobe and think: I’m not wearing any of this old rubbish. But then when it comes to a clearout, I hoard it all anyway.But look at Fanny – she looks so happy, with her non-jumbled accessories. I want to be more like Fanny. So these are Fanny’s tips for being More Like Fanny.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Tidy queen … Fanny Moizant. Photograph: Dvora/PR1. Enjoy fashion and then let it goUnless you want to keep them for ever, sell designer pieces within three to four seasons – people tend to still want items for a few seasons, but interest wanes after four or so. With very popular, sold-out items, if you can be ruthless and sell within one or two seasons, there is a good chance you can recoup most of the original retail value. (Keep proof of purchase to reassure your buyer.)2. Embrace the trial separationTake a tip from psychologist Anuschka Rees, who helped author Vestiaire Collective’s Detox Handbook, and take a break. If you love a piece, but you can’t think of three upcoming events or occasions at which you will actually wear it, store it out of sight. When you reopen that box, cull all the pieces you haven’t thought about since you packed them in there.3. Operate a one-in, one-out policyThis is essential unless you plan on building an extension for your clothes, and that gets expensive. If you purchase something new, something else has to go.The Ultimate Detox Guide can be downloaded from vestiairecollective.com from 5 April
