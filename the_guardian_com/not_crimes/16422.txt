Sharp intake of breath on reading Chitra Ramaswamy’s statement that Pembrokeshire is the only coastal national park (Last Night’s TV, G2, 8 March). True, it is the only fully coastal one, but here in North Yorkshire we have the best national treasure of all in a park with heather moors, beautiful villages nestling in valleys, heritage and craftspeople aplenty as well as a delightful varied coastline.Felicity BrownNether Poppleton, North Yorkshire• Why is Richard Curtis’s film so popular (Love Act-two-ally, G2, 13 March)? It features a prime minister who stands up to an American president. Could only happen in fiction.John LoaderLeyburn, North Yorkshire• Food and phones are not the only annoyances at the theatre these days (Letters, 9 March). On a bus recently I overheard a conversation that recounted a performance where, when the lights went down, the lady in the next seat opened her handbag and took out a dog.Mervyn Bryn-JonesTwickenham• I recall that in 1950s north London, bakers sold squares of sponge cake covered with pink icing (Letters, passim) called Tottenham cake.

It could join the silk scarf I have printed with the banner headings from the Manchester Guardian 6 May 1821 (in old English text) through the years to 1969.Helen KeatingGatehouse of Fleet, Dumfries and Galloway• How about a new apron with recipes for leftover pastry?Jean JacksonSeer Green, Buckinghamshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
