After endless days of heavy rain and high winds, ice-cream vans appeared out of mothballs by White Moss and Thirlmere, despite snow patches still striping Helvellyn's mighty range like zebras. Two climbers could also be seen inching their way up Borrowdale's Troutdale Pinnacle like flies on a wall.Other harbingers of spring were apparent, too. Hosts of budding daffodils gave a hint of gold, the sky shone a spirit-lifting azure blue and shepherds gathered their pregnant flocks for the annual scanning to see how many twins, triplets and quads would be born come April.Meanwhile the craggies – female by the sound of their voices – approached overhangs the size of a football ground Kop roof 500ft overhead that appeared to bar further progress, only for a slabby traverse to the left to save the day. After a heart-thumping moment the leader, taking her courage in both hands, reached upwards for a Thank God hold and swung out over space on to an overhanging wall before finally tackling the pinnacle itself, joined like a Siamese twin to the face. Higher still was bulging rock, offering a final impasse. Just when all hope seemed lost, the leader, whooping with joy, found a jug-handle hold on the crag's brink.As the sun sank below Maiden Moor, I reluctantly turned my back on Black Crag and a leafless Troutdale and walked back to the road thanks to my alloy NHS walking stick, which I must use for another year while the thigh-bone that was severed during my hip revision operation 13 months ago becomes ever stronger – thanks to Mr Patel, the orthopaedic surgeon at Lancaster Infirmary.Oh, to be able to discard the stick and climb Troutdale Pinnacle as I did in my heyday. Now I will just settle for the dream of walking unaided on hills, which, I am told, will still be perfectly possible.
