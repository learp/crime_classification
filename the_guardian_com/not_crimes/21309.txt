The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with Moodymann: Shades of Jae   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I love Moodymann! Dance music is a better place for this guy. This is a classic sample-based jam with no drums for four minutes, but it’s so groovy and psychedelic, and probably other words our parents use to describe music, too.The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor Boys Noize: Starwin   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It’s perfect when you mix it in and the chords start building, and the whole room can feel something great approaching. It’s not rocket science, but rescuing the dancefloor shouldn’t be.The track that currently gets the most rewinds Tessela: Hackney Parrot   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This was a turning point for club music: young producers turning back to classic jungle sounds again. I’m not a huge fan of modern drum’n’bass or whatever they call it now, but I’m a sucker for a screeching female vocal and some sub-bass.The track that got me out of bed this morning Bone Thugs-N-Harmony: Days of Our Livez   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’m a bit of a latecomer to Bone Thugs, but I can’t get enough of them at the moment. They’re so dreamy, the way they sing-rap, and the lyrics are pretty out-there: loads of murdering, but sung in a lovely way.The track I think has been unfairly slept on this year Tiga ft Hudson Mohawke: Planet E   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Maybe this hasn’t been slept on, but this is a perfect combination of my favourite things in music and I wish it was playing out the radio every time I get in an Uber. Tiga with great lyrics, a vacuum sample and some clicks and bleeps from HudMo.The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding Whitney Houston: Love Will Save The Day   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Every good DJ should have a wedding tunes folder; I learned that from DJ Mehdi. Keep that folder close by: you never know when you might be DJing to five people at a festival.The track I’d play at sunset in Ibiza Manuel Göttsching: E2-E4    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’d play both sides of this record; almost an hour of deep trance! Most important record ever made, if you ask me; he created techno in one go with this masterpiece.The track I’d play at my funeral Vitalic: La Rock 01   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest I’m imagining that I have some modern LED lights on the bottom of my coffin, kind of like those Ugg boots.Riton plays Ministry of Sound, SE1, Saturday; Switch, Southampton, Tuesday; Space, Leeds, Friday
