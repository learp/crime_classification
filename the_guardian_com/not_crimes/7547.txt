The British and French governments have insisted the Hinkley Point nuclear plant is on track, despite fresh doubts emerging over the £18bn project after an executive row at its main backer, EDF Energy.EDF confirmed that finance chief Thomas Piquemal had resigned, amid reports he wanted the French state-owned company to delay a final decision on building the UK’s first new nuclear power station in a generation.French trade unions latched on to Piquemal’s departure as evidence that the Hinkley Point C plant, which is expected to meet 7% of the UK’s energy needs once up and running, poses a threat to EDF’s future.Analysts echoed the finance director’s concerns, with one energy expert saying that the project to build two nuclear reactors on the Somerset coast was “verging on insanity”.Labour called on the government to come up with a “Plan B”, in case EDF pulls out. But EDF and the UK and French governments said the project would go ahead as planned, with a final decision due to be taken in the “near future”.Jean-Bernard Levy, the chairman of 85% state-owned EDF, said he regretted the “haste” of Piquemal’s departure. “With the support of its shareholder, the state, EDF can confirm that it is looking to invest in two reactors at Hinkley Point under the best possible financial conditions for the group,” said Levy in a statement.A Downing Street spokesman said the British government would not “speculate on the resignation of one individual” but added that “we continue to fully support the project”.French economy minister Emmanuel Macron also reiterated his government’s “full support” for Hinkley, which he said would be “very profitable” over the next 30 years.But critics said the plan, which would see nuclear power produced at Hinkley from 2025, was being driven by political will rather than business sense.“Politics is rather trumping the economics at the moment,” said Tim Yeo, the former Tory MP who chairs pro-nuclear lobby group New Nuclear Watch. He said the government should put the project on hold and consider potentially cheaper nuclear technologies from South Korea, China and Russia.Yeo added: “Now is the moment for the government to examine whether these alternatives represent value for money. We need to cast the net a bit wider.”The government has faced criticism for agreeing to guarantee EDF a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour for energy produced at Hinkley.But EDF’s €37bn (£29bn) debt pile, coupled with the impact on its day-to-day income from low energy prices, has led to fears that it cannot afford to proceed even with such a substantial subsidy.Force Ouvrière, a french trade union, said that Piquemal’s departure showed they were right to be concerned about the impact of Hinkley on EDF’s long-term financial health.Serge Gianorsi, Force Ouvrière’s trade union secretary, said: “The resignation of such a high-ranking executive is pretty spectacular and shows the disagreement even at the highest levels.”Martin Young, an energy analyst at investment bank RBC Capital Markets, said that for EDF to proceed with such a costly plan would be “verging on insanity”. He said the firm would have to sell assets in the “double-digit” billions to afford the project.EDF was initially looking for a partner to fund 49% of the project but has only been able to secure investment to cover 33% of its cost from China’s state-owned China General Nuclear.Young added that EDF was under pressure to push ahead with the project because it uses European pressurised reactors [EPR], a technology that France hopes will be a lucrative export for its nuclear industry.EPR reactors being built at Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland have met with huge cost overruns and lengthy delays. “To walk away from the project would be a blow to French aspirations to be a major force in the nuclear world,” said Young. “If they walk away from doing this, they’re admitting that EPR has failed.”Peter Atherton, an energy analyst at investment banking firm Jefferies, said that despite these problems, the British government was determined to press on for fear of missing legally binding targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.Atherton said: “The biggest problem the government would have is that without a large nuclear programme it’s very difficult to see how you can hit climate change targets. It’s being driven by those targets, not economics or security of supply.“Alarm bells have been ringing on this project for some time but the two governments are determined to push it though.” He added that EDF might struggle to find buyers for its assets as it tries to raise cash to fund the project.Labour’s shadow energy secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the government should say what alternative options it has in place in the event that EDF walks away. “This power station is absolutely central to the government’s strategy for keeping the lights on and meeting Britain’s international commitments on climate change,” she said. “With growing scepticism over whether it will now be built, ministers must tell us what is their plan B.”Kevin Coyne, national officer for energy at the Unite trade union, said EDF should follow the lead of the British and French governments by confirming that Hinkley will go ahead. “We want to unpack the boots and shovels and get on with the job,” he added.
