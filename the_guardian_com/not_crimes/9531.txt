Boris Johnson has dismissed claims by top experts that Oxford Street has the worst nitrogen dioxide pollution on the planet as “bollocks”.The mayor of London said that it was a “ludicrous urban myth” that the popular shopping street was one of the world’s most polluted and said the capital’s air quality was better than Paris and other European cities.The exchange on Twitter followed a presentation last month by Dr David Carslow at King’s College London, which suggested that the hourly and annual average levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution in the street were unparalleled in the world.NO2 is largely caused by diesel vehicles, can aggravate asthma and has been found to have similar impacts to particulate pollution, which is linked to higher risks of lung cancer.Jon Paul Regnart, an energy and climate intern who works for a consultancy in Solihull, asked Johnson this week what the prospect of more hydrogen cars and buses was, in order to tackle Oxford Street’s air pollution problem. Johnson replied:Boris Johnson (@MayorofLondon)B*ll*cks: ludicrous urban myth. London air qual better than Paris and many other Euro cities- and go to Beijing or Mexico city@JonRegnartJuly 16, 2014Boris Johnson (@MayorofLondon)but we are doing much more - Ultra Low Emission Zone and low emission buses and taxis. we determined to beat this. #askboris @JonRegnartJuly 16, 2014Although data on NO2 emissions in cities around the world is patchy, a Guardian analysis last week concluded that Oxford Street does, in fact, have the worst NO2 pollution levels.Paul Regnart told the Guardian that he researches hydrogen vehicles and was genuinely interested in what role they could play in the capital. Of Johnson's reply, he said: "His response showed it’s obviously an issue because he wouldn’t respond so many times [otherwise]. But the contemptuous response shows it hit a nerve. I wanted to get a reaction, which is what I got."He ended the exchange with Boris by saying it was wrong to compare the UK with China:Jon Paul Regnart (@JonRegnart)@MayorofLondon N02 is 10 times EU limit. It triggers asthma attacks and other illnesses. Comparing ourselves to a BRIC is a poor argument.July 16, 2014Carslaw said he did not want to comment on the mayor's remarks, referring the Guardian to his original presentation, which on an "Oxford Street 2013" slide said: "Highest annual mean concentration and most hourly NO2 exceedances in the World? – Highest in the (long) history of air pollution?". Last week, the environment department published data showing London would be in breach of EU limits on NO2 until at least 2030, five years later than previously expected.
