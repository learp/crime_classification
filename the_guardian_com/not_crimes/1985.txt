Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has marked Mother’s Day by paying tribute to single mothers, saying she never realized how hard it was to be a single parent until her husband died a year ago.Sheryl Sandberg's moving tribute to the husband who died: 'Dave was my rock' In a touching Facebook post on Friday, Sandberg writes that the odds are stacked against single moms, many of whom live in poverty, work two jobs or don’t get paid leave to care for themselves or children if they get sick.“I did not really get how hard it is to succeed at work when you are overwhelmed at home,” Sandberg notes.The US, Sandberg writes, is the only developed economy in the world that does not provide paid maternity leave. Facebook, one of several tech companies that offer benefits around childbirth, offers US employees up to four months of paid parental leave. Sandberg did not say whether anything would change.Sandberg’s husband, Dave, died in a treadmill accident a year ago, while on vacation in Mexico. Sandberg writes that she had never realized how often situations come up in which she is unable to stop her son or daughter from crying.“What would Dave do if he were here?” she asks herself, writing that she never realized how many events such as father-daughter dances there are at schools and how hard they are for children without dads.Sandberg conceded that she was fortunate not to have the financial worries that many single moms face, and wrote that in her 2013 book Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, she should have written more about women raising children without a partner. “I will never experience and understand all of the challenges most single moms face,” she wrote, “but I understand a lot more than I did a year ago.”
