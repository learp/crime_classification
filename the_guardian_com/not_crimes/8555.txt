The BBC is looking to capitalise on true crime hits such as Netflix’s Making a Murderer and the Serial podcast by airing a US drama looking behind the scenes at the OJ Simpson trial.The People v OJ Simpson: American Crime Story, whose cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr, John Travolta and David Schwimmer, examines the 1995 trial of the former American football star for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.The BBC says the series promises to lift the lid on how chaotic dealings between the legal teams and a “combination of prosecution overconfidence, defence shrewdness, and the Los Angeles police department’s history with the city’s African-American community” led the jury to deliver the not guilty verdict, which drew more than 100 million viewers on US TV.Making a Murderer: the Netflix documentary beating TV drama at its own game The series’ UK premiere next month follows the success of true crime shows including Netflix’s Making a Murderer and hit podcast Serial, which is being made into a TV series.Scheduled to air in the US on 2 February on FX, the show is based on Jeff Toobin’s book The Run of His Life: The People v OJ Simpson.The cast includes Gooding Jr as Simpson; Travolta and Schwimmer as defence attorneys Robert Shapiro and Robert Kardashian; Sarah Paulson as prosecutor Marcia Clark; and Bruce Greenwood as Los Angeles county district attorney Gil Garcetti.Executive producer Ryan Murphy, best known for Glee and American Horror Story, is using the show to launch his American Crime Story franchise.The series was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karazewski, the pair behind The People vs Larry Flynt, the 1996 biopic of the porn magazine publisher and editor starring Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love and Edward Norton.BBC2 and BBC4 controller Kim Shillinglaw said: “I’m absolutely thrilled to be bringing this gripping, highly distinctive series to BBC2. With an outstanding cast and a top rate creative team, it is just the kind of grown-up, contemporary drama I want to see on the channel.”Sue Deeks, head of BBC programme acquisition, added: “I am so excited for BBC viewers to see this series.
