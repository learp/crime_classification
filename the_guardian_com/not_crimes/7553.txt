If I’m not clean-shaven I’m not happy going out the door. I have to run a quick razor over my face to make sure my skin’s nice and smooth. Moisturising is very important (I use Kiehl’s) and I’ll do an Aesop parsley seed face mask on the last Sunday of every month. I spend the longest time moisturising my body; I get through a tub of whipped body butter every six weeks. I like to watch a fun gameshow like Take Me Out so I leave the house in a good spirit.When I get dressed I always start with the top I’m going to wear. Ultimately, on a night out (in a restaurant or bar, say) that’s all people are going to see anyway. I’ll wear Hugo Boss or Dolce & Gabbana but I get a lot of things made for me, which I know sounds terrible but you’d be surprised what you can get for 100 quid and the fit is so much better. I love Mark Wallace and Joshua Kane if I want something more “out there”.Gemma Cairney: ‘I have tried to refine the clown element to my outfits’ Everyone looks at a part of their body and goes: “I’m a little bit fat.” Mine’s my stomach. You won’t see me topless, but I’ll wear a vest, as I’ve got decent arms and shoulders. Coming from the world of sport, I’ve got decent legs. I like Oliver Sweeney for classic, fitted, comfy shoes. It’s comfort over style for me, although when my mum reads this, she’ll go, “He’s lying!” We went to Buckingham Palace recently and I was wearing a tight pair of Chelsea boots. As soon as I put them on, I thought: “This is not going to be a good day.” When we got into the taxi, I had to blame the fact that I couldn’t walk anywhere on my mum being an “old woman”. She just looked at the driver and said, “It’s because he’s got tight shoes!”Colin Jackson is part of the BBC’s Rio 2016 Olympics team.
