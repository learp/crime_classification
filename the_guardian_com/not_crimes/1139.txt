The art and science industries in Indonesia have combined forces to help educate Indonesia on issues at the heart of social development with the House of Natural Fibers Foundation.Honf, based in Yogyakarta, Java, Indonesia, works as a vessel to bring artists and scientists together to solve some of Indonesia's biggest technology development challenges in sectors such as health and the environment."Indonesia is hindered by inadequate infrastructure and improper use of technology. We want to use art and science to educate people to use technology in better ways," said Irene Agrivine who along with Vincensius Christiawan and Tommy Surya established the Honf Foundation in 1999 following the fall of Suharto's authoritarian New Order regime, and as the freedom of information and technology era began.Honf created the Education Focus Program, a curriculum whose objective is to fill the gaps in technology development through its partnerships with technology institutions in Indonesia such as Gadjah Mada University's microbiology laboratory, Duta Wacana University's informatics laboratory, Institute Sains and Technology, and high school technology groups such as the robotic community of SMPN 5 school.Agrivine said that because creativity was central to innovation and problem solving, it includes an artistic element in each of its projects. The EFP also invites all sectors of society to join heads to beat technology challenges at its Open-Community Forums.Honf's latest collaboration produced the Micronation | Macronation project, an art installation accompanied by seminars, which present innovative sustainable agriculture practices to the public to combat climate change. The exhibition opened in Honf's laboratory in Yogyakarta in April this year.The installation constitutes a model farm that includes a fermentation-distillation machine to process hay from crop fields into ethanol as an alternative energy source to fossil fuel. It has also deployed a system to convert waste products from fields into livestock and fish feed, and advocates collecting manure and urine from cattle farms for fertiliser."The problem with food and energy sustainability is in creativity. We have to be creative in order to discover renewable energy options," said Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals Association chairman Ilham Habibie of Honf's Micronation piece.The model has since caught the interest of farmers in Yogyakarta province, and a few farms have already begun rolling out Honf's proposed techniques.Honf also conceptualised bamboo leg prostheses for those who lost limbs after an earthquake hit Yogyakarta in 2006. The group chose bamboo for its strength and affordability, with 33 percent of the country's population living in poverty. FabLab Amsterdam – fab labs or fabrication laboratories being a type of laboratory that uses digital fabrication or 3D modeling software to create – then developed Honf's idea.The project has grown to become an international collaboration between Honf and FabLab Amsterdam based in the Netherlands, with cultural research, innovation and technology center Waag Society, also in the Netherlands, and the Christian foundation for public health, Yakkum Rehabilitation Centre, in Indonesia.Together they are researching how developing countries such as Indonesia can become self-sufficient in prostheses and aims to manufacture the bamboo form for a cost price of less than US$50. Next year, Agrivine said, it aims for the model to be available to the public around the world.Honf is also contributing to health through a performance-based tutorial on alcohol-awareness as part of its Intelligent Bacteria series called Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which won the international media art transmediale award – an award recognising technological contributions to society – in Berlin in 2011. The tutorial shows how alcohol can be made in safe ways by fermenting tropical fruits in an entertaining form through using sound artists to make music from the fermentation process.The Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, who worked in collaboration with Honf on the tutorial, says the presence of methanol in alcohol is likely caused by non-hygienic practice, such as failing to properly sanitise equipment, in the fermentation process, which causes methanol-producing bacteria. If methanol is consumed within a certain amount of time it can cause vision disorders, blindness or death."Society needs to learn more about correct alcohol processing technology so homemade alcohol can be safe for consumption," Agrivine said.Homemade alcohol has been responsible for a number of deaths in Indonesia, with methanol reported as the lethal ingredient – the Indonesian Police Forensic Laboratory confirmed traces of methanol in the three people who died soon after consuming homemade liquor in Central Java in 2010. Alcohol-related deaths in the country spiked after the government slapped a high excise duty on alcohol, increasing the price of liquor.Honf also created an art-based tutorial to address Indonesia's severely polluted water supply. The installation, titled IB:EC [Intelligent Bacteria: Eschericia coli], The song of the river, and which was recently on display at the New Museum in New York, the US, in March this year, consists of an ecological experiment to provide alternative ways to purify their water.The piece is made up of four microscopes connected to projectors that magnify bacterial microorganisms in water samples collected from the river. The water is then purified through a homemade filter with the aim for the people to make this system for themselves.Indonesian private collector Natasha Sidharta, who has been working with Honf for a number of years, applauds the group's dedication."From conducting workshops for children in the surrounding community to providing seminars, [it is] a responsible community group that has an important mission – to share knowledge," Sidharta said.
