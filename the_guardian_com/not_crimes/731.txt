Net neutrality is on trial, and everyone from white-shoe-firm lawyers to Christian internet activists showed up to watch oral arguments in the US Telecom Association v the FCC on Friday in a packed Washington DC courtroom, where an exasperated bailiff threatened to toss out reporters who wouldn’t stop using their phones to access the technology in question.From the moment in February when the FCC voted to reclassify internet providers as “common carriers”, paving the way for net neutrality protections, a bitter fight in the courtroom was inevitable.Telecoms lobbyists rail against 'arbitrary and capricious' net neutrality rules And now that the occasionally weird war of the lobbyists is over, the legal battle has begun in the US court of appeals for the DC circuit. Plaintiffs representing essentially the entire telecommunications industry have banded together to demand the court vacate the new regulation, and the stakes are high.“The question now is whether it’s going to be net neutrality with a capital N,” said Stuart Brotman, senior fellow at DC thinktank the Brookings Institution.Even before the arguments began, Massachusetts senator Edward Markey and California representative Anna Eshoo, both Democrats who pushed for the reclassification, issued a statement calling for the court to uphold the FCC’s new rules. The pair echoed the commission’s own mantra: that times have changed and the industry needs better oversight. “The FCC has done precisely what Congress intended the commission to do – classify broadband internet access service according to its best understanding of the technology of the day, and how consumers use that technology,” the pair said in a joint statement.Within sight of the Capitol building in the E Barrett Prettyman courthouse, the mood was tense. A team of men in hoodies and dirty jeans were scattered throughout a line that stretched up and down the hallway on the the sixth floor, waiting for the people who had paid them to hold a spot in the queue outside the courtroom to arrive, occasionally conferring with a supervisor holding a clipboard. In the courtroom itself, the gallery wore mostly bespoke suits and expensive watches, but for all the wealth in the room the atmosphere was as polarized as a football game. Junior partners, amici and industry leaders broke the silence with quick laughs whenever their team scored a rhetorical point, or murmured when a speaker had been led off track.‘That’s not the kind of phone I have’All three judges on the panel regularly cut off the attorneys mid-sentence to ask for clarification or to take issue. David S Tatel, one of the judges, questioned whether telephone numbers and websites could be considered part of the same network – a phone, he pointed out, can call any other phone, but it can’t call a website.“I’m assuming your honor does not have a smartphone,” said Jacob Lewis, associate general counsel for the FCC.“Yeah, exactly,” said Tatel, who is blind. “That’s not the kind of phone I have.” Tatel later admitted to laughs from the courtroom that he does actually use a smartphone – just not to surf the internet.This will be Tatel’s third major case involving the FCC; the judge ruled against the commission twice, once in 2010 when Comcast contested the FCC’s citation of the company for slowing down peer-to-peer traffic, and again in 2014 when Verizon sued the regulator over a previous iteration of net neutrality law.But Tatel seemed more sympathetic to the defense this time, in contrast to David Williams, a Reagan appointee who on Friday likened proprietary internet service to “a refrigerated car on a railroad – though that is in some sense discriminatory, it is an extremely reasonable discrimination”.“I think Judge Williams tends to be more skeptical about all regulation,” said Cheryl Leanza, a former litigator who now works for the United Church of Christ, which has campaigned for net neutrality for many years. Leanza thought even Williams could come around to the FCC’s position, however. “Although he did ask a couple of very pointed questions, I was pleased with his response on the core reclassification question.”Sri Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, is seen generally as friendlier to the defendants than his colleagues.‘It was like the Cheshire Cat’Representing the United States Telecom Association (USTA), attorney Peter Keisler brought forth a litany of grievances, saying that reclassifying USTA’s constituents put their businesses in jeopardy. He contended that the only part of an internet provider’s service that could conceivably be regulated more like a utility (as Title II proposes to do) is the “last mile” – the cable that goes from the user’s house to the closest facility. The rest, Keisler said, is an information service and ought to be left alone.Jonathan Sallet, general counsel for the FCC, said Keisler was misrepresenting the sophistication of even the simplest connections, including modern telephones. “There was never a last mile that consisted of wire and no computing,” Sallet told the judges. “The term ‘internet’ itself expresses that there are multiple networks that need to exchange traffic.”Keisler, formerly the assistant attorney general under George W Bush, was particularly vehement on the perceived unfairness of last-minute changes to the law governing intra-industry contracts, which the FCC decided would not be governed by Title II, the same rule that now governs the contracts between the user and the internet provider.“It was like the Cheshire Cat,” he said. “The body, the whole legal rationale, disappeared, but the smile was still there.” Sallet contended that there was indeed a difference between “edge providers” and consumers and that the rationale still held up.Ultimately, the basic question at hand was a brief one, but endlessly complex: can the company that delivers the internet to your home have a say in how you’re allowed to use it?
