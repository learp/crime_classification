More than 1,400 flood defence projects are to receive funding to provide better protection from flooding for hundreds of thousands of homes.The Treasury is detailing projects that will receive a share of the £2.3bn already earmarked for capital spending on flood defences over the next six years to improve protection for 300,000 homes, as part of plans for range of infrastructure investments.The spending on flood defences includes major investments in areas such as the Humber Estuary, where £80m will be spent, and £196m for a programme in the Thames Estuary.Ministers are also committing to spend £15.5m on flood defences in Somerset over the next six years, which they hope will benefit 7,000 properties, including £4.2m on the Somerset Levels and Moors which were badly hit by flooding last winter.The government has previously come under fire for its flood defence funding, with critics warning that not enough was being spent to protect homes and businesses from the increased risk of flooding in the face of climate change.Chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said: “We all saw the destruction and heartache caused by flooding last year and that is why this investment is vital to build up Britain’s defences for the future.“The projects we are announcing today will protect some of the country’s most at risk locations ensuring that we will be as prepared as possible for future severe weather.”Officials said the six-year programme would help prevent more than £30bn of economic damage.Major flood defence projects will benefit, including Tonbridge, Yalding and surrounding communities in Kent which will receive more than £17m, £73m for the Boston barrier, Lincolnshire, £42m for the Oxford western conveyance scheme and £47m for coastal defence improvements for Rossall, Lancashire.The coalition also announced it would be starting “closer discussions” with a company bidding to build the world’s first tidal lagoon energy plant, in Swansea Bay, to establish if the renewable power scheme is affordable and value for money for consumers.Other projects announced as part of the National Infrastructure Plan include a deal with Toshiba, GDF Suez and NuGen to provide a guarantee to assist the financing of a new nuclear power plant at Moorside, near Sellafield, Cumbria.Up to £50m will be available between 2017-2020 to support innovation in manufacturing ultra-low emission vehicles, with £25m coming from government, which hopes the money will be match-funded by industry.Funding for number of rail projects is also being announced, including a new station at Chesterton, linked to Cambridge Science Park, and support to improve the resilience of the rail link to south west England which was badly damaged in the winter storms and floods.Companies that own and operate electricity interconnectors, enabling the UK to tap into power supplies from other countries, will be allowed to bid for funding to ensure energy security and reduce bills, the Treasury said.
