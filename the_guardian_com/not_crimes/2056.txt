Running is a fantastic way to get fit. You don’t need much kit, you can do it anywhere (within reason) and it’s available to you all the time – you don’t need to wait for the gym to be open or a class to start; just go. You might think of it as a leg exercise, but it actually works most of the body. Running fast is also one of the quickest ways to burn calories; it’s an activity with a high “met rate” (calorie burn per kg of weight, per hour). Rowing is another good one; cycling is slightly lower.People worry about injury and bad knees and so on, but it’s a myth that running is bad for you. With good trainers, and good technique, you should be OK. That said, an unprepared body lacking mobility is more likely to get injured, so make sure you stretch and do supporting exercises. If you’re very overweight, start small, with fast walking. And if you have health issues, take advice from a doctor.As well as the physical benefits, there’s a mental one, too: running is almost meditative. It clears your head, releases adrenaline and endorphins, and brings down cortisol levels.For beginners, I’ve designed a simple four-week plan (below) to get you running for 30 minutes.Lace up your trainers and let’s go.

Thirty minutes is a great first milestone to aim for: here is a simple plan you can use to reach this goal. You don’t have to stick to the exact days, just aim for three runs, spread through the week. Remember to rest, and aim for at least seven hours’ sleep a night. A balanced diet is essential, with protein and carbs from wholefoods; eating a meal within two hours of a run may help recovery.Week 1MondayJog for 1 minute, then walk for 1 minute.

Five ways to improve your pace1 Get used to running faster. Interval training (or fartlek training) is the most effective way. Go to the park and find a distance of around 150m. Jog the first 50m at a normal pace (one you could hold over 30 minutes). Run the second 50m at the pace you could maintain for 1km – fast, pushing yourself. The final 50m should be an all-out sprint. Walk back to the start, rest, and repeat up to 10 times. 2 Mix up your runs with some extended intervals. If you’re going out for a 5km run, do 1km at the pace you could do 5km in. Then do ½km to 1km at a pace you couldn’t do for any longer than that. Next run ½km to 1km at your steady 5km pace. Then another 1km fast, before a final slow 1km. You will be amazed at how soon you see your pace improve. 3 Dynamic movements and conditioning are key to supporting your runs. For example, do 20 or 30 jumps on to a low-level box. Or try bounding forwards or sideways with huge, leaping, exaggerated strides, over a distance of around 50m (quite far – it will be tiring). Three to five minutes of skipping before a run will strengthen and prepare your feet.4 Have a plan each time you go out for a run, and a specific target in mind. Better still, sign up for an event. Allow at least six to eight weeks to prepare, so that you don’t overdo it, and give yourself 10 days off before the big day. It’s a fantastic motivator – especially if you get a friend to sign up with you. 5 Don’t forget about strength. You’ve got to look after your core, lower back, glutes and hamstrings. A lack of mobility is the quickest way to injury. Get a foam roller and after a run do some intensive conditioning: squats, lunges, step-ups and glute bridges (lie on your back, knees bent, and raise your butt up and down). Master your form: 8 top tips for good running1 Keep your head in a relaxed, neutral position.2 Your shoulders should be relaxed; don’t hunch.3 On a regular jog let your arms swing naturally. Don’t let them go higher than your chest, and don’t exaggerate the movement, but do use them: when you sprint you need to work them like crazy.4 Your hands should stay quite close to your body, but not grip on – an inch away is best.5 The biggest mistake is to overstride and extend your leg too far, coming down hard on your heel. This puts pressure on knees, hips and lower back, and slows you down.6 Aim to land between heel and mid-foot, then roll on to your toes. Your foot should be below your body as it hits the floor. If you need to, shorten your stride.7 Keep your core engaged, so you don’t rotate too much. Your chest should face forward in a neutral position; only your hips and shoulders should move.8 Have a breathing pattern related to your stride. Try four strides breathing in, four out. (Too hard? Try two first.)
