The longlist of 2016’s Miles Franklin literary award is dominated by families, dysfunction and grief, and weighted towards women writers for the fifth year in a row.Nine nominees, who were selected by judging panel, will compete for the $60,000 prize, including three authors who have appeared on the Miles Franklin longlist in the past. Tony Birch has been nominated for Ghost River, based on his short story which was published by the Guardian in 2013; Stephen Orr is listed for his sixth book, The Hands: an Australian Pastoral; and Charlotte Wood is listed for The Natural Way of Things, which was shortlisted for the Victorian premier’s literary award, the Indie book awards and the Stella prize. Charlotte Wood's novel The Natural Way of Things optioned for a film The Natural Way of Things, which tells the story of 10 women who wake to find themselves captive in the outback, was recently optioned for a film after a successful pitch by two independent producers: “I thought, imagine if this could be the next Picnic [at Hanging Rock]?” Wood told Guardian Australia. “I have total faith in these young women to make something astonishing.”Newcomers to the Miles Franklin longlist include Mireille Juchau for The World Without Us, which won the Victorian Premier’s literary award and is nominated for the Stella prize; 2011 Prime Minister’s literary award winner Stephen Daisley, for Coming Rain; novelist (and Art of Fighting band member) Peggy Frew, for Hope Farm; and author of the Rainy Season, Myfanwy Jones, for Leap.Judging panel spokesperson Richard Neville, the Mitchell Librarian at the State Library of NSW, said the selected books had certain commonalities. “This year a dominant theme of these novels is the impact of grief and loss – complex families, unstable relationships, accidents, European war crimes, suicide – and how the experience of these issues deeply determine the narrative and direction of lives,” he said. “All possess a quality of writing that indicates Australian literature is strong and thriving.”The Miles Franklin award is Australia’s most prestigious literature prize, and was endowed in the will of My Brilliant Career author Stella Miles Franklin, who bequeathed her estate to fund it after her death in 1954. Franklin – who is also the namesake of the annual Stella prize which will be awarded later this month – said that “without an indigenous literature, people can remain alien in their own soil”. In 2009, the award came under fire for an all-male shortlist, but since then Miles Franklin longlists have comprised 41 women and 33 men. In last year’s longlist, eight out of the 10 nominees were women. The prize was won by Sofie Laguna for The Eye of the Sheep.The shortlist of the 2016 Miles Franklin literary award will be announced on 29 May.Stella prize 2016 announces longlist of 12 books by Australian women The 2016 Miles Franklin longlistGhost River by Tony BirchComing Rain by Stephen DaisleyHope Farm by Peggy FrewLeap by Myfanwy JonesThe World Without Us by Mireille JuchauThe Hands: an Australian Pastoral by Stephen OrrBlack Rock White City by A S PatricSalt Creek by Lucy TreloarThe Natural Way of Things by Charlotte Wood
