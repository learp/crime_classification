A stage performance variously described by critics as “devastating”, “earth-quaking” and “breathtakingly uninhibited” won Billie Piper one of the UK’s leading theatre awards on Sunday.Piper was named best actress for her performance in Yerma at the Young Vic at the Evening Standard theatre awards on Sunday, now Britain’s longest-running theatre awards having been established in 1955.There were also prizes for Glenn Close, Ralph Fiennes, Kenneth Branagh, John Malkovich and the Good Chance theatre company, which was set up in Calais by the young playwrights Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson.In less than two decades, Piper has gone from teenage pop sensation (Because We Want to, Honey to the Bee) to TV stardom as Doctor Who’s assistant to one of the most exciting stage actors of her generation.Off stage, 2016 would seem to have been a tough year for Piper, garnering lots of tabloid headlines as she divorced her second husband, Laurence Fox, after eight years of marriage.On stage, the year has been a triumph with critics stunned by her brilliant performance in the Australian writer-director Simon Stone’s loose adaptation of Federico Garcia Lorca’s 1934 classic. The Guardian’s Michael Billington said Piper gave “a breathtakingly uninhibited performance” as the play’s protagonist; while Libby Purves in the Daily Mail said Piper was “one of the most intense and exciting creatures on any stage”.Judges for the Evening Standard awards agreed, naming her best actress from a shortlist that also included Noma Dumezweni, Helen McCrory and Sophie Melville. The award was presented in the memory of Natasha Richardson.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Ralph Fiennes in Richard III.

His competition was from Ian McKellen, Kenneth Branagh, James McArdle and OT Fagbenie.In total, 13 awards were given out at a starry, black-tie ceremony held at London’s Old Vic theatre. The editor’s award went to two men, Murphy and Robertson, who set up a theatre in the most unlikely of places, Calais’s grim, desperate and now dismantled migrant camp. The camp may have gone, but the Good Chance theatre company, created by the two men, has said it will “continue to build temporary theatres of hope”.Presenting the award, actor Mark Rylance said Good Chance represented the best in us, particularly “in these dark times when hate and fear of the other seem to becoming government policy.”There was success for one of 2016’s most talked about theatre events, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The two-part play, written by Jack Thorne and based on an original story by JK Rowling, Thorne and John Tiffany, won the award for best new play.The best musical performance award went to Close for her barnstorming Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard at the London Coliseum. The limited run was Close’s West End debut and a reprise of a role she first tackled in 1994, for which she won a Tony. She is due to play the faded Hollywood star once more when it goes to Broadway next February, a move that will mean Andrew Lloyd Webber will have four shows in New York: Sunset Boulevard, Cats, Phantom of the Opera and School of Rock.There was even more good news for Lloyd Webber at Sunday’s awards when the Regent’s Park Open Air theatre production of his show Jesus Christ Superstar won the only award voted for by the public, the Evening Standard and Radio 2 audience award for best musical. Tyrone Huntley, a memorable, powerful Judas in the production, won the emerging talent award. It was presented by Sir Elton John.Lloyd Webber joked that it had taken 45 years for the show to win a prize. He accepted with a message for Theresa May. “Prime minister, if you are listening, can I passionately beg that you must stop cutting the arts in schools.”He was echoing earlier remarks made by Patrick Stewart, who said he was the product of a secondary modern education. “Let my story be an example to the prime minister ... your elitist, two-tier secondary school policies won’t keep all underprivileged and therefore undeserving working class scum at the bottom of the heap. Some of us will have the impertinence to have ambition.”Malkovich won the award for best director for his production of Good Canary by Zach Helm, a play he first directed in Paris in 2007. Staged at the Rose in Kingston, it was Malkovich’s London debut as a stage director.The other awards included Sean Mathias’s production of Harold Pinter’s No Man’s Land, starring McKellen and Stewart, which won best revival; Gareth Fry and Pete Malkin won best design for The Encounter, which transferred to the Barbican from Edinburgh; and Charlene James won the Charles Wintour award for most promising playwright for her exploration of FGM in her play Cuttin’ It.The first award of the evening was presented by Prince William, giving the beyond theatre award to Sir David Attenborough for “his outstanding contribution to broadcasting”.Another knight, Sir Kenneth Branagh, was presented with an award in the name of the Evening Standard owner Evgeny Lebedev for his year-long residency at the Garrick theatre.
