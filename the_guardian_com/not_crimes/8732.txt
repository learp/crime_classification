The average UK commuter consumes nearly 800 additional calories a week while travelling to and from work, often as a result of unhealthy snacking, a study has found.The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), which commissioned the research, said longer commutes are potentially shortening lives by increasing stress, limiting sleep and physical activity, and encouraging unhealthy eating.Meet the supercommuters: how to survive five hours of travel every day A poll of 1,500 people, conducted by Populus, found that two-fifths exercised less due to their commute, a similar proportion said they slept less, and about one-third reported increased snacking or fast food consumption.The report’s author, Emma Lloyd, a policy and research manager at RSPH, said: “The commute is hugely stressful; we have got thousands of commuters travelling through stations which are very obesogenic, both in terms of advertising and what’s available [to eat]. It’s natural that many people will reach for comfort food to relieve boredom or stress, but it’s a high-risk strategy when so many people are overweight and obese.”The average commuter spends 55 minutes a day travelling to and from work, according to the TUC. About 3 million people have a commute of two hours or more a day, a TUC study suggested last year, while nearly 900,000 have journeys of three hours or more. The poll asked commuters whether they consumed one or more of 12 different items during their journey and, using their responses, found that the median number of calories totalled 767 a week. The most popular item people ate on their commute was a chocolate bar, followed by crisps. Other items included fizzy drinks, fast food meals, muffins and alcohol. As the list was limited, the average number of calories could be higher. The RSPH wants a restriction on junk food outlets in stations and a health and wellbeing requirement for when train and bus franchises are awarded. This would oblige transport providers to create a healthier travelling experience in terms of the food on offer and comfort of passengers.The charity found that the top three commuting issues that members of the public believe are most detrimental to their health and wellbeing are delays, overcrowding and antisocial behaviour. To combat these issues, employers should increase flexible and home working, the RSPH said, citing the fact that three-fifths of those polled said flexible working hours would improve their health and wellbeing.A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said: “We know that commuting can be stressful, whether it’s by train, car, bus or tube. As part of its £50bn railway upgrade plan, the rail industry is building 12 new carriages a week to provide more seats and we’re improving the railway so that we can run more and longer trains. Today, quality, choice and healthier options form a big part of the food on offer at stations.”A Department for Transport spokeswoman said the government was “cutting journey times and improving the experience for passengers by funding new carriages across the country, electrifying swaths of the rail network and redeveloping many of our great railway stations”.
