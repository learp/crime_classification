Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.This week’s question: My wife and I both have to look smart at work but loathe ironing. Non-iron shirts/blouses we tried in the past were a waste of money. Has anyone found any that don’t look terrible – or is there a different solution? If I lose another Sunday evening to ironing I’m going to crack.Do you have a problem readers could solve?
