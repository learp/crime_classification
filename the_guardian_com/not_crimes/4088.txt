London fashion week is great – but with everything from eiderdown quilts to giant tulle dresses on the catwalk, the connection to what you wear IRL isn’t always clear. Rest assured, there are always some takeaways, and autumn/winter 2017 is no different. Here are the trends that will make it to your wardrobe next autumn.The continued polo neck      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Emilia Wickstead, London fashion week AW17.

You might be bored to death of that jumper you’ve been wearing all winter, but get ready to get it out again in a few months – the polo neck was in collections from Emilia Wickstead to Topshop. Face it: necks are not going to be fashionable again for a while.Socks and sandals      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Mulberry, London fashion week AW17.

Versus basically gave the sports sock a style upgrade – by printing the brand’s logo around the top of the sock, where the ones you buy in packs of five typically have stripes. Clever.Deconstructed florals      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Preen by Thornton Bregazzi, London fashion week AW17.

They are a little edgier for winter – especially when they have a punky deconstructed feel, the kind of thing that might provoke whispers, rather than approving glances, at the village fete. Preen are becoming experts at this – their lovely collection had loads of flowers but was never cutesy. Erdem, meanwhile, added velvet textures.A very big and long chunky jumper over a flowy skirt      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Topshop Unique, London fashion week AW17.

It was a look that got played both on (Topshop, Peter Pilotto) and off the catwalk (among fashion editors) – a sure sign you will be wearing it sometime soon.Chainmail for going out-out      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   JW Anderson, London fashion week AW17.

Get ready to relive that moment – metallics were big this season, with chainmail the alpha take on partywear. JW Anderson’s floral dress with feather skirt and chainmail cloak was wonderfully eclectic – and would cause some quizzical looks at Ministry of Sound.Big earrings      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Christopher Kane earrings, London fashion week AW17. Photograph: Sipa/Rex/ShutterstockIt was a lobe-in on the front row, with every alpha editor trying out can’t-miss-them earrings by brands from Céline to Loewe. “The bigger the better” was the general rule of thumb. And, judging by the catwalk, ears will continue to be the place to make fashion statements​. Earrings were big at Christopher Kane, Emilia Wickstead and Topshop. Excellent news when you realise a jazzy earring means you can wear the most boring outfit ever and it can still be totally Fashion.Shirt tails poking out under a jumper      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Burberry, London fashion week AW17.

Similar ideas were also seen at Sharon Wauchob and Pringle of Scotland. The kind of trend that you’ll be thankful for when you’re getting dressed for work in the dark at 7am next November.
