Forget five-a-day, scientists have said getting 10 portions of fruit and vegetables is an even better way of lowering your chance of heart disease, stroke, cancer and premature death.Forget five a day, eat 10 portions of fruit and veg to cut risk of early death While a 200g portion is associated with a 16% reduced risk of heart disease, 800g (around 10 portions of fruit and veg) sees this risk reduced further to 24%. To put this in perspective, one banana is 101g. It means we should all be piling up platefuls of greens and eating plenty of apples, strawberries, bananas etc.But, getting this much greenery is not always easy, especially if you are not vegan or vegetarian. We want to hear from those of you who manage it without quitting meat. How do you do it? Whatâ€™s the impact? Do you have any advice for others who want to increase their veg and fruit intake?
