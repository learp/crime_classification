1.55pm GMT13:55That's all folks  Guardian contributor Vicky McClure 27 January 2017 1:53pmThank you for all your questions. Some funny ones in there! I'm still trying to think about what I find most exotic - I'll get back to you on that. Thanks for all your support with my work, and it's still quite overwhelming that this is my job.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.54pm GMT13:54RickHall1 asks:You, Stephen Lowe and Billy Ivory all feature on the Nottingham Trams. What is it about Nottingham and drama/theatre talent?  Guardian contributor Vicky McClure 27 January 2017 1:52pmMaybe it's in the brown sauce... I think there's a lovely, humble trait that runs through Nottingham. We're a city that are incredibly proud of what we've achieved but we don't shout too loud about it. I think when people discover the talents that come out of Nottingham, it is getting bigger. But I think we'll always remain really humble. There's a certain realness about the Nottingham people, and I think that shines through in our work, especially with the likes of Billy and Stephen and Shane, their styles are rooted in their surroundings.

Tempted?  Guardian contributor Vicky McClure 27 January 2017 1:49pmHahahahahaha! Hell yeah I'd do it. But I think it's pretty unlikely.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.51pm GMT13:51rordulum asks:How would you think you’d feel about working on a show that had an American-style 20-22 episode season run, as opposed to British shows that tend to only have 6-10 episodes a year?  Guardian contributor Vicky McClure 27 January 2017 1:48pmThe potential of a seven year contract does make me a bit nervous, but it would always depend on what it was, I guess.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm GMT13:49charchar06 asks:What do you find more of a challenge, scripted work or improvisation? And which do you prefer?  Guardian contributor Vicky McClure 27 January 2017 1:47pmI prefer improvisation. It can sometimes be a challenge when you feel you're being forced to say certain things that might not feel natural. But for example, in Line of Duty, the star is the script, and there's no way I'd be able to improvise that show!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.49pm GMT13:49Pagey asks:Any plans to write/direct for TV or theatre?  Guardian contributor Vicky McClure 27 January 2017 1:46pmNo plans to write or direct, but it's not something I'd rule out. I co-produced a six-part comedy series called Charity Shop Sue, and really enjoyed the producing side of things. And Shane Meadows exec produced it - it's yet to be aired, but I learned that things aren't easy to get off the ground.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.48pm GMT13:48vinnyggow asks:Did you get to hang out much in Glasgow filming The Secret Agent? If so, any favourite haunts?  Guardian contributor Vicky McClure 27 January 2017 1:45pmI absolutely loved Glasgow, I felt as home straight away there. I went to a reggae bar one night, I can't remember what it was called... but I remember having a very good night.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.47pm GMT13:47'If I wasn't an actor I'd be a food critic'Emma Richardson asks:If you weren’t an actor, what what would be the dream job?  Guardian contributor Vicky McClure 27 January 2017 1:44pmA food critic. I'd try anything food-wise - I'm not fussy. I used to think as a kid, when people would say we're going out for a meal, and make a big thing of it, it was really sad. That's now all I want to do, go out for nice meals.Updatedat 1.51pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.46pm GMT13:46sam7728 asks:Did you ever think: “Hmm. An undercover cop might be more subtle than sidling up to a suspect on a fag break and go, ‘Done anything suspicious recently?’” Is it easy to style it out when you are asked to do stuff like that?

What were your happiest moments making the series and do you ever see another instalment down the road?  Guardian contributor Vicky McClure 27 January 2017 1:43pmWhen we did This is England 86, we all lived in this apartment block together, and as difficult as making it was, with the storylines that Lol had, they were some of my happiest days, because I was surrounded by my mates. We had a lot of fun in those flats... I was the only one allowed back for 88!FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
