Inferno is the second book in the Blood for Blood saga. It is about a girl called Sophie who falls in love with a boy (Nick) from a Mafia family- but she can never be with him. If she is then she’ll be dragged into a world of death and murder.After what happened at the end of Vendetta, the first book in the series, Sophie’s life has been destroyed. However, Nick won’t give up on her love, and its not long before another Mafia family destroys the quiet, and fragile, amity.  Inferno is an amazingly gripping read that I, quite literally, couldn’t put down. The plot is incredibly griping and heartbreaking; the style of writing is beautiful and it is exceptionally passionate as well as being thrilling.  I would recommend this book to everyone, even if they don’t like romance or thrilling books! It is a fantastic read but, if you haven’t already, you should read Vendetta (it’s also a fantastic book!). I would give Inferno a rating of 5/5.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
