As psychologists, we work with women who are survivors of rape. We see the devastation to mental health that this crime causes – and as a result we are deeply concerned at the introduction this week of a “rape clause” to the family welfare cap (Government under fire over new child tax credit form for rape victims, 6 April).We strongly believe that the way in which this rape clause is to be administered will cause significant psychological harm. Given that a major reason that survivors of rape do not come forward is a legitimate fear of not being believed, it is unhelpful that the new process will ask women to provide evidence to support their claim.It forces women to disclose details of their history to professionals for administrative reasons. This may cause flashbacks, renewed shame and emotional turmoil, and consequently affect how mothers bond with their children.In addition, we also work with children and adults who have been born of rape. Finding this out and managing the identity crisis it can cause carries significant psychological risks.Government under fire over new child tax credit form for rape victims By asking for children born in this way to be named, the policy takes any control over disclosure away from parents and denies children the right to privacy. Most mothers who have children as a result of a rape manage, admirably, to have a bond equal to that with children conceived by choice. To force mothers to remember the circumstances of conception for administrative reasons is unethical and potentially damaging to both mother and child.Dr Danny Taggart Clinical psychologist, University of Essex Dr Jay Watts Clinical psychologist,  Queen Mary, University of London Scott Bartle Trainee clinical psychologist, University of East London Dr Andrew Beck Consultant clinical psychologist, ELCAS Dr Gabriel Bes Counselling psychologist, Brighton Dr Caroline Bradley Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust Dr Sarah Blainey Clinical psychologist, South London and Maudsley NHS TrustDr Naomi Bright Clinical psychologist, Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation TrustRhona Brown Clinical psychologist, Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation TrustDr Angela Byrne Clinical psychologist, East London NHS TrustDr John Cheetham Clinical psychologist, South London and Maudsley NHS TrustDr Samantha Cole Kent and Medway NHS Foundation TrustDr Louise Conlan Clinical psychologist, Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation TrustDr Harriet Conniff Clinical psychologist, Guys and St Thomas’s NHS Foundation TrustDr Kate Danvers Chartered clinical psychologist, Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health TrustDr Hannah Darrell-Berry Clinical psychologist, Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation TrustDr Sarah Davidson Clinical psychologist, Merseycare NHS Foundation TrustDr Lynda Durell .
