Standing at the southern wall of the churchyard at All Saints, Langport, is like being on a cliff edge, except that you are looking out across miles of Sedgemoor rather than out to sea. Below, across the moors where the rivers Parrett and Yeo meet, you do sometimes see only a great sheet of floodwater interrupted by treetops and the "great island" of Muchelney, where the monks built on raised ground.But now, in dry, sunny weather, I was travelling through the lowland fields, where meandering brooks feed the Parrett, and the map shows the lines of ancient drove roads and a grid pattern of irrigation ditches, as well as mills, weirs and sluices. Passing roadside flood markers, I took a lane from Kingsbury Episcopi and the wetlands up a gentle gradient towards East Lambrook, between high hedges now full of leaf.Through gateways on either side, I could see sunlight slanting across ranks of apple trees in shadowy cider orchards. Higher up was the fertile country where early settlers made homes safely above the seasonal threat of flooding, and the Romans later established a base close to their Fosse Way.And now I found myself in the market town of South Petherton, the focus of an agricultural community that had developed above the stretch of Somerset levels I had just crossed. I stopped beside one of the golden stone buildings surrounding the marketplace that tilts across the slopes high up beside the churchyard. The hairdresser's door was open, offering fresh air to the ladies under the dryers in the hot weather.The spacious church is set on a grassy knoll, its slender octagonal tower reaching high above the varied roofscape, so that as you climb the winding lanes and alleys, negotiating the occasional flight of steps, it often takes you by surprise, reappearing in a new perspective to delight the eye.
