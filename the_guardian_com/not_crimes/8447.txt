UK companies are set to miss out on the majority of specialist contracts to build the £14bn nuclear power station at Hinkley in Somerset because of a dearth of hi-tech engineering skills in the country, according to the plant's state-backed French developer, EDF Energy.An announcement is expected imminently on the result of long-running negotiations between EDF and the government over the price consumers will pay to subsidise electricity generated by the new reactors, as well as details of Chinese investment in the Hinkley project.While UK consumers will ultimately foot the bill for building the first nuclear facility in almost 20 years, most of the available contracts could be beyond UK suppliers which are struggling to meet the complex safety and quality standards of the nuclear industry, according to Ken Owen, commercial director for nuclear new build at EDF Energy."There are a lot of critical components where quite frankly the UK has lost its capability. We don't mind that because we know there is capability from a global perspective," he said.Contracts for what he described as "muck shifting" have already gone to UK companies which are set to prepare the site, but contracts for hi-tech engineering, civil engineering, marine engineering and various support services are at the preferred bidder stage or yet to be tendered.Although the UK excels at civil engineering and building in constrained sites, Owen said the difficulty arose when producing and integrating hi-tech components."This is where the UK has got to upskill itself because of the constraints of manufacturing parts for nuclear. We need full traceability: where every little bit of material comes from, and documentation of it. We need to understand the documentation sign-off for every manufacturing stage. That is a huge challenge for UK industry because they have never made components for the nuclear industry to today's standards."The vast majority of the value of the generator at Hinkley was in hi-tech engineering, not building the structure, said Owen."There are 90 contracts to deliver the job, excluding the muck shifting and enabling work. Two – marine works and civils – are traditional UK [strengths]. The other 88, that's the world of manufacturing and erection," said Owen, previously commercial director of CLM, the private sector delivery partner of London 2012 Olympics.The government expects the two new reactors at Hinkley to create between 20,000 and 25,000 jobs during construction and 900 permanent jobs once in operation.The project has been delayed because the government and EDF Energy remain locked in talks over the "strike price", which will guarantee the long-term price for electricity produced at Hinkley. EDF Energy needs a price sufficient for return on investment. However, the government is reluctant to be seen to subsidise a state-owned French firm at the expense of British consumers. An agreement had been expected by the end of 2012.The strike price also depends on the capital costs of the project, but here the two sides are nearing agreement. Owen said the government's due diligence on the EDF's costs was coming to an end.Until agreement is reached, EDF energy has suspended its procurement process, although it continues to work with four preferred bidders.Owen said EDF was working with the UK supply chain to help it understand the needs of the new build programme and helping suppliers collaborate with French companies with experience in the field.A government study from Oxford Economics and Atkins found the UK supply chain could capture 44% of the total value of a new nuclear reactor. If the government and energy producers worked together to develop the supply chain the figure could rise to 63%, it said. EDF estimates 57% of the value could return to the UK.
