An aspiration to become a “Heavy Dude, Musically” prompted me to listen to Thunderclap Newman and Khachaturian (Letters, 7 April). Eric Banks’s HDM acquaintance was winding him up. The piano solo in Something in the Air is not taken from Khachaturian. His concerto uses classical themes and makes no use of jazzy syncopation. The piano bridge in the song is unremarkable but does its job well, complementing the main theme without distracting from it in anticipation of an attractive lead-in to the main theme’s restatement. Does this make me an HDM or am I just being pretentious?Steve EdwardsReading, Berkshire• We expected our 2005 Saga trip to Argentina to be good, but it was made extra special by the company of Howard Marks (Goodbye, Mr Nice: Howard Marks, former drug smuggler turned writer, dies aged 70, 11 April). He was there to do an Observer piece about the Patagonian Welsh descendants. A likable and genial person; most nice. And he treated us to a drink. That’s all – really! Have a spliffing time, Howard, wherever you’ve gone.Rod WarringtonChester• Len Blomstrand’s report of a train delayed for “scheduled loitering” (Letters, 12 April) brought to mind the guard who announced the early arrival of a train I was on, from Yorkshire at Kings Cross, due to “circumstances entirely beyond our control”, to the great hilarity of the passengers. Of course this was in pre-privatisation days when humour was allowed on “our” railway.Maureen PantonMalvern, Worcestershire• During a journey from Leeds to London the train came to a stop and the driver announced that there were sheep on the line. After a long pause he added: “Apparently they are the wrong kind of sheep.”John HoughamGravesend, Kent• The West Country produced one of the finest broadcasting voices in Mark Laity, BBC defence correspondent during the 1990s (Letters, 7 April). My mum struggled with profound deafness and hearing aids all her life but loved listening to his voice “because I can hear every word he says”. That warm Cornish burr, the tone and pace, were just perfect for her.Jo ShortallLichfield, Staffordshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
