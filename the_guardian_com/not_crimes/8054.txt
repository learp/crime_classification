I refuse to buy into the idea that February and March are flat months, the “hungry gap” where there is nothing of interest in the shops with which to cook. I rather enjoy seeing piles of citrus fruits against quiet, grey skies and boxes of purple sprouting, the asparagus of the brassica family, stacked at the greengrocers. The Brussels are still sweet, there are Jerusalem artichokes, leeks and still a few golden-fleshed squash about. Anyway, we are stuck with it so we had better get on with it. A dressing made with honey and clementine zest removes all notion of worthiness I know a salad of Brussels sprouts sounds mirthless, but I urge you to give it a chance. Mine has enough citrus, almonds and rough skinned apple to be interesting. A dressing made with liquid honey and clementine zest removes any notion of worthiness. There are a few sesame seeds and some flat-leaf parsley, but it’s not complicated with unnecessary ingredients. It has freshness and clarity.I tend to think if you can smell a sprout, then you’ve overcooked it. In this recipe the leaves are given a hot bath rather than cooked. A brief dunking. It sets their colour to a vital, lively green. It tenderises without softening. This is the salad for eating with grilled bacon. Sprouts and bacon fat is a fine marriage.The sprouts seem sweetest when cut straight from the stalk despite being an infuriating way to buy them. The stalk is ridiculously long and weighs far more than you expect. Initially, I wrote off the sprouts-on-the-stalk thing as a gimmick – an attempt to make your shopping bag feel like it had been to the farm gate. Wrong. I made a soupy rice dish with purple sprouting, too, full of reassurance and solace.Brussels sprout, apple and clementine saladServes 4Brussels sprouts 175gclementines 2, or other small citrus russet apple 1sesame seeds 1 tbspalmonds a handful, skinnedparsley leaves a large handfulFor the dressing:clementine 1lemon 1olive oil 2 tbspwhite wine vinegar 1 tbspliquid honey 1 tbspPut a large pan of water on to boil. Trim the sprouts, then remove the outer leaves and put them in a bowl of cold water. Slice what is left of the sprouts into quarters and add to the leaves. Rinse thoroughly, then drain. Lightly salt the boiling water then lower in the sprouts. Leave them to cook for a maximum of 2 minutes, until their colours are bright.Have ready a bowl of water with ice cubes in it – failing that, a basin of very cold water. Drain the sprouts and put them into the iced water. This will stop them cooking.Remove the peel from 2 clementines, slice the fruit in half then into thin slices and place in a salad bowl. Halve the apple, then cut each half into thin segments, removing any pips as you go. Toss the apples with the clementines.In a dry pan toast the sesame seeds to a rich golden brown then tip half into a small bowl and the remainder into the clementines and apples. Return the pan to the heat, add a little oil and then the almonds. Leave them to cook, moving them around the pan every few minutes, until they are golden and fragrant. Salt lightly, then remove and place on kitchen paper.Drain then lightly dry the sprouts and their leaves then toss them gently into the salad with the parsley leaves.To make the dressing, squeeze the clementine and lemon then stir their juice into the reserved sesame seeds. With a fork or small whisk beat in the olive oil, vinegar and honey. Season with salt and black pepper.Broccoli, rice and blue cheese      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Blue heaven: broccoli, rice and blue cheese.
