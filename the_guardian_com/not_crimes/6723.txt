Bathing is a chance not just to wash off the grime of the day, but to scrub away memories of a whole dirty year. Go wild. Light a candle. Add a glug of scented oil, unwrap the fanciest soap you can find and lie still for a minute, or maybe an hour. Hell, listen to an old Desert Island Discs. Treat this evening like it’s the beginning of something new, something good.Our favouritesByredo Saints Incense Candle £88 byredo.com Susanne Kaufmann Bathing Oil £44 libertylondon.comSoap Co bar £7 thesoapco.org Dead Sea Magic Salts £5.99 hollandandbarrett.com Temple Spa Drift Away Oil £25 templespa.com Miss Dior Foaming Shower Gel £36.50 johnlewis.com L’Artisan Parfumeur Gel £26 lartisanparfumeur.com Anterenea soap £30 for 3 fredericmalle.comEmail Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman
