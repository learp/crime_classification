Therefore, I believe Burton’s Biscuit Company’s delivery of the news was not executed responsibly enough. Imagine how many dairy intolerant people might still be stuffing their faces with this delicious treat!It’s 2016! There are news every week of companies going vegan, offering new cruelty-free alternatives. How can the BB Company think this is a good move?
