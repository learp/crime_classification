This is the first book in the Divergent trilogy and it is set in a time and place where children are divided into one of five factions (Abnegation, Erudite, Candor, Dauntless and Amity) when they reach the age of 16.Beatrice Prior, the main protagonist of the story, has been brought up in the Abegnation faction where her father is a political leader, and at the start of the book she is preparing for her Aptitude Tests to decide which faction she will belong to. Her results are inconclusive which is very dangerous and puts her life in great peril - she is what is known as Divergent! She can’t tell this information to anyone so when the day of her choosing ceremony arrives she chooses Dauntless. This faction are the protectors of the society and are known for their toughness and courage. Most of the story follows her initiation process at the Dauntless training compound where she is taught fighting and combat skills in a fiercely competitive environment. If the recruits do not score well they face a factionless future! She finds good, loyal friends but also makes a few enemies; however, when Erudite plan to take down the Abegnation Government things turn nasty in this highly structured society and Beatrice finds herself in the middle of the action.I thought this book had a very original plot and I was intrigued at the way the society was structured. The characters were completely believable in their battles to face their fears and as soon as I had finished the book I couldn’t wait to pick up book 2 to find out what happens next. If you are a fan of thrilling adventure stories I am sure you will enjoy this book.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
