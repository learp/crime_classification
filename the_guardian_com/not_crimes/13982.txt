 All writers prefer to remember the good reviews rather than the bad ones, but there are always going to be some that mean more than others. While I was visiting a prison, an inmate once told me that a novel of mine got her into books and now she was an eager reader of fiction. As everyone familiar with breaking the cycle of reoffending will be aware, dealing with literacy issues is a key element that helps prisoners build a new life. Apart from being vital in solving obvious problems such as getting a job or dealing with public services, reading means you are able to understand your own life, the lives of others and the world at large.This is why Quick Reads plays such an important role. An initiative run by The Reading Agency, in partnership with authors, publishers, retailers, libraries, schools, colleges, prisons, unions and workplaces, it provides engaging stories that promote adult literacy and foster a love of reading. It was a huge honour for me to be asked to contribute to Quick Reads 2017 and I knew exactly what I wanted to write. During my many years working in prisons I had longed to write a fast-paced thriller about a recently released inmate who is determined not to reoffend, but temptation keeps getting in the way. This is how my One False Move was born.Having grown up in the East End of London I have seen at first hand how crime and prison make an impact on families and communities, as well as the way in which access to reading can open up a new world for youngsters from economically poor backgrounds. I was once one of those young people. By learning to enjoy reading, some of those who have struggled with literacy in the past may go on to enjoy writing, too. In these troubled times, when the same voices dominate, that would be good news for everyone.• False Move is published by Hodder. This year’s Quick Reads are available from 2 February a for just £1
