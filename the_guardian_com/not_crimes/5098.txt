The hoody as a bottom layer You know that real-world thing where you wear a hoody or a hooded quilted Uniqlo jacket as a layer under your coat? The hoody as practical bottom layer is now officially Vetements-approved. On the catwalk – which was actually the lobby of the Pompidou Centre – an orange hoody was worn under a spaghetti strap, sari-silk evening dress. Just imagine if someone did this on the red carpet. That would be the best thing ever.The new Vetements jean: think 90s R&B night in a suburban club       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Make way for the skintight jean.

They come in white or an almost stonewashed pale blue. Destined for instant cult status are the all-in-one jean-stiletto boot hybrids, which take the thigh-high boot to the next level and about which we have so many questions (how do you wash them? What happens if your friends have stripped their floorboards and instigated a no-shoes policy?).The inside-out denim jacket       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘The successor to the Frankenstein jean.’ Photograph: WWD/REX/ShutterstockThe successor to the Frankenstein jean is a double-layered denim jacket that seems to be made of two jackets with the top one inside out. Something like that, anyway, it was hard to be sure on first viewing; the models had clearly been told to walk as quick as possible. Some of them overtook each other on the catwalk, and the whole show was over in six minutes, so details were hard to grasp. Anyway, the easy-win styling trick here is to turn your denim jacket inside out.
