Action, adventure, mystery and fantasy. That isn’t a genre mix you get in a book very often. But this book nails it to the spot.Alfie, Prince of Wales and heir to the throne of the United Kingdom, is looked upon to become the next courageous leader of the UK. But there’s one little problem... he doesn’t want to be king. He doesn’t want to smash bottles against ships or knight someone with a sword. However, all that changes when his dad, King Henry, dies of a heart attack. But there is more to being king than what Alfie thinks. A dark force is rising, and Alfie may be the only one to stop it…This gripping, wonderful book, kept my eyes and my brain glued to the book, from start to finish. I was slightly apprehensive about the fact that one of my personally favourite genres, action/adventure, was being mixed with fantasy, which I’m not so fond of. But it turns out I was wrong to worry. Throughout, Huckerby and Ostler mixed the Black Lizard– a very mythical monster– with modern day situations; filled with action, such as a volcano erupting in Edinburgh and a night–time battle at Stonehenge.It finished on a cliffhanger, of which I’m sure I have an answer to. It was well thought–up and isn’t one you’d forget about in a hurry! This imaginative, innovative tale is sure to keep readers hooked, young or old, and I’m sure anyone who’s read the book feels the same as me.
