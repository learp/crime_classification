The recipeRemove any juicy pieces of meat from the bones of the Sunday roast (pork, lamb, chicken, whatever) and reserve. Put the bones into a large pot, pour in enough water to come two-thirds of the way up the pan then bring to the boil. Add 1 onion, halved, 8 black peppercorns, 1 tsp of coriander seeds, a carrot or two, a stick of celery, a couple of bay leaves and 3 star anise flowers. Turn the heat down so the liquid bubbles calmly and partially cover with a lid. Leave for 45-60 minutes. Leave the broth to simmer over a low heat, then get on with other things Cook 100g of pearl barley in boiling, lightly salted water for about 20 minutes till chewily tender. Drain and set aside. Fill the pan with water and return to the heat. Wash 4 big handfuls of greens, such as kale and chard leaves, then cook them briefly in the boiling water and drain. Make 4 slices of toast.Pour the broth through a colander to remove the coriander seeds and peppercorns and pick out and discard the bay leaves. Check the seasoning. Divide the barley and toast between 4 bowls, add the cooked greens, some of the reserved meat, then ladle over the hot broth, onions and carrots. Enough for 4.The trickI prepare the broth, leave it to simmer over a low heat, then get on with other things. Once the broth has been cooking for about half an hour, I cook the barley, make the toast and blanch the greens. The broth will be greatly enhanced by the addition of any bits of meat jelly and aromatics that have settled around the roast.The twistIf you are using beef bones, simmer the broth a little longer than you would for the others. In place of the barley try cooked rice â€“ brown is especially suited to this. Lentils will work nicely, too. The dark cabbages, such as savoy and kale, work very well. Coarse-leaved winter spinach, too. You could season the liquor with a drop or two of dark soy sauce.Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
