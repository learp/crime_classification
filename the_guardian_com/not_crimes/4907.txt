Italy has seen its share of heretics. Galileo spent his final years under house arrest for insisting that the Earth orbited the sun.In Bologna, a brave marketing executive has dared to put forward a theory that will be considered equally unthinkable – perhaps even blasphemous: that the dish known in Britain as spaghetti bolognese exists in Italy and is perfectly acceptable.This will be news to many Italians, who have derided the dish as a gastronomic aberration for decades. But, much like Galileo himself, Piero Valdiserra claims to have found proof. His examination of old texts found that – far from being a figment of the British culinary imagination – spaghetti bolognese, or spaghetti al ragù, as it would be known in Italy, dates back five centuries.It is steeped in Bologna’s culinary tradition, he says.Controversy surrounding the dish resurfaced last month, when Antonio Carluccio became the latest in a long line of chefs to complain that one of Britain’s favourite “Italian” dishes did not, in fact, exist in Italy. Massimo Bottura, whose restaurant in Modena, Osteria Francescana, was named the best in the world this year, has also complained about “crazy versions” of the pasta dish.

While spaghetti – dried pasta – is usually associated with southern Italy or coastal cities, he said it could without a doubt be considered traditional in Bologna.He reflected on his own personal history. “As far as I am concerned, I remember myself, my friends, my relative and families, consuming spaghetti al ragù forever, so it is not only a matter of documents, but also family history,” he said.So why do people from Bologna insist that tagliatelle is the only way to go? Historically, Valdiserra said, tagliatelle was consumed by wealthy people who could afford to make the fresh pasta, while normal people tended to consume the egg pasta only on special occasions. Secondly, Valdiserra claimed, the dish became enshrined in local tradition because restaurants focused on serving the dish with tagliatelle, in part because fresh pasta cooked faster.The fact that a slight variation on a local classic has caused so much controversy is not a new phenomenon in Italy, where even a Michelin-starred celebrity chef was lambasted by a mayor for admitting he added a touch of roasted garlic to his amatriciana sauce. Spag-bol – and other crimes against ragù alla bolognese Italians’ rigid adherence to cooking traditions, Valdiserra said, is linked to the false belief that they have not changed much over centuries. Valdiserra said he hopes that his research and new book on the topic, Spaghetti Alla Bolognese: L’altra Faccia Del Tipico – Spaghetti Bolognese: the Other Side of Tradition – will inspire other locals to see the error of their ways and embrace the controversial dish, if for no other reason because the furore could attract more interest in Bologna.“In our city, it was really a matter of big discussion: people who are in favour, people who are against. Our city is now burning a little bit from this point of view,” he said with a laugh.As for the dish itself, Valdiserra still thinks tagliatelle is the “most suitable” pasta.“But this does not prevent the fact that, spaghetti, when they are well chosen, well cooked, dressed with a good sauce and maybe enriched with parmigiano cheese, are fantastic as well.”
