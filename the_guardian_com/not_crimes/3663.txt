We’re deep into the post-holiday abyss, temperatures have plummeted and winter yawns on for a good couple of months yet. So if you want to feel better about your January lot, now’s as good a time as any to watch Everest (Universal, 12), in which the digit-severing blizzard that killed eight mountaineers on the mountain’s slopes in 1996 whips away at the screen with near-tangible fury. Shot with steely grace and bone-jangling sound design, Baltasar Kormákur’s real-life disaster epic is a triumph of sensation, giving even those of us who pant after a few flights of stairs a sense of masochistic, exhilarated peak-lust. As personal drama it’s less rewarding. Despite an all-star ensemble, led with tight-jawed authority by Jason Clarke, Kormákur gives us little sense of who Everest’s victims actually were, while sporadic check-ins with the waiting women at home seem perfunctory, adding only the most expected notes of tragedy to inexorable narrative doom. Still, few films have made more visceral sense of George Mallory’s famous “because it’s there” quote.Things don’t cheer up a whole lot in Camp X-Ray (Koch, 15), a Guantánamo Bay drama that salvages a good deal of empathy and human texture from a seemingly specious premise. A numbed US soldier (Kristen Stewart) tentatively bonds with a Middle Eastern man (Peyman Moaadi) who has been detained there – but, in a cruelly critical semantic distinction, not imprisoned – for eight years. Peter Sattler’s script sometimes strains for even-handedness when the two actors, both superb, convey interior conflict and compromise to more tacit effect. It’s a worthy footnote in the annals of America’s post-9/11 political cinema.

(Icon, 18), an inspired evolutionary-scramble fantasy that imagines a world in which humans have developed behaviourally more along the lines of apes. That it’s not such a different world after all is an easily foreseen punchline, but the film is driven less by schematic irony than hearty pathos, as Oram studies modern relationships and gender imbalance through this wonky speculative prism.Arrested male development takes a more conventionally amusing kicking in Bad Bromance (Sony, 15) – a dreadful retitling of a film that was released as The D Train in cinemas. No matter: it’s still a thoughtful, surprisingly tender examination of insecurities at both ends of the jock/nerd spectrum, as Jack Black’s small-time Pittsburgh loser chases a Hollywood-blessed classmate (the excellent James Marsden) to attend a high-school reunion, and winds up with more bonding than he bargained for. Like the comparable man-love comedy Humpday, it gets shy just when it really shouldn’t, but even its guarded provocation is welcome.French new wave acolytes are being doubly treated this week on the Blu-ray front. Alain Resnais’ Hiroshima, Mon Amour (StudioCanal, 12) finally makes its debut on the format in a shimmery digital restoration. Its images have never looked so crystalline, even as the alluring tangle of its era-melding romance remains perfectly knotted. A rarer coup still is The Jacques Rivette Collection (Arrow, 15), which gathers some of the most elusive works from the new wave’s wiliest trapeze artist. Chief among them is his 13-hour opus Out 1, with its playful latticework structure meshing the actions of two theatrical troupes. (Also included: Out 1: Spectre, its still-imprecise four-hour precis.) It’s not exactly where Rivette virgins should start, but it’s an opulent wallow for the converted.

Ian Gabriel’s overplotted but intense film has received a fraction of the international attention granted the Johannesburg-set Tsotsi a decade ago, but it’s tougher and more sharply crafted. Even at its most stylistically derivative, this tale of an ex-con out to avenge his father’s murder (among other grim story strands) has a scraped-knee burn that sticks with you.
