Civil-rights campaigner and congressman John Lewis was in tears as he accepted America’s National Book award for young people’s literature in Manhattan on Wednesday night, speaking of how as a child he had been turned away from the public library for being black.John Lewis: 'I don’t think I’ve changed much. I still consider myself an activist' Lewis won the prestigious US honour for the third volume of his graphic memoir March, which tells of his vital part in the civil rights movement in the 1960s. “This is unreal. This is unbelievable,” said Lewis as he took to the stage with his visibly moved co-authors Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell.Recounting how he grew up “very, very poor” in rural Alabama, Lewis said there were “very few books in our home”, recalling a trip in 1956 to try and borrow some books from the library.“I had a wonderful teacher in elementary school who told me: ‘Read, my child, read’, and I tried to read everything. I love books,” said Lewis. “When I was 16 years old, some of my brothers and sisters and cousins [were] going down to the public library trying to get public library cards, and we were told the library was for whites only, not for coloureds. To come here and receive this award this honour is too much. Thank you.”Lewis has previously described March as a book “for all of America”, but in particular for young people, “to understand the essence of the civil rights movement, to walk through the pages of history to learn about the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence, to be inspired to stand up to speak out and to find a way to get in the way when they see something that is not right, not fair, not just”.

And in the midst of the human ugliness of racism there is the human beauty in the resistance to racism. That is why I have faith. And I’ll never lose my faith that you and I can create an anti-racist America ... where black lives matter.”Colson Whitehead: 'My agent said: Oprah. I said: Shut the front door' The poetry award went to The Performance of Becoming Human by Daniel Borzutzky. Novelist Colson Whitehead won the National Book award for fiction for his novel The Underground Railway, about a slave who escapes from a cotton plantation in Georgia. In her review for the Guardian, author Cynthia Bond said: “This uncanny novel never attempts to deliver a message – instead it tells one of the most compelling stories I have ever read.”Whitehead said, on accepting his prize: “Outside is the blasted hellhole wasteland of Trumpland,” advising his audience that in response to Trump “a good formula, for me anyway”, was to “be kind to everybody, make art and fight the power”.
