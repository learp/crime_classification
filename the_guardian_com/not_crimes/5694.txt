As usual, Wiley got it right. “A statement was made,” he said last year, as Kanye West brought half of the UK grime and rap scene on to the Brits stage with him, all clad in black, flamethrowers at the ready: “Kanye knows the Brits ain’t letting dons in there like that, so he kicked off the door for us.” Kanye’s theatrical, provocative performance of All Day was a highlight and the main talking point of an awards ceremony notorious for bad taste and baffling anachronisms. As Alexis Petridis recalled last night, the music industry’s annual jolly is characterised by pushing the likes of M People, Sting and (mercy me) Jimmy Nail to the front, while shutting the zeitgeist firmly out in the cold and telling it to go haunt somewhere else. It is the awards ceremony Alan Partridge would approve of.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Wiley’s comment was poignant because it keyed into a widely held suspicion: that only the world’s greatest living rock star could choose to bring the likes of Skepta, Stormzy and Krept & Konan on to the Brits stage – because they’d never be nominated, or win, or be asked to perform in their own right. And sure enough, when the nominations for the 2016 awards were announced yesterday, there were those same gaping holes: not a single UK grime or rap artist appears anywhere. This might have been less of an issue, but the UK’s grime and hip-hop scenes followed their explosive start to 2015 with one of its strongest years in living memory. Of course, everyone thinks their favourite kind of music should be recognised; that’s what being a “fan” is. But it’s hardly a stretch to suggest Skepta’s incredible year ought to have led to a best male artist nomination; that Stormzy, Lady Leshurr, Novelist or Krept & Konan should be in the best breakthrough act nominations; that Skepta’s Shutdown, JME and Giggs’ Man Don’t Care, Krept & Konan’s Freak of the Week, Lady Leshurr’s Queen’s Speech 4 or Stormzy’s Shut Up should have made the best single list. Shutdown was voted the Guardian’s critics’ single of the year, in fact. I’d even make a case for Stormzy’s Know Me From and Leshurr’s Queen’s Speech 4 getting best video nominations – the former famously featuring Stormzy’s mum and both of them brimming with joyful DIY creativity.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  So what’s the justification for this year’s whitewash? The Brits use a confusing mixture of criteria and methods: best single and video nominations are measured only in who gets the best numbers (sales and YouTube views) – and the 15-20m views achieved by most of the above simply aren’t big enough. Nominees for best breakthrough act are “selected by the voting academy” – and then at various points, in various ways, there is public voting, sometimes. “There was at one time a myth that some secret panel met in a smoke-filled room to draw up an arbitrary list,” says the Brits website, ever so slightly defensively, before assuring us that the voting academy, in fact, consists of “over 1,000” music industry figures. Whatever their methods, the end result is embarrasingly bland, and embarrassingly white. The Brits’ blindness to black British talent doesn’t seem to apply to the US however: Drake and the Weeknd were nominated for best international male, and maybe,given their huge commercial appeal, that’s not at all surprising. But so was another bold, uncompromising MC – and fellow critics’ favourite – Kendrick Lamar.Grime’s greatest star (and departed hero), Dizzee Rascal, actually won best male artist at the Brits in 2010 and performed as well, showing off his undeniable lyrical skills – and in an interesting contrast to Kanye’s “mob”, appearing in black tie, accompanied by harps (and Florence + the Machine). When questioned about Kanye’s 2015 performance, Dizzee’s solidarity for his UK MCs seemed limited – he congratulated Skepta and JME, before issuing a caveat: “Everything people are seeing now, I already did it on my own. People talk about the pop part – they don’t talk about me being an independent artist. I made it look easy, that’s the problem! I dominated the underground and then I dominated the overground, and I did that on my own.” His suggestion seems to be that the likes of Skepta aren’t ready for Brit awards until they’ve conquered both worlds.For a raucous, anti-establishment genre like grime, it’s always been the fashionable thing to reject official recognition, and reject a mainstream music industry that doesn’t understand their appeal. “On stage at the Brits, we were the people’s people, the rebels,” 18-year-old Novelist told me after joining Kanye for All Day last year. “The TV, the blogs, the big magazines – it doesn’t matter if they say it, the country knows about us, and that’s all that matters.” With the ability to connect straight to fans via social media, and to make money via sales, merchandising and performances without the approval of the suits arrayed in the Brits audience, perhaps industry recognition is less important than it ever has been. “You can do things comfortably without having to conform, without the approval of the Brits,” he said, cheerfully. Just as well, really.
