They usually say don’t judge a book by its cover and you obviously shouldn’t! But if you did judge this book by its amazing cover then you won’t be disappointed because the story inside is just as amazing as the cover. Currently it’s my favourite contemporary book and if you are looking for a good book to read during summer, then pick this one!Since You’ve Been Gone by Morgan Matson is a stand-alone book that follows the story of Emily Hughes’ enthralling and unexpected summer adventures. Emily’s best friend Sloane has vanished and all she has left Emily is a list of 13 insane challenges that Emily would never do. But what if the list is the only way for Emily to reunite with her best friend? Therefore, Emily sets off to cross off each one of the items on the list and while she is at it ends up making the most unexpected friendships with the least expected people.The friendship between Sloane and Emily really touched my heart and since situations like this where friends fall apart and fall back together are very realistic, they make the book all the more appealing. Another interesting part of the book is Emily’s character development as she emerges out of her shell from being a socially awkward girl into a determined and braver version of herself. While this book covers all these aspects the plot was light and amusing which hooks the readers all the more.Overall it’s a heartwarming story of loss, taking risks, new beginnings and self-discovery along the journey. This book made me realize “it’s not the destination that matters but the journey”. My only criticism for this book would be that the later events were pretty predictable but it was still a great, read so I’d rate this book a 4.5/5.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
