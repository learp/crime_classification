While I am unable to help Jenny Jeater with her conundrum (Letters, 29 November), I can vouch for the flammable qualities of the Guardian. Many years ago, in a previous marriage, the mother of my children would chat to me in the evening as I tried to read the paper. One evening it became apparent that my grunts, umms, ah-has etc had not been placed appropriately in the conversation when I smelt scorched paper and the Guardian suddenly erupted in flames in my hands.As the smoke and charred remains of the Guardian cleared, I saw the mother of my children, with a smug look of satisfaction, blow out the match and place the matchbox back on the mantelpiece.Chris SeidelCochrane, Alberta, Canada• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
