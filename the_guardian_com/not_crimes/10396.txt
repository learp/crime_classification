Farmers and environmental groups have lined up against the oil and gas industry to oppose fracking of unconventional gas in Victoria, as a parliamentary inquiry into its potential benefits gets under way.A parliamentary committee began hearings in Melbourne on Wednesday morning into the economic, social and environmental ramifications of allowing Victoria to be opened up for gas drilling.In vast swaths of rural New South Wales, there's only one election issue: coal seam gas Victoria has banned unconventional gas exploration, which includes coal seam gas and tight gas, since 2012. Since then, the expansion of coal seam gas in New South Wales and Queensland has sparked fierce protests from green groups and some local residents. In January, Victoria’s Labor government extended the ban until the committee handed down its findings. A review conducted by the former Coalition government recommended that regulations around fracking for gas be relaxed. Advocates for gas drilling claim Victoria would benefit financially and households would enjoy lower gas prices if supply were increased. But farmers have vowed to fight any expansion of coal seam gas into Victoria. The Gippsland and Otway regions are considered the most likely areas for gas extraction, raising fears over the potential impact upon agriculture.“Unconventional” gas lies in hard-to-reach areas such as within rocks, requiring fracking technology to drill underground and fracture the minerals to release the gas.  “We cannot believe that the government is thinking of approving these invasive gas fields on our best farmland without having investigated whether we even need the gas,” said Jill Smith, a sheep farmer from Branxholme. Smith said a group of farmers had commissioned the University of Melbourne to study Victoria’s need for unconventional gas.Tim Forcey, an energy expert at the university, was due to tell the inquiry there was no economic reason to connect new houses to the gas grid and it was now cheaper for people to use electricity for heating rather than gas.The Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF) said its members were concerned gas developments would risk groundwater supplies. The federation said farmers should be allowed to block mining companies coming on to their land. The chairman of the VFF’s land management committee, Gerald Leach, said there was not enough evidence about the potential effects drilling would have on groundwater.“The fact is we don’t know enough about our groundwater reserves, their profiles, recharge processes and interactivity to know what impacts onshore gas drilling would have on our water,” he said.Why increasing coal seam gas supply will result in higher gas prices “Given that uncertainty, the VFF believes a moratorium should remain in place until scientific evidence proves it’s safe.”The Greens have released polling showing 70% of people surveyed in four state electorates – Brunswick, Prahran, South West Coast and Morwell – are opposed to expanding gas exploration in Victoria.Cam Walker, co-ordinator at Friends of the Earth, said: “The inquiry offers our state the best chance it will ever have to stop this destructive industry.“Given the known contamination dangers associated with this industry, the negative impacts it will have on current farming and economic activity, and the deep community opposition, the only logical outcome of the inquiry must be a permanent ban on unconventional gas drilling and fracking.”But the oil and gas industry is pushing for a change in regulations, claiming that Victoria’s stance is out of step with the rest of Australia and is pushing up gas prices for 1.8 million customers in the state.“Inquiry after inquiry has found that a properly regulated natural gas industry is safe and delivers real benefits to regional communities,” said Paul Fennelly, chief operating officer at the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA).“Further inaction or a continuation of polices that undermine the development of onshore gas projects, will only impose costs on the community, in jobs, economic growth and higher energy prices.”APPEA said the ban on onshore gas exploration and fracking should be removed “immediately” and that there should be a “gas fields commission” to engage with the community on unconventional gas.
