A wind farm in Northern Ireland will not re-open until an investigation reveals why an 80-metre wind turbine collapsed on a mountainside.The only previous time that one of the UK’s almost 4,800 commercial-scale turbines has toppled was in 2007 in Scotland. No-one was injured in either case.The turbine which collapsed on Friday evening, in winds of about 25mph, was one of eight in the Screggagh windfarm near Fintona in County Tyrone. The remaining seven have been shut down until the investigation is completed. The turbine, worth over £500,000, appears to have buckled near the base of its 80m tower causing its three 40m blades to hit the hillside.Doreen Walker, director of the £26m windfarm, which opened in March 2011, said: “The wind farm will remain shut down until [turbine supplier] Nordex UK Ltd has completed a full investigation in to the remaining seven wind turbines and confirms that they are safe to operate.” “There were fortunately no injuries and no personnel on site at the time.” Walker said. “We are satisfied that the site’s precautionary health and safety alert processes worked well with local emergency services in attendance within minutes of the incident taking place.”Local reports suggest the rotor blades spun out of control, with the sound of the turbine crashing to the ground heard up to seven miles away. Some people claimed to have heard the sound of metal grinding throughout the day.

An investigation later showed that bolts attaching the blade to the hub had failed, while lights seen in the sky were probably fireworks. In 2007, a 63m turbine in Kintyre ended up bent in two after a suspected braking problem. The wind industry’s trade body, RenewableUK, said there have also been five recorded collapses of small turbines installed by farmers on their own land. These turbines were on average 25m tall and no-one was injured.RenewableUK’s director of health and safety, Chris Streatfeild, said: “A thorough investigation is already underway into what happened in this extremely rare incident. The wind industry takes health and safety issues very seriously. There’s a rigorous process in place to ensure that installation standards are adhered to strictly, including a detailed risk assessment so that every turbine is sited in a safe place.”The single collapsed Screggagh wind turbine provided annual electricity equivalent to that used by about 1,500 homes. Failures at coal, gas and nuclear power plants take much larger amounts of energy off the grid at short notice. In October, a fire at RWE’s gas-fired power station at Didcot in Oxfordshire led to the near-instant loss of electricity equivalent to 500,000 homes. In August, nuclear operator EDF shut down four of its reactors for months after a crack was found in a boiler.
