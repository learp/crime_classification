Autumn foliage is at its most colourful in the UK, north America and parts of Europe in October, and we’d like to see the early autumn signs and colours wherever you are.Whether an autumnal shot of the UK countryside, or an image of fall changing the landscape of north America, share your photos and videos of the best autumn colours you will see this year, and let us know where and when the images were taken. We will feature a selection of your autumn images on the site.
