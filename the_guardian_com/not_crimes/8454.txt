Putin’s Secret Riches – Panorama8.30pm, BBC1It is commonly supposed and/or alleged that Vladimir Putin has amassed a vast personal fortune, despite spending most of his life drawing a public-sector wage. Richard Bilton’s film goes looking for the truth about Putin’s loot, meeting several former Kremlin insiders who claim knowledge of what Putin has, how he got it, and where he has stashed it. As is often the case with journalism concerning Russia, reminders to self that this isn’t some bleak satirical fiction but is actually happening are necessary. Andrew MuellerMary Berry’s Foolproof Cooking8.30pm, BBC2For those of us who worry about kitchen ineptitude, Mary Berry is here to help. That’s because her new series is all about “trusted recipes”. Advice is delivered crisply and authoritatively as, first up, Britain’s doyenne of the domestic prepares dishes for “special days”. These include baked salmon (served with spiralised veg), lobster tails and beef wellington. The latter brings a positively shocking revelation as Berry advises using shop-bought: “Life is too short for me to make puff pastry.” Jonathan WrightThe Undateables: Holiday Romance9pm, Channel 4The first holiday together as a couple can be a challenge, so imagine how much worse it is if you’re being filmed for The Undateables. Alex and Eloise have a long-distance relationship and their anxiety is heart-wrenching as they spend three days together in the Loire valley. Jeanette is off to Paris with Ray, while Brent, who has Tourette syndrome, and his wife Challis celebrate their first wedding anniversary in Amsterdam. It’s as warm and sensitive as ever. Hannah VerdierDrunk Stoned Brilliant Dead: The Story of The National Lampoon9pm, Sky AtlanticAt its height, National Lampoon was the second-most popular magazine on US newsstands: less a satirical organ than one big coked-up party for the Me Decade. In this rather brittle tribute, writers, actors and editors tell its story, from its Nixon-baiting origins, to status as something of a real-life Animal House for everyone from the future cast of Saturday Night Live (who plundered its talent wholesale) to future film director John Hughes. Ali CatterallGotham: Rise of the Villains 10pm, Channel 5The batty Batman prequel continues, with a knife-throwing villain hijacking a ritzy Gotham benefit gala live on TV. That’s the sort of larger-than-life caper Adam West would routinely kapow his way through 50 years ago, but here it’s up to grim cop Jim Gordon. Can he outwit the rather familiar-seeming Jerome, a circus runaway with pale skin, colourful hair and an unsettling cackle? Meanwhile, Sean Pertwee showcases a notably different side to loyal butler Alfred by chatting up Gordon’s girlfriend Lee. Graeme VirtueTracey Ullman’s Show10.45pm, BBC1Third helping of repatriated ribaldry from Ullman’s new series, and the recurring characters continue to bed in. Tonight’s treats include Dame Maggie Smith’s new green screen-ready showreel, events unfolding inside the HQ of a corporation stamping twee slogans on to premium earthenware, Dame Judi Dench’s ongoing crime spree, and a raucous rock opera documenting Rebekah Brooks’s return to the Chipping Norton set. Ullman’s impressive ability to inhabit contrasting personas again outshines a patchy script. Mark Gibbings-JonesKilljoys8pm, SyfyThis Canadian drama brings light sci-fi intrigue with an emo soundtrack and a good-looking cast. Three futuristic bounty hunters cause mischief and most of the action takes place in grimy but glossy places. They’re thrown into a dilemma when asked to work on a case that involves one of their long-lost relatives. Chief Dutch rules the show, but will she come unstuck when she’s sent undercover at a fancy garden party? D’avin’, meanwhile, is not fond of keeping his shirt on. Fun. HVFilm choiceThe Dark Knight (9pm, ITV2) Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale’s reinvention of the Batman franchise is dizzying, daft, absurdly macho and unabashedly great fun. Paul HowlettX-Men Origins: Wolverine (Gavin Hood, 2009) 9pm, Film4This prequel explores the backstory of the coolest X-Man, Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine. It seems Wolvie grew his claws in snowy 1840s Canada, then spent a century-and-a-half trying to rein in his even wilder brother, Liev Schreiber’s Sabretooth, while the pair fight for a special mutant unit through world wars and Vietnam. PHLast Man Standing (Walter Hill, 1996) 12midnight, ITV4Akira Kurosawa made it as Yojimbo, Sergio Leone as A Fistful of Dollars, and Hill isn’t far off the mark with this third telling of the classic tale. This one’s set in a dusty little prohibition-era Texas town where rival bootleggers fight for supremacy. In the middle is Bruce Willis as John Smith, an infernally fast gunman, with cold-eyed killer Christopher Walken as worst of the villains.
