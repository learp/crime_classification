PerformanceThe PhilanthropistChristopher Hampton’s 1971 campus play is usually staffed by middle-aged actors, but director Simon Callow’s production has a crack team of new comedy talent. The Inbetweeners’ Simon Bird is the titular benevolent university prof, Fresh Meat’s Charlotte Ritchie is his fiancee, Tom Rosenthal (who plays Bird’s brother and partner-in-pranks in Friday Night Dinner) his best mate, and booming voice of a generation, Matt Berry, a larger-than-life novelist. Meanwhile, model Lily Cole will be proving her comic acting chops as man-eating acquaintance Araminta.At Trafalgar Studios, London, 3 April to 22 JulyScatteredIf it sounds a bit drippy that this touring dance show “explores our relationship with water”, Motionhouse combine acrobatics, aerial wizardry and lifelike projections of waterfalls, waves and glaciers, with which the dancers interact by jumping into the screen.

And his tangentially football-themed Athletico Mince podcast with Andy Dawson (the man behind social media sensation Get in the Sea) is an oddball treat. Now the pair are taking the podcast to the stage.

The most exciting rapper to sashay on these shores is Stefflon Don (pronounced Steff London, pictured below) who parlays UK grime, Dutch bubbling and Jamaican patois into a global hybrid sound that’s attitudinal and unique. She plays a one-off show. Tape, London, 6 April Sub Club 30th BirthdayAt a time when UK’s varied nightlife can feel under threat, that Glasgow’s well-loved venue Sub Club has reached three decades – during which it has given a platform to DJs such as Optimo and Slam – deserves championing. Its founders and techno stalwarts Harri & Domenic kick off celebrations, and a programme of parties continues into the summer.Harri & Domenic play Sub Club, Glasgow, 1 AprilFilmFree Fire   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Free Fire trailer: Ben Wheatley’s shootout starring Brie Larson – videoBritish writer-directors Ben Wheatley and Amy Jump are never predictable. Their latest film is a vaguely Tarantino-ish action-comedy shoot ’em up containing 70s outfits, barbed dialogue and a seemingly endless gunfight. You’d never call it subtle but the sheer pyrotechnic elan and impressive cast (Cillian Murphy, Brie Larson and Sam Riley) make it a memorable experience. Free Fire is in cinemas nowFlatpack film festivalBirmingham’s achingly hip film festival returns with another vast, avant-garde programme spanning live soundtracks, animation, documentary, virtual reality and, they say, “weird films for kids”. Highlights this year include a retrospective of David Lynch, including a live scoring of Eraserhead, a rare showing of Matthew Barney’s five-film epic The Cremaster Cycle and a delightfully titled “Gongoozling Day”, dedicated to leftfield shorts, from Jean Painlevé to Alys Fowler’s canal walks.Various venues, Birmingham, 4 to 9 AprEventsInside Vogue      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Vogue one: Alexandra Shulman.
