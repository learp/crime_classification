Although the 30 grey seals that have hauled out to breed at this spot may weigh 10 tonnes collectively, they look little more than a low-lying hoard on the dipping horizon of beach and tide. Even on close approach they are just a third the height of the final wave cresting ashore and in these February temperatures and with a bitter north wind spitting sand, they look like gigantic fish-bloated larvae marinated in contentment.I love the way one sings that soft low moan like wind through sand. I love even more how one will heave up its head momentarily, the mottled brown-and-cream pelt breadcrumbed in sand, and graze a flipper over its ample flank, or even its neighbour’s. Then it flicks its chin with that five-nailed comb like an Edwardian gent adjusting his whiskers and slumps down softly. Who could imagine that this suggestive wallow of life could be such good box office, yet the wardens tell me that over the winter more than 43,000 people have come to see the seals.Occasionally they threaten genuine drama. One big bull, fresh out of the spume and shovelling the moleskin-black of his bulk up the beach, has mouth open and his huge dog’s teeth, which can kill porpoise or grind down 7kg of cod a day, unsheathed. Then he yawns, rolls over, his pink grin turns upside down and from my angle becomes a huge jellied ball compressed by gravity. Perhaps there is a kind of imaginative theatre underneath all that fat: when he finally lumbers back to the water, whose cold could kill us within the hour, he could swim to Northumberland or sail offshore to Europe.Yet I suspect the human crowds are coming less to marvel than to dote. Nestled higher up the beach are the pups, whose immense liquid eyes seem even darker against the whiteness of their lanugo. While they await the 50% fat of their mother’s milk, they doze in an atmosphere of winter dazzle and icy sun and the sugared oohs and aahs of brief human affection.Twitter @MarkCocker2
