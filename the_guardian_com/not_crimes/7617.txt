I had thought that the BBC’s Autumnwatch might not recover from the loss of Kate Humble, but I now realise that there has been a gain in strength.One of the recent shows featured the strangely named edible dormouse, which is not as cute as it looks. If you haven’t been following, the best way to conjure up the truly daunting edible dormouse situation is that there used to be a few of them but now there are zillions, threatening to eat the entire country.The problem partly arises from the fact that an edible dormouse doesn’t look like that kind of creature. It is very cute, even after it has tripled in weight, which it can do at the drop of a hat.With the cane toad, the Australians at least had the excuse that they knew it was uglier than sin. They just thought it might do some good. But the British have no such let-out from responsibility. They (and by they I mean all of us who live anywhere near the Chilterns, which includes Edinburgh if you think about it) just took one look at the dormouse and fell, clunk. Cuddly or what?In the relevant show, the dormouse experts who had taken Lucy Cooke into dormouse territory had to keep reminding her that the tiny animal was not necessarily nice just because it looked like a film star. Kate Humble used to be harder to remind about that kind of awkward fact. Faced with animal pulchritude, she would coo. The animal would coo back.Clive James: ‘I am continually reminded of what a misery guts I have been’ Lucy has a harder head, and the band of edible dormouse wranglers who had taken her out on the trail were able to get their message across, partly by evoking, with their grim expressions, a picture of whole swaths of Britain reduced to territory in which nothing but teeming thousands of edible dormice reign supreme, consuming a whole village for lunch.A fabulous show, and all the more so because Chris Packham is now wearing a zip-up sweater rather like the one I wear to bed. He is still too young for old age, but one can’t begrudge the fact that he has been given some of its rewards, such as the right to sit by the fire. One assumes that the fire is blazing inside some nice warm studio, whereas the lake which his subordinate Martin Hughes-Games stands in the middle of is definitely a lake. Martin has a special night-vision scanner which he holds up to his eyes while saying that the deer are probably over there, near those trees. Almost invariably they aren’t. An edible dormouse ate them.
