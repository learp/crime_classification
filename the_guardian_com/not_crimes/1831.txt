Sniff this The best way to choose roses for your garden is to see them in full bloom, and sample their scent. Now’s the time to do it: try Borde Hill’s rose garden in Haywards Heath, West Sussex. It features more than 75 varieties of roses in shades from pure white to deepest red. See bordehill.co.uk for details.Spread this If grass cuttings clog up your compost bin, put them to work on your vegetables. Tomatoes, courgettes, beans and potatoes will all benefit from a mulch of clippings: they help to smother weeds, keep soil moist and add organic matter to the soil. Just avoid any material from lawns treated with weedkiller. No lawn? Try strulch (strulch.co.uk), a mineralised straw mulch that slugs hate to cross, instead.Plant this When people ask for a tough, evergreen, drought-resistant perennial with pretty flowers, I suggest thrift.
