We reached the grove of tall, centuries-old mahogany trees, growing beside the mansion that used to be a cane plantation. We had walked for hours into the hills in the north-central part of Barbados. The cool air was welcome after the morning on the beaches on the west coast of Holetown. We sat on the smooth trunks of the trees and looked up into canopy: you could hardly see the sky, the foliage was so thick, sheltering us from the sun.We had bought 10 tiny mahogany trees from a local NGO, the Future Trees Project at the Future Centre Trust, which has been operating for 15 years. (The trust is also working with disadvantaged young people, training them to become gardeners.) Their scheme is designed to re-green the island and our little trees would soon be planted along the busy ABC highway.Many trees have been cut down over the past decades to make room for roads, hotels and apartments. Our tiny trees will be a paltry-sized carbon sink, chosen from mahogany, neem, royal palm, tamarind, mango, golden apple and frangipani.Karl Watson, who has worked for environmental causes here all his life, had told us: "Us Bajans, we wished for a Garden of Eden and a garden was what we got." He meant that so many people on the island love manicured lawns, golf courses and neat gardens, rather than wilderness.That mahogany grove was the first part of the island I had seen let go wild. The island has many attractions, but so many towns have been overdeveloped. Everyone seems to drive. Few people cycle or walk.The tourist industry has forgotten how important trees, plants and wild places are for attracting people to the Caribbean for holidays. But plant power may be quietly on the rise. The stamps have pictures of Caribbean plants such as the Lignim vitae, the tiny purple flower that is the symbol of Jamaica, to encourage people to care about the flora.On our way back down, we walked through cane fields under the hot blue sky and agreed how wonderful it would be when our trees grew to the size of the magnificent mahogany trees in that grove. It may take two centuries, but we were happy to think about them still growing tall on this small island, long after we have left this earth.
