Name: Kate Bush.Age: 58.Appearance: Rare.Occupation: Artiste.This is the Kate Bush, right? That’s right. The art-pop prodigy and now reclusive doyenne.What has she done? Is it a new tour? It’s a new tour, right? Please can it be a new tour? Nope. It’s a political opinion.I’d have preferred a new tour, ideally. Yes, but you’ll have to wait.It’s not fair! And political opinions are so boring! Just about every artist in the world is either leftwing or very leftwing. Not so fast. Bush is full of surprises, remember. And the latest is that she loves Theresa May.I admit I did not see that coming. What did she actually say? Well, she was asked by the Canadian magazine Maclean’s about the fear of women in power after Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the US.Right. To which she answered: “We have a female prime minister here in the UK. I actually really like her and think she’s wonderful. I think it’s the best thing that’s happened to us in a long time. She’s a very intelligent woman but I don’t see much to fear. I will say it is great to have a woman in charge of the country. She’s very sensible and I think that’s a good thing at this point in time.”Yes. There is also this whole leaving-the-EU thing and the question of whether it is going well or quite terribly. There is, but Bush trusts May with the task, it seems.I suppose both were convent school girls of about the same age who grew up in the south-east of England. Perhaps they see things the same way? Perhaps.Did Bush mention how firm she likes her Brexit? She did not. Although, when asked about the subject on another occasion, she said: “Change is such an important part of life. It’s such a different world from even five years ago. A lot of unexpected things have happened this year.”Hmm … Exactly. She is also the doyenne of inscrutable answers.Do say: “Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen.”Don’t say: “How could you leave meee / When I needed to / Possess EU? / I hated EU / (I loved EU too.)”
