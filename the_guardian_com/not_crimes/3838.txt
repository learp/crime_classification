Three months ago we teamed up with Stephen King’s UK publisher to launch a short story competition inspired by his latest collection, The Bazaar of Bad Dreams. More than 800 stories later we have chosen the six that will be sent off to be judged by the master. I have to admit that the prospect of ploughing through dozens of wannabe Carries and second-rate Shinings seemed like the roundabout route to Misery, even though – as one of the selectors who came in at the second stage, along with King’s editor Philippa Pride and independent judge Kate Lyall Grant– I only had to read a longlist of 20.It turned out to be a far more interesting task than I had expected, demonstrating that there are plenty of talented storytellers out there, and giving some sort of glimpse into the legacy that King has left in the imaginations of his readers after nearly 40 years of storytelling.The Bazaar of Bad Dreams by Stephen King review – dark stories with moments of magic Here are some of the tropes we noticed:When in search of the psychological evils generated by dysfunctional families, head for the toy cupboard. There is something particularly creepy about dolls’ eyes.Bears, real or stuffed, are the stuff of nightmares.There are many varieties of cat. All of them are killers.When stuck for a title, reach for the French dictionary.The HBO tradition of TV storytelling casts a long shadow.Modern gothic speaks in an American accent (even in a UK-only competition).There is nothing more frightening than a watery grave. Whole civilisatons have succumbed to them.When trying to express pure pain, look to the teeth.  There are no objects too commonplace to be cursed.Therapists are the modern stand-in for the omniscient narrator.All 20 finalists had something going for them, but in the end we wrestled it down to the following six, which are winging their way to Stephen King as I write. The winning entry will be printed on Guardian books in February.The finalists:The Bear Trap by Neil HudsonEau de Eric by Manuela SaragosaLa Mort de l’Amant by Stuart JohnstoneThe Spots by Paul Bassett DaviesThe Unpicking by Michael ButtonWild Swimming by Elodie HarperTo find out more about the competition and Stephen King, click here.
