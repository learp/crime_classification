“I’ll just pull up me trousers,” says Zayn Malik, yawning like a teenager dragged away from his Xbox as he settles down for his half-hour of power with Zane Lowe (Beats1). Trouser-talk might be enough to make a One Direction fan swoon, but Malik’s slightly shaky drawl suggests he’s not in the mood for revelations.Of course, Malik never wanted to be in One Direction – the music wasn’t his “cup of tea”. Perhaps he forgot to read the boyband job description. “The whole thing that got me through it was not realising what was going on,” he says of his five years in the band. “I just needed time to breathe.”He refused to dance back then. Now he refuses to throw out soundbites, only livening up to describe how producer Frank Ocean’s producer Malay works. “He does weird things,” he teases. “He told me he once put a condom over a microphone and put it in water.”Uncle Zane is an enthusiastic beast of an interviewer and he’s been on the receiving end of a Kanye rant or two, so a boybander should pose no problem. But he treads so carefully that at times it’s like eavesdropping on a teen who has been sent to see the cool teacher for a pre-GCSE pep talk.Fans were devastated by Malik’s exit from One Direction, but he makes it sound like packing in his Saturday job. “Yeah, I just left,” he reveals. “My dad weren’t too impressed.”Lowe refuses to be beaten, which is admirable in the face of such faux rock’n’roll nonchalance. He keeps firing the questions and empathises where he can. How does he have a good time? “I don’t really go out much,” says Malik, not-very-intriguingly. “When I have fun I just hang around with a few people I know.” Right. But he’s in a relationship? “Er, yeah, we’re good friends, yeah.” That’s put model girlfriend Gigi Hadid firmly in the friend zone, and it’s a shame Lowe doesn’t give him a laddy punch on the arm and call him out on it.Like a man trying to get blood out of a bearded stone, Lowe pushes the boat out and asks Malik if he’ll consider playing One Direction songs now. They’re “very separate things”, apparently. As separate as being a pop star and having fun.
