The celebrated Northumbrian wood engraver Thomas Bewick walked this riverbank path many times, 250 years ago, on his way into Newcastle from his birthplace at Cherryburn. It must have provided inspiration for some of those exquisite little tailpieces that he produced for book chapter endings; cameos of fishermen, farmers, miners and boatmen going about their daily work, vignettes of children roaming the countryside. Had he been walking here with us this afternoon, his subject matter might have included rowers, cyclists, joggers, parents with infants in buggies, golfers and wildlife watchers, all enjoying their autumn afternoon leisure.Over the intervening centuries the daily patterns of people's lives have been transformed, but there is still much in the natural surroundings along these wooded banks of the Tyne that Bewick would find familiar. His eye for detail would not have missed herons fishing in the river, the expanding ripples from salmon making their way upstream to spawn, honey fungus toadstools sprouting from tree trunks and a raucous jay on the path ahead, searching for acorns. And I'd like to think that he might have enjoyed the sight of the brightly coloured shield bugs that we found on one of the silver birches.The mother birch shield bug, her body outline taking the form of a miniature heraldic shield emblazoned with green, red and gold, was feeding alongside her progeny on the tree's brittle catkins of ripening seeds. She moved with the awkward, stiff-legged gait of a knight in armour. Her brood of nymphs, which will need to complete two more moults to adulthood quickly now that colder, more seasonal autumn weather has arrived, were much livelier, shimmying from leg to leg like fractious infants. But their most endearing feature was the pattern of their abdominal markings, bearing a strong resemblance to a smiling face. These cute insect emoticons and their ponderous mother may have provided just the kind of counterpoint between impudence and dignity that appealed to the master engraver as subjects for one of his delightful little cameos. @seymourdaily
