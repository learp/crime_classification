Caravanner of the Year8pm, BBC2Caravanning is often thought of as the preserve of eccentrics, a preconception this contest hasn’t exactly dispelled. Tonight’s final features a variety of challenges for our three remaining couples, David and Ann (experienced), Keith and Angela (meticulous) and John and Jenny (cuddly toys). Obviously, the joy comes from watching these larger-than-life sixtysomethings taking part. Or, in the case of super-keen semi-finalist David – knocked out but still hanging around – not doing so. John RobinsonMary Beard’s Ultimate Rome: Empire Without Limit9pm, BBC2Classicist Mary Beard covers a lot of ground (literally) in the first of this four-part look at the extraordinary rise and fall of the Roman empire. Tonight, she explores the founding myth of the city (Romulus and Remus raised by wolves etc), as well as showing how Rome’s dominance grew by dint of a combination of improvisation and ambition. From there, it’s on to the annihilation of Carthage, and then to the life and times of Julius Caesar, arguably the most famous Roman of them all. David StubbsScott & Bailey9pm, ITVThe last instalment in a brief series of the superb detective drama. Manchester shivers under grey skies as the killer or killers unknown continue to stalk the streets and perhaps even acting detective inspector Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones) herself. Will she and Janet Scott (Lesley Sharp) manage to work out who is playing a sick game of tag with them before another victim is offed? With Jones and Sharp perfectly in tune as always, and a high-quality script for the duo to work from, three episodes is really too few. Julia Raeside24 Hours in Police Custody9pm, Channel 4There are echoes of the 2005 film Hard Candy in this week’s real-life scenario, which sees a pair of latter-day vigilantes posing as underage girls and reeling in would-be predators, before posting details of the entrapments online and demanding the men hand themselves in to the authorities. It’s up to Bedfordshire Police to determine whether or not the vigilantes are a help or a hindrance, and whether there’s enough evidence to build cases against the potential sex offenders. Ali Catterall12 Monkeys9pm, SyfyThe season two premiere of the brilliantly convoluted US TV adaptation of the Terry Gilliam film, itself a reimagining of 60s French sci-fi film La Jetée. The action begins three months after the end of season one, with Cole and Ramse aiming to evade the cultish Army of the 12 Monkeys and potentially patch up their friendship in the face of virus-based apocalypse. Meanwhile, Railly and Jones are protecting the planet over in 2043, and Jennifer makes an erratic return. Hannah J DaviesNormal for Norfolk10pm, BBC2Another visit to Norfolk’s eccentric agriculturalist Desmond MacCarthy, fighting to keep creditors from the door of his manor house. With sights on kickstarting his own version of Glastonbury, Desmond invites a bluegrass band to play in one of his barns, neatly sidestepping the fact that Eavis and co generally throw bigger bashes. There’s also a more traditionally English function, with a garden party to celebrate the 100th birthday of family matriarch Chloe. Mark Gibbings-JonesThe Force: Manchester10pm, Sky1Series following the Greater Manchester police as they go about their business. This week, the force discover a hi-tech cannabis farm, pursue a stolen van and discuss the best place to get a butty. There’s also a look at the dog team, where a new German shepherd faces its first day on the job and gets its teeth into a criminal. It’s all done with a dash of workaday humour and an obligatory burst of Happy Mondays where needed. Call the cops, indeed. Hannah VerdierFilm choiceThe History Boys (Nicholas Hytner, 2006) 9pm, BBC4Alan Bennett’s hugely popular play about Sheffield schoolboys aiming for Oxbridge gets a respectful big-screen treatment from Hytner, using the original cast and letting the wise and witty words do the work. The lovely Richard Griffiths’s idealistic, repressed gay history teacher is the biggest act among many astute performances. Paul HowlettBlue is the Warmest Colour (Abdellatif Kechiche, 2013) Wed, 11.10pm, Film4This Palme d’Or-winning love story from the French-Tunisian director Abdellatif Kechiche is an astonishingly intense portrait of youthful passion, and much of that is down to the luminous performances of his two young stars. Adèle Exarchopoulos is thoughtful high-school girl Adèle, who becomes fascinated with the more mature art student Emma (Léa Seydoux). Their ardent relationship, from initial, breathless longing all the way through to tearful, snotty misery, is laid bare on the screen. A deeply touching, very special romance.
