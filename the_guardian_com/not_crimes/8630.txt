1 PixxDespite the 90s nostalgia and very short fringe, 21-year-old Hannah Rodgers doesn’t produce self-indulgent hipster music. Since graduating from the Brit school, she has channelled the spirit of bands such as Dubstar and Portishead into diaphanous, left-of-centre tunes that are also earwormy enough to make her pop-factory alma mater proud. The Great Escape, Brighton, 18 May2 Angel OlsenLast autumn, alternative country star Olsen returned in a blaze of attitude, grungy guitars and silver tinsel wigs. Her third album My Woman saw her beef up her accomplished Americana while maintaining the melancholy. Catch her soft-centred rock schtick on this nationwide tour. Rock City, Nottingham, 18 May; Vicar Street, Dublin, 19 May; touring to 24 May3 SigridThe success of pop high priestess Robyn seems to have produced a whole generation of Scandi pop star wannabes, but Norway’s Sigrid has managed to single herself out from the slew with her debut single Don’t Kill My Vibe, an irresistible blast of thwacking drums, ghostly vocal effects and indignant womanhood. Manchester, 15 May; London, 17 May; Brighton, 18-19 May4 Ariana GrandeWith last year’s Side to Side focusing on the neglected topic of not being able to walk properly after sex, the doughnut-licking pop force’s output has become increasingly smut-obsessed as she has approached her mid-20s. Expect things to get heated as Grande prances over the pond for an arena tour. Genting Arena, Birmingham, 18 May; touring to 26 May5 Sad13This side-project by Sadie Dupuis of grunge band Speedy Ortiz skewers pop music by replicating its syrupy euphoria but replacing the lyrics with thoughts on consent and sexism. The result is uplifting in more ways than one. The Crofters Rights, Bristol, 17 May; The Boileroom, Guildford, 18 May; touring to 25 May
