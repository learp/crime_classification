The ACT chief minister has officially launched Uber in Canberra, calling it “a real step forward for on-demand transport” in the city.The ACT is the first jurisdiction in Australia to have passed legislation regulating app-based taxi services, allowing the likes of Uber, OnTap and GoCatch to operate under strict conditions and government oversight.Andrew Barr said he had used Uber, which now operates in almost 60 countries, numerous times in its unregulated form. “I must confess,” he said, after having the door to a silver Toyota opened for him, “I have used it in Sydney and Melbourne, and in San Francisco and Washington on a recent trip.”Bill Shorten reveals Labor's plans for sharing services such as Uber and Airbnb Drivers in the ACT have to pass criminal and driving history checks, ensure proper insurance coverage and have their vehicles tested for roadworthiness.Taxi operators have accused Uber of taking their business while not having to pay the same fees or meet the same standards as licensed cabs.The ACT government has tried to appease them by immediately dropping the annual fee to lease a government-owned taxi licence from $20,000 to $10,000 and from $4,600 to $100 for hire cars.The $350 annual operator accreditation fee has also been scrapped.Uber’s general manager for Australia-New Zealand, David Rohrsheim, said trips would typically be 20% to 30% cheaper than in taxis, depending on demand.“But a lot of people choose it because it’s a better experience – press a button, get a ride; that’s something that’s unfamiliar for a lot of people in Canberra right now,” he said.More than 100 drivers were ready to go from day one, including Peter Mackay.The 57-year-old retired public servant worked as a cab driver for five years but decided to join Uber because it gave him more flexibility, he said.“This is something I can do part-time, whenever I feel like it or whenever there’s a need for it,” Mackay said.“It’ll give me that satisfaction of getting people to where they want, which was always the thing I enjoyed most out of driving a taxi – feeling like I was doing something useful.“The only problem there is the wife says, ‘Why can’t you be like that around the house?’”Registration took a few months and involved a lot of paperwork and some meetings, but he respected the process, Mackay said.
