The US secretary of state, John Kerry, is about to make what may be the biggest decision on global climate policy of his term. The verdict on whether to approve or reject the Keystone XL pipeline, from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, could, at one stroke, confirm or condemn US prospects for climate leadership. This is a policy decision that will have truly global significance. Keystone has been called the "fuse to the biggest carbon bomb on the planet". According to experts, it would end any hope of the US meeting existing international commitments to cutting emissions by 17% by 2020, let alone forge new action.We call on Mr Kerry to reject the Keystone XL pipeline and open up a pathway to a clean and sustainable energy future. We are not alone. As of today, more than 1.5 million people from the US and across the world have submitted formal comments and are standing with us, responding to Kerry's call made in Jakarta for individuals and governments to turn up and fight climate change. Keystone XL is his chance to set a correction course on US energy policy and open up a new clean energy future. We hope he does.
