As William Shakespeare famously put it: “What’s in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet”. But, despite these words of wisdom, for many people names really do matter – especially when deciding what to call your child. What if you get it wrong?Many new parents end up with what has been dubbed “baby name remorse”, according to a new Mumsnet survey. The survey found that 18% of parents regret the name they chose for their offspring, although only 2% have actually changed their child’s name.Do you regret the name you gave your child?
