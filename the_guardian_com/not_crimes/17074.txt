BBC director general Tony Hall is expected to give an update on the issue of bullying at the BBC when he unveils the corporation’s annual report.In the wake of Dame Janet Smith’s report into the failings at the BBC that allowed Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall to sexually abuse nearly 100 people without detection for decades, the BBC has tried to address bullying and Smith’s conclusion that “an atmosphere of fear still exists today in the BBC possibly because obtaining work in the BBC is highly competitive and many people no longer have the security of an employment contract”.It is understood that the number of cases reported during the past year has fallen by around half compared with two years ago, and that Hall will talk about steps the BBC is making to try to reduce the figures further. Hall will use the Tom Hiddleston drama The Night Manager and Mary Berry cookery show The Great British Bake Off as evidence of BBC success when he unveils the corporation’s annual report on Tuesday.The annual report comes a year after the BBC was saddled with the £700m-plus cost of funding free TV licence fees for the over-75s in its controversial funding deal with the government.The report is due to reveal the head count at the BBC, which despite cost-cutting and the efficiencies that have been made during the £700m Delivering Quality First savings programme, has fallen by less than 150 since last year, according to sources. The BBC will say that it has cut one in 10 senior managers, with the total reduced to 356 from 401 last year and 640 in 2009. The senior management bill has been reduced by £5m and is down 40% since 2009, while talent pay has been cut by £8m to less than £200m.The amount of money it spends on its biggest earning stars has been cut by more than £2m following the departure of some of its most familiar faces, including former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson.

Worldwide is thought to usually make about £50m a year from its most lucrative show, Top Gear. It is not known how much impact Clarkson’s departure in 2015 has had on worldwide sales of the car series and on merchandising.The BBC has declared itself broadly happy with the government’s white paper on its future published in May, before the renewal of its royal charter at the end of the year. But critical details, including the make-up of the corporation’s unitary board, which will absorb some of the responsibilities of the BBC Trust, are still to be agreed, with concerns about the impact of government-imposed appointees on its independence.A BBC source said: “Programmes like The Night Manager and War and Peace have shown the BBC at its creative best over the past year and by cutting senior managers and back-office costs we have been able to focus more of our money on the things which really matter to the public.“There are still tough financial challenges ahead, so the search for savings is not over, but the progress we have made will help us create a BBC fit for the digital age, which continues to act as a creative beacon to the world.”Last week the BBC named finance chief Anne Bulford as deputy director general in a senior staff restructure that will reduce the corporation’s top executive team by almost a third, from 16 members to 11. The appointment of Bulford marked the first time the corporation has had a deputy director general since the departure of Mark Byford in 2011.
