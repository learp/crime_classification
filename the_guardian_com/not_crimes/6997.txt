What is it? According to the Victorian language of flowers, wallflowers represent faithfulness, which is odd, really, because many wallflowers are anything but. Wallflowers are classed as short-lived perennials, but many will pop their clogs after a year or two, which isn’t great for the low-maintenance garden. Time was when ‘Bowles’s Mauve’ was the only reliably perennial wallflower, but breeders have expanded the options considerably. Choose the right one and you’ll have cheery flowers from March to July (often longer).Any good varieties? The ultra-reliable Erysimum ‘Bowles’s Mauve’ is still a fine choice, but to match the delightful scent of the shorter-lived wallflowers, you need the reddish-purple ‘Red Jep’, or ‘Winter Orchid’, whose petals start burnt-orange and mature to purple; the bright orange ‘Apricot Twist’ and pure white ‘Rysi Moon’ are worth a look, too.Plant it with? Lime-green euphorbias and tulips in whichever brash shade you prefer make perfect bedfellows.And where? Sun or partial shade in a sheltered spot; in colder climes, offer them some winter protection.Any drawbacks? Even the perennial types will begin to look leggy after a few years. Trim after flowering and take cuttings in spring to make more.What else can it do? Bees and butterflies can’t get enough of them.
