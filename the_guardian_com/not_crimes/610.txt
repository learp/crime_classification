I first met Caroline at a reception for the Royal Television Society. I’d been nominated for something, and there was a buffet laid on and my wife said, “Get us a sandwich” or whatever. So I went over and I bumped into this young woman and she looked at me and went, “Oh, you’re my dad, aren’t you?” And I went back to my wife and said, “That poor girl, she thinks I’m her dad.” She was tremendous. She made a laugh out of everything The next day I got a phone call to go to Granada for a read-through for The Royle Family and it was Caroline. So she’d obviously made her mind up then. I didn’t know much about her real dad, Jim [who was the inspiration for Tomlinson’s character]; she’d just say, “Jim’s a bit of a skinflint, a bit of a lazy old sod.”But I know her mum very well. Her mother is basically Mrs Merton. She’s a bloody corker! If we were working, we’d have our lunch at midday and she’d always pop by: “Just passing!” she’d say. And I used to say, “Are you just passing every day when it’s lunchtime?”Caroline was tremendous at studying people and she could make a laugh out of everything. She had this incredible, incredible sense of humour.Caroline was generous, and she was generous all the time. The Royle Family was one of those shows where you couldn’t wait to get up in the morning to go to work. And you’d work all week, and every Friday, as you knocked off, everyone got a Lottery ticket.'She was fearless': in praise of Caroline Aherne Also, of a Friday, she’d have a table set up: I don’t drink at all now but in those days I used to drink mild beer, and she’d have half a dozen cans of Sainsbury’s mild for me, cans of lager for the grips and the cameramen and people like that, and a couple of bottles of wine. On TV shows, it’s always an us-and-them sort of thing, but it wasn’t like that on The Royle Family. It was us, all of us.You hear about the dark turns she used to have; I never knew anything about that side. But I did feel that she didn’t enjoy the success and the fame that came with The Royle Family. She’d rather have gone out and gone shopping or whatever without anyone knowing her. She just wanted to be one of the crowd.And we never knew that she was as ill as she was, the pain that she’d been through. She never told anyone. I know when people are dead, people eulogise about them and they say this, that and the other… but I couldn’t put into words what a lovely person she was.I honestly don’t know what’s going to take the place of The Royle Family. I live in Liverpool, and if I’m out today for a couple of hours in town, I’ll bet a minimum of 50 people – be it taxi drivers, bus drivers, kids in the school playground – they’ll shout, “My arse, Jim, my arse.” That’s every day, it’s never gone away. I look back to the days when I was on building sites getting soaking wet and working my socks off for a pittance, and to have got into this game by default, I just think it’s amazing.

Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockPeople always ask me what was my favourite scene from The Royle Family. And Caroline was very generous with me, she gave me all the best lines. But it wasn’t a funny thing I remember, it was the scene in a Christmas special in the bathroom when she’s having the baby. I didn’t know then that Caroline couldn’t have children, but my daughter Katie was born on Christmas Day and it brought all those emotions back. So they were real tears she was crying and they were real tears I was crying, and when we looked up at the director of photography, he was crying as well.He said, “I’ve been a cameraman for 20-odd years… that’s the first time in my life I cried filming a scene.” Normally you do two or three takes, but he said, “One take. We’ll never capture that moment again.” So I cherish that little thing.
