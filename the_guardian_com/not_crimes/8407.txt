A special delivery arrived one night beside our front doorstep. I didn't take it in or even pick it up, but reached for a twig and turned it over and back again. A month later, it is still there, a little shrivelled and broken by alternate spells of sun and rain. There is no question that it is a hedgehog dropping, the size of a child's pinkie, studded with beetle shells; some are shiny black gemstones, others larger and finely ridged. One drops off at the prod of a stick and falls on its back, matt side up. Dislodged and out of context it has lost its beetleness, and bears more of a resemblance to a sunflower seed husk. It is the naturalist's hobby to break open animal droppings. This one has very few beetle shells – perhaps its depositor found a bowl full of cat food or surfeited on slugs.Of the hedgehog, I've seen nothing. A single dropping is the sum total of this summer and autumn's offerings. The garden is littered with memories that are less than five years old – a path alongside the wood pile strewn with the hedgehog's calling cards, the water butt where a female defended her chastity by wedging her rear against it to fend off a persistent suitor, the pond that was a habitual water hole. Dusk walks no longer turn up a familiar hump-backed shape lodged in a flower bed. And the roads are devoid of spiny flattened carcasses.Earlier this year, the hedgehog was voted the nation's favourite animal. Figures show that numbers nationwide have halved in 20 years – we are loving it towards extinction. Maybe the phrase "fragmentation of habitat" explains the sudden collapse in this neighbourhood – too many paved front gardens starving them of earth, too many concrete-shuttered fences excluding the creature we all want but do our best to exclude.This morning I dug a tunnel under next door's new fence to let hedgehogs in and out. Sunlight broke through from the other side. Maybe it was a symbol of hope. I'll just keep watching.
