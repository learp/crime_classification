Health-wise, I’ve had the kind of bad week when it’s an effort just to turn on the TV set and go looking for David Attenborough. Finally I found him. He was at his best, miles up a Himalaya and giving us a blow-by-blow of the snow leopards screwing each other.I wonder if he has the same priorities as I. Does he look at the schedule and say, “Thank Christ it’s the snow leopards again next week. If I had to provide another running commentary on those death-pale bivalve slow worms having it off in the mud of the Amazon, I’d flip my lid”?But, apart from his unflagging curiosity, Attenborough differs from me mainly in being the kind of perpetual energy source who can get a week’s work done no matter what. Parachute him into the High Andes, and he lands all set to track the emerald-bottomed lemur or whatever. (The male emerald-bottomed lemur is the one who clears a whole acre of jungle so the female will be able to see nothing except his oscillating rear end when he goes into his display, which keeps Attenborough gasping with fascination even when it is not successful: “But no, with a threatening snarl, she makes it clear that she is in search of a male who looks more like Harrison Ford.”) Whereas I have spent a whole fortnight almost too shagged to reach the hospital and, once there, entirely too shagged to leave.Planet Earth II review: Attenborough’s rollercoaster wildlife tour returns This time, I had two plastic surgeons and a nurse all working on a series of linked craters in my scalp. In the Cambridge area, a set of roadworks that big can stop traffic for months, but this was a minor event, and after a few hours I was sent home with strict instructions to pick up a box of a specific antibiotic pill on the way to the taxi rank. No other kind of antibiotic pill would do. It had to be the one written down on this piece of paper, in a mixture of Klingon and ancient Greek. Guess what I forgot to do.Instead, I walked into a wall, and for the next couple of days I wasn’t sure which day it was, except for a vague impression that if I switched on the TV at the right time in the evening, I would see a small female ape with a green bottom doing a lap dance for David Attenborough, or perhaps vice versa.Actually, I was out by miles and saw, instead, a whole episode of the Aussie police series Deep Water, in which the most beautiful female cop on Earth kept finding bodies at Bondi. They had been thrown among the foaming rocks. I knew just how they felt.
