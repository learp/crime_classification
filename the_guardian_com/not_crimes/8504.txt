It was in the early 1960s that I first heard Frankie Valli sing with the Four Seasons. Even then, it seemed amazing that the boyish falsetto that pierced the static around Radio Luxembourg could emanate from this man in his 30s. Valli is in his 80s now, and still apparently up to the job of hitting the high notes on Sherry and December 63 (Oh, What A Night) as he headlines the annual Proms In The Park (Saturday, 5pm, Radio 2) above the cast of Matilda, the Feeling, ABC, All Saints, Alfie Boe and James Galway. The following day, Radio 2 Live In Hyde Park (Sunday, 1.30pm, Radio 2) features Elton John, Madness, Status Quo, Gregory Porter, LeAnn Rimes and Travis, all drawn into the open either by the promise of huge performance fees or the hope of getting their latest single on the station’s playlist.Tinker, tailor, writer, spy: the many lives of John le Carré, in his own words The Pigeon Tunnel (Weekdays, 9.45am, Radio 4) is a title John le Carré has temporarily attached to most of his novels over the last 60 years. Now he’s finally landed it on his recollections of the writing life, and every morning this week he delivers some of its jewels with the unhurried assurance of the practised anecdotalist. His prose is spare, his speaking voice always seemingly on the edge of sadness and – since they feature the likes of Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Lindsay Anderson, Martin Ritt, Alec Guinness and Dennis Healey – his stories are likely better than anyone else’s you’ll be hearing on the radio this week.On 11 May 1985, a fire broke out below a stand at Bradford City’s Valley Parade in the middle of an end-of-season game. The club had just been promoted, so attendance was greater than usual. This fire claimed the lives of 56 people and haunted those who survived. The 56 (Wednesday, 2.15pm, Radio 4) is an example of verbatim theatre put together from the memories of survivors. It was written by Matt Woodhead and Gemma Wilson and produced with the help of Sheffield’s FYSA theatre company. It sounds like a documentary with real Yorkshire voices, which is only right.I’m sure you’ve marked next October on your calendar as the centenary of the Russian Revolution. In the runup to that event, radio drama will be doing the lives of all the major Russian leaders in Tsar (Sunday, 3pm, Radio 4), starting with Ivan The Terrible and winding up with Vladimir Putin, who clearly has no intention of being succeeded. Mike Walker, who’s done all your English kings, has written this first one, which stars David Threlfall as Ivan IV.The excellent adaptation of George Gissing’s New Grub Street (Saturday, 9pm, Radio 4) by Ed Reardon’s Week creator Christopher Douglas first broadcast a couple of weeks ago but episode one is still available on the iPlayer. I commend to you Emily Pithon – who plays Gissing’s much put-upon girlfriend Edith – as the funniest comic voice of the moment.
