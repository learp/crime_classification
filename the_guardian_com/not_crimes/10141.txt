Morrissey has accused the royal family of hypocrisy after Prince Charles and Prince William went on a hunting trip in Spain a day before issuing a plea for wildlife protection.  Calling the Prince a “thickwit” and labelling the monarchy “a colossal embarrassment” to the UK, the blogpost is entitled “This story is old, I know, but it goes on” and was posted on his fansite True to You.  Although William’s speech (no doubt written by his publicity aides at Clarence House) will concentrate on endangered species, William is too thickwit to realise that animals such as tigers and rhino are only driven to near-extinction because people who are precisely like himself and his brother have shot them off the map – all in the name of sport and slaughter.Whenever you shoot an animal in the head the outcome is usually the same: death. Just why William kills innocent and defenceless deer does not matter – the fact is, he does it, and we must go on and on asking why any form of violence is acceptable to the British establishment.Morrissey suggested that endangered species are dying out purely because of “people like William and Harry”. The blogpost was written after the Duke of Cambridge and his father, Prince Charles, recorded a video message calling on the public to save endangered animals like rhinos, elephants and tigers. The Sun reports that the Princes flew to Spain the day before giving the plea, where they hunted wild boar on a private estate. Morrissey finished his blogpost by saying: “We can only pray to God that their hunting guns backfire in their faces.”In a piece written last November titled “The world won’t listen”, Morrissey – a longstanding critic of the monarchy – criticised its elevated role in society. “We are continually told (warned?) that we love the ‘royals’ whatever their conduct, and we see very clearly how this most dysfunctional family must – at all costs – leave a virtuous emblem on the age, as we also see how no British citizens (for we are not subjects) can be considered qualified enough to question the ‘royals’ – or to even be allowed to ask why it is thought necessary to have a monarchy in the first place – especially as most countries throughout the world exist quite well without royal boils …”
