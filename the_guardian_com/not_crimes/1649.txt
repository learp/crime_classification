I was always a passionate cook but often couldn’t find some of the ingredients listed in books,” says Nicola Lando, whose solution was to create Sous Chef, an online destination for serious food lovers, in 2012 with her husband, Nick Carter.Browsing the website is like walking the aisles of the world’s supermarkets. Lando is currently keen on Forvm chardonnay vinegar (£14.95), a boost to salad dressings that she discovered via revered American chef Thomas Keller’s cookbooks. Then there’s shredded jelly fish (£2.50) used by the authority on Chinese cooking, Fuchsia Dunlop, and all things bibimbap, including the gochujang paste essential to the Korean dish and the correct stone bowls to serve it in. “What’s becoming trendy in Korea or Japan – those are kind of things our customers might be interested in.”Lando looks after the buying and marketing while her husband runs the operations side. Before Sous Chef, they both worked in finance, Lando leaving in 2010 with an idea to start her own food business. Exactly what kind of food business was shaped by three months she spent working as a trainee chef at Gauthier Soho, for research (“for the first month I was mostly dicing aubergines, grating parmesan, and trimming asparagus”).Lando was intrigued by the ingredients and tools chefs had at their disposal. “I saw beautiful vinegars, pistachio pastes, things like ice cream stabilisers which give that extra mouthfeel to make something very smooth. All these things I couldn’t find to cook with at home.”Hence you’ll find Sous Chef’s ice-cream stabiliser in the section marked “modernist and molecular”, alongside spherification spoons, and chef’s plating tweezers. But you don’t have to dream of becoming Heston Blumenthal to shop on the site: merely adventurous cooks will find plenty to love in Sous Chef’s bundling together of books and their key ingredients, including the winner of this year’s OFM Award for Best New Cookbook, Our Korean Kitchen by Jordan Bourke and Rejina Pyo.Lando aims to build the business steadily, slowly broadening its range. The existing stock is stored in a warehouse in north London, filled with about 3,000 products. “It’s like a massive store cupboard,” says Lando. And it’s all just a click away.
