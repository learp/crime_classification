Another week of The Bachelor, another two hours of watching survivors of the zombie apocalypse behave as if they are meeting another human being for the very first time.OK, that is not entirely fair. This week, on some especially windy island in the Bahamas, Ben went on a date with Caila the software rep – their second! – which was almost normal. Almost, except for the part where Ben decided he needed to “penetrate” Caila’s “bubbly” surface and find out how she feels deep down.Really, who cares? Does Caila even know? Does anyone know how to explain their pain in a meaningful way on an early date? It was clear from the ensuing conversation that neither Ben nor Caila understood what the point of this emotional exercise was.Far from being ready to get married, and nearly halfway through his season, Ben is only now figuring out how to have a discussion with a woman. He is only just learning how to broach intimacy that is still casual. He is still discovering women and how they feel. He might want to work on that for a while.Because Ben was not at all prepared for what came next. Next was a group date that involved swimming with pigs, which of course was awkward, and all day long Ben the bachelor was managing ornery bachelorettes. The mess that followed convinces me that I only watch The Bachelor to be amazed to see that, yes, some people just never learn.The aggrieved Leah, an event planner from somewhere or other, had not yet been invited on a one-on-one date with Ben. On Monday night’s episode, she started getting teary around the house about “never getting any time”. On and on she went about that to whomever would listen.Leah cried while feeding chicken hotdogs to some very demanding pigs. She cried to Ben on the beach. Ben asked her to make the most of the the day. She found this dismissive. Viewers likely agreed. Viewers likely saw why.When being weepy did not make Leah popular – surprise! – she decided instead to tell Ben that Lauren B, his absolute favorite girl in the house, is hated by the other women. Leah told Ben that Lauren B is different with them than she is with him.No, Ben you don’t really know the real Lauren B. Who is this girl you are falling for?Of course, no one hates Lauren B. She is a simple girl. She serves cocktails a mile into the sky to grumpy passengers: Lauren B is nice. When Ben asks Lauren B about the conversation, she is stunned. She goes back to the women and cries. Leah pretends to have no idea how this has happened. Leah decides to be brash and rash. After Ben retires for the night, she goes to see him in his hotel room. She is going to completely alienate him from Lauren B. That way, she will be gone, and Ben will have room in his heart for Leah. Yes, that is the plan. Now, understand, Ben is easy. He is happy to see Leah when she knocks on the door. He invites her in, pours her a glass of red wine. He is thinking she wants to hang out and chat. Ben likes these women. He is into this. Of course he is. So he is expecting to banter, and inevitably talk about feelings, because that’s what they do.Instead Leah goes on and on about how awful Lauren B is and how wrong for him she is.All Leah wants to do is talk about Lauren B. The conversation gets quite involved. Ben listens for a short while, and then tells Leah that their situation is not working out. They had a spark, but instead of pursuing that, she is talking to him about someone else.So Leah, shocked, goes to her room, and packs her bags.Somehow this result did not seem obvious to her.This cannot be the first time Leah has tried to sabotage someone and had the results turn on her, as they usually do when the manipulator is not a master. This kind of obvious ploy is low-level stuff.Of course, as stupid as Leah was, at least she is not delusional like Olivia, the news anchor from Austin who has been sure she is a sure thing all along.There must be blogs devoted to hating Olivia. Also there must be many who love her, and her mad confidence. Well, she calls it confidence. I’d say that Olivia has quite an imagination. She believes that the love she shares with Ben is “all-consuming” and “ever-present”. She has been certain that things are moving forward fast between them from the beginning. It is hard to say why Olivia thinks this besides that she likes to.Mostly, there is no harm in thinking whatever crazy thing you wish – we have no thought crimes in this country. But Olivia actually drives the other women crazy with her beliefs. Her convictions annoy them. She is one of those people. Her delusions of grandeur demoralize others, and they turn on her. Even Ben sees that something is not right.The last date of the night is a twosome with Ben. Olivia and Emily go to a deserted beach with him. The whole point is that one will get a rose and the other will go home. Both twins are very sweet and sheltered – they have never eaten vegetables, which I imagine could happen if you survive the zombie apocalypse in Las Vegas. In any case, there is no way that Ben would be mean to one of the twins in front of Olivia. So it was obvious that Olivia, who was so sure he was about to propose, had to go. It was obvious Olivia had to go because she is awful. That can’t last long on The Bachelor. If no one likes you, you are done.Indeed, they left Olivia on the deserted island, never to be heard from again. Maybe someday, we’ll see her on the evening news.
