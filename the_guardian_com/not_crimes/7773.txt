The NHS should train medical professionals to support people with autism so that patients do not feel they get inadequate treatment, an inquiry has found.The Westminster commission on autism called on the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to remind clinical commissioning groups of the obligations to ensure staff have the skills to support autistic people.An estimated 700,000 people have the condition in the UK and the Autism Act should guarantee them awareness in the health service, the study says.Barry Sheerman, the MP for Huddersfield who founded the inquiry and has a grandson with autism, said: “Our health professionals are committed and wellintentioned. However, despite the Autism Act, many still have had no autism training whatsoever nor are supported in consulting with autistic patients. This must change now.”He also called for annual health checks and for NHS England to appoint a national clinical director for autism.The commission’s study, published in parliament on Monday, included a survey of almost 900 autistic people, parents and professionals. Nearly three-quarters of respondents felt people with autism received worse or much worse treatment than others.'If you don't talk, it doesn't work': how sport can help autistic people A similar number said medics rarely or never understand autism and its effects on physical and mental health and 70% of respondents cited training as the top priority to improve access to healthcare.Craig Kennady, a commission member with autism, said he left A&E while experiencing breathing difficulties because a misunderstanding with a nurse left him distressed.The 32-year-old from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, said: “Every minute that passed by I had flashes of losing my life and not being able to support my wife and my children.”The UK does not have mortality figures for people with autism but a study in Sweden suggests their life expectancy there is 16 years shorter.The report also calls for GPs to report when they have a patient with autism so they can be added to an anonymous national register, which could be used to calculate UK mortality statistics.A Department of Health spokesman said it has been working with the Royal College of General Practitioners to improve GPs’ understanding of autism.He said: “We have made monumental strides towards improving the lives of people with autism in this country and are determined to make further progress. We are working alongside people with autism, and their carers, to make sure they have access to healthcare with adjustments made for their conditions.”
