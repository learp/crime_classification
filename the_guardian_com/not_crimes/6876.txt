From the age of 11 I found myself sequestered in a boarding school in Peterborough. My parents had gone off to work in the Far East for three years and I was left in England to continue my education. Lucky old me! The school was absolutely frightful. Here they turned boys into men on a rigid diet of hard exercise and corporal punishment. To say that I hated the place would be an understatement. I longed to escape.What are the best Scottish children's books? My only way of doing so was to find a good book in the school library and lose myself in it. A book, after all, is a passport to anywhere in the world. Robert Louis Stevenson was an early discovery. I read Kidnapped first and was thrilled by the opening chapter. The young hero’s grim circumstances seemed to mirror my own predicament. And then of course, there was Treasure Island, that seminal yarn from which we have learned everything we know (or think we know) about pirates. Years later, when I was looking for a plot for the third and final part of my Edinburgh trilogy (which I wrote as Philip Caveney), it was inevitable that I would turn to Robert Louis Stevenson for inspiration.Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson - review In One For Sorrow, my time-travelling hero Tom Afflick finds himself in Edinburgh in 1881. There he meets the mysterious and rather sickly “Lou” who has fallen down in an alleyway. Tom helps him back to his house where his American wife Fran and his stepson Lloyd are waiting for him.

When questioned about his future plans, Lou states he has no intention of taking the story any further. Tom realises he is going to have to use all his powers of persuasion in order to make a book of the story a reality. At one point, he realises that Lou has actually dedicated Treasure Island to him – in another, a T-shirt that Tom is wearing inadvertently gives Lou the idea for Jekyll and Hyde!More recently, Robert Louis Stevenson has been an inspiration in a different way. When I thought that I wanted to write an old fashioned ghost story, something rather different to the works I’d already published, I decided to create my own “Mr Hyde”. Danny Weston is my evil twin, a man with a predilection for tales about vengeful ghosts and haunted ventriloquist dummies. The two of us have ended up as rivals. I take a rather dim view of him and he has been quite caustic when talking about me.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Danny’s debut novel, The Piper, tells the story of a couple of young evacuees sent out to Romney Marsh on the eve of world war two. It’s a grim and terrifying tale, one guaranteed to give the reader sleepless nights… and one that I think Robert Louis Stevenson would have thoroughly approved of.
