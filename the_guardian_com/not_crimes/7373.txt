Debatable 6pm, BBC2Panellists Ann Widdecombe, Russell Kane and Dan Walker debate the answer to questions before offering their majority view to a contestant to help them win a cash prize. While each celeb’s eagerness to showcase their knowledge ensures that panel chemistry is lacking, the literature, geography and art-focused questions encourage both intriguing and watchable debate. Amy WalkerBritain’s Hardest Workers: Inside the Low Wage Economy 7pm, BBC2In what presenter Anita Rani calls a “unique experiment” but others call “going to work”, 20 people are given low-paid jobs in various industries (hospitality, food production, etc). After every shift the least efficient worker is booted off. Oddly, the volunteers are low-paid workers in their real lives too, making the show a perverse watch. Grace RahmanMake My Body Better With Davina McCall 8pm, Channel 4Kirsty, 25, has suffered from night terrors for seven years. Enter Davina McCall and this series documenting radical approaches to health issues. For Kirsty, this means being challenged to scale a 100m cliff face and then bed down on a metre-wide canvas platform suspended above the Atlantic. Lest that seem too cruel to inflict on someone with a debilitating sleep disorder, Kirsty undergoes nine months of treatment first. Jonathan WrightRipper Street 9pm, BBC2 This fourth series has been on Amazon since January, and now fans of the Victorian plod drama – but not big enough fans to cough up for Amazon – can catch up. Reid (Matthew Macfadyen) is living a quiet life. Drake (Jerome Flynn) is in charge of H Division, and Jackson (Adam Rothenberg) is working on freeing Long Susan from chokey. Still gruesome, absurd and hugely enjoyable. Luke Holland500 Questions 9pm, ITVGiles Coren hosts a new gameshow with a simple premise: questions are propelled at a contestant until three consecutive answers prove incorrect, at which point they’re replaced. Repeat until question 50, where the incumbent collects the cash. This just about keeps things interesting. As for the title, it’s the number of questions posed over the series. Assuming no recommission, then? Mark Gibbings-JonesSarah Beeny’s Four Rooms 9pm, More4Return of the weirdly compelling show that splices Dragon’s Den with Deal or No Deal. Tonight’s offerings include a signed Winston Churchill book and a “damaged vase”. It’s all very polite on the surface but underneath it’s a brittle game of poker face. “I love your red blouse,” dealer Alex purrs at one lady. “I rather like your shoes,” she parries. And having “softened each other up”, they get down to the haggling. Ali CatterallTyrant 9pm, FoxCreated by Gideon Raff, Howard Gordon and Craig Wright – the key talent behind Homeland – this succession saga set in the volatile Middle Eastern country of Abuddin has failed to achieve comparable critical traction. Partly that’s because it feels like a glossy US soap exoticised by hot-button geopolitical window dressing. But the third series has just delivered a ballsy character death that has knocked the main players for six, suggesting some steel beneath the suds. Graeme VirtueFilm choiceTyrannosaur (Paddy Considine, 2011) 2.10am, Film4Paddy Considine’s feature debut rivals fellow actor Gary Oldman’s Nil By Mouth for bleak, unrelenting realism. It stars Peter Mullan (himself no bundle of laughs in the director’s chair) as Joseph, a rage-filled drunk who stumbles into a charity shop staffed by Olivia Colman’s Hannah, a middle-class woman with, it turns out, her own issues. An intelligent, gripping, superbly acted tale of domestic abuse.Live sportTest Cricket: West Indies v IndiaThe final day of the fourth Test from Queen’s Park Oval in Port of Spain, Trinidad. 2.55pm, Sky Sports 3Elite League Speedway: Swindon Robins v Poole PiratesCoverage of the latest meeting from the Abbey Stadium. 7.30pm, Sky Sports 2La Liga Football: Valencia v Las PalmasCoverage of the Spanish top-flight clash from the Mestalla. 9pm, Sky Sports 1
