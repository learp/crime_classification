Kesha’s performance at this Sunday’s Billboard music awards is back on after the singer re-obtained permission from her record label to appear. The label, Kemosabe Records, is run by record producer Dr Luke, who Kesha has accused of sexual assaulting her. The producer denies the claims.Kemosabe had initially granted Kesha permission to appear, but retracted it on Wednesday when, according to the label, it “learned Kesha was to use the performance as a platform to discuss the [pending] litigation”.She is currently suing Dr Luke, whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald, for sexual assault, battery, harassment and emotional distress.The label said that it had restored the approval after “assurances” that “neither Kesha nor her supporters will use the performance as a platform” to discuss the case. Kesha and the label are embroiled in a complicated legal battle happening in courts in both California and New York. Earlier this month a judge in New York denied Kesha’s request to be released from her record contract given the allegations against Gottwald, who has declared his innocence and said Kesha invented the sexual assault claims to get out of her contract.Kesha’s original charges against Gottwald in California have been paused by a judge, pending the outcome of his countersuit for defamation and breach of contract in New York.After Kemosabe’s decision to re-allow the performance, Kesha posted a picture to fans on Instagram with the caption “good work animals. 🏻looks like our voices can be heard after all”.The singer plans on performing a cover of Bob Dylan’s It Ain’t Me at Sunday’s Billboard awards.
