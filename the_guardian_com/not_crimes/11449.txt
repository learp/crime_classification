It is not surprising that small ports are being used to import goods and people illegally (Dispatch Norfolk, 4 June). Successive governments have cut customs staff due to their doctrinaire policies of reducing civil service staff numbers. Thirty years ago every small port had its own customs officer, and there also were coast preventive men who travelled around their local coastal area in blue mini cars, talking to harbour staff, local people, seafarers etc, gaining intelligence on unusual traffic. The key word is “preventive”; Coastwatch volunteers, however willing, are no substitute for a professional anti-smuggling force. If the government wishes to protect the UK border properly, it has to employ enough staff to do so.
