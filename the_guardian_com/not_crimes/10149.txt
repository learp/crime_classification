Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This novel was such an exciting read and was one that I couldn’t put down. The story was written from three different viewpoints, and although I struggled remembering whose view each one was, the different perspectives makes it much more exciting. You learn things that the other characters do not yet know which causes you to feel apprehensive of whether they will find out. By the end of the book I was so enticed that I read the second book straight after because I needed to know what happened next. Mary E. Pearson is an amazing writer and she writes so descriptively that you create the world in your head which makes you that much closer to the characters. I never usually like books that change perspective in each chapter, but she wrote it so that it worked completely with the story and made it that much more enjoyable. How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site? Mary wrote Lia not only as a strong female character but also as one that is strong-minded and takes her life into her own hands, instead of letting others tell her how she should live it. That is what makes this story not only one about romance but also self-discovery. With many twists and turns this novel didn’t have any boring moments. I would recommend this to any readers who not only like romance but also adventure and self-discovery novels. Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
