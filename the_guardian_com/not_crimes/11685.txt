The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), the normally conservative organisation that represents the six major Hollywood studios, has joined the chorus of protest against the travel ban ordered by US president Donald Trump.MPAA chairman Chris Dodd issued a statement saying that the organisation – which is a trade association, but also administers the US film ratings system – was “concerned about the impact of the executive order on individuals with legitimate personal and business relationships in the United States”.Dodd also raised concerns for film’s role in supporting freedom of expression: “Among those potentially affected are members of the creative community who cannot freely express themselves in their home country and come to the United States seeking the opportunity to communicate and enlighten. Our mission of storytelling brings people closer together and introduces us to new perspectives from all over the world. We firmly believe our country can both protect its national security and be a welcoming place for those who respect our values.”Dodd, who was Democratic senator for Connecticut from 1981 until 2011, has been MPAA head since leaving Congress, has spearheaded efforts to crack down on piracy and open the Chinese box office to American films.
