   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It's fair to say that there's never been a record like Björk's Biophilia. Released on Monday, it's available on CD or in other standard formats, but it is also appearing as a suite of apps for the iPhone and iPad. In fact, Björk sees this as a multimedia project "encompassing music, apps, internet, installations, and live shows". Earlier this year, she premiered her groundbreaking live concept at the Manchester international festival, describing her performance as a "meditation on the relationship between music, nature and technology."The title Biophilia is taken from a book by the naturalist Edward O Wilson, whose hypothesis that there is an instinctive bond between human beings and other living systems has proved increasingly influential in the fields of biology and evolutionary psychology. This is of a piece with Björk's long-standing interest in the way the world really works. "When I was a kid, my rock star was David Attenborough," she has said – and now she has the great man himself voicing the intro to Biophilia. So where did this interest spring from? Where does Björk think the planet is heading?Here's your chance to ask her, because Björk will be live on guardian.co.uk/music at 3pm on Monday 10 October to answer your questions.Worried that the music has been lost in the mix? In his glowing review of the album, Alexis Petridis writes "whether the app album becomes the industry standard or whether it's even a good idea for it to become an industry standard is up for debate … far less questionable is the quality of the music on Biophilia, which would underline how far apart from the rest of rock and pop Björk is, regardless of how it was delivered." But see what the singer herself thinks. In fact, she's asked us to say: "Ask me anything."Post your questions in the comments thread below, and at 3pm BST on Monday, Björk will be here to answer them.
