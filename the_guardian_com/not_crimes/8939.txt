While we recognise that there are some very serious issues around homelessness in Severn Beach, that your newspaper must rightly report (Wave goodbye to your support network, 5 April), and we are aware that, for pure commercial reasons, homeless people are being housed in a building in our community, that is not an excuse for painting a negative image of our village and the lovely people who make up our vibrant community.We have the lowest unemployment in the region, one of its best bakery shops and, right next to Ableton Court, a superb primary school, the village hall and children’s play area. Admittedly we don’t have a nightclub, or the glitz of the gambling casinos and pubs of Bristol, but we do have trains to Clifton and buses to Cribbs Causeway shopping centre.We are almost surrounded by countryside, and we are on the banks of the wonderful Severn Estuary, where we get some of the best sunsets in the country.Peter TyzackVice-chairman: Pilning & Severn Beach parish council, Gloucestershire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
