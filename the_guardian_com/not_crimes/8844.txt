Michael Caine has revealed his reasons for voting for Brexit, saying that the British public voted for “freedom” rather than as a result of racism or anxiety over immigration.Speaking to Sky News while promoting his new film Going in Style, the actor said that he was confident that Britain’s exit from the EU would be “all right”.“I voted for Brexit. What it is with me, I’d rather be a poor master than a rich servant,” he said. “It wasn’t about the racism, immigrants or anything, it was about freedom.”“Politics is always chaotic,” he added. “In politics, you’re always going into areas you’ve never been before, so you’re going to get lost and then you’re going to find your way, and then it’ll be all right.”Caine has been outspoken in his Euroscepticism before. In an interview with the BBC’s Nick Robinson four months before the EU referendum, he declared both leave and remain options “scary”, but seemed to express a preference for leaving the EU.

I think that, unless there are some extremely significant changes we should get out. I feel certain we should come out.”Going in Style stars Caine, Morgan Freeman and Alan Arkin as friends who decide to rob a bank after their pensions are cancelled. The film is a remake of the 1979 film of the same name that starred George Burns, Art Carney and Lee Strasberg and is released in cinemas tomorrow.
