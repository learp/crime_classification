The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is the sort of book that needs to be read by everyone as it is told through the eyes of autistic fifteen year old Christopher, and increases awareness of learning disorders to the reader.Christopher likes maths and science. He doesn’t like talking to people. He hits anyone who touches him. He has never left the end of the road on his own. Four red cars in a row makes it a good day, four yellow cars in a row makes it a bad day. He doesn’t talk to strangers. He doesn’t understand jokes and he doesn’t like people laughing at him. His life revolves around plans and lists and counting to calm himself down.Then his neighbour’s dog is murdered and he embarks on the mission of detective to find out who committed the crime; not realising what other mysteries he will uncover and how close to home the truth lies. The book keeps you turning page after page, desperate to find out the truth behind each lie uncovered, and desperate to understand more about a child’s mind plagued by autism.Slowly you learn that everything isn’t all that it seems in this story, and those that you trust may be those that betray. It is a book that must be read as it says so much about the topic of learning disorders, a topic that most books, like most people, don’t ever dare venture into. Perhaps whilst Christopher solves the problems in his own storyline, you’ll think about the problem of learning disorders amongst young people today.Who murdered Wellington, the dog next door? And what secrets are the four walls of Christopher’s house hiding? And what must it be like to live everyday of your life in battle with your own mind? Find out when you read this book; a book full of creativity and cliffhangers that keep you reading to the end with the constant theme of mystery running throughout. A wonderful book about family, secrets and learning disorders.Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read? Join the site and send us your review!
