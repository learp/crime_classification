Thanks everybody. Goodnight.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose11.03pm GMT23:03Right, hooray, we did it! As such, the timelines must now merge, and everything can happen at the same time again. It’s a shame, but hopefully we can all meet back here again one day and inexplicably choose to cover something that happened in the past in the present as it happens after it finished. We can dream, right?FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose10.58pm GMT22:58I’ve just checked Twitter for the first time since the ceremony started, and saw this:nick (@hlorrithi)@stuheritage Will you finally put up a picture of the damned tassel for those of us who'd rather eat brussel sprouts than watch the Baftas?February 12, 2017The answer is no.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose10.57pm GMT22:57Now it’s all over, here’s the big news takeaway of the night: La La Land won a lot of awards, but not as many awards as everyone thought.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose10.55pm GMT22:55That’s it. The end. Also some other films won awards OK BYE.Updatedat 10.55pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose10.54pm GMT22:54Things must be wrapping up now, because Stephen Fry is telling a story about something that someone else said a long time ago.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose10.53pm GMT22:53He keeps threatening to veer off into political commentary – “I’m an American...”, “I forgot my passport at the airport” - but doesn’t quite follow through. Instead, he’s sincere and awestruck and promises not to eBay the award.Updatedat 11.00pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose10.50pm GMT22:50Brooks thanks Harvey Weinstein “for having nothing to do with this award tonight” and apologises to Prince William for the American Revolution.

Way to go, La La Land.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose10.40pm GMT22:40La La Land wins. No surprises there. Perhaps it’s because the film has been the frontrunner for ages, the acceptance speech is almost sighed out. It’s deeply indifferent, even to the point that one of the producers accidentally said: “I hope this film inspires you to drink.”Updatedat 10.41pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose10.36pm GMT22:36Oh, that didn’t go on for very long.
