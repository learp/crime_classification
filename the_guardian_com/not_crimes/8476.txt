What is the Keystone XL?The Keystone XL project would expand an existing pipeline from the vast tar sands of Alberta to refineries in the US Midwest, nearly doubling the initial capacity and transporting crude oil deeper into America to refineries on the Gulf coast of Texas. Its proposed route would stretch about 1,660 miles, connecting Hardisty, Alberta to Port Arthur, Texas. It was first proposed in 2008, and was originally scheduled for completion in 2013.What makes it different from other pipelines?There are already about 2.3 million miles of pipeline across the US, carrying oil and natural gas. But the tar sands produce bitumen, which has a much higher carbon footprint than conventional oil. There are also concerns about safety, in addition to climate change. Tar sands oil is heavier and more corrosive than conventional oil; critics say that means a bigger risk of pipeline leaks.Why are people opposed to the pipeline?Some environmental groups are opposed to the pipeline because it will tie America even more deeply into a highly polluting source of energy. But there are growing concerns about pipeline leaks, and the safety record of the company behind the project, TransCanada. The first stage of Keystone had 14 accidents in its first year of operation. Protesters in Nebraska are also worried about the routing of the pipeline; it would cross the Ogallala Aquifer, an important source of irrigation and drinking water.What are arguments in favour of the pipeline?TransCanada and other energy companies, as well as some major trades unions, argue that the pipeline project would create as many as 20,000 construction jobs. They also argue that it would give the US economy access to oil from a friendly neighbour – or so-called ethical oil. But Canada is already the largest single supplier of oil to the US, followed by Mexico – both friendly countries and neighboursDoes the US economy really need all that oil?That's far from clear. Critics have noted that US oil consumption has been falling since 2007, and that a significant share of the oil would eventually be exported to Latin America and Europe.Why does it involve the State Department?The State Department is involved because the pipeline crosses an international border. Eight other government agencies are also required to sign off on the project, but the State Department has the final say.What will Canada do with the tar sands oil if the pipeline does not go through?The Canadian government has been lobbying hard for the project. But if the pipeline is not approved, there are no guarantees the oil will stay in the ground. Canadian officials have suggested they would be willing to ship to China. But the project to pipe crude across indigenous peoples' lands to Pacific coast ports already faces strong opposition.
