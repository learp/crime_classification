Black and Asian authors have welcomed an independent review of diversity in the Carnegie and Kate Greenaway medals, after an exceptional year for children’s books by minority authors failed to make an impact on the prize longlists.The review of the venerable children’s books awards – which are judged by school librarians – was announced on Wednesday by the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (Cilip). It is part of a wider diversity and equality action plan by Cilip, which runs the awards, to address the lack of diversity in the information sector.Carnegie and Kate Greenaway awards announce 2017 longlists Cilip chief executive Nick Poole said: “Recent concerns [over the Carnegie longlist] have shown that we need to articulate very clearly what we are doing to address the issues of equality and diversity.” He added that, although the association believed the decisions made about this year’s medal longlists were “appropriate” and reflected the existing criteria for selecting books, there may be a case for changing the criteria to protect the prize from unconscious bias.In January, Philip Pullman joined author protests when it emerged that the 20-strong longlist for the Carnegie was entirely white, despite a strong showing for writers of colour in other children’s book prizes. Alex Wheatle – who won the 2016 Guardian children’s fiction prize with Crongton Knights – and author Sunny Singh led a call for black, Asian and minority ethnic (Bame) writers to boycott the award.Wheatle welcomed news of the review. “Something had to be done,” he said. “What has to be addressed is any unconscious bias in the nomination and judging process.” He added that the review should consider opening the nomination process up to a wider group than librarians. Cilip’s own research has previously revealed that the sector is 96.7% white and 78.1% female, compared with the 87.5% white and 50.1% female UK workforce.Singh, who co-founded up the Jhalak prize to raise the profile of British Bame writers, had reacted with fury when news broke that all 20 longlisted titles were by white authors, despite work by a number of well-respected Bame writers, including Malorie Blackman and Patrice Lawrence, being among the 114 titles nominated.Though Singh welcomed the review, she added that she would wait to see if it could provide concrete solutions. “I hope this will not be yet another review that repeats what we already know and does little towards real change,” she said.Poole promised that the review would bring about change in the 82-year old Carnegie medal, which has a poor track record of recognising Bame authors. The award has never been won by a Bame writer, it has been awarded to white authors writing about black lives, including Tanya Landman’s Buffalo Soldier in 2015 and South African writer Beverly Naidoo’s The Other Side of Truth in 2000.“When you are running an award focused on children, you have a responsibility to address equality and diversity in the broadest possible sense,” Poole said. Though the new review will not affect this year’s competition, it will inform the long-term planning around the prizes and involve consultation with “the widest possible range of stakeholders”, including those who have raised concerns.The wider Equality and Action Plan commissioned by Cilip in 2015 is due to report this summer. Poole said he hoped it would help develop policies that would entice a much wider demographic into librarianship. “We have to make [it] a universally accessible and aspirational career for absolutely everybody,” he said.
