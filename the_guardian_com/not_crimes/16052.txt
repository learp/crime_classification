“Life in Beijing happens in the streets,” explains Jens Schott Knudsen (@pamhule), a lawyer and freelance photographer who lives in the Chinese capital. “The scarcity of personal space pushes daily activities outside – from eating and drinking to singing and exercise. At night, Beijing’s streets transform into social hubs. Communal life and an outdoor culture still define much of the city.”Through his pictures, Knudsen aims to capture both this outdoor culture and the tension between new and old in the cityscape – from the architecture to the lights and activity. As a photographer, he has collaborated with historians and urban planners to document Beijing’s rapid changes, which provide him with constant inspiration. An exhibition of his photography is currently on show in the city.
