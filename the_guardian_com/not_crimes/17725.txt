Cliff Michelmore, one of the BBC’s best-known television presenters over the course of the 1950s and 1960s, has died at the age of 96.A nightly presence on television screens in the era of two channels, Michelmore was best known for fronting the BBC’s ground-breaking current affairs programme, Tonight, which included the first television appearance of David Bowie, aged 17, in 1964.He presented the programme from 1957 to 1965, before working on the series 24 Hours. His work included hosting the BBC’s coverage of the Apollo moon landings and general election results programmes, the popular So You Think specials and presenting Family Favourites on BBC radio with his wife Jean Metcalfe.Born in Cowes, Isle of Wight in 1919, he served in the RAF during the second world war and began a broadcasting career with the British Forces Network in Germany in 1947.

Michelmore stepped down in 2003 but made a brief return to BBC television at the age of 87 to contribute to an evening marking the 40th anniversary of the 1967 sterling devaluation crisis.Antony Jay, who was a trainee when Tonight was first broadcast on 18 February 1957, wrote in the Guardian in 2009 that Michelmore was the first TV celebrity who came across as “one of us”.“He rapidly became a national figure, but he was much more than a television celebrity,” Jay recalled. “There was no pretence, no feeling of “performance” about him, in spite of the consummate professional and technical skill he brought to the programme. He was just Cliff, take him or leave him. And of course the audience took him, in their millions.”
