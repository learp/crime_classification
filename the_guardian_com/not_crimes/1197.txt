Ask any gardener what they love about their plot, and you’ll get as many answers as there are species of plant. Some will go straight for flowers; colour is sexy and exciting. Others will take you to their raised beds and show you beautiful vegetables; growing your own is rewarding and delicious. Then there are those who take pride in a luxurious lawn, mowed and weeded and manicured to perfection. Gardeners love containers, trees, wildlife and roses – the list goes on. However, there is one aspect of any garden which is the antithesis of exciting: drainage. It’s a vital part of any garden but is undeniably boring.Given everything that been happening in the world recently, it can be easy to think that humanity is circling its own drain. However, politics aside, drainage is crucial to the survival of many plants. Many new gardeners are so keen to start planting they don’t take the time to look at their soil’s structure or how it drains. I can’t blame them. Even for a keen gardener like myself, garden drainage is a mundane necessity. But looking at the way water interacts with the land is an important consideration for any garden. My garden, and my own ignorance, is a good example.Six years ago, when we moved house, I was keen to get things growing. The previous owners hadn’t been green fingered, so the space was pretty much a blank canvas. The exception was a large conifer in the back garden. It stood like a sentry in the middle of plot, blocking out light and dominating the space. I knew it had to go. I called a local tree surgeon, and a few days later a man appeared with a truck, a chainsaw, and a root grinder. In an afternoon, the tree was gone. I was pleased… until it started raining heavily the next week.As the rain drummed off the windows and ran from the roof, I watched the sodden lawn quickly grow from a series of puddles into one large pond. My garden has a slight slope to it and everything runs to a natural low point near the garage. This is where I watched my new pond form. It was also where the large conifer had been planted. It was then I realised that taking this tree out had exacerbated the situation. A large, mature tree can absorb hundreds of litres of water a day. The tree acted like a pump, helping to improve the drainage. On top of that, my garden is predominantly clay. The tiny particles of clay stop the water from moving down and dissipating. As much as I wanted the local ducks to take up residence on my water feature, I knew something had to be done.There are several options if drainage is a problem. A simple solution is to create a soakaway. This can be done by digging down into the affected spot and building a void where water can naturally fill and then dissipate. You can buy custom made plastic crates to make a void, or you can simply use anything that will create a space underground. My father-in-law had a problematic spot in his garden and built a void using an old beer crate and some weedproof membrane. For more extensive problems, you can also use piped drainage. Piped drains are perforated, heavy duty flexible tubing, laid several feet underground and then backfilled with gravel. The pipes need to be laid at an angle (or fall), so that the water can gather and then run in the desired direction. Usually, piped drains are connected at some point to the sewer, so that the water has somewhere to go.Given the extent of the problem in my garden, I decided to install piped drains. The budget for the new garden was limited, and I desperately wanted to blow it on plants and pots and paving. But I knew if I didn’t get the drainage right in the garden, many of the plants I wanted to grow would wither and die.Some may argue that I could have embraced the situation. I have visited a few bog gardens and they can be beautiful. However, I’m an romantic at heart, and I love plants that sing of sunnier climates. I love salvias and lavender and agapanthus. I’m also a fan of many traditional cottage garden favourites: hollyhocks, delphiniums, and clematis. None of these plants will grow with their roots sitting in sodden soil.In the end, it only took a few days for a contractor to lay the pipes and backfill with gravel. I’m glad I’m now protected against the worst of the winter wet. While no one will ever stand back and admire my drainage, it’s a vital part of what allows my garden to flourish. Often in life, it’s the underlying structure of things which allow them to function – what we don’t see can be as important as what we do. And while trench digging isn’t beautiful, it allows my garden to exist.
