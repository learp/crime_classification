The release of the latest report (PDF) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is yet another sober warning on the perils humanity faces from global warming.The threats seem written from the dystopian blockbuster Hunger Games: global food-stocks are risk, melting sea ice, thawing permafrost, dying coral reefs, heat waves, mega-rains, and a death toll amongst the poor, weak and elderly. Except for one thing. The effects of climate change are happening now.As Graham Readfern writes, we've heard it all before.The IPCC and its reports are notoriously conservative and have consistently underestimated the pace, intensity and impact of climate change. This conservative bias has had significant impacts on policy making at a national level; the scientific hedging has been used by mischevious or unethical climate change denying politicians to stall action, while governments with good will have underestimated the threats.This report is noteworthy because it media reporting has included conclusions that have been eschewed in earlier reports, especially the "drama" arising from the social, economic or political consequences of things like sea-level rise, droughts and heat waves.While we're hurtling towards the worst case scenario, and recognising that the latest IPCC report just confirms what we've known since the first Assessment Report back in 1990, it's worth asking whether the reports are helping or hindering action on climate change.Recently, David Grimes wrote in The Guardian that "denying climate change isn't scepticism - it's motivated reasoning". Describing the "boomerang effect" in an academic article by P. Hart and Erik Nisbet, the academics say that motivated reasoning explains why simply providing more and better facts based on science can actually increase polarisation on issues like climate change.Because attitudes on climate change (in the US at least) are strongly associated with partisan leanings, individuals are more likely to "pay attention to and interpret information in ways that reinforce their partisan views". Information about climate change that is presented in ways that amplify partisan differences therefore will deepen peoples' existing attitudes.The dominant approach to science communication, which has been used in climate change communication, is the "deficit model". This model is based on scientists providing more facts and general knowledge to media and the public, and the "underlying assumption of these efforts is that if the general public has more information about climate change, they will adopt views consistent with scientific experts."The "boomerang effect" is where motivated reasoning and social identification (such as political party support) collide, when a message constructed for a specific purpose (e.g. the IPCC report urging rapid action on climate change) actually backfires and produces the opposite result intended:For example, due to motivated reasoning, individuals exposed to counterattitudinal messages, such as Republicans receiving a message promoting climate change as problem and calling for climate mitigation policies, may be motivated to interpret available social identity cues, such as geographic location or group membership, in ways that lower their social identification with potential victims of climate change featured in the message. In turn, low social identification with potential victims may decrease the effectiveness of the persuasive impact of the message, possibly resulting in a boomerang effect.AndThus, strong political partisans are likely to employ motivated reasoning when exposed to messages about climate change with ideological predispositions moderating information effects on policy attitudes.This begs the question, do IPCC reports assist or hinder action on climate change, or do they risk the boomerang effect?Another research paper by S. Mo Jang from the University of Michigan looked at confirmation bias,  a cognitive bias where people seek out information that reinforces existing preconceptions and under-weigh information that disagrees with them. Confirmation bias is especially problematic with how the media treats IPCC reports.Last year, I wrote that the Australian media's reaction to the IPCC report focused on discredited conspiracy theories and misinformation. Because of the unwritten editorial policy of major news companies like News Corp to highlight scientific uncertainty and disparage climate scientists, politicians like Tony Abbott have a ready-made shopping list of media reporting to confirm their climate denying bias.Jang noted that Fox News is "dismissive" towards climate change, and thus "disproportionately" attracts viewers who are climate skeptics to "reinforce their existing attitudes through selective exposure to attitude-congruent information". What's more, the more someone thinks they know about an issue like climate change, the more they are likely to display confirmation bias and avoid attitude-incongruent information.Jang's research suggests that when new information presents "risks and threats, novel findings, or unexpected occurrences", people are more likely to pay attention to bias-disconfirming ideas.So, do the IPCC reports help climate action?In Australia, the media reporting on the IPCC in the only national broadsheet The Australian has been scant, and focused on misleading distortions of the report's warnings. Meanwhile, its online articles are largely confined to AP wire reports, or focused on confected scandal aimed at discrediting the report itself.Diabolical distortion from The Australian on the IPCC report today. pic.twitter.com/a37GHvoCm5— Alexander White (@alexanderwhite) April 1, 2014Fairfax reporting has highlighted the present dangers and risks. However, caught in a partisan "he said, she said" style of political reporting (where one politician is quoted, followed by another politician), these articles fall trap of the boomerang effect.The response by Tony Abbott and the Australian government to this IPCC report isn't to announce a new, significant climate policy that will actually take some steps towards reducing carbon emissions. Instead, the prime minister took the opportunity to reinforce his existing discredited Direct Action policy and attack the former Labor government's carbon price.In fact, Abbott's response is the opposite of what IPCC chair Rajendra Pachauri had hoped would happen: "The one message that comes out of this is the world has to adapt and the world has to mitigate."A continuing challenge, highlighted by Grist writer Brentin Mock, is that scientific reports, by their very nature are often written and presented in a dry, emotionless way, which limits its vocabulary for action, whether for the public or for decision-makers and politicians.To be clear, I am not suggesting that the authors of the IPCC report or other climate scientists are at fault or deliberately setting out to present scientific facts in a partisan way. Climate and other scientists contributing to the IPCC reports since 1990 have done an admirable job in difficult circumstances, as have many scientists who have expanded humanity's knowledge of global warming.I am also not suggesting that the IPCC reports, or those such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science's "What We Know" reports, are unimportant or irrelevant. I am certainly not suggesting that policy makers and politicians should ignore the evidence.The fundamental tragedy about the twenty five years of IPCC warnings, and countless others from the CSIRO, Bureau of Meteorology and many other respected scientific institutions is that they've been ignored. Facts simply aren't enough, but they're all that scientists can give us.
