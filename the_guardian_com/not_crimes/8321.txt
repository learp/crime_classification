Finally, we come to a regular feature entitled “If at first you don’t succeed, hello, reality TV!” This time, it’s the turn of Ed Balls, who is following in the illustrious footsteps of Edwina Currie and Ann Widdecombe towards the dancefloor of Strictly Come Dancing. Because nothing says “Trust me with the national economy again” like a perfectly executed paso doble.But let’s park the snarkiness because this member of Lost in Showbiz is actually a big fan of Balls. What, his politics? Oh, I don’t know anything about that. Do I look like Aditya Chakrabortty? But during the 2014 World Cup, Balls and I conducted some Panini swaps via Twitter and, thanks to him, I completed the Italy team. It is no lie to say that’s a lot more than any other former shadow chancellor has ever done for me.The cliche that all political careers end in ignominy never felt more true this week with the news that David Cameron’s waxwork has been wheeled on out of Madam Tussauds, and is presumably now being repurposed as a £42 Jo Malone lime, basil and mandarin candle. So really, Balls’s twirling is looking comparatively dignified. I mean, he might never got his hands on the budget, but when it comes to dancing the salsa in a werewolf costume for Halloween week, I reckon he’s the man for the job. Feel the validation, Ed!
