I am an out gay man living in an urban area. I spend hours and hours online looking at hook-up ads on my phone. In addition, I hook up a lot. It is wonderful and awful in equal measure. I’m sure this is a challenge for a lot of other people, too. Society has rarely had so many people with so many sexual opportunities in a short span of time. Any thoughts on how I should handle this time-wasting distraction?• When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
