Kesha has broken her silence following the public outcry after last Friday’s court ruling, in which a judge denied the singer’s request to be released from a recording contract with producer Dr Luke, who Kesha claims physically and sexually assaulted her. In a lengthy statement posted to Facebook, Kesha said all she wanted was to be able to make music without being “afraid, scared, or abused”.“This case has never been about a renegotiation of my record contract – it was never about getting a bigger, or a better deal,” she wrote. “This is about being free from my abuser. I would be willing to work with Sony if they do the right thing and break all ties that bind me to my abuser.”Kesha said that she wants other survivors of abuse to not be afraid to speak out. “Unfortunately I don’t think that my case is giving people who have been abused confidence that they can speak out, and that’s a problem,” she wrote.“But I just want to say that if you have been abused, please don’t be afraid to speak out. There are places that will make you feel safe. There are people who will help you. I for one, will stand beside you and behind you. I know now how this all feels and will forever fight for you the way perfect strangers have been fighting for me.”Dr Luke made his first public comments on the case on Monday, denying all the allegations via Twitter. In her statement Kesha thanked her supporters for standing up for her, saying she was “beyond humbled and thankful”.“Other entertainers who knowingly put their own careers at stake by supporting me, I will be forever grateful,” she wrote.Among the many stars who have publicly supported Kesha is Adele, who, during her acceptance speech for best solo female artist at the Brit Awards on Wednesday said: “I’d also like to take this moment to publicly support Kesha.”Adele is signed to Columbia Records, owned by Sony, the corporation Kesha sued to be released from her contract. Other artists who have spoken out on Kesha’s behalf include Lena Dunham, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Kelly Clarkson, Demi Lovato, Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff.
