The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has declared the Adani mine needs to proceed, and he’s endorsed giving the project a concessional loan in order to “get the thing built and get the money flowing”.Joyce used Wednesday’s worse-than-expected GDP figures to urge Queenslanders to “show the same spunk you had when you developed the coalfields in the past, built international airports at Cairns, built the Wivenhoe dam, sealed the roads out west, built the Gold Coast”.His enthusiastic backing for the contentious project contrasted with more obvious caution expressed by the treasurer, Scott Morrison, on Wednesday.Morrison told reporters in Canberra he did not intend to join commentary about whether the project should win support from the government’s Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund.Indigenous owners launch fresh legal challenge to Adani’s Carmichael mine He said the independent advisory board of the fund needed to be left alone to do its job. “I agree that it was set up to make independent assessments about the proposals.“They are the people to make those calls and I don’t intend to join in in any commentary about what they should or shouldn’t do, that would compromise the fundamental purpose of those people who have to make those assessments,” the treasurer said.During the federal election, the government’s position on the Adani project was that it should proceed, or not, on a commercial basis.But since the election, senior Nationals have pushed to have the project allocated $1bn from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund to bankroll a 388km railway line associated with the Carmichael mine.On Monday, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, met the Adani Group chairman, Gautam Adani, in Melbourne to discuss the project.
