Just as I was putting the kids to bed my eldest, aged 7, asked “Does Father Christmas really bring us the presents, or is it you and mummy who get them?” The question took me aback, and I’m afraid my reply was the rather unconvincing fluff of “Well, what do you think? It’s magic.” She said to me “Look me in the face and say that, so I can see if you are lying.”I was most conscious though that this was all in earshot of her 3-year-old brother. It’s been my policy not to lie to my children about anything. If they’ve asked where babies come from or questions about religion they get a very biological or honest answer. “Well some people believe Jesus was the son of God. But daddy doesn’t believe that.”However, Father Christmas, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy all make an appearance in our household - which I guess makes me a bit of a hypocrite on the honesty front.I was pleased today to find out I’m not alone, here is a lovely little collection of what parents tell their kids about Santa which is well worth your time.'It shocks people that I refuse to lie': what parents tell their children about Santa Updatedat 4.32pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.13pm GMT16:13Sending fat smokers to the back of the queue is a betrayal of NHS valuesPolly ToynbeeThe idea that NHS treatment should be denied or delayed for people who can be blamed for their condition is poisonous. It will lead to the end of an NHS founded on the principle that treatment is free for all, when they need it, regardless of their status, their worth, their morals, their state of mind. It didn’t surprise me that lot of smug people wrote comments after my piece praising the Vale of York NHS, backed by Downing Street, for putting obese people and smokers to the back of the queue. People like to feel good about themselves by imagining they are superior to others, the unlucky, the addicted, or the unworthy. Which of us, really, is so virtuous? Let’s have empathy and support for the people who need it most when they are ill and treat everyone according to need.Sending fat smokers to the back of the queue is a betrayal of NHS values| Polly Toynbee FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.05pm GMT16:05Sarah MarshForget Sam-Cam’s fashion range, one reader has other ideas ...   imperium3 02 December 2016 3:56pmI'm just looking forward to Jeremy Corbyn's range of jams and preserves.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.44pm GMT15:44Why are we so fascinated by the wardrobes of public figures?Jess Cartner-Morley  Photograph: Darren GerrishSamantha Cameron’s intention to launch her own fashion label has been the worst-kept secret in fashion. This week it was confirmed with an announcement that the Cefinn brand will go on sale early next year. So far, all we have to go on are two outfits, and the fact that the brand logo is eyebrow-raisingly close to the Celine font. More details will be in the January issue of Vogue, which is out on Monday. But the news got me thinking: why is it that we are so fascinated by the wardrobes of public figures?

Having said that we should do everything we can to reduce beef and dairy consumption, as it's not the by products but the big market for those main products that are environmentally unfriendly and unsustainable.

According to the experts, CBT is a more effective treatment than antidepressants. Which sounds fair enough. But, of course, no.Along with some fierce debate about the physical v psychological root of the issue, some interesting cultural questions were raised. Are we failing women by not treating PMS seriously? Are we trying to pathologise womanhood? Can our cash-strapped NHS afford to offer this kind of treatment? Can it afford not to? Do talking therapies work anyway? Can we have one damn story about periods that doesn’t prompt a load of sexist, sniggering comments?

More specifically, it was the office lunches and your feelings towards your colleagues’ habits that turned cogitation to conversation. How hot, smelly and noisy is your al desko lunch? One comment that resonated with many was this, which talks of presenteeism culture invading the lunch hour.   mad4plaid 28 November 2016 1:51pmThis comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debateEven though my co-worker re-heats fish at her desk (gag), she actually makes fun of me/picks on me for "taking a lunch break" (as she calls it) because I leave the office for lunch.That is what I find most depressing about the al desko (as the author calls it) trend. It makes leaving the office something to be ashamed of, whether it is your right to do so or not: many appear to think you are not working hard enough because you've left your desk for lunchPart of the problem where I live (middle of the US) is that office buildings are not built with cafeterias or a break room anymore. Thus if you are bringing your lunch in, eating at your desk is the only solution.Working during your lunch hour? This commenter agreed that this was the problem to tackle rather than stray odours.   YojimboBeta 28 November 2016 2:01pmNever mind the smell - it's working during your lunch that should be socially unacceptable. Previous generations worked hard to get us mandatory lunch breaks, but we willingly erode these rights with the creeping expectations of 'professionalism' - a mythology of sacrifice and work obsession that negates our own interests.And also away from the whiffs of reheated dinners, the sound ...   ReggieHammond 28 November 2016 1:17pmLess bothered by smells (unless they are incredibly vile) and more bothered by people who; eat with their mouth open / have weird clicky jaws / make weird munching sounds / take 2 hours to consume lunch. I quite like having a nose and seeing what everyone's eating.What do you think? Do you agree that we shouldn’t be eating at our desks?

The Sleaford and North Hykeham constituency is in the Brexit heartland of Lincolnshire, and 62% of people in the relevant local authority area voted to leave the EU (in Richmond, 70% supported remain). As part of the Anywhere But Westminster series, I went there not to cover the electoral race – this is a very safe Tory seat – but to find out how the aftershocks of the EU referendum were playing out far from the capital. Sleaford’s Brexit byelection: a people united by fear for the futureWith my journo partner John Domokos, I found a deep generational divide, lots of Brexit voters who wanted the UK to get out of Europe as a matter of urgency, and also something much more complicated and challenging: a deep, emotional link between support for Brexit and strong feelings about the decline of community and solidarity, and simple loneliness. For anyone who thinks the leave vote was essentially reducible to nastiness and xenophobia, this film may serve as some kind of corrective; more generally, we think it’s not a bad picture of a very troubled England, and leave and remain voters united by one key thing – a pronounced fear of the future (oh. and some of what it explores probably also applies to Trump voters).FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.30pm GMT13:30Some are looking not only to Richmond, but to Sleaford, Lincolnshire, where there will be a byelection next week.   ProjectReality 02 December 2016 1:26pmThe result, along with the previous one at Witney, means that there's rich-pickings for any openly anti-brexit party.

Richmond is the kind of place where most people voted Remain. Rather than simply accept being told to "shut up" every five minutes, these people are now digging their heels in. The country is going to be divided for a very long time over this and the name-calling, wilful disregard of facts and tabloid hysteria have not helped one little bit. Neither, for that matter, has a government which has decided that "the will of the people" excludes millions who wanted exactly the opposite and that the referendum is a mandate not only to leave the EU, but to leave the single market, insult our neighbours, threaten people living legally in this country and sabotage the future prosperity of the nation. Paradoxically, both the Libdems and UKIP will be boosted by all this.You can get involved in the discussion below.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.04pm GMT13:04Our colleague James Walsh has been speaking to readers in the Richmond Park constituency, resulting in this piece which is worth a read:Why we voted to get rid of Zac Goldsmith FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.52pm GMT12:52The Liberal Democrats – the only progressive party able to take advantage of Brexit schism?Toby MosesWhat does the Lib Dem victory in Richmond mean? Could a pro-EU message take a swathe of seats from the Tories? This graph by pollster James Kanagasooriam suggests that around 20-25 seats have enough people who voted Remain to overturn the Tory majority from 2015, so would be vulnerable to a similar swing – even without any drop in Tory popularity more generally.James Kanagasooriam (@JamesKanag)Richmond one of a small group of Tory seats vulnerable to Remain tactical voting. Graphic below indicates up to c.20-25 could be vulnerable pic.twitter.com/VeSWeylAaIDecember 2, 2016The question then becomes, can Labour take advantage? The Lib Dems are well placed – there are very few loyalists not in favour of staying the EU. Labour has a whole other problem with a swathe of northern Labour seats with large leave majorities. If Corbyn pivoted to an anti-Brexit, block Article 50 position he might win over a few Tory seats, but he’d surely leave the north exposed to Ukip’s message that Labour is out of touch. That it wants to defy the will of the people and simple doesn’t understand what its base wants.It’s a pickle for the Labour leadership to be sure – and one that is unlikely to be easily solved, which means the Liberal Democrats will be the only progressive party able to take advantage of the Brexit schism in the country. If they take enough seats from the Tories, and Labour can hold on to what they’ve got at the next general election a progressive coalition government could be a possibility – which I would suggest makes the chances of an early election slim. The risk is simply too great for a prime minister with a small majority and a reputation for playing it safe.Updatedat 2.06pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.41pm GMT12:41You’ve been sharing more vews in response to the question of sleep in the comments.   mezzamorta 02 December 2016 12:30pmI definitely keep myself awake far too long in the evenings, mainly because I feel robbed of time after a day at work. When I come home I'm desperate just to spend time enjoying not being at work, relaxing, feeling equilibrium return. I arrive home exhausted and annoyed.

First sleep, second sleep. This is how we sleep. It's the natural way to do it. The idea of sleeping all night so we can go to work all day is entirely artificial, has only been around since the industrial revolution and not surprisingly, many people can't do it. What's surprising is that we can expect them to, or even ask them to do something so unnatural.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.10pm GMT12:10Our sleeplessness epidemic: why we are not getting enough shut-eyePaula CocozzaThis week a report claimed that poor sleep costs the UK £40bn a year. People sleep badly, go into work, and with foggy heads do their best. But, whatever your job, such days are less productive than they should be. Hit snooze! How a better night's sleep could save the UK £40bn If only we could all sleep seven to nine hours a night, the UK would be wealthier. (The figures also showed a sharp impact of sleeplessness on productivity in the US, Japan, Canada and Germany.) Some companies provide napping areas. Others try to make the workplace feel homely.   Photograph: Alamy Stock PhotoBut isn’t the real problem the endlessness of the working day, now revolving tirelessly around a world clock, the greed with which work wants to swallow the rest of our lives, so we stare at our smartphones when we should be sipping camomile and reading Marilynne Robinson?Do you, like this reader, remember better times?   JustanOldFool 30 November 2016 1:51pmIn one of my first jobs about thirty years ago, one of the manager's I worked for used to have a short nap in his office after lunch.
