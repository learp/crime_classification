A friend once told me that while he was undergoing an embarrassing medical procedure, the fact that he knew me somehow came up in conversation. “So I’m lying there with a camera halfway up my arse,” he said, “having to answer questions about your sodding column.”“Sorry,” I said. But I wasn’t sorry. I secretly considered it a career high point. You are being discussed, I told myself, in highly inappropriate settings.Years later, I find myself sitting in an examination room contemplating a pair of dignity shorts. It is the third time I’ve been in hospital this year. Each time they look up my arse, tell me nothing is particularly amiss, and then mention that they have an even bigger camera they would like to use on me. Today, I am to experience the full colonoscopy.“I’ve just got to put some money in the meter,” my wife says, “and then I guess I’ll wait for you outside.” She is here because I’m being sedated, and won’t be allowed home on my own.“OK,” I say.After she leaves, a nurse comes in and says that if I prefer I can forgo sedation and just make do with gas and air. That way, she says, I can go home right away. I am worried what my wife will say after waiting around needlessly, when I could have just got the bus. But I opt for the gas and air, figuring I can just act a bit deranged on the way back to the car park.When the time comes for the procedure, the doctor asks me to confirm my name and date of birth. I am told to lie on my side with my knees drawn up. Someone hands me the gas nozzle, and tells me to place it in my mouth. I hear the rip of the Velcro tab at the back of my dignity shorts.Ten minutes later I am looking at my transverse colon on a monitor, addled with gas. It doesn’t do much for the pain – I can feel everything – but at least I’m incredibly confused.“So what would you normally be doing on a day like today?” says the doctor. My voice, when I answer, sounds clotted and alien.“A journalist,” says the doctor. “What kind of journalist?” I tell him.“Really?” he says. “Which newspaper?” I tell him. I am convinced that he is pedalling a stationary bike behind me, in Lycra shorts. People are cheering in the distance.“Oh, well, I’ve probably read it then,” he says. “That’s the entrance to your appendix there.”“Wow,” I say. Some kind of alarm goes off, and I decide the building is on fire.“Yes, I’m sure I would have read it at some point,” he says. “Sorry about this, just a tricky corner. You’ve got a very long colon.”“Me?” I say, “or everyone?”“What’s that?” he says.“Nothing,” I say. He and the nurse get into a long conversation which I cannot follow, but which I am increasingly certain concerns some emergency to do with my insides. When I turn to look at the doctor I’m surprised to see that he isn’t wearing a cycling helmet.“You’re doing really well,” he says.“I have no idea where we are,” I say. “In terms of my colon.”“So what sort of things do you write about?” he says. “Is there a theme?”When I find my wife in the waiting room an hour later, I have forgotten my intention to appear incapacitated enough to require supervision. My jaw aches from biting down on the gas nozzle.“That took a long time,” she says.“I have a famously long colon,” I say.
