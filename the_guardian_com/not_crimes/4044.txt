My husband and I and our 7 month-old baby arrived in California last week for an extended stay. We are sharing parental leave and it’s his turn to take over. My work happens to bring me back to my home state, so we are making the most of it, starting with a little holiday in the Napa Valley wine region. Driving here from the coast north of San Francisco, I am struck by the dry, golden grass-covered rolling hills. Most of the area we drive through is agricultural. We go by grazing beef cattle and dairy cows and chicken caravans for facilitating free-ranging before we pass olive groves and finally vineyards. All along the way, the wide open roads are lined with wild fennel with feathery leaves and asterisk-like yellow flowers filling the air with their heady anise scent.Wild fennel is really a weed –transferred easily on shoes and hooves – that has invaded this area of California the same way it has invaded the British isles. Wild fennel can be found in Britain along waterways and hedges, and now is the time it shines. I have long loved what its flavour does when paired with wine, so it is reassuring to see the two growing alongside each other here in Napa. The fig is having a moment now too, and roasted figs in red wine with fennel tastes as good as it looks. I choose ripe black figs with deep ruby and yellow-flecked centres, then drown them in a red wine that I like to drink, finishing them with a constellation of bright sunny fennel pollen.Fig ice-cream is another of my favourites. Using a generous amount of fruit gives it that gooey gelato texture and the popping of the seeds is really satisfying. These recipes work together, so that you can make the roasted figs one day and serve them on their own with creme fraiche, or let them cool down and puree them up to be made into a delicious ice-cream. My favourite is to make them twice and serve warm roasted figs over the frozen figgy ice-cream.Wild fennel and red wine roasted figsServes 4-610 ripe black figs100g raspberries150g red wine50g caster sugar2 fronds wild or cultivated fennel leavesHoney2-4 wild fennel heads full of yellowpollen1 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Select a ceramic or other heavy roasting dish that will hold the figs snugly – about 20cm in diameter.2 Trim the tough tip of the stem on each fig, but try to maintain the lovely fig shape. Slice the figs in half through the tail and stem, then put in your baking dish, cut-side facing up. Scatter with the raspberries and pour over the red wine. Sprinkle evenly with caster sugar and gently lay the fennel fronds over the top. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the figs have puffed up and the wine has reduced a little. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes.3 While the figs are still warm, drizzle with honey and sprinkle over the pollen from the heads of fennel, by gently pulling the flowers. Do this over the figs to catch all the falling goodness. Serve right away with creme fraiche or ice-cream.Wine roasted fig ice-cream (main picture)It is much easier to make this recipe with an ice-cream maker. If you don’t have one, simply follow the same steps, but put the finished mixture in your freezer, removing every half hour to stir and break up the ice crystals to the desired texture.Serves 4-6350g whole milk175g caster sugar4 egg yolks650g double creamA pinch fine sea salt2 tbsp honey4-6 portions wild fennel and red wine roasted figs, cooled and pureed1 In a heavy-based saucepan, warm the milk and sugar until just under the boil. Meanwhile, separate your yolks in a bowl (reserve the whites for another use) and whisk to break them up.2 Measure the double cream into a large container that will fit into your fridge and put a sieve over it. Set aside.3 When the milk has come up to temperature, temper the yolks by pouring a little bit of milk into them, whisking as you go. Pour this mixture (scraping with a rubber spatula to get all the bits stuck to the bowl) back into the saucepan. Stir constantly with a heatproof spatula or wooden spoon over a medium heat until the custard just starts to thicken – a matter of minutes. You can test this by periodically bringing the spoon or spatula up out of the pot to check. Once it has started to thicken, remove from the heat and pour through the sieve into the cream. Cover and chill completely.4 Stir together the ice-cream base and fig puree, then freeze in your ice-cream machine. Serve with more roasted figs and their red wine juices.Claire Ptak is a pastry chef, author and food stylist and owns Violet Bakery in London.
