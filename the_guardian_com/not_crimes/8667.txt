New year, newly expanded waistline, newly extortionate rail fares … what better time to resurrect that long contemplated resolution to pedal into the office? Cycling is one of the simplest ways to keep fit while simultaneously saving money. "Once you've done it a few times you'll be surprised how easy and quick it really is," says Rory McMullan, author of Cycling to Work: a Beginner's Guide.Great – I've dusted off the old Raleigh three-speed; there's some rust on the spokes and a family of sparrows in the basket but otherwise it looks in decent nick. It's wise to make sure your bike is in good working order, says Wendy Johnson of environmental transport advice charity Sustrans: "This is especially important if it has been immobile in the shed for some time. You might want to do a simple bike maintenance session."I need a new bike; what should I be looking for? "There is no right answer on which one is right for you," says McMullan. Designs range from sportier road bikes with racing handlebars and razor-thin tyres to no-nonsense city models equipped with mudguards, rear luggage racks, enclosed chain, well-sprung saddles and so on."It's probable the one you choose will be somewhere in between these two extremes, but consider a folding bike if you need to get a train or bus for part of the journey," says McMullan.How much should I spend? It is not necessary to spend a fortune and a good second-hand bike could serve you perfectly well. Check to see if your employer runs a Cycle to Work Scheme, which lets you buy a bike at a discount in monthly instalments.Does size matter? With bikes, yes; the wrong-sized frame can cause a lot of discomfort. "Make sure your toes touch the ground from sitting in the saddle and you can stand flat-footed over the crossbar," says McMullan. "The saddle should feel comfortable, although you can change this later."Cycling kit looks pricey; which bits do I really need? "Make sure your bike has a bell," says Johnson. "And as most of us are coming home from work in the dark at this time of year, front and rear lights are a must."A helmet is also strongly advisable. "Try them out to make sure you get one that fits properly – an ill-fitting one won't protect you properly when you need it. A pannier rack and panniers, or a basket, are a good idea if you want to carry a laptop, files or your lunchbox."Other items to consider are a good-quality lock, a bike pump and, if you're thinking of braving the elements, some wet-weather clothing to keep you dry.A fluorescent vest is also a good idea, but again, says McMullan, you don't need to blow a fortune. "If you are only riding at a sedate pace you won't sweat much more than when you are walking, so you won't need professional clothing."There seem so many more bikes on the roads since I was last in the saddle. Will I be fine just hopping on? If you haven't been on a bike in a while, it's a good idea to do some training, advises McMullan: "Adult training courses are often offered by large workplaces or the local council for free or at a discount." Johnson suggests phoning the National Cycle Training Helpline on 0844 736 8460/8461.How can I find out the best route? Another advantage of bikes is that you can get off the main roads. Sustrans can advise on traffic-free routes – great for regaining confidence if you haven't been on a bike for a while – along with estimates of how long your journey should take.
