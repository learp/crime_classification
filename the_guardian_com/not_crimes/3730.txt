I started in the gym at seven years old – I enjoyed bouncing around. At 11 or 12 I was told by the coach that I needed to lose weight and stop eating school lunches, so Mum arranged all my food. I got classed in the elite and started doing 25 to 30 hours a week in the gym and it was a massive commitment that has stayed since. Healthy eating hadn’t been a family priority – I’d eaten a lot of junk food – but suddenly the whole family changed nutrition, skimmed milk instead of semi-skimmed, and everything else. Then my younger sister Ellie took up gymnastics and the family adjusted to the needs and schedules of both of us.For my breakfast, Mum – or me – will usually have made scrambled egg whites or one of many varying omelettes with vegetables and tuna or fish. This morning I had an omelette with tuna, runner beans, corn and chia and caught up on the Kardashians. After a morning gym session of two and a half hours, we’ll have an hour and a half or two for a break for lunch – sometimes in the canteen but usually I’ll bring lots of salad, maybe with prawns, probably quinoa, some sweet potato, rice and Naked or Primal bars. I’ve never liked the taste of beetroot shots but I’ll have one. In the afternoon it’s another two and a half hour session, followed quickly by a protein yogurt or shake. Then home for dinner, getting recovery in early. My bones, at 24, are equivalent to a 40-year-old’s, apparently.The road to Rio 2016: how the key Olympic sports are shaping up Mum will have texted us in the afternoon to decide on our dinners. It’s not often we get home and there isn’t what we want, or need, on the table. Often lean fish or meat and veg-based, but adding more things, not necessarily carbohydratey, like butternut squash when I’m really, really hungry. One thing I’ve got into is pasta alternatives – carrot spaghetti and courgette spaghetti. For a while I’ve been doing no-carb or low-carb evenings, because I don’t want carbs sitting on me. In this sport, body composition and weight is really important, not necessarily for our look but because we have to do so many repetitions and impacts. Extra pounds means extra pounds of impact on joints.It’s all about making little decisions, choices, changes and hopefully improvements each day, including diet, that are right for that day. Every day in gymnastics is different, no one is the same; that’s what’s so hard about our sport. Some days I can be feeling really bouncy and light and work’s really easy, but on others I’m slower, more tired, my timings are off. This sport’s about fractions of seconds, so you’re either on the bar or on the floor. I think it’s important as an athlete to feel you’re making your own food decisions, because if restricted too much you might rebel. I go crazy when it’s downtime with friends, and chocolate is my greatest weakness. Any chocolate, I’m not picky.Becky is European and Commonwealth Games champion on the uneven bars.
