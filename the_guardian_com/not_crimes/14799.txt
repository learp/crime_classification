The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with A Vision Of Panorama: Seaside Tune    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This Russian producer has managed to make what sounds like 80s new age music going reggae into something really cool and beautiful.The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor A Guy Called Gerald: Voodoo Ray    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest An acid house classic; every element is a hook. It bounces out of the speakers with a big smiley face to save the day (or night).The track that currently gets the most rewinds Calm: Pearls And The SunWe’re talking virtual rewinds here, in my head, in slow motion. This is a 10-minute-long floating thing that I could listen to all night.The track that got me out of bed this morning A Reminiscent Drive: Life Is Beautiful    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest A drifting melody that makes you breathe in the pine-scented air, stamp around in the dust, look up at the big blue sky and whisper: “Life is beautiful”.The track I’d play to show off my eclectic tastes Pharoah Sanders: Sun Song    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest You still can’t beat a little jazz to confuse people. This is a celebration of the power of the sun that will bring out your inner hippy, too.The track I wish I’d never played Phil Collins: In The Air Tonight    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Some people think that Balearic is an excuse to play cheesy tunes because you can get away with it in the sunshine, or dull generic chill out, but for me Balearic means a genuinely eclectic mix of all genres – maybe people can take that difficult jazz or 70s Venezuelan prog because they are watching a celestial spectacle on a warm summer night, but hey that’s the beauty of it. But there’s aa fine line between Balearic and rubbish and Phil has always been just on the wrong side of it. Chris Rea, though, is a different matter altogether.The track that should have been a crossover hit Young Gun Silver Fox: You Can Feel It    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The perfect 70s west coast tune, made on a rainy day in west London, with lyrics so dumb they are profound, like all great pop records.The track I’d play at my funeral Herb Alpert: This Guy’s In Love With You    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest This list gets longer all the time; at the moment I am planning a very emotional two-day party with one killer tune after another. Herb nails it, though – head-to-toe goosebumps.Chris Coco plays Balearic at Ropewalk, SE1, 10 & 24 July
