An Aboriginal art mystery spanning more than three decades has finally been solved.With an estimated value of up to $150,000, the painting, Untitled (Travelling Dreaming), was loaned to the Northern Territory chief minister’s office sometime after 1978 but then disappeared in 1981.Despite many years of extensive searches, the Papunya board was considered long gone until it was spotted by someone with a keen eye.The Department of Tourism and Culture’s chief executive, Alastair Shields, said he found the artwork in an old store room and decided to display it in his office.By chance, during a recent routine meeting, the director of Arts NT, Angela Hill, discovered it hanging in the new Tourism and Culture headquarters in Darwin.Territory art historian Anita Angel then identified the work as an early board painting by artist Mick Namarari Tjapaltjarri, created 44 years ago.How do you buy Indigenous Australian art ethically? “The office needed a little bit of life and colour, however I had no idea that I was hanging a prized piece of Northern Territory art,” Shields said. “I was shocked to learn it was a one-of-a-kind Mick Namarari Tjapaltjarri painting that had been missing for 35 years.”In the artwork, two ceremonial men are depicted singing a bush tucker song while two other figures are listening around campfires.The Papunya board shows radiating lines that indicate a journey, which the NT minister for tourism and culture, Lauren Moss, says is fitting considering where the artwork has travelled.“This is a wonderful moment of luck that brings a terrific end to a 35-year mystery,” she said. “Although a very unusual mode of discovery, I’m very pleased to hand this incredible piece of territory history to its rightful home – the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory.”The artwork is still in good condition but will undergo some restoration before it joins the exhibition Tjungungutja: Early Papunya Paintings, which opens in July.
