The charity Keep Britain Tidy (KBT) is urging you to clean up for the Queen’s 90th birthday (cleanforthequeen.co.uk). Cigarette butts are the most littered item on our streets, followed by fast-food and snack packaging, and plastic bags.Litter is an ecological nightmare. Our rubbish fragments into bits of plastic that are washed into water courses, poisoning wildlife and choking the ecosystem. Every wrapper or container made from virgin materials that isn’t recycled is a blow to the ambitions of a smarter, more circular economy. KBT’s report How Clean is England? tells us that litter disproportionately affects low-income neighbourhoods, so it is a social justice issue, too.The rise in our consumption of on-the-go food follows the global trend. In Los Angeles the average citizen generates 4.7lb a day of potential litter in takeaway containers. I lay responsibility at the feet of brands and outlets which still have a patchy approach to recycling. Remember that your local council has power through Community Protection Notices to take a stand. The more difficult it is for consumers to bin, or preferably recycle, the more litter there is. Unfortunately I have evidence that major food brands are changing their packaging from recyclable plastic to non-recyclable.We need clarity. The waters are muddied by the promises of biodegradable and degradable packaging. Professor Richard Thompson of Plymouth University has published dozens of papers on plastic debris. He says: “Designing plastic that could recognise when it has ceased to be useful and so begin to rapidly degrade would be challenging.” Basically we would need plastic containers that are smarter than us. In any event, litter is not going to melt away.The big picture: very visible Vanish      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A lot of bottle: thousands of pink plastic bottles wash up on Cornwall’s beaches after a container had gone overboard. Photograph: Universal News And Sport (Europe)Plastic litter is often talked about in general terms, but residents of Poldhu Cove on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall were treated to a very specific deluge two weekends ago when hundreds of bottles of Vanish detergent washed up on the beach. The distinctive pink bottles are thought to be from a container that slipped off a cargo ship near Land’s End last May. A clean-up is under way, with surfers joining the effort offshore. Parent company Reckitt Benckiser said it was “deeply concerned” about the spill.Well dressed: design your own knitwear      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Ready to knit: Unmade offers bespoke designs by hacking industrial knitting machinesThe production processes of most clothes are enough to keep you awake at night. There is egregious waste and you can rarely be certain where and how your garments were made. But who can afford couture? Unmade, the collective bringing transparency to knitwear, is holding a special preview show at London’s Somerset House until 29 March. They offer bespoke designs by hacking industrial knitting machines. Herman, Helga and Hansel and Gretel, three Stoll machines (Stoll machines are reckoned to produce a staggering 10% of the world’s clothing) are waiting to machine-knit you a bespoke scarf or jumper. The design might be based on a 1930s map of Borneo or a reworking of a classic check. The point is, you are in control. If you can’t get to the preview, you can order online.
