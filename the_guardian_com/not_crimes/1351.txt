To run one sub-three marathon may be regarded as impressive. To run three in as many months - four in the year - looks like awesomeness. People of the running blog, take your winter running caps off for Gill. 2hr 53min at Florence marathon yesterday, finishing off that sub-3 streak with a PB. To put that in context, the first two of those marathons were within a couple of weeks of each other (Berlin, Lake Garda). It’s impossible really to come up with a precise equivalent for what a sub-3 marathon for a woman would equate to for a man. Sub 2hr 45min? 2 hrs 40min? At any rate, I genuinely think that very few people (men or women) have performed at that level (their absolute best, remember) with such consistency. Gill, you are my hero. Also, can I borrow your legs? And, err, lungs?My own running is pretty rubbish at the moment thanks to what is being christened ‘sick November’ in my house. Yet another virus curtailed my attempted long run yesterday, though at least I got a half decent track session in on Saturday. I’ve got a long way to go until London marathon, but I will try and channel just a tiny bit of Gill’s determination on the journey. Over to you folks. Share your frosty parkruns, epic PBs and injury woes below the line as always
