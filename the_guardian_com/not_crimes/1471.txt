When we were younger, we were polar opposites in everyone’s eyes. You were tall and I was small. You were skinny and I wasn’t. You were beautiful and I was plain. The fact that you had speech problems and learning difficulties didn’t play on my mind much. We spent so much time together that it wasn’t as if there was any communication barrier. I was jealous of you, of how you looked. I used to imagine what it would be like if I looked like you. Maybe I wouldn’t be so awkward, maybe I would have more friends. When we learned about genetics in biology, I wondered how the genes lined up for you but not for me.It wasn’t that I disliked you; it just got to me that you had it so easy. People gravitated towards you. “Beautiful girl,” they would say, then they would smile at me. You used to get complimented on your hair. When I grew mine, no one ever said anything.However, when you started at secondary school, the year I began my A-levels I began to notice more differences. For the first time, you were out on your own and I wasn’t there to catch you. You were compared to me and that wasn’t fair. They expected you to be like me, they expected your brain to be like mine. Our faces didn’t match, that they could see. However, they assumed our insides did match, despite our appearances. I was clever. You were clever too, but not in the traditional way. You had a memory like an elephant and a knack for making cool videos. You were expected to climb trees when you were built to swim lakes. It was then that I remembered that, whenever you were speaking, our family would look at me, not at you. We used to share a playground – I was a junior and you were an infant. Teachers would come to find me when they couldn’t understand what you were saying. I understood you completely and often I was the only one who did. People didn’t think of me as your sister, they thought of me as your translator. You would have given anything to be like me. Who was I to be jealous of you when you faced such misery? I will never forget the day you were doing homework at the kitchen table. I was sitting across from you singing under my breath and working on some coursework. You went very quiet and you put down your pen as a teardrop hit the page – it blurred some of the words. You whispered, “I just want to be a normal girl.”I looked at you and I cried, too. Inside, I was punching myself. You would trade anything to be like everyone else in your class at school. You would have given anything to be like me. Who was I to be jealous of you when you faced such misery five days a week, 39 weeks a year?We were polar opposites in every way possible. I had to retrain myself. I put myself out to help you with schoolwork in every way I could. You noticed and you would do my hair for me.My little sister – you got the looks and I got the brains.It’s not really fair, but we learned to live with it.AnonymousWe’d love to hear your stories• We will pay £25 for every Letter to (please write about 600-700 words), Playlist, Snapshot or We Love to Eat we publish.
