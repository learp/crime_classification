Clothing retailer Lands’ End apologised on Thursday after publishing an interview with feminist and political activist Gloria Steinem. The all-American chain and catalogue, famous for its outdoor wear with a preppy twist, promptly removed the article from their website when some customers voiced their outrage.The interview was conducted by Lands’ End CEO Federica Marchionni – who joined the company a year ago after working as an executive at Dolce & Gabbana – and was featured in their spring catalogue. It was part of the company’s Legend Series, which features people “who have made a difference in both their respective industries and the world at large”. But critics quickly took to the company’s Facebook page demanding the article be removed. Many threatened to stop shopping at the store entirely.“Those of us who love family, love children, are completely puzzled why you would promote a very vocal pro abortion celebrity,” one customer wrote. “Are you anti-child? You want to kill off possible future customers?”Another added: “Sooooo disappointed to see you aligned with Gloria. I have been a big fan and loyal customer for a long time. No longer! I cannot in good conscience support a business that is moving in this direction.”Lands’ End removed the article from their website following the backlash. In a statement, Lands’ End said: “It was never our intention to raise a divisive political or religious issue, so when some of our customers saw a recent promotion that way, we heard them.” They apologized for “any offense” they might have caused.But upon their removal of the interview, more customers took to their Facebook page – to criticize their decision to back down.“Women’s equality means that women earn money to spend and will choose to spend it at places that support women’s equality. What/Who are you afraid of Lands’ End?” one user asked.“Shame on you, Lands’ End, for dropping Gloria Steinham,” another wrote. “My friends and I are now dropping you!”
