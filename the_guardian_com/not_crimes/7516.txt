Batter is a wonderful thing. Baked, griddled or fried, it can be transformed into dramatically different forms. From crepes and pancakes to Yorkshire puddings and American popovers, the ingredients change very little, but the methods of cooking, and the order in which you incorporate the ingredients, yield gorgeously varied results.The other appealing quality of batter bakes is the ease with which they can swing back and forth between savoury and sweet. Take crepes: season the batter with salt and pepper and you can fill them with spinach and cheese for a savoury snack, or season it with nutmeg and lemon zest and sprinkle them with caster sugar and lemon juice for a sweeter option.In my opinion, by far the most exciting batter-based recipe is that for Dutch babies. These American breakfast cakes start with a silky batter that’s prepared, rested and then poured into a piping hot frying pan generously coated with melted butter. Baked in less than half an hour, the whole thing puffs up into a monolith of crisp, eggy deliciousness. I love them served with loads of freshly squeezed lemon juice and icing sugar, but you could add the zest of an orange or vanilla sugar, if you like.Claire Ptak’s recipes for orange salad and upside-down cake | Baking the seasons Puffy, buttery popovers are my second-favourite batter-based bake, America’s answer to the Yorkshire pudding. There is a well-known restaurant in my home town, Point Reyes, California, called The Station House Cafe. It has been there as long as I can remember, serving up baskets of warm freshly baked popovers to every diner as soon as they sit down. They are legendary. I hope my version does them justice.Dutch babies (main picture)You will need a 25cm cast-iron frying pan or a similarly sized ovenproof pan to cook these puffy pancakes.Serves 4-63 large eggs150ml whole milk100g plain flour1 tsp vanilla extractA pinch of freshly grated nutmeg¼ tsp flaky sea salt55g unsalted butterZest of 1 lemon25g icing sugar, for serving2 large lemons, cut into wedges1 In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, flour, vanilla, nutmeg and salt.

If you can’t find one, just use the deepest muffin tray you can find.Makes 12450ml whole milk6 large eggs140g plain flour1 tsp fine sea saltA generous grating of nutmegA generous grating of black pepper100g unsalted butter, melted, then cooled12 tsp vegetable oil, plus more for greasing1 Use a pastry brush or paper towel to grease a 12-cup muffin tray with oil. Be sure to coat the top of the tray as well as the cups. Add 1 tsp of oil to the bottom of each cup. Set aside.2 In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. In a separate bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients. Slowly add the wet to the dry until it all comes together and there are no lumps. Add the melted and cooled butter, then strain the whole mixture. Let the batter rest for at least 1 hour, but preferably longer, if possible.3 Put the oiled muffin tin into the oven over a baking dish to catch the drips. When the oil is hot, divide the batter between the cups and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until golden and puffed. They should have tripled in size. Remove the popovers from the tin and put on a paper towel for a few minutes before serving. Serve piping hot.Claire Ptak is a pastry chef, author and food stylist and owns Violet Bakery in London.
