With forays into fashion, sport, photography and philanthropy it has been a busy year for the Beckhams. It has also been a year in which Victoria opted not to sing, but now Cruz has decided to give it a whirl. Here’s how things are measuring up for the Beckhams …Cruz BeckhamThe signs were there in October when 11-year-old Cruz was pictured in Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins’s studio. This week, he released his grammatically questionable debut single If Everyday Was Christmas, joined Instagram, and was revealed to be under the guidance of Scooter Braun, who also looks after Justin Bieber and Kanye West. Premiering the single on Capital FM (money goes to its Make Some Noise charity), Cruz noted that the song combines “two of my favourite things, Christmas and singing”. Is it fair to criticise the charitable work of an 11-year-old boy? Absolutely not, but Scooter Braun is 35 and he’s on course for a potato in his stocking.

GEM launched in the summer sans Posh and Sporty, with a shonky video that looked like it had been shot on an iPhone 3S; in November, a song called Song For Her leaked. Let’s just say it wasn’t a classic.David BeckhamDavid started 2016 as the planet’s second highest-earning retired sportsperson, having made £45m in 2015 from fashion firms such as Kent & Curwen, Adidas, Breitling and H&M. Dave continued his work with Unicef (earlier this week, he unveiled a video in which his tattoos came to life to tell stories relating to violence against children), and in March he bought land in Miami upon which, at some point, he plans to build a Major League Soccer stadium.Romeo BeckhamHaving spent time training with Arsenal, 14-year-old one-time Burberry model Romeo has knocked football on the head  and now plays tennis several times a week. In June he met up with Andy Murray, the tennis player, for whatever a kickabout is called when it’s tennis.Brooklyn BeckhamAfter also “moving on” from Arsenal’s Hale End academy in 2015, the now 17-year-old has spent most of 2016 building his brand. This included wearing top hat and tails on the cover of L’uomo Vogue (headline: THE NEW LEGACY), becoming the new face of Pull&Bear, landing a £100K ad deal with Huawei, and announcing his first photography book to the delight of other photographers). A promo clip for Pull&Bear included the phrase: “We all have a place in the world; jump barriers and be in the right place.”Harper BeckhamIt’s important to remember that Harper Beckham is only five years old so it’s far too early for her parents to help her “jump barriers” into the worlds of fashion, music, sport or photography. That said, the Sun reported last month that Harper was training with the English National Ballet, so let’s reconvene in 12 months.
