Following his death in January, the late musician has become the first act in six years to knock themselves off the top of the official albums chart. His Best of Bowie compilation, originally released in 2002, has replaced his final studio album Blackstar at No 1. He joins Michael Jackson in this feat. Behind Bowie’s Blackstar, Sia rounds off the top 3. Just 1,213 sales separate Sia’s album This is Acting from the chart-topping Best of Bowie. At present, he occupies seven entries in the top 40. Elsewhere on the album charts, Adele’s 25 has slipped two places to No 4, while Justin Bieber’s Purpose is at No 5.
