For Lisa Chu, owner of Los Angeles-based clothing company Black N Bianco, offering same day delivery to her clients hasn’t traditionally made financial or logistical sense.“I have a lot of small boutiques that carry my clothing in the southern California area, and whenever they need a specific size in a rush I can never fulfill their needs,” she said. “It’s not viable enough for me to hire a driver and I cannot let my employees waste time delivering one item.”But that may soon change with the launch of a new delivery service unveiled last week by on-demand taxi company Uber, which aims to make it simpler and more affordable for small businesses to deliver their products quickly, helping bring them at least a little closer to competing with retail giants like Amazon and Target.The new service, called Uber Rush, allows local merchants to tap into a network of drivers for almost instantaneous pickup and delivery of their products, be it flowers or tacos or a handbag, at a relatively small cost. The service, which has existed in pilot stage in New York City for the past year, has now expanded to San Francisco and Chicago, with plans to extend to other cities in the future.Chris Webb, CEO and co-founder of restaurant online ordering platform ChowNow, one of Uber Rush’s partners, said the new service will enable small businesses to tap into a large network of local delivery drivers with the click of a button, allowing them to fulfill more orders and save on costs.“Delivery can be a financial and logistical pain point for restaurants as hourly wages are going up, insurance rates continue to climb, and staffing around lunch and dinner demand spikes has always been a challenge,” he said. “Because of these challenges, only half of our restaurant clients offer delivery today and we aim to help resolve this pain point with the Uber Rush integration.”Small business owners have struggled to keep up with larger companies, who continue to roll out faster and cheaper delivery options to their customers. Earlier this year, Amazon launched free same-day delivery to subscribers of its Prime membership program.Last month, the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that optimism continues to be low among small businesses compared to August. Merchants cited poor sales and competition from large businesses as some of the biggest problems that they face, after taxes, governmental red tape and poorly skilled workers.To use Uber Rush, local merchants input a customer’s order into an online form, then a courier arrives shortly after to deliver the package. Delivery costs vary depending on the city, but range from $5 to $6 within one mile and between $2 and $2 per extra mile, according to Uber’s website. Businesses and their customers can view where their package is in real time using an online map.“We used to wait two to three hours for a delivery to start,” said Olivier Plusquellec, co-founder of New York City florist Ode à la Rose, which was featured on the Uber Rush website. “With Uber Rush, now it’s five or ten minutes.”But Uber Rush carries some potential downsides, said John Morgan, the Oliver and Dolores Williamson professor of organizations at University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business. For one, there is the risk that delicate items like flowers or food will suffer in transit due to careless drivers, Morgan said. There’s also the issue of price, he added. Uber drivers may want to bunch orders to make the trip more worthwhile financially, which would decrease the speed of delivery.“Uber has shown itself to be a very competent market platform for matching rides with riders and figuring out the right price to make both parties semi-happy,” Morgan said. “But when it comes to logistics and delivery, direct participation and central control is critical, hence I am skeptical of Uber’s ‘invisible hand’ approach in this sphere.”But the high costs and logistical challenges of traditional delivery have left small businesses with few options, so on-demand services like Uber Rush at least give local merchants a chance to remain in the race.For Chu, the new service will enable her to to serve all her boutiques on demand, giving her a leg-up on her Amazon competitors, who she said don’t offer same-day delivery.“Uber Rush is a God-sent gift,” she said. “It will differentiate my brand and bring reliability to a whole new level.”
