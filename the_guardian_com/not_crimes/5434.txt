A “grand bargain” aimed at winning parliamentary passage of the government’s Direct Action climate change plan and a revamped renewable energy target is being quietly discussed behind the scenes in Canberra.Independent senator Nick Xenophon supports one version of the idea, the Palmer United Party is understood to be considering it and environment minister Greg Hunt is listening, but has as yet made no commitments.Former Australian Conservation Foundation head Don Henry, who was been instrumental in the talks between PUP leader, Clive Palmer, and former US vice president Al Gore has been discussing the ideas with both Gore and PUP. Further briefings are scheduled when parliament resumes.The “bargain” involves pledges for a significant strengthening of the so-called “safeguards” in the Direct Action package – the measures to ensure that emissions from electricity generation or manufacturing do not increase so much that they wipe out emission reductions bought by the government from its $2.5bn emissions reduction fund.The government has deferred legislation on the “safeguards” and is now facing the Senate defeat of the first tranche of Direct Action, which is being implemented by extending an existing carbon farming initiative that allows land users and others to be credited for actions that reduce emissions.Under the “grand bargain” plan, developed in consultation with Danny Price, who was chosen by Hunt as an “eminent economist” to co-chair the expert reference group advising him on the Direct Action scheme, companies could be credited for beating emissions baselines and risk financial penalties for exceeding them.At the same time the renewable energy target could be expanded to include other “low emissions” technologies like gas and would eventually be wound into the safeguards scheme.Under another approach, suggested by Grattan Institute energy expert Tony Wood, the RET would be expanded to include a proportional acknowledgement of reductions in emissions from fossil-fuel generated energy.Wood thinks such a plan could overtake the need for a safeguards scheme, with the emissions reduction fund ensuring abatement continued outside the energy sector.Given the very strong resistance in parts of the business community to any kind of penalty in Direct Action – one the reason safeguards were deferred when cabinet was finalising the scheme earlier in the year – there would be opposition. But the alternative would be the defeat of the Direct Action policy, which would leave Australia with no policy to reduce greenhouse emissions at the same time as the rest of the world is intensifying efforts in the lead up to the UN secretary general’s climate change conference in New York in September and the crucial United Nations meeting next year in Paris, where Australia will be under pressure to commit to a tougher post-2020 target.And the renewable energy target is also splitting the government, with Hunt and industry minister Ian Macfarlane wanting it to be “pared back” and prime minister Tony Abbott wanting it to be closed to any new projects and the renewable industry fiercely resisting both ideas. The prime minister and the two ministers are scheduled to meet Sunday to try to reach a resolution, but either of those options also appear to face almost certain senate defeat.PUP has insisted it will only support Direct Action if the government accepts its proposal for a “dormant” emissions trading scheme, which would become “active” only when the climate change authority decides that major trading partners EU, Japan, Korea and China had in place their own ETS or “equivalent measures” to make a “comparable effort” on reducing greenhouse emissions.But the government has made it clear it won’t support another ETS similar to the one the parliament just abolished – even in a dormant form.The “grand bargain” aims to overcome this impasse.Henry, now a professor of environmentalism at the University of Melbourne, told Guardian Australia; “The important thing is to reduce what goes up into the atmosphere. There are different ways to do it ... and you could add some dimensions to Direct Action and you could build on the renewable energy target and you could end up with a cost effective way of driving emissions reductions.“I am talking to Gore and PUP about all of this because at the moment the government has an election commitment on Direct Action which it doesn’t have the numbers to deliver and the pressure will continue to increase for Australia to act.”According to Wood arguing about how big the RET should be after almost every other policy to reduce greenhouse emissions has been scrapped is “like fighting over whether you should get an upgrade when the whole plane is heading for a crash landing.”“We really are having the wrong conversation,” he said. And he says there is really no point each major party undoing the policy if the other upon assuming government, and therefore some kind of bipartisanship has to be found.Many long time observers of Australia’s bitter and protracted climate policy debate agree that the preoccupation with the RET ignores the real problem.“The central failing of the current environmental policy discussion is that we have no bipartisan support on the need to decarbonise the electricity sector,” said Erwin Jackson, deputy chief executive of The Climate Institute.“The RET has a key role to play but so could regulatory limits or incentives to start to drive the most polluting power stations out of the market ... but just focussing on the RET ignores the bigger picture. We need a broader discussion, and soon.”
