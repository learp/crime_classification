She isnt who she says she is, her name isnt even Stella – but she cannot tell them the truth if she wants to protect the ones she loves, even if they don’t deserve it. Stella uptown life is soon vanished as she becomes a witness of a serious murder crime committed in her own home. Forced to leave her home, her friends, family and boyfriend, Stella moves to Thunder Basin and cannot turn back.Here, she realises that her life back in Philadelphia wasn’t as perfect as she thought after meeting Carmina and Chet. Stella doesnt want them to judge her and despite falling for Chet, she cannot bring herself to tell him the truth and betray her boyfriend who still hasnt tried to contact her. Dangerous Lies was a lovely quick read in that it ticked all the boxes: mystery, romance, humour. Stella really surprise me in the way she handled everything despite being a lost cause. Most young adult books nowadays avoid having a parental adult figure, so Carmina’s contribution to the story was appreciated and was definitely significant to the story.• Buy this book at the Guardian BookshopWant to tell the world about a book you’ve read?
