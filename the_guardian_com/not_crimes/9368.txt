It always seems like such a good idea, stuffing a whole fish, filling its belly with a savoury tangle of onions and breadcrumbs, parsley and lemon zest.But then, as you bring it to the table, its skin crisp and flecked with black and gold, you realise you have given yourself an impossible task. Bones get caught up with breadcrumbs, fins stick to the roasting tin, fine pin-bones become impossible to extricate from the filling. Your proud handiwork ends up on the plate looking more like a kedgeree.Earlier in the week I bought a couple of mackerel from the fishmonger and got him to remove the fillets and skin them. At home, I put the fish on the work surface and stalked the flesh, hawk-like, for any hair-like bones and removed them with a pair of kitchen tweezers. It took all of five minutes. Maybe less. We kept the head and bones for a sauce with cream and chives I was left with four perfect fillets to stuff with crumbs and herbs, wrap in almost transparent rashers of pancetta, and bake. Later, I prepared a sea bass, again filleted but this time cooked one fillet on top of the other with a filling of crisp potato rosti. We kept the head and bones for the sauce, a simple affair with cream and chives.Stuffing a fish makes it more substantial and often it will go further – a boon with the price of fish as it is. One of the most popular recipes ever to come from this column was a salmon wellington, where two large salmon fillets were stuffed with shredded cucumber, mint and yogurt and baked in pastry for Christmas. This week’s recipes are, I suppose, a more everyday version of that.Baked mackerel, pancetta and parslied crumbsLet your fishmonger prepare the mackerel. Ask for the fillets to be removed from the carcass, together with their skin and fine pin-bones. You should be left with four perfect, smooth, skinless fillets. You should nevertheless check them thoroughly for any whiskery bones that may remain.Serve two fillets per person, perhaps with a bowl of spinach leaves that you have softened in butter and seasoned with grated lemon and toasted pine kernels.Serves 2onions 2, mediumbutter 30golive oil 4 tbsp (and a little extra)parsley a small bunchbreadcrumbs 25g, coarse, whitesmoked pancetta 4 rashers, thinly slicedmackerel 2, filletedSet the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Peel the onions and slice them very finely. Warm the butter and oil in a shallow pan, stir in the sliced onions and let them cook over a moderate heat until soft, golden and lightly caramelised. Let your fishmonger prepare four perfect, smooth, skinless fillets Finely chop enough parsley to give you 4 tbsp. Remove the pan from the heat then fold in the breadcrumbs and chopped parsley and season with a little salt and ground black pepper.Lay a rasher of pancetta on the work surface, place a fillet of mackerel on top, then place roughly a sixth of the mixture on top, patting it down to stick to the fish, then roll it up and put it into a small, deep baking dish.Continue with the remaining fillets and rashers, tucking the fish together, spooning any excess stuffing around them. Trickle a little oil over the top.Bake the fish for 20-25 minutes until the crumbs are golden and the fish is lightly cooked throughout. Serve two curls of fish per person.

Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the ObserverSea bass with potato rosti and chivesServes 2sea bass 1, large , filleted (keep bones and head)onion ½bay leaves 2cloves 3black peppercorns 6double cream 250mlpotatoes 500g, largeolive oil 6 tbspthyme leaves 1 tbspchives 2 tbsp, finely choppedPut the head and bones of the fish in a small, deep-sided saucepan, add the onion, bay leaves, cloves and peppercorns, pour over the cream and bring to the boil. Immediately turn off the heat, cover tightly with a lid, and set aside to infuse.Using the coarse disc of a Magimix or mouli grater, shred the potato into fine matchsticks. Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan set over a moderate heat, then add the potato and press it down into a large, flat cake. Scatter the surface with the thyme leaves and flakes of sea salt. Leave the potato to cook for a good 15-20 minutes, until the underside is pale gold and lightly crisp. Turn the cake over with a fish slice. It will crumble a little, but no matter. Leave to crisp and lightly brown, then lift from the pan and drain on kitchen paper. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.Place one of the fillets, skin side down, on a piece of baking parchment or kitchen foil. Season lightly then pile a good half of the potato rosti on top, breaking it as necessary. Season the second fillet of sea bass on both sides, then place skin side up on top of the rosti. Place the remaining potato on top then spoon over some of the remaining oil from the rosti pan.Bake the fish for about 35-40 minutes. Remove the fish head and bones from the cream by pouring it through a sieve into a small saucepan to remove the aromatics. Warm over a low heat until just starting to bubble, finely stir in the finely chopped chives and correct the seasoning with a little salt. Serve the fish with the chive sauce.
