Once again Amazon has taken the public on a thrill ride into the future with another sensational disclosure about its drone deliveries. It has filed a patent for parachute-aided package drops. With this remarkable innovation,whose introduction can surely be just days away, the ordered item is released above your back garden and floats gently down as a little silken canopy opens up above it.But wait! What if you live in a flat? Or what if you don’t want your package to lie in the damp garden getting weed on by cats all day while you’re at work? Never mind these footling objections. This is progress we’re talking about. While the parachute package descends, the drone hovers nearby, ready to correct any off-course drifting with a burst of compressed air! Then it zooms off.The futuristic Amazon delivery drone is the 21st-century equivalent of the TV detector van that in scary 1970s ads cruised around the streets, searching for television sets without a licence while a sinister guy in the back famously barked: “... they’re watching Columbo!” But no one ever seemed to see one of these vans in real life. As for Amazon, if it wanted press coverage ... well, buying ads is expensive. But filing sci-fi patents for drones is cheap – and gets acres of publicity.Doubles all round These bizarre political times generate exotic forms of vocabulary – “normalisation”, “alternative facts” – and for me one of the most notable is the transformation of an existing phrase: “doubling down”. It used to be a relatively abstruse blackjack term: I first came across it reading the blackjack card-counting classic Beat the Dealer (1962) by the American mathematician Edward O Thorp. Now political pundits use it all the time. But is it misleading?When caught, politicians increasingly just double their original claim; they brazen it out, hoping to shout down their accusers, to bully and browbeat them with sheer shamelessness – and we call that “doubling down”. But in blackjack, it means being allowed to increase your original bet by up to 100% in return for an extra card. It is a risky but rational move. You can’t change the rules by doing it, you can’t make the dealer throw up their hands and say: “OK, fine, sure – you win.”But the alternative-fact merchants think of themselves as players and gamblers, in which all that counts is winning. Maybe the doubling-down trope flatters their vanity.Earning my stripesHere’s another thing they don’t teach you at parenting school: the horror of the half-term “sleepover”. Your child and their friends have the luxury of nothing to do the next day. But you have to work. Is there anyone to complain to, any descriptive standards body, about the first syllable of the term “sleepover”? Could it not be renamed “sleepdeprivationover”?My 12-year-old and his friends, having consumed their increasingly substantial body weight in Haribo and Pringles, commenced screaming at each other in the neighbouring bedroom at 10:30pm. It lasted until 6am. Metallica live would have been less noisy. At various points through the long night I tapped on the door and did my unconvincing Tolerant Dad impression, chuckling indulgently: “Come on, boys, settle down! … Ha! Go to sleep now, boys! It’s 3am! … Boys. COME ON. It’s 4am!” And finally: “It’s 5am. Come on.”It was only as dawn lit up my haggard face that I realised I had been channelling Sergeant Wilson from Dad’s Army: “Would you mind awfully just falling in?”The boys showed up for breakfast at 7:30, at which point the earsplitting discussion continued, about which variety pack to have.
