While many artists venture out into the world of retail for their own brand benefits, Beastie Boys’ Ad-Rock has designed a trainer for the good of the world.Along with ethical LA shoe company Keep, the rapper has created a vegan trainer to raise money for Planned Parenthood, the US non-profit organisation that provides reproductive healthcare, sex education and information to millions of people worldwide.“I support a woman’s right to choose, and feel that women should not be punished for making decisions about their own lives and bodies,” said Ad-Rock in a statement. “If you have similar beliefs, you might wanna grab a pair.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Keep x Ad-Rock Ramos trainers Photograph: keepcompany.comAdam Horovitz: ‘It’s weird not being a Beastie Boy. It’s all I did for 25 years’ Ad-Rock, whose real name is Adam Horovitz, is one of many artists, including Run the Jewels’ El-P, who have aired their support for Planned Parenthood in the wake of Donald Trump’s election to the US presidency. In a letter posted in September this year, Trump stated: “I am committed to defunding Planned Parenthood as long as they continue to perform abortions and reallocating their funding to community health centers that provide comprehensive healthcare for women.” Earlier this month, Ad-Rock also gave a speech at a “stand up against hate” rally when a New York City park named in honour of the late Beastie Boys member Adam ‘MCA’ Yauch was defaced with antisemitic graffiti.
