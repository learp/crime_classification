Two influential sets of film prizes have given boosts in the awards-season scramble to Moonlight, Barry Jenkins’ poetic study of an African-American teenager’s struggle with his sexuality, and American Honey, Andrea Arnold’s freewheeling road trip following a group of magazine subscription sellers.Moonlight was the main beneficiary of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association awards, where it took home four, including best picture, best director for Jenkins, best supporting actor for Mahershala Ali, and best cinematography for James Laxton. This follows its success at the equivalent New York critics awards, where Jenkins, Ali and Laxton all won in the same categories (though it lost out to La La Land in the best picture category), and its strong showing at the Gotham awards, a key independent-cinema oriented ceremony.

Photograph: PR ImageMomentum would also appear to be building behind Isabelle Huppert’s startling turn as a revenging rape victim in the Paul Verhoeven-directed Elle: she won the LA critics’ best actress award (along with her work in Things to Come), replicating earlier wins at the NY critics (for the same two films) and the Gothams (for Elle alone). American Honey emerged at the head of the pack at the British independent film awards, winning four and just edging British-Iranian horror Under the Shadow which took three. American Honey won best British independent film, best director for Arnold, best actress for Sasha Lane and the craft award for cinematographer Robbie Ryan. The critically admired but little heralded Under the Shadow was a surprise success, taking best screenplay for writer-director Babak Anvari, best supporting actress for Avin Manshadi, and the Douglas Hickox award for best debut director for Anvari.Ken Loach’s hard-hitting benefits-system drama I, Daniel Blake did less well than expected, taking two awards for its cast members – best actor for Dave Johns, and most promising newcomer for Hayley Squires – but was passed over elsewhere.Los Angeles Film Critics Association awards – full listBest picture MoonlightBest director Barry Jenkins (Moonlight)Best actor Adam Driver (Paterson)Best actress Isabelle Huppert (Elle, Things to Come)Best supporting actor Mahershala Ali (Moonlight)Best supporting actress Lily Gladstone (Certain Women)Best animation Your NameBest foreign language film The HandmaidenBest documentary I Am Not Your NegroBest screenplay The LobsterBest editing OJ: Made in AmericaBest production design The HandmaidenBest music score La La LandBest cinematography MoonlightNew generation award Trey Edward Shults and Krisha Fairchild (Krisha)Independent/experimental film/video Deborah Stratman (The Illinois Parables)Career achievement Shirley Maclaine British independent film awards – full listBest British independent film American HoneyBest director Andrea Arnold (American Honey)Best actress Sasha Lane (American Honey)Best supporting actress Avin Manshadi (Under the Shadow)Best international independent film MoonlightBest screenplay Under the ShadowBest actor Dave Johns (I, Daniel Blake)Best supporting actor Brett Goldstein (Adult Life Skills)Best documentary Notes on BlindnessDouglas Hickox award (for debut director) Babak Anvari (Under the Shadow)Breakthrough producer Camille Gatin (The Girl With All the Gifts)Discovery award The Greasy StranglerOutstanding achievement in craft Robbie Ryan (cinematography, American Honey)Debut screenwriter Rachel Tunnard (Adult Life Skills)Most promising newcomer Hayley Squires (I, Daniel Blake)Best British short Jacked
