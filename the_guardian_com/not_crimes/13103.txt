Amid rising floodwaters across the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia, Indigenous environmental groups have issued a fire warning.Heavy rain across the region has sparked flash floods, cutting off communities and knocking out communication lines, and even pushing tropical weather into the normally arid desert region.A low-pressure system is expected to bring more heavy rain over the next week. Widespread falls of more than 100mm have been recorded across the Top End, including 275mm at Labelle, west of Litchfield national park. Darwin saw its wettest day in five years on Monday, with 145.6mm in 24 hours, and a number of roads around Katherine are under water.Gemtree Caravan Park (@GemtreeP)Depth Indicator getting washed away!

Custodians rain fire from the sky to care for country “The future of IPAs in the longterm is really critical in terms of this kind of land management,” O’Leary told Guardian Australia.“It creates that strategic framework around which you prioritise things like fire management that you have to roll out throughout the year so you get good bang for your buck in terms of environmental outcomes, and Indigenous outcomes.”The current federal funding cycle for IPAs ends next financial year and O’Leary said it was a “big question” for the environment and Indigenous affairs portfolio in the next federal budget.Lyndon Keane (@LyndonKeane)With a moderate flood warning now issued for the Waterhouse River, this is the current state of play in #Beswick. @BOM_NT @abcdarwin pic.twitter.com/Z1pJfTtgw0January 24, 2017Daniel Fitzgerald (@danielpfitz)After heavy rains last night the Katherine River is at 12m, initial minor flood warning current pic.twitter.com/anKqInVN7hJanuary 24, 2017
