Thousands marched in Warsaw this week after the leader of Poland’s ruling party backed a call from Catholic bishops for a complete ban on pregnancy terminations. In the US, Planned Parenthood is under fire, with Republican politicians lining up to condemn the organisation and legislators repeatedly pressing to defund it. And Donald Trump last week called for women who have abortions to be “punished” – though he was forced to retract the comments, after they provoked the biggest crisis of his campaign. We are all familiar with the extremely rocky terrain of abortion rights in the US, and with the harassment faced by some women trying to access abortion services. Providers are being forced to close, and last year, a gunman stormed a Colorado clinic killing three people and injuring nine. The president of the Rocky Mountains chapter of Planned Parenthood, Vicki Cowart, suggested the stage for such violence was set by “a climate of rancour surrounding abortion”.But many are unaware that US-style abortion clinic protests – complete with harassment, gory placards and the intrusive filming of women attending clinics – are increasing at an alarming rate in the UK as well. Last year, BBC news reported that protests now regularly take place at around half of the UK’s abortion providers. Research from Birmingham’s Aston University found that women trying to access abortion services had been followed, harassed, and even physically assaulted. And one clinic in London is reportedly being forced to close because of intimidating protestors. Kerry Abel, chair of national pro-choice campaign Abortion Rights, says: “People are shocked when they hear that activity normally associated with anti-abortion campaigning in the United States is happening here in the UK.“These hard-line protesters,” she says, “would like to see abortion outlawed altogether and use tactics such as harassment and intimidation [to agitate for that].” Behaviours range from trying to physically block the passage of would-be patients and staff members to clinics, displaying large, exaggerated pictures showing “aborted foetuses”, to filming women outside clinics.Abel says that it is no coincidence that we are seeing patterns from protests in the US replicated outside UK clinics: “The anti-abortion movement is well connected and funded, and UK anti-choice activists are not only importing tactics, but ideology from anti-abortion movements in the US.” We know, for instance, “that organisations such as 40 Days for Life, which is an American anti-choice group with established groups in cities across the UK, routinely establish protests at clinics in the UK.”Next week, I will speak at a parliamentary meeting organised by Abortion Rights to discuss methods of ending clinic harassment and to call on the UK government to take responsibility for addressing the problem. For Abel this is key – pressure needs, she says, to be taken away from clinics “and put it where it belongs – with the government”.According to Abortion Rights, the Home Office has suggested that existing legislation under the Public Order Act, the Protection from Harassment Act and the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act are sufficient to deal with the problem, but that there has been a reluctance to implement these laws in this context.“The current legislation that aims to tackle harassment and intimidation in public is not being used effectively to protect women at clinics,” says Abel. “We are calling for the government, local authorities, police and local MPs to use existing powers to intervene and ensure women are able to access their legal right for information and abortion.”Women elsewhere in the UK are facing draconian repercussions, stemming from laws passed during Queen Victoria’s reign, for making choices about their own bodies. Just this week, a 21-year-old woman in Northern Ireland was found guilty of taking pills to induce an abortion and was given a suspended prison sentence, leading to calls for Westminster to overturn Northern Ireland’s abortion ban. Earlier this year, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service launched a campaign calling for “cruel, archaic” abortion legislation to be overturned and for abortion to be completely decriminalised under UK law. In England and Wales, under existing law, abortion is still technically illegal under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, as the 1967 Abortion Act did not overturn the Victorian legislation, but simply added exemptions, with the ability to end a pregnancy still predicated on the consent of two doctors.Meanwhile, as the government fails to respond to calls for action, anti-choice protesters are becoming louder and more active in the UK. It is 2016 – more than 150 years since the Offences Against the Person Act was passed. If we are as outraged as we claim to be by the war on reproductive rights elsewhere in the world, then it’s time to recognise what is happening at home as well, and take action.
