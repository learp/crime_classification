Now that we have had time to fully absorb and analyse the repercussions, it is clear that the most culturally significant reverb of Kim’s takedown of Taylor in July was the death of Swift’s squad, and the resulting devaluation of the very concept of the squad. For all their photogenic solidarity, Taylor Swift’s girl gang turned out to be wholly incompetent in defence of their queen when the going got tough. There was total radio silence from Gigi Hadid, Cara Delevingne, Karlie Kloss and the one from Victoria’s Secret, while a supportive tweet by Selena Gomez backfired spectacularly, when she appeared to belittle the Black Lives Matter movement #nothelpful      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Cara Delevingne and Margot Robbie in matching personalised silk tracksuits.

Adding #squadgoals to your social media post these days is a faux pas of such proportions that you would probably want to enrol in some kind of witness protection programme.However, pictures speak louder than words, and this summer’s alpha duos have discovered the power of twinning, ie wearing matching clothes. When Beyoncé and Jay Z and Theresa and Philip May (in polo shirts and hiking trousers) are both working a trend, something is definitely afoot.

Real-life twins Lia and Odette Pavlova star in the new Mulberry ads, mirroring Cara Delevingne and Margot Robbie’s tracksuit-twinning at the Suicide Squad premiere after-party. Bey twinned with her mini-me, Blue, in matching bespoke Gucci at the top of the Eiffel Tower, which would be ultimate #squadgoals if that was still a thing.The Beckhams (Versace black leather, 1999) and Britney and Justin (double denim, 2001) must be gutted that Instagram arrived too late for their twinning heydays.
