Radiohead and There Will Be Blood director Paul Thomas Anderson have released another minimal video, this time for The Numbers, a song from their ninth studio album, A Moon Shaped Pool.Titled The Numbers: Jonny, Thom and a CR78, which is a reference to a Roland drum machine, the video features guitarist Jonny Greenwood and Thom Yorke sitting on a bench while playing the song. Shot in Tarzana, California, it is the third video he has produced for the band’s current album.The release follows Anderson’s video for Present Tense, which saw the same setup featuring Greenwood and Yorke, and Daydreaming, which followed a more conventional music video setup and saw Yorke walking through various scenes.The director has links with the band due to his work with Jonny Greenwood, who has composed Oscar-nominated music for Anderson’s films, including The Master and his atonal, unsettling score for There Will Be Blood.Anderson also worked with Greenwood on the documentary Junun, which followed the guitarist’s work with musicians in Rajasthan in north-west India. Greenwood has also collaborated with lauded Polish classical composer Krzysztof Penderecki when the pair worked together on the 2012 album, 48 Responses to Polymorphia.The album’s first video, for the song Burn the Witch, was accused of breaching copyright over its similarity to the children’s TV show Trumpton.
