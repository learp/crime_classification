I’d never heard of Fred Uhlman, the German-born writer and artist (1901-1985), or of his novella Reunion, until Nicola Beauman, the publisher of Persephone Books, pressed it into my hands. At the time, I wasn’t in need of any new paperbacks; my toppling to-read pile was in danger of getting its own Channel 4 documentary. But she was so fervent, and the book so slight – the Vintage edition runs to just 78 pages – it would have been rude to refuse it.Appearances, however, are deceptive. Reunion, which was first published in 1971, can indeed be read in about the same time as it takes to drink two martinis. But boy, does it punch above its weight. Set in Stuttgart in 1932, it is an account of the friendship of two teenagers: Hans, the middle-class son of a Jewish doctor, and Konradin, scion of a noted aristocratic family. Both have a passionate interest in history, and against the odds – snobbery is rife in their ultra-competitive school – this brings them together.But their beloved Germany is changing. Sides will have to be taken, loyalties adhered to. Disgust, rejection, fear, exile, stoicism, bravery: these are the things the years ahead will bring, even if their pattern will not be fully revealed for many decades. Uhlman’s story, which takes on the most terrible crime of the 20th century, could easily have wound up a fable, pat and sentimental. Somehow, though, it never comes close to being so, perhaps because he is careful not to lose sight of the bonds from which its beginning is forged. A daring miracle of narrative simplicity, its end comes at you like a torch in a long tunnel. All is black, calamitously beyond words, and yet the eye, swiftly followed by the heart, is drawn to it: at last, a circle of light. Even if history cannot be rewritten, Uhlman tells us, a life may sometimes have more than one act.
