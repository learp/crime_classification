What is it? The cardoon (Cynara cardunculus) is an architectural beast of a thistle, with decorative silvery toothed leaves. It’s in the same family as the globe artichoke, but it’s the stems, not the flower buds, that are prized by Mediterranean cooks.Any good varieties? There are few options in the UK, but Franchi Seeds sells the varieties ‘Bianco Avorio’ and ‘Gobbo di Nizza’, while Chiltern Seeds offers heirloom cardoon ‘Rouge d’Alger’ with attractive red-blushed stalks. For young plants by mail order, try Victoriana Nursery.Plant it with? Cardoons brighten the back of the ornamental border when teamed with purple irises, oriental poppies, verbascums and hostas.And where? These are thirsty, hungry plants, so ensure full sun and fertile soil. Mulch the crown in winter to protect from the cold.Any drawbacks? At up to 6ft tall, even one plant may overpower tiny gardens. And if you want to eat the stalks, prepare yourself – it’s a bit of a faff. Blanch the stems in September for at least a month, tying burlap, cardboard or bin bags around the stems.What else does it do? Bees adore the huge electric-blue spiky flowers from June to September.
