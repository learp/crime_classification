Michael Bublé has announced that his three-year-old son Noah has been diagnosed with cancer.A message posted on Facebook from the Canadian singer and his wife, Luisana Lopilato, said: “We are devastated about the recent cancer diagnosis of our oldest son Noah, who is currently undergoing treatment in the US.“We have always been very vocal about the importance of family and the love we have for our children. Luisana and I have put our careers on hold in order to devote all our time and attention to helping Noah get well. At this difficult time, we ask only for your prayers and respect for our privacy.“We have a long journey in front of us and hope that with the support of family, friends and fans around the world, we will win this battle, God willing.”According to reports, Noah was diagnosed after he and his mother travelled to the US due to health concerns. The type of cancer has not been revealed. Michael Bublé: my salmon-kissing days Bublé and Lopilato, an Argentine model and actor, also have a younger son, nine-month-old Elias.During a recent appearance on ITV’s Loose Women, Bublé praised his children for giving him “perspective” and said that he was unaware how much he would enjoy being a father. He said: “The only regret that I have in my life is that I took this long to have kids, because I had no idea the perspective it would give me. It’s made everything else so insignificant, moments that I was afraid of and moments that would overwhelm me have now become a joy because I’ve realised how not serious they are compared to what is really important, which is Noah and Eli and that’s it.” In an interview this year, Lopilato said she and her husband were “a little weird about our kids”. She told PageSix.com: “We love to be with our kids a lot. When we are out for one hour, we miss them.”
