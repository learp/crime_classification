Throughout the years, the Supreme x The North Face collaborations have produced some classic pieces: such as the purple Summit jacket from 2008 and the leopard-print nylon slip-on from 2011. In the same year that athleisure seems to have gone mainstream and functional utility wear continues to dip into blue-collar jobs for inspiration, their newest range is prescient. The standout pieces are these joggers, and particularly the bright red-and-black two-tone, with a bold Supreme logo up the leg. Itâ€™s an exciting piece because it feels entirely in keeping with the streetwear revolution: a mix of retro sportswear nostalgia and slouchy hip-hop glamour.
