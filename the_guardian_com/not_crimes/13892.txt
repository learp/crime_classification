Drawings going on display for the first time at the National Portrait Gallery really do look like a child did them, albeit a talented one.“They are really accomplished,” said the gallery’s curator Sarah Howgate of the lively drawings by a possibly seven- or eight-year-old Lucian Freud. “The colour is so vivid.”Freud’s childhood drawings are part of a huge archive donated to the NPG after it was accepted by the government in lieu of £2.9m inheritance tax.The archive includes about 47 sketchbooks with more than 800 drawings as well as the 162 drawings that Freud made as a boy before his family fled Nazi Germany in 1933.Howgate said: “What is amazing about them is that they are so beautifully preserved because his mother, Lucie, kept them in envelopes.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Childhood landscape sketch with figures by Lucian Freud, circa 1930s.

Alongside these are Freud’s sketchbooks, which are a kind of diary of the artist’s life, with preparatory drawings intermingled with random notes, telephone numbers and betting tips.One example has stream of consciousness thoughts on why the artist regularly painted naked subjects. “Truth heads into naked people bodies bodies whole complete living naked women avoid facial expression make bodies expressive of feeling,” writes Freud.Howgate said: “He’s thinking about painting naked portraits, although it is quite difficult to understand – it’s very Joycean – but his obsessions are all there.”The display includes a newly discovered self-portrait, going on display for the first time after its recent allocation to the NPG, settling £559,773 of tax.Elsewhere curators have included studies that are connected to important works by Freud, such as a drawing of Lady Caroline Blackwood, which relates to his 1954 painting Hotel Bedroom, and another that is clearly a detail from Large Interior (after Watteau), 1981-3.Howgate said the archive was incredibly rich and would “help us to further understand the studio practice of an artist whose focus and preoccupation was the portrait”.• Lucian Freud Unseen is a free display in Room 40 at the National Portrait Gallery, London until 6 September.
