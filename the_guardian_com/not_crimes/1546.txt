Tacita Dean is an artist who identifies strongly as British, while living abroad. Actually, it’s more precise than that: she identifies as English. Her latest exhibition at the Marian Goodman Gallery, in New York, is entitled, quoting Shakespeare, “... my English breath in foreign clouds”. At its heart is a series of drawings called A Concordance of Fifty American Clouds, in which she uses techniques such as chalk on a blackboard to portray the lofty cloud formations she observed recently while living in Los Angeles. The clouds that glide above Thomas Gainsborough’s fields are silver-coloured veils of national identity Dean is consciously seeing LA, or rather its sky, through English eyes. The exhibition (God, I’d love to see it) also includes a film portrait of David Hockney smoking. Hockney, the original Englishman in LA, is seen through his own personal cloud of cigarette smoke: is smoking partly an attempt to bring the English weather with him?The temperate, rainy, variable and, above all, cloudy weather of Britain and Ireland blows through our artists’ souls. In studying Californian clouds, Dean is consciously thinking of this endless ethereal fascination – as her title, taken from Shakespeare’s Richard II, makes explicit.

The first British painter to see the beauty of the clouds that blossom in these moist skies was Thomas Gainsborough. In his youthful masterpiece Mr and Mrs Andrews (c 1750) he portrays an East Anglian couple against a vista of green fields and clouds threatening rain. The Marxist critic John Berger claimed this is a painting about property and ownership. Nonsense. It is about a far more British subject: the weather.Looks like it’s going to rain, Mr Gainsborough. The clouds that glide above Gainsborough’s fields could not be floating over anywhere but England. They are silver- and pewter-coloured veils of national identity. They are gloomy and beautiful and most of all, mutable. Clouds passing, clouds gathering. An empty sky would be so much duller. The clouds that rise like glowing steam over a woodland in Gainsborough’s late painting The Market Cart (1786) look like a glimpse of heaven. They also look like Britain.The acute observation of clouds that is such a striking achievement of Gainsborough’s art was taken even further by his fellow East Anglian John Constable, whose paintings of clouds were direct models for Dean’s cloud studies because they excluded everything except the sky. They recorded that sky with acute observation, analysed different kinds of clouds, painted the shifting theatre of the upper air with rapt attention. Meanwhile, Constable’s contemporary JMW Turner painted shimmering vaporous skies, the sun through clouds, swirling operas of cloud.

In his 1962 work Man Stood in Front of His House With Rain Descending (The Idiot), blue-grey vapours enfold a man in wetness. But when Hockney moved to Los Angeles, he painted skies without clouds. He gloried in the empty blue of freedom. Perhaps it was looking at Hockney pictures that left Tacita Dean not expecting to see clouds over LA at all. Instead, they were cosmic, strange, almost astrophysical. “Driving down Sunset Boulevard early on in my stay, I was confronted by a voluminous atomic cloud blooming at the end of the road in front of me, back-dropped by a deep blue sky,” she said. It was a foreign sky, seen through very English eyes.
