The Royal Photographic Society has revealed it was not consulted about the controversial decision to move its world-famous photography collection from Bradford’s National Media Museum to the Victoria and Albert in London.In its first public statement on the move since it was announced in February, the society said it would prefer its much-loved collection to remain in Bradford provided the museum remained a well-staffed centre for photography, although it added it would not oppose the proposed move to the V&A if certain conditions are met.However, the Guardian has also learned that eight curators and exhibition staff – including the museum’s curator of photographs – were this week made redundant, dealing another blow to campaigners who have branded the transfer “an act of cultural vandalism”.Judith Cummins, the Labour MP for Bradford South, said: “This latest twist in the saga only strengthens my demand that the decision to relocate the Royal Photographic Society collection from Bradford to London should be halted immediately.“A full independent review should then be undertaken, to ensure that decisions made by the Science Museum Group are conducted in a balanced, impartial, transparent way and crucially with proper consultation.”The Royal Photographic Society (RPS) collection, dating from 1827 to 2016, has been based in Bradford’s National Media Museum since 2003.Among the treasures moving to the V&A are works by the British photography pioneers William Henry Fox Talbot, who invented the negative/positive process for producing photographs, and Julia Margaret Cameron, known for her pre-Raphaelite-inspired portrait photography. The artist David Hockney, film director Mike Leigh and photographer Don McCullin are among more than 80 leading cultural figures calling for the reversal of the decision to move the collection in London. Ed Vaizey, the culture minister, has said he will examine the decision at a meeting with the Science Museum Group, which owns the National Media Museum and whose trustees signed off the move, and Bradford MPs.In the latest twist, the RPS has confirmed it was not notified or involved in any of the discussions to move the collection from the National Media Museum.Nor were the RPS privy to the private bidding process in which only London’s Tate and V&A were given an opportunity to bid for the artistic and cultural “jewels” of Bradford.An RPS spokesman said: “The society would wish to see the collection remain at the National Media Museum if its remit remained as a national museum of photography, properly funded and staffed.“The society has already flagged its concern – in January – at a loss of a single institution dealing with the full breadth of photography across its art, science and technology.”The RPS described the V&A as a “world-class museum of international renown” and said it would have no reason to oppose the move providing that it met four key criteria: “The collection is kept together as a whole and not broken up; our initial agreement with the Science Museum Group is transferred to the new custodians and honoured in full; public access is maintained or enhanced; the collection is seen as a live collection and continues to grow.”The RPS statement came as nine curatorial and exhibition staff at the National Media Museum were made redundant, including its head of photography. The museum said it was recruiting for six new positions in their place.It has also emerged that an exhibition of more than 200 photographs from the RPS collection had 8,000 more visitors in Bradford than it did in London.Drawn by Light was seen by 29,000 people when on display in the north for free, while 21,260 paid £8 for adults and £5 for children to see the show in the Science Museum in London.The numbers, released through a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian, were gathered by door counters, exit surveys and ticket sales.The vast majority of the items from the moving collection are not currently on display, housed instead in Bradford’s research centre, Insight. Last year, the collection at Insight had 500 visits, but access to the research centre is limited to five days each month, with advanced booking needed.The MP for Bradford East, Imran Hussain, called for the decision to move the collection to be “suspended with immediate effect”.He added: “This revelation further illustrates the need for a full review and meaningful consultation before any decision can be taken with regards to moving the collection.”
