Kanye West has cancelled all remaining dates of his Saint Pablo tour after another onstage rant on Saturday.Kanye West cancels LA concert after rant against Beyoncé and Hillary Clinton According to Pitchfork, a representative for the star confirmed that the 21 remaining concerts would not take place and “tickets will be fully refunded at point of purchase”.The news follows West using his Sacramento concert on Saturday to criticize Hillary Clinton, Beyoncé and Mark Zuckerberg and performing just three songs before leaving the stage. He also called out radio stations for playing too much Drake and not enough Frank Ocean and added: “The Saint Pablo tour is more relevant than radio and if y’all keep following old models, your ass is going to be Hillary Clinton.”Earlier in the week, he faced criticism for voicing his support for Donald Trump to a crowd in San Jose and telling black people to “stop focusing on racism”.His words have led to a backlash within the entertainment industry. In a series of tweets, the rapper Talib Kweli criticized West for his damaging remarks.“A genius, an icon. U added greatness to my life. But lifting Trump up kills us. Come home,” he tweeted. He added: “Feelings don’t matter. Facts matter.”Rapper Action Bronson also tweeted: “I’ll be donating a ridiculous amount of NBs and Yeezys to struggling immigrants in NYC.”The reason for the cancellation remains unclear, but a source told TMZ West was “just exhausted. He’s been working around the clock on fashion design.”West has yet to address the cancellation on social media but has added almost 100 blurry photos of a fashion spread to his Instagram after he canceled his Los Angeles concert on Sunday.
