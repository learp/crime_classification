She produced the bag, saying it contained a joey.Face oddity: 'David Bowie of koalas' rescued by Australia Zoo staff “Not quite believing their ears, the officers cautiously unzipped the bag and found this gorgeous boy,” police said in a media statement. “There are many firsts in our job and last night was one of those for officers from the Upper Mount Gravatt tactical crime squad.”The woman’s claims that she was caring for the joey after finding it on a main road in the southern Brisbane suburb of Nathan the previous evening were being examined, police said.Koalas are protected under Queensland’s Nature Conservation Act and cannot be held as pets but the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection gives members of the public 72 hours to hand in wildlife species they find.
