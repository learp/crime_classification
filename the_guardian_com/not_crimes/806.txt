Physical books have been a passion, even an obsession, for most of my life. I have spent an inordinate time in bookshops and libraries. I am, however, grateful to the Guardian online and a “screen” (my tablet) that I could read Simon Jenkins’ article (Books are back. Only the technodazzled thought they would go away, theguardian.com, 13 May). Although partially sighted, I still use the library, buy physical books and persevere with a magnifier – but I find ebooks so much easier if what I want is digitised. I am pleased that sales of physical books are rising, but we shouldn’t dismiss advances in modern technology, and not only to make helpful adaptations to reading. Such advances could also help to make libraries viable – 2014’s Independent Library Report advocated a “national digital network for libraries”.Graham UllathorneChesterfield, Derbyshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
