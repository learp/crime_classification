The surprising omission from John Dugdale’s recommendations for books on rowing (Best books for the Olympics, 6 August) is the 20th century Dutch masterpiece Over den water (1998)  by HM van den Brink. Paul Vincent’s beautiful translation, On the Water (Faber and Faber, 2001), was acclaimed by English reviewers, including the Guardian’s own Daniel Topolski (16 February 2001). This is a unique and enthralling representation in fiction of what competitive rowing feels like. Set in prewar Amsterdam, it tells in exciting and moving detail how the seemingly mismatched coxless pair, shy Anton and self-confident David, are transformed from awkward partners into triumphantly cooperative oarsmen and become, in the process, the truest of friends. Narrated by Anton, who has lost his adored compatriot in the devastation of the second world war, it is a subtle bittersweet evocation of a summer of perfect happiness.Alistair SteadLeeds• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
