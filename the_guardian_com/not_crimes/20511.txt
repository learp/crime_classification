The Oscars have paid tribute to Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, who both died at the end of 2016.Fisher, 60, suffered a heart attack on a plane from London to Los Angeles on Christmas Eve, and died four days later; her mother, Reynolds, died the following day. She was 84. Confirming her death, her son, Todd Fisher said:“The last thing she said this morning was that she was very, very sad about losing Carrie and that she would like to be with her again. Fifteen minutes later she suffered a severe stroke.”The pair concluded the year’s In Memoriam montage at the annual awards ceremony. Fisher was an accomplished comedy actor as well as writer, but remained best known for her work on the Star Wars franchise. In 2010, she said she had asked her co-star (and former lover) Harrison Ford to sing during her Oscars death reel, should she predecease him.“It’s just something I want,” she said. “Because they did that thing with John Hughes, they brought out all these actors who worked with him. So I just figured they’ll bring out, depending on, of course, when it happens, there’s a lot of people they can bring out. He’s going to sing Melancholy Wookie.”Reynolds was best known for her role in Singin’ in the Rain, the classic musical to which this year’s leading Oscars contender, La La Land, owes a significant debt.
