A cockle bed may be closed down in an effort to stop unlicensed and ill-equipped fisherman putting lives at risk there.Cocklers have had to be rescued from the Ribble Estuary in Lancashire on 26 occasions in the last two months. On Tuesday, checks were carried out by a number of agencies and found 50 cocklers fishing without permits and 15 boats that were deemed to be unsafe.The Fisheries minister Richard Benyon said tough decisions would have to be taken if the activity continued, describing it as "reckless."He said he shared the concerns of Fylde MP Mark Menzies, who said the numbers of inexperienced and unlicensed cocklers could result in fatalities.Benyon said: "There are legitimate cockle fisherman who have long-established rights to fish there, and do so with all the health and safety measures that you should expect."But there are a lot of people coming in now to do this illegally, or to do this in a way that is completely reckless for their own lives and those who might have to rescue them.The Minister for the Natural Environment and Fisheries said there would possibly be a review of the by-laws that govern the fishery, and they would make sure police, the local authority, Inshore Fisheries Conservation Authority (IFCA) and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency were working well together.Up to 400 cocklers a day have been gathering at Foulnaze bank between Lytham and Southport since the cockle beds were opened on 1 September.The beds are due to be closed again in April but the RNLI said some inexperienced cocklers are ignoring weather and tidal conditions to gather as many cockles as possible within the period.Phil Woodward, Fylde Council's chief executive, told the Lancashire Evening Post: "Residents have been shocked and angry at the behaviour of some of the cocklers and one of Fylde Council's main roles is to represent their interests."It is clear from Tuesday's operation that a fair proportion of the cocklers have been unlicensed and have been working in an unsafe way. That has placed extra burdens on the emergency services."There have been too many reports of litter and unsavoury practices such as urination on the beach and in other areas near the Lytham slipway by a minority of cocklers who have no concern for residents. "Anti-social behaviour willl not be tolerated. The council has instituted litter patrols and has kept the nearby toilets open for 24 hours. It has all cost council taxpayers money and it is only right that the council taxpayers have their costs defrayed by the new beach charges." Cocklers will be charged £15 a day to park their vehicles on the beach.It is estimated that the bed situated two miles offshore and which becomes exposed at low tide, contains about £8m worth of shellfish.Cockles, which are mainly exported to Europe, fetch about £1,200 a tonne.But in February 2004, 23 Chinese cockle pickers died further around the coast at Morecambe Bay after they were swept away by strong currents.
