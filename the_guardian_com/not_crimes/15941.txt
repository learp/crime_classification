Dawn Mander is a “sandgrown’un” – a person born and bred in Blackpool, the UK seaside resort famous for its Pleasure Beach amusement park. Mander’s photographs of the town try to provide an honest portrait of a place which – despite its late 19th-century and early 20th-century heyday as a booming holiday destination – has seen economic decline as the rise of cheap international travel took visitors elsewhere. The town is now the most Eurosceptic place in the north-west of England and pro-Brexit (despite EU laws being responsible for its beaches getting cleaner and safer).The dent in the tourism industry took its toll on the town’s landscape. “I love Blackpool, I think it’s a great place to live and grow up, but there’s still a huge amount that needs doing to rejuvenate the town,” says Mander. “Many areas, especially those away from the main promenade, are very neglected with streets of closed and often derelict shops. I would love to see more investment in those areas, restoring the faded glamour and kitsch that I so love trying to capture in my photography.”An insider’s cultural guide to Blackpool: bovver boots and ballroom dancing Mander explains that through her photographs she wants to portray “her” Blackpool, beyond its well-known landmarks and attractions. “As well as the noisy chaos of the town in school holidays, I like to photograph the empty streets at the end of the season, as well as the shuttered shops, closed street food vendors and ice cream kiosks.”“Blackpool is a creative town with a thriving independent arts sector,” she adds, “and I hope people begin to realise there’s more to it than stag dos, hen parties and drunken Saturday nights.”As Blackpool looks ahead to large regeneration projects, Mander’s photographs catch the traces of the town’s former glory. But if last year’s LightPool festival is anything to go by, the seaside resort’s traditions may well be reinvigorated rather than replaced.Follow @guardiancities on Instagram and tag your best city shots with #guardiancities
