Mötoheard frontman Ian “Lemmy” Kilmister died of prostate cancer, according to his official death certificate. Congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia were also listed as causes, according to the document obtained by TMZ. When Kilmister died last month, news reports attributed it to “extremely aggressive cancer” but the details were not known. The notoriously hard-living musician had been battling health problems for some time. Kilmister was a diabetic and in 2013 was diagnosed with a haematoma.In an interview with the Guardian in 2015, he revealed that he had reduced his cigarette consumption to one packet a week, and had stopped drinking Jack Daniels and Coke – although this had been replaced with vodka and orange. Around 300,000 fans tuned in to watch the British rocker’s memorial service, which was held in Los Angeles and broadcast live on YouTube. At his funeral, the Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl said that Kilmister was “not only that badass-looking, whisky-drinking rock star, but he had the biggest heart. He set such a great example because he was so kind to everyone.”Kilmister died on 28 December 2015 after being diagnosed with the cancer on Boxing Day. Mötorhead have since announced that they will no longer function as a band.
