Badger culling is breaking international rules to protect wildlife because of the negative effects it could have on other species, campaigners have said.Wildlife charities have launched a challenge to the government's policy of culling badgers in England to tackle tuberculosis in cattle, claiming officials failed to conduct sufficient risk assessments on the impacts it could have on protected wildlife.The Humane Society International UK, Care for the Wild and the Badger Trust claim the policy breaches the Bern Convention on conserving European wildlife and habitats, to which the UK has been a signatory since 1982.In a complaint to the convention's secretariat, they said the badger cull could have a negative impact on a range of species such as song birds and small mammals affected by the removal of badgers from their ecosystem.The groups also said the cull was unnecessary because bovine TB could be controlled in cattle without culling badgers, which are a protected species.Research showed removing badgers could affect numbers of other predators – for example increasing fox numbers, which can damage protected species such as ground-nesting birds, they said.The government has pushed ahead with two pilot culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset, claiming culling is necessary as part of a package of measures to tackle TB in cattle.But opponents of the controversial policy say it is ineffective and inhumane and that other approaches, such as tighter measures on farms and developing vaccines for cattle and badgers, should be pursued.Mark Jones, vet and executive director for HSI UK said the groups were taking their challenge to the Bern Convention with evidence to show badger culling was "potentially very bad news for the wider ecosystem"."The cull zones and surrounding areas are home to many protected endangered species of birds and mammals, and habitats such as heathlands, grasslands, meadows and forests."Removing or displacing large numbers of badgers from nature's delicate balance could be catastrophic for some of these species and habitats, so we're asking Bern to intervene and protect all of our wildlife from this disastrous cull."Dominic Dyer, of the Badger Trust and Care for the Wild, said: "We hope that this is the beginning of the end of badger culling in the UK. "The UK government has cut corners and turned a blind eye to the damage this policy will do both to the badgers themselves, and the rare birds and other animals which will be affected when badgers are culled."A Defra spokesman said: “Bovine TB is a devastating disease for our cattle and dairy industries which is why we are determined to do everything we can to combat it. Our policy was reviewed by the Bern Secretariat in 2012 and again earlier this year – and on both occasions they were satisfied that we complied with our obligations under the convention.”
