A BBC radio presenter who labelled anti-gay views as bigotry was in serious breach of the corporation’s editorial guidelines, the BBC Trust has ruled.Iain Lee left the BBC Three Counties Radio breakfast show two weeks after the interview with Libby Powell, a lawyer for Christian Concern, who appeared to defend a former prison worker who was disciplined after citing verses from the Bible that listed homosexuality among a list of sins.Lee, the former presenter of Channel 4’s 11 O’Clock Show, told Powell: “Do you support bigotry? Yes, homophobia is bigotry … I guess you don’t know what the definition of bigotry is – and considering you’re from a legal centre, that’s a little bit worrying.”BBC's Iain Lee leaves show after condemning guest's anti-gay views The preacher and former prison worker, who was claiming constructive dismissal at an employment tribunal, also appeared on the show and was told by Lee: “I find the view that being gay is sinful, I find that view completely repugnant and disgraceful.”Lee added: “I find what you’re saying so obnoxious … what you’re preaching here is hate … it’s poisonous and it’s hateful. God you’re obnoxious.”Both Lee and the station later issued an apology, although Lee told the BBC Trust’s editorial standards committee that he stands by both interviews in terms of their content and tone.He told the committee that the only part of the output he felt was inappropriate was his comment in which he referred to some Christians as behaving in a “horrible, patronising, superior way”.The breakfast show interview took place on 3 November last year, with Lee departing the station later that month.In its ruling published on Tuesday, the trust said the interviewees were “not treated with respect but instead faced significant personal criticism and challenge and that, overall, the tone of the interviews was inappropriate”.It expressed concern that it reflected a pattern across BBC local radio of presenters conducting interviews in an inappropriate manner. A training programme was due to be rolled out across its local radio stations in the first quarter of this year to prevent further breaches of the guidelines.“Trustees had been concerned to note that there had been recent occasions when other local radio stations had broadcast output that had included the presenter’s own views on a particular subject,” it said.“They noted that these included the broadcast of comments by a presenter that were potentially offensive and which exceeded the expectations of the audience. “They believed that the BBC’s local radio output had a critical role to play in terms of enabling the widest possible public debate and that local radio presenters had considerable leeway to be provocative to engage audiences. “However, they considered that where presenters appeared to defend a particular stand on an issue in an inappropriately combative manner the effect was not to broaden debate but was likely to be the opposite – as potential callers might be less likely to contact a radio station if they felt they would not receive a fair hearing.”The ruling comes at a critical time for BBC local radio, which has lost audiences in recent years with its future under the spotlight amid reports that it may be merged with Radio 5 Live, a proposal that was mooted, and later rejected, in a previous round of cost-cutting five years ago.
