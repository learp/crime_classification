We’re only just into day three of Advertising Week Europe, and it has already thrown up its fair share of controversy – not least in the shape of the views expressed by Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone on Tuesday on immigration, gender equality and Vladimir Putin. However, Monkey notes the whole event could have descended into a brawl within the first hour when News UK chief customer officer, Chris Duncan, took the stage to discuss adblocking with Brendan Eich, the founder of Mozilla.Why would Monkey worry the relatively mundane issue of adblocking could have led to fisticuffs? Well News Corp – parent company of Duncan’s employer – is one of a dozen major US media companies that have sent a cease and desist order to Eich over his adblocking browser, Brave. Luckily the panel was perfectly cordial, though Monkey suspects the lawyers’ letters are less so.
