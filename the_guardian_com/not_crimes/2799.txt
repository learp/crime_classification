Fear not, Europhiles, for love is not lost. If you’re downbeat about Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, know that 48% of the country are with you, and one of them might just be your soulmate.No, honestly ... there is a new dating app in development that aims to let you meet other Remain voters so that you don’t have to go through the pain alone. The idea for “Remainder” started off as a joke between “two ordinary voters” on Friday afternoon, but after receiving a huge number of sign-ups since the website went live, the pair are trying to make the app a reality.Billing itself as the “dating and social app for the 48%”, Remainder is in the early-formation stage at the moment, but discussions with a dating app developer means a launch could be expected soon, the team behind it told the Guardian.The website asks: “Voted to Remain, and looking for love? What better way to recover than hooking up with someone who shares your sense of existential dread?”In a press release, the team behind Remainder explained: “We think everyone’s entitled to their views and we know that there are many sensible, kind and intelligent leave voters but our audience is ‘Remainers’ and we’re trying to provide a little comfort for these heartbroken voters.“We created it because all the remain voters we know seemed so depressed. Our Facebook feed had turned into a neverending funeral service.“We thought the best way of recovering must be to go out for a few drinks with someone who’s in the same boat. After all ‘a problem shared is a problem halved’ and what we never managed to give Brussels was our British sense of humour.”The target for sign-ups is over 16 million, the team said, and a crowdfunding site has at the time of writing received four backers.Early sign-ups and funders will be in line for invitations to exclusive events in remain-voting cities such as London, Brighton, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and Edinburgh. “We don’t have heaps of cash to throw at it, so we’re just dependent on the goodwill of friends, friends of friends, and fellow ‘Remainers’,” the team added.
