Emmerdale escapes investigation after 550 complaints over dognapping plot It’s Halloween in soapland, so carve your Phil Mitchell-headed pumpkins, jangle your bucketful of ridiculous storylines, and let’s go trick-or-treating. Horror stalked Emmerdale as village bunny-boiler Emma Barton caused a communal car crash that left a lot of actors wondering if their contracts were about to come to an abrupt end.Things started innocently enough with Paddy and Marlon on one of their legendary boys’ trips, dressed as giant fluffy bunnies. Emma, meanwhile, was nursing her husband James, laid low with a broken leg. Nursing, that is, in the Misery sense of the word, because she’d discovered he’d been doing more than just helping earthy fox-of-the-Dales Moira herd sheep. If her 80s wedding dress wasn’t horrific enough, the meat cleaver, slaughtered chicken and dead cat she wielded were the stuff of nightmares.As James made a bid to escape, he ended up in a tussle on a bridge over Hotten’s highway to hell and Emma pushed him off it and into the path of, well, everybody. He landed on Ashley’s car. Crash! Speeding Pierce rubbernecked at the accident, ploughing into a van. Bang! Paddy and Rhona flipped their car trying to avoid the pile-up, while two-headed love beast “Robron” swerved off the road and into a water-filled quarry. Just as Rob was proposing to Aaron, too. Wallop! As Rhona’s spleen, Aaron’s liver and James’s punctured lung left their lives hanging in the balance, there was a funeral looming. Ultimately, it was James who was killed off, while Emma sat around looking shifty as the police grilled her on what went down.

Cockroach of the cobbles Gail locked volatile son David in the Bistro’s Shiraz-drenched dungeon until Clayton’s trial was over, as she feared what he’d do to his beloved Kylie’s killer. Once David escaped, his fury prompted him to douse his car in petrol, drive down the street and run over his daughter Lily and brave Gary Windass, who’d stepped in to save her. Thankfully both survived, but resident butty-server Anna Windass ended up with her legs on fire and is now laid up in hospital.In other news, Tracy Barlow was furious. Nothing new there. This is a woman who was the “only person in the cinema cheering for the iceberg” when she watched Titanic. This time her ire was stoked by dad Ken, who was about to abandon her in her hour of need to selfishly head off on a cruise around Italy. “You know how much I’ve got going on at the moment and you’re swanning around like a geriatric Jack Sparrow,” stormed Tracy. Well, she does have to run the flower shop and look after septic daughter Amy. And poor Tracyluv has only got the one kidney. But when Ken’s rufty-tufty son Peter returned and wound his dad up, Ken collapsed with a stroke. The only grand tour the Street’s Michael Palin will be doing now is of the hospital corridor.

The ex-prostitute/troublemaker strutted in like a rock star, dripping with fake tan and attitude. Snobby Marnie was her first victim as she cast her critical eye over her wannabe big-shot restaurant. “They say every time a bottle of cheap champagne’s opened you can hear the sound of Dom Pérignon turning in his grave,” she purred, before getting busy with a scam to fleece the locals out of cash by pretending to be a property developer.Cut Jude open and she bleeds ’Oaks fun, which was much needed, as doomed lovers Jade and Alfie were separated for good. Watching cancer-suffering Jade die in hospital with Alfie by her side was a moving moment. Yet life went on, with Jude trussed up like she was about to sing for survival on X Factor Fright Night as she geared up for a Halloween Spooktacular. While that was going on, serial killer Nico’s freaky obsession with Peri reached new heights when she locked her in a bunker and fed her poisoned cheese sandwiches. Tasty!

Walford’s top undertakers Pam and Les Coker have always been festooned with misery, so it’s a relief to see them hand over the embalming fluid and ship out to Worthing, where there’ll be more room for Les’s cross-dressing alter-ego Christine. Les got a comedy send-off, lurking in a coffin while the others waxed lyrical about his penchant for pickled eggs. We’ll stick with the poisoned sarnies, thanks, Les.
