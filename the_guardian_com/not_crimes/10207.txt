This is a lovely story, the sort you would read while toasting marshmallows around the campfire, spooking and teasing your friends.The main character is a little kind girl called Ottoline. Her companion (and best friend) is called Mr Munroe. He is a hairy creature found in a bog in Norway by Ottoline’s parents who are explorers. One day, in the park, Ottoline makes a new friend Cecily. When she finds out that Cecily goes to the Alice B Smith School for the Differently Gifted, Ottoline is eager to attend that school, too. Soon she finds out that a ghost haunts the school.Does Ottoline find out the truth behind this mystery? Does she discover her own special talent? This book is imaginative and beautifully illustrated, full of gorgeous, intricate black and while drawings. I think this book is definitely a “must have book”. It teaches us all how important it is to discover our own unique talents. I have met Chris Riddell, the author and illustrator of this book, and he is absolutely brilliant. Funny, interesting and imaginative as well so no wonder his books are great. I have read the rest of the series and I would thoroughly recommend them all.Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop
