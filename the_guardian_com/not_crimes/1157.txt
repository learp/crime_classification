A Beatles fan has had his dream creation realised after Lego launched its Yellow Submarine set including mini figures of the much-loved band.Lego models of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were unveiled after Kevin Szeto put forward the request to the toy company’s ideas section.The 550-piece set allows fans to take a surreal trip under the sea in a yellow submarine in Lego’s version of the 1968 musical fantasy film inspired by The Beatles.Eight Days A Week: how Ron Howard brought the Beatles back to life The animated adventure was a groundbreaking surreal tale featuring characters from Beatles songs, but with actors voicing the band members.The Lego set even includes a mini figure of Jeremy Hillary Boob – a fictional character from the film voiced by Dick Emery, who describes himself as an “eminent physicist, polyglot classicist, prize-winning botanist, hard-biting satirist, talented pianist, good dentist too”.Szeto, an amateur musician, said: “I have always been drawn to the music of The Beatles. The creation of the Yellow Submarine model was really my way of showing my affection for The Beatles, as well as trying to pay a small tribute to The Beatles phenomenon.
