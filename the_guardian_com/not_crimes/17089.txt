She told the Guardian:“George was always a perfectionist. When we played China, we were the first western band to go there, which was a bizarre experience. They were making a feature film and we had a huge film crew. After the first few scenes were shot, George and Andy looked at the rushes of the film and George was seriously unhappy with his hair, so he flew out his sister Melanie, who was a hairdresser, to sort it.“He knew exactly how he wanted to look and how he wanted his music to sound. Even though my colleagues and I were the backing singers on all the live gigs and the live videos, he rarely used session singers in the studio, because he was so brilliant he did all his own backing vocals – infuriating for us, but what a star!“On the first tour, amongst the merchandise were dolls of George and Andy. The guys would have a little competition at each gig to see whose doll sold the most. George used to get quite miffed if Andrew Ridgeley’s sold more!“Years later I was invited to his Cowboys and Angels birthday party. We had to go in fancy dress. I was eight and a half months pregnant so couldn’t really go as an angel, but managed a cowboy outfit. It was all just after the shenanigans had gone on with George being arrested in the public loos, and the invitations said: ‘Please note, there will be no public conveniences so please go before you come.’ He had a fabulous sense of humour, that’s why he was so beloved.“I’m not sure he ever got over the death of his mother, Lesley. She was the most lovely woman, so proud of her son, and we had several long discussions about the horror of losing someone to cancer so young.”Updatedat 6.40pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.35pm GMT16:35Daily Mirror associate editor Kevin Maguire’s take on the story:Kevin Maguire (@Kevin_Maguire)We should remember George Michael was the son of a Greek Cypriot, his dad coming to Britain in 1950.

If anything – as he told Kirsty Young when he was a Desert Island Discs castaway in 2007 – it kept bobbing buoyantly, untarnished by scandal. With Michael, there was no such thing as “reputational damage”. from Caroline here.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.19pm GMT16:19Huffington Post writer Aaron Vallely tweets: Aaron Vallely (@Vallmeister)We have lost some of the most iconic champions of individuality recently.

Photograph: Samuel Kubani/AFP/Getty ImagesGeorge Michael was no stranger to the headlines. His private life was often offered up for public consumption, but his philanthropy was not as widely reported. Since his death, stories have emerged that reveal his generous, often spontaneous, acts of kindness.The star often kept aside tickets for NHS staff at his concerts, and once gave an entire special concert free of charge for nurses as a thank you for the care they had given his mother a decade earlier. here.Updatedat 3.57pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.22pm GMT15:22Readers are sharing their memories of meeting George – this one from kirstimckee adds to the stories we’ve been hearing today about the artist’s generosity: “When I was training as a doctor, on one of my first weekends on call in a North London hospital, a patient was transferred to our ward. It was a chauffeur who worked for lots of rock stars, who had been in a very serious accident. I was called up to talk to the family, who were Greek-Cypriot, and I realised while talking to them that one of the people in the room was George Michael. Half an hour later his personal doctor gave me a call and we were asked to transfer the patient to a private hospital. George arranged for everything and, I assume, paid for it all. I was a fan of his music but this revealed a side of him I had not seen before (and he rose even further in my estimation).”hvadaltsaa: “I was a regular at Double Bass, the club night that Steve Strange used to run on a Tuesday. It was more of a question of who didn’t go there than who did. I met George Michael as we were dancing the night away. The next day, some tabloid or other had a shot of a woman whom they claimed was his partner. It was an education for me in how sometimes the media write the stories they want when they can’t get the stories that they would really like.”  ...Mel Cameron: “My first concert was at the Birmingham NEC and in the days before mobile phones and cameras - the flash created on his Everything She Wants video was so cleverly created, by George shouting to the thousands of adorning fans “On the count of 123” and suddenly they all pressed their automatic camera flash and WHAM you had that amazing flash on the video.”  ...Share your tributes and memories by clicking on the blue ‘Contribute’ button.
