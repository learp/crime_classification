After being closed for eight years, Hastings Pier has reopened to the public following a £14.2m restoration project. The historic pier was shut down for safety reasons in 2008 and was then almost completely destroyed by a fire in 2010.

The Lottery gave £11.4m to support the reconstruction, while 3,000 shareholders bought a stake in the project at £100 a share.

From Wednesday 27 April, the bar, restaurant and a traditional funfair in the pier’s pavilion building will be open. This will be followed shortly by the opening of a new cafe and roof terrace. The Hastings Pier Charity believe the new pier will bring 300,000 more visitors to the town each year, contributing more than a £1m to the local economy.hastingspier.org.uk
