20th Century Women review – Mike Mills's new film is poignant and delicious Director Mike Mills’s autobiographical 20th Century Women is not just about the three women of his title, his own 55-year-old single mother Dorothea (Annette Bening) and the two younger women, Abbie and Julie (Greta Gerwig and Elle Fanning), she recruits to help raise her 15-year-old son Jamie (Lucas Jade Zuman). Set in the last year of the introspective, self-questioning US that went back to sleep after Reagan won the 1980 election, it’s an elegy for the time in which they lived, for the lovely, dilapidated beach town that Santa Barbara once was, and for a particular questing, optimistic late-70s state of mind, all now utterly vanished.Mills evokes his boyhood period in a flurry of details: a Talking Heads: 77 T-shirt; a totemic copy of Our Bodies, Ourselves; a primitive pregnancy-test kit; Jimmy Carter’s “Malaise” speech of 1979. But he also frames it by stretching the arc of his story, letting us see what is soon to be lost. As Dorothea points out in the voiceover: “They don’t know that this is the end of punk. They don’t know that Reagan is coming.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  20th Century Women trailer: Mike Mills’ new film starring Greta Gerwig – videoGrounding this coming-of-age story is Bening’s warm and wise performance as Dorothea, born in 1924, Depression-raised, trained as a pilot in the second world war, the first woman draughtsman in her architecture practice, but, sadly, too early a pioneer to make much difference. She’s a little daffy and New Age, but her life is a jerry-rigged masterpiece of strength, barter and klutzy ingenuity. Of course she embarrasses the hell out of Jamie, which is why she needs help to keep him on the straight and narrow. Which they manage, sort of.‘People just want a bully’ - director Mike Mills on how the US picks its president Their lodger, Abbie, is a failed escapee from Santa Barbara, “where everybody was so happy it made her want to scream”, just back from a New York that broke her. She embraces punk partly out of blind fury that she can’t bear children. Julie has been Jamie’s friend since kindergarten, but is tired of him “now that you’re horny all the time”. She tries teaching him to smoke, Abbie takes him to punk shows in LA, while the only man around is sweet, dim 40-year-old handyman William (Billy Crudup), confused by post-60s California morals but delighted about all the easy sex he’s getting. Somehow, by trial and error, a boy is raised to be a man.

I wonder what, in 40 years’ time, an elegy for the last months of the pre-Trump US will look like.20th Century Women is out in UK cinemas from Friday 10 February
