Christmas, they say, is all about tradition. Here in GuardianWitness’s capacious underwhelming department, we have traditions of our own. Underwhelming ones.Last year, we asked for your unimpressive photos from the Christmas season. You responded halfheartedly, with photos of middling Christmas parties, average Santas, and festive decoration attempts that cried, “help me”.We were delighted with your efforts, so we’re asking you to do it all again this year. If you have taken a Christmas-related image that fills you with a profound sense of listlessness, then you’ve come to the right place.How to contributeShare your underwhelming Christmas related photos and stories by clicking on the blue “Contribute” button on this article.
