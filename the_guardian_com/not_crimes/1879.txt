Recomposed by Max RichterAs a composer who also attempts to bridge the gap between musical genres, Richter’s minimalist recomposition of the seasons speaks to me in volumes. Although Richter is quoted as saying he discarded 75% of Vivaldi’s original material, the soul of the original is still there in the phased and looped original musical cells he beautifully reharmonises.

There is a lot of jazz in this piece, with its syncopated rhythms and harmonic language. I also have a soft spot for the romantic violin solos.

It shares a lot in style with the robot-pop of Kraftwerk (a favourite group of mine). Even on 80s synths, the strength of Vivaldi’s writing still works.

I find the idea of using this piece in particular an interesting choice for a ballet. The dancers add another layer of description to Vivaldi’s already programmatic work.
