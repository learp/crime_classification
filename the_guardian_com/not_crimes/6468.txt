I just love these stories from actors who went to public school denying that it helped them in any way to get a job (Working-class actors don’t land the best roles because ‘it’s fashionable to sound posh’, 1 March). Now we have Tom Hollander providing us with the explanation – there are more posh parts requiring posh accents. I take it that working-class boys and girls can’t manage these posh accents quite so well as their Harrovian and Etonian counterparts. There’s silly old me thinking Hollander’s parents sent him to a posh school to give him a leg-up in whatever career he chose. I wonder what his explanation would be for the legal profession (“Lawyers have lots of posh clients so they need to communicate with them properly”), or ambassadors (“They have to give posh parties for foreign diplomats”), or top brass in the military (“They need to give orders in clear RP”).Arthur GouldLoughborough • So Tom Hollander thinks it’s just fashionable to be posh and privilege is not a factor in getting a top acting job. His education at the private fee-paying Abingdon school, current boarding fees £36,960 per annum, even equipped him to become an actor without going to drama school. I am sure his old school is still very fashionable.Adrian TownsendGarsington, Oxfordshire• With regard to Tom Hollander’s naive observations: I am glad that you produced statistics that show his anecdotal opinions regarding public school-educated actors to be incorrect. The furore about the Oscars and your G2 interview with Geena Davis stand in contrast to his mistaken view that “the barriers people were facing … don’t exist now”.Barriers are going up globally against working-class people, women and minority ethnic groups. The French had it right in 1789!Linda KarlsenWhitstable, Kent• The print-edition version of your article about Tom Hollander didn’t say whether Abingdon, the school he attended, was independent or state. Is this a reflection of the private education of journalists among the Guardian staff?Anne StrachanManchester • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
