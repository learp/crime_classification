Twilight is magical to gardeners, most particularly to those of us who work full time, and dash out to grab a few minutes’ gardening fix post-work, before darkness descends. Right now, dusk is moving in alarmingly fast. It falls more than an hour earlier than it did at the beginning of the month, as we hurtle towards the day the clocks go back, on October 30. These are the last of the dusk gardening days.Dusk and twilight are beautiful, evocative words and times. They are also little more complex than you might think. I am currently crowdfunding to create a reinvention of the rural almanac, which will contain tables on moon phases, sunrises and sunsets, the sky at night, seasonal gardening and food. A book about the measure of things. And so I have been researching twilight and have found that there is more to it than I thought. There are of course many beautifully poetic names for dusk – dimmet, the gloaming, simmer dim in Scotland, the dimpsy in Devon – but there are also official names for each of the three stages of twilight and dusk. So here are civil twilight, nautical twilight and astronomical twilight and their dusks explained, followed by the times you can expect each tonight. (Times given are for Birmingham, it being roughly in the middle of the UK.)Civil twilight and duskSuch a polite term, and so expressive of the period when the light starts to fade, but you can still comfortably go about your business without the need for artificial light. I see neighbours gardening in proximity and chatting over the garden fence during civil twilight. More precisely, it means the time between sunset and the moment that the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon. The moment that it reaches 6 degrees below is called civil dusk.Tonight’s civil twilight will begin at sunset at 6.49pm and end at 7.23pm.Nautical twilight and duskThe term dates back to when sailors used the stars for navigation, because during nautical twilight – the spell when the sun is between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon – most stars can be seen with the naked eye. Nautical dusk is the moment the sun reaches 12 degrees below.Tonight’s nautical twilight will begin at 7.23pm and end at 8.02pm.Astronomical twilight and duskThe sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon, and this is the spell when there is still a little light in the sky, but before true dark. After astronomical dusk at 18 degrees below, all stars will be visible.Astronomical twilight begins tonight at 8.02pm and ends at 8.43pmSnatch these moments of gardening gloaming now, because within a month, night will have very nearly tacked itself on to the end of the working day.And if you would like to have this sort of day-to-day knowledge about the turning of the earth to refer to day after day, please consider pledging to support my crowdfunded project, The New Almanac, by pre-buying a first edition via on my Unbound page.
