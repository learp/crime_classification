Fans of Frank Ocean, rejoice: the enigmatic R&B artist has finally released new music.A 45-minute “visual album” was released through Apple Music at midnight ET. Somewhat appropriately, given the protracted speculation over when Ocean would break his creative silence, it is titled Endless.In announcing Endless, Apple also indicated that “more from Frank” would be released over the weekend, leading fans to assume that his second album is nearly, finally here. Then titled Boys Don’t Cry, the hotly anticipated follow-up to 2012’s Channel Orange was tipped for release last month.Decoding Frank Ocean: secret messages, boomboxes and Boys Don't Cry When that deadline came and went, fans were somewhat appeased on 1 August with the launch of a four-day live stream at boysdontcry.co, set in a warehouse with desks and audio equipment lining the back wall, featuring a man – presumed to be Ocean – cutting wood.Social media users embraced the mystery with gusto, observing as the stream progressed that the Ocean figure appeared to be assembling a spiral staircase reaching to the roof of the warehouse.The stream, which contained snippets of music but no vocals, ended on August 4 – with no new release from Ocean.On Tuesday, Ocean’s producer Malay explained the delay in an interview on Reddit, saying: “Art cannot be rushed.“It’s about making sure the perfect aesthetic for the situation has been reached, to do that takes constant tweaking, trial and error ... That goes for any creative [situation].”Nearly three weeks on from its launch, the live stream reappeared late on Thursday, this time to the soundtrack of what appeared to be complete songs, leading fans to conclude that Ocean was streaming his much-anticipated album.Apple Music (@AppleMusic)“ENDLESS”A film by Frank Ocean.Now on Apple Music. #ENDLESShttps://t.co/IKMm2PNsUH pic.twitter.com/nlLxXoQ296August 19, 2016Endless opens with At Your Best (You Are Love) by the Isley Brothers, which was notably covered by Aaliyah.
