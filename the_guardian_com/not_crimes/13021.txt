Barbra Streisand, an ardent Hillary Clinton supporter, has gone all in to attack Clinton’s Republican rival Donald Trump in a blogpost she penned for the Huffington Post. “Trump says Hillary doesn’t look presidential?” Streisand writes. “What does that mean ... coming from a guy who looks like a raccoon in a tanning bed ... with a flying squirrel on his head? That’s what a president is supposed to look like? A wrestler who dies [sic] his hair blonde?”Barbra Streisand review – a legend's triumphant Brooklyn homecoming Streisand covers plenty of ground in her impassioned plea to voters. She criticizes NBC morning personality Matt Lauer for mishandling a live primetime forum with Trump (“Many in the media ... are too entertained to correct [Trump’s] lies”); applauds President Obama’s “incredible policy work”; accuses Republican party members of playing “dirty”; and laments how Clinton isn’t justly recognized for her accomplishments because of her gender (“It goes back to something I’ve felt for many years ... Strong women, powerful women have always been suspect”). Most of her essay, however, is dedicated to bashing Trump for “spreading and reflecting bigotry and hatred” throughout America.“We cannot allow America to fall into the hands of a narcissist who has shown no regard for anyone but himself ... a bigoted and misogynist reality-TV character with no political experience and no qualms about lying loudly and often,” she urges. For Streisand, there is “NO equivalency” between the two candidates. “Only Hillary Clinton has the skills, the knowledge, the temperament and the compassion to lead this nation,” she writes.Streisand last addressed the election in a lighter way, appearing on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in August, to duet a pointed rendition of Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better with Fallon, who dressed as Trump.
