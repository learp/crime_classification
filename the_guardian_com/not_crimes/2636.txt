Samphire is a juicy green shoot eaten as a delicacy with fish dishes. It has a briny taste because it grows in saltwater.After the summer solstice is the traditional start of the samphire harvest. The shoots are picked at dawn each day on mudflats along the coast and river estuaries, especially in the Wash of Norfolk, and then rushed to market. Samphire is such an unassuming plant, almost prehistoric-looking, with tiny leaves and small thin flowers. But this humble little plant is also our first line of defence against storms and rising sea levels that batter the coastline and lead to serious erosion.Samphire’s remarkable strength is colonising muddy coasts and estuaries, where its mat of roots binds the soft mud and creates a foothold for other salt-loving plants to grow therefore aiding the development of salt marshes. And, although these marshes may not look glamorous, they absorb the power of waves far better than manmade sea walls. With about 17% of the UK’s coast facing erosion, a number of projects are tearing down sea walls and sacrificing land to develop into salt marshes as a buffer against wild seas.As if these credentials weren’t remarkable enough, the hardy samphire and the other plants on the salt marsh also trap and store a sizeable amount of carbon, a greater contribution than forests covering similar-sized areas. They do this by means of photosynthesis and by trapping organic detritus washed up on the tides.In olden days, the plant was also used for glassmaking because its ashes are rich in sodium carbonate, which is needed for melting sand into glass, hence the plant’s other name: glasswort.
