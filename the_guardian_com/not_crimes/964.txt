Baron Cohen said that Queen members Roger Taylor and Brian May, who are working as music producers on the film, had different ideas about how much of the film should be focused on Mercury. May later denied the claim, saying Baron Cohen “became an arse”.The film is scheduled to begin shooting early next year.
