For those of us smitten with their saline charms, oysters are one of few foodstuffs immediately evocative of celebration. Whether borne aloft through a noisy restaurant on a silver platter, or slurped from the shell on a pebbly beach, they scream special occasion – yet even among their many fans, they remain an occasional treat in Britain, despite the fact our waters contain some of the finest bivalves in the world.A survey conducted by Morrisons, which put them on sale at 25p each earlier this year, found that a quarter of people were put off oysters by the perception they were expensive (generally they tend to come in between 50–80p a pop), and I suspect worries about food poisoning must deter a few more (although, in truth, as long as they’re tightly closed, and you keep them somewhere cool, with a damp tea towel over the top until you’re ready to eat them, it’s pretty low-risk stuff).Bringing oysters back home to Britain It’s hard to beat them on the half shell, perhaps with a dash of Tabasco or shallot vinaigrette if you must but, for a luxurious Christmas treat for a select group of friends (because, even at 50p each, four oysters are definitely better than one), I can’t think of a better upgrade than oysters Rockefeller, a New Orleans classic so named, according to its creator Jules Alciatore of Antoine’s restaurant, “because I know no other name rich enough for their richness”. Simon Hopkinson describes these gratinated green shellfish as “the best hot oyster dish I know. Period.” That’s tha, then.The original recipe is a closely guarded secret, however – and one which many have tried to replicate. Including, of course, me.

That said, it would seem a crime to do anything to our delicate native oyster before savouring its subtly lovely flavour – even a squeeze of lemon feels like sacrilege.The more assertive rock variety, however, is fair game, and its deeper shell is also a better shape for grilling, allowing the animal itself to stay almost raw while the topping melts and bubbles on top. (Folklore has it that the recipe was developed as a substitute for escargots, which proved less abundant on the Louisiana coast than oysters, so if anyone knows of a bivalve with a peculiarly muddy, vegetal flavour, it might be worth a try.)

Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the GuardianThe greensThe most striking thing about oysters rockefeller is its vibrant colour – often achieved, as in chefs Simon Hopkinson, Richard Corrigan, Pierre Franey and Bon Appétit magazine’s recipes, with pureed spinach, although purists insist this is not authentic. Indeed, food writer Malcolm Hebert, the son of New Orleans restauranteurs, claimed “I was told by Bernard Guste of Antoine’s that the original recipe does not have spinach in it”.Instead, Jane Eddington, an early-20th-century journalist who, after visiting Antoine’s in 1912 (and not greatly enjoying the experience by the sound of it, given her response: “to dine at Antoine’s is, after all, to learn by contrast that you would rather have simpler things, but that a name means a great deal when it comes to foods”) published the recipe supplied on a souvenir pamphlet, which claims to have been given by Monsieur Jules himself while “sipping on a cognac after luncheon” and uses only parsley and tarragon to give the dish its distinctive hue. My old mucker Chuck Taggart of the Gumbo Pages site – which proved so invaluable in the matter of jambalaya – has a formula that purports to be very close to the original and “rather than using bunches of spinach … has lots of herbs plus celery leaves, which is true to the rumour that Jules created the dish out of what happened to be lying around the kitchen, including scraps. It seems to me that the secret of this dish is the herbs – tarragon, of course, and chervil.”Looking at the photos of Antoine’s oysters Rockefeller, it seems more than likely that no spinach is involved – the topping is more the hue of grilled mushy peas (NB should the Louisiana tourist board like to send me to try it for myself, I’d be more than happy to). That’s the thing about recipes, though: even if you can pinpoint an “original” version, it’s not always the best, and testers come down emphatically on the side of the greener, more vegetal versions, which, they say, not only look more enticing, but work better with the saltiness of the oyster beneath.

Celery leaves, or indeed Hopkinson’s chopped stalks, prove too savoury for the panel, competing, they say, with the bivalve itself, which seems to have suffered too much to be overshadowed by a mere vegetable.Hopkinson and Franey are the only ones to cook their greens before use, but, though doing so sacrifices some of their vivid colour, it also rids them of much of their moisture content, giving the topping a better texture.AlliumsEddington and Hopkinson both use shallots to flavour their toppings, while Gumbo Pages, Bon Appétit and Franey favour spring onions, with the last two also adding garlic for good measure. This is classically rich French-style cooking, however, thus sweet, winey shallots, softened in butter, feel more appropriate.

Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the GuardianFlavouringsAccording to Howard Mitcham’s book, Creole Gumbo and All That Jazz, Rockefeller would originally have been made with a drop of absinthe, but these days, an anise liqueur such as pastis is more popular – which makes sense given that Alciatore’s father retired to Marseilles, home of the aperitif, suggesting the family had connections there. And with pastis and tarragon, there seems little need for Bon Appétit’s fennel seeds as well.More local is the Tabasco often added to the mixture, too, which cuts through the rich creaminess of the butter and bivalve nicely. Less necessary, in our opinion, is the salty anchovy or parmesan cheese favoured by Franey and Bon Appétit – cheese, in particular ,seems an unhappy partner for an oyster. I am quite taken, however, with Franey’s notion of adding the oyster liquor – so often discarded before cooking – to the butter itself as seasoning, adding a pleasing briny quality, and saving on salt, too. Two birds, etcetera.Fat and crumbsMost Rockefeller recipes are based on a kind of compound butter, but Franey uses a roux finished with double cream, which, looking at pictures of the Antoine’s version seems truer to the original, which is clearly piped on top of the oyster. The cream dulls the other flavours, however, so butter seems preferable – although I’ll be using less than usual because oysters are rich enough on their own, especially if coming before dinner.Eddington’s recipe includes walnuts, which I can find no mention of in more modern accounts. The walnut butter itself is delicious, but, in combination with an oyster, proves unpleasantly rich.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Jane Eddington’s Oysters Rockefeller. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the GuardianBreadcrumbsSome recipes mix breadcrumbs into the compound butter, but I think they’re better sprinkled on top, as Hopkinson suggests, so they brown and crisp under the grill.The cookingAnd it will be a grill – although baking is more common, with times varying from 3 to 25 minutes (Franey clearly liked his oysters very well cooked), testers overwhelmingly prefer versions, like the one from Gumbo Pages, which are grilled very briefly, just so the topping bubbles and browns, while the oyster beneath remains silky cool. If you’d like them cooked more, however, 8-10 minutes in a 220C oven, as Hopkinson suggests, should do the trick.Serve with good bread for mopping up all the delicious juices … and maybe a sazerac for good measure.
