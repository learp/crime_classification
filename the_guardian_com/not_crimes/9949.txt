It has been described as the greatest crisis in the history of British public libraries. And now, deepening cuts in public spending are to force four out of a London borough’s 10 libraries to close, move or be taken over by community volunteers.What does your local library mean to you? The Carnegie and Minet libraries in Lambeth, south London, will close at 6pm on Thursday – the end of the financial year but also peak exam revision time.Both are scheduled to reopen in a year as curious hybrids: part private gym, part host to shelves of books with no dedicated staff, which campaigners argue will fail to fulfil the function of a library.Later this year another library, in Waterloo, will be relocated to a temporary home belonging to a church-based community group. The fourth, in Upper Norwood, is being handed over to a group of volunteers.The changes highlight a wider trend, which, according to a BBC analysis this week, has seen almost 350 libraries closed over the past six years, with the loss of about 8,000 jobs.

Opponents counter that the changes are unpopular and chaotic. They say the two libraries closing on Thursday will remain untouched for months as officials remain unsure how to install “healthy living centres” in the Grade II-listed structures.“It’s pointless,” said Laura Swaffield, chair of the Friends of Lambeth Libraries, a pressure group that has campaigned noisily over the planned changes. “The staff are still on the payroll pending a restructure. They’re also paying for security guards now the buildings will close.“They’ll be spending more money on keeping them closed than keeping them open. Work is not going to start on either of those two libraries, because in both cases the plans are an absolute shambles.”Lambeth disputed this, saying staff would be reallocated to other libraries. There was no option but to close them before the new budgetary year, according to Jane Edbrooke, the council’s cabinet member whose brief covers libraries. “We have to set a legal budget,” she said. “If we incur additional costs from 1 April we have to make further cuts from elsewhere in the budget.” Opponents, however, argue Lambeth has mishandled the process, consulting on a variety of options before deciding at the last minute to hand the two libraries to GLL, a social enterprise that runs gyms and libraries for a number of councils.No plan has been publicly presented for fitting the gyms into the buildings. The Victorian Society has called for Lambeth to reconsider this for the Carnegie, saying this seemed difficult for “a particularly attractive and important example of its type”.The Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (Cilip), meanwhile, has raised concerns about plans for libraries without dedicated staff.A library “doesn’t just mean a room with books”, said Nick Poole, chief executive of Cilip. “It means getting people the information they need, when they need it. Information to help them build a business, find things to read, do their homework, access healthcare information or participate in their community. “Google may bring you a million answers, but a skilled professional librarian will bring you the right one, saving you time and money. If a venue can’t provide this, then it isn’t a library.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A protest at the closure of Mark Twain Library in Brent, London, in 2012.

She said: “There are other councils out there who don’t have any domestic violence services and no one made a mention because, funnily enough, those women were far too vulnerable to kick up a noise about it.”
