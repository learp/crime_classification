Who or what did you study to get into the mindset of Valmont, and is he comparable to any of your modern characters?  Guardian contributor DominicWest 26 January 2016 6:03pmUnfortunately I think he's comparable to most of my modern characters! I hope I'm not getting into a rut. I read a lot about the Marquis de Sade, who was a preoccupation of Laclos, and like Valmont, had a warped view of love, caused by a deeply scarred childhood. Also like Valmont, he has a thrilling mind.Updatedat 8.38am GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.02pm GMT18:02Jizzer asks:Hi Dominic, do you ever get the chance to catch up with Bunk Moreland?  Guardian contributor DominicWest 26 January 2016 5:58pmYes, as often as possible. He and Sonia are godparents to my kids, and if they happen to see this, we're still waiting for Christmas presents.Updatedat 8.38am GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.55pm GMT17:55StevieBee123 asks:Do you agree that you look like a real-life version of Moe Syzlak?

I spent the whole series waiting for it to happen. It didn’t.   Guardian contributor DominicWest 26 January 2016 5:51pmHe does pretend to die. And when we shot the scene with me lying supposedly dead on the pool table, Bunk got me drunk on whisky, assuring me all I had to do was lie there. Then the director suddenly zoomed the camera into my face and insisted I open my bloodshot eyes.Updatedat 8.37am GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.50pm GMT17:50JimmySands asks:Did you get to keep any of the wardrobe items from Rock Star?

Guardian contributor DominicWest 26 January 2016 5:46pmThe best thing a director can do is be really efficient with the camera, but I also rely on a new director's fresh opinions about my character, particularly in a TV series. The best direction I've heard is: remember the camera can read your mind. It's a useful tip to stop you indicating.Updatedat 8.39am GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.45pm GMT17:45"Northern audiences are so much more intelligent"Lisa Dixon asks:Hi Dominic, I was wondering if there will be a season 3 of The Affair? I also heard you were planning another trek. Is this true and when will it be? I am a massive fan of The Wire and loved the part of McNulty although I must say Noah was my favourite. Lastly will you be doing any productions up north anytime soon?  Guardian contributor DominicWest 26 January 2016 5:42pmI'm pretty certain we'll be back for season three, with Noah likely to be behind bars. I just hope someone doesn't put lipstick on him and make him his bitch.I am planning to climb a holy mountain in India called Deo Tibba (20,000 feet), and be the first person to fly off the top with my friend, Jim, with whom I made a documentary about the Kumbh Mela called West Meets East. He's a paragliding champion as well as being a Sanskrit scholar and yogi, so I follow him around in the hope of gaining enlightenment.  Guardian contributor DominicWest 26 January 2016 5:44pmI was really hoping to play Richard III in Hull next year, but it seems there are scheduling difficulties. I love going home to the north because audiences there are so much more intelligent, and enthusiastic.Updatedat 8.36am GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.44pm GMT17:44ecsaro asks:Love the Wire and The Affair; do you have it written in the contract that your character’s have to have lengthy periods of being an arsehole?  Guardian contributor DominicWest 26 January 2016 5:38pmThis is the best question I've ever been asked. Yes of course I have it written into my contract. How else do you think I maintain such consistency of arseholery?Updatedat 8.36am GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.40pm GMT17:40EarsoftheWolf asks:How long did it take you to learn to speak with a Baltimore accent [for The Wire]? Were there any words or phrases you found particularly difficult to pick up?Also, how difficult was it to then pretend to be English on top of that in Season 2, when you did the brothel bust?  Guardian contributor DominicWest 26 January 2016 5:37pmI never tried speaking with a Baltimore accent, because I was told it would sound too comedic. Like playing Brummie in Out of Hours, a show I did on the BBC, which I was also not allowed to do. However, the two phrases I most wanted to use were: "Are yew gowna see the Oroles?" and "How much? Tew do'ors!" I decided to do the brothel bust sounding like Steve Irwin because I was always being asked in Baltimore if I was Australian, and I thought: McNulty might well confuse Australian for English.Updatedat 8.36am GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.36pm GMT17:36glenrunciter2014 asks:Will you be doing any more theatre with Clarke Peters? I missed Othello in Sheffield.Oh and why didn’t you film Othello?  Guardian contributor DominicWest 26 January 2016 5:33pmYou should not have missed Othello in Sheffield. It was far better than the one in London. Things in Sheffield usually are. Clarke was amazing, and so was I. If Iago wasn't so soul-destroying I would have loved to have played him again in the West End, but those parts really can start to get you down. They start to influence how you behave in real life - for instance, I am constantly hatching mischievous plots since I started playing Valmont.Updatedat 8.36am GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.33pm GMT17:33glenrunciter2014 asks:Who is your favourite actress?  Guardian contributor DominicWest 26 January 2016 5:30pmI'm incredibly keen on Jennifer Lawrence, but I think my all time favourite would be Gena Rowlands. She has such a smoky charisma, and a ragged vulnerable soul.Updatedat 8.36am GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.30pm GMT17:30sauchie asks:Would you like to direct a episodes of The Affair for Season 3 and also what is like working with Martin Hutson and Andrew Woodall, hope you do some more plays or a TV show with them in the future.  Guardian contributor DominicWest 26 January 2016 5:28pmI directed an episode of The Wire, and a drama for the BBC, and really enjoyed the experience. I would love to do some more but I think The Affair is too intense an acting experience to be able to direct as well. Also Jeff Reiner does a fantastic job on it. Directing really informs acting - it makes you aware of how many other elements go into a final screen performance, and how much less work the actor has to do than we often imagine. I have a tendency to overact, so this has been good for that.  Guardian contributor DominicWest 26 January 2016 5:29pmI adore both Martin and Andrew and would love to act more with them in the future. We have played brothers at least twice, although they're both starting to look a lot younger than me now.Updatedat 8.36am GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
