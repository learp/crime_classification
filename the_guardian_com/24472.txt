Two British teenage girls accused of trying to take 6kg of cocaine out of Ghana in laptop bags were today found guilty of drug smuggling.Yasemin Vatansever and Yatunde Diya, both 16 and from north London, face up to three years in prison.Following the juvenile court session - held behind closed doors - officials said sentencing had been deferred until December 5, ahead of a report being compiled by Ghanaian social services and British authorities.The girls' lawyers also plan an appeal.After the verdict, the teenagers were bundled into a waiting vehicle, their heads covered by green patterned scarves.They were arrested on July 2 at Kotoka airport, in Accra, after narcotics officers found cocaine worth an estimated £300,000 sewn into the lining of the laptop bags they were carrying.Throughout the case, the girls' families insisted they knew nothing about the drugs and had been set up by traffickers.In a statement read outside the court by Sabine Zanker, of the group Fair Trials International, they said they were "deeply disturbed with the verdict delivered this morning"."Yasemin and Yatunde are two extremely vulnerable young girls whose naivety was ruthlessly exploited by the men who lured them to Ghana and led them to this terrible fate," the statement said.Despite leaks from prosecutors claiming the girls had both known what they were carrying, the families insisted neither had any knowledge about the drugs."Our daughters are not the criminal masterminds which the prosecuting authorities attempted to portray them as," the statement said.Zanker said she did not see "any realistic prospect" of the girls serving any sentence in the UK because there is no agreement with Ghana for such transfers. "No attempt has been made yet to come to an agreement - and even if they were to try to do that, it will take some time," she added.The teenagers were tried under Ghana's progressive Juvenile Justice Act, meaning their trial had to be completed within six months and they can only be held on remand for three months.According to the Ghana narcotics control board, the girls arrived in the country on June 26 and spent a week at a hotel in Accra, the capital.Ghanaian officials said the pair claimed their trip had been arranged by a north London man who had promised them an all expenses paid holiday and £3,000 apiece if they each brought a package back to the UK.In July, Yasemin told Channel 4 News from prison: "There were basically two boys over here who gave us two bags. We never thought anything bad was inside ... they told us to go to the UK and drop it off to some boy at the airport."It was basically like a set-up. They didn't tell us nothing, we didn't think nothing, because basically we are innocent. We don't know nothing about this drugs and stuff, we don't know nothing."In recent years, Ghana has become a key transit point for South American drug barons seeking to ship cocaine to Europe.In 2005 and 2006, customs officials at Heathrow and Gatwick airports intercepted 400kg of cocaine from Ghana - more than from Nigeria, the traditional hub of drug smuggling in west Africa.
