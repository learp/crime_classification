Raoul Moat asked for psychiatric help months before his shooting spree, according to recorded conversations with social workers that were broadcast today.Moat shot his former girlfriend, her boyfriend and a police officer before killing himself at the end of a week-long manhunt on Saturday.The recordings, obtained by ITV News, were made between July last year and April this year. They raise further questions about whether the authorities could have done more to prevent the shootings.In the conversations he described himself as emotionally unstable and repeatedly asked for help.In August 2009 he told a social worker: "I would like to have, erm, a psychiatrist, psychologist, have a word with me regularly, on a regular basis to see if there's somewhere underlying like where I have problem that I haven't seen."I would like a professional, you know, not a DIY thing you know? A professional thing for someone to come along and say look there's area for improvement here. This is a problem."At the same meeting, Moat asked again to see a psychiatrist. "Why don't we just have a psychiatrist sit me down and say: 'Right, OK, I want to see you regularly, then we can move towards where your areas of fault are, we can enhance on these areas you know, erm and work with us'," he said."If I'm at fault myself in any way I'm open to all kinds of suggestions but I refuse to spend the rest of my time fighting with social services."Newcastle city council, which dealt with Moat's case, said it commissioned a report from a psychologist to examine whether it was safe for Moat to live with his two older children."This report did not recommend any treatment but examined Mr Moat's aggressive behaviour on the safety and wellbeing of the children," the council said in a statement.Moat was released from prison earlier this month after serving a short sentence for assault. After his release Durham prison warned Northumbria police that he posed a threat to his former girlfriend Samantha Stobbart, who he shot and wounded after killing her new partner, Chris Brown. A day later he shot PC David Rathband in the face, leaving him permanently blind.The Independent Police Complaints Commission is examining the actions of Northumbria police in light of the prison warning as part of its investigation of the case.The recordings portray Moat as an articulate but increasingly anxious figure."I'm quite emotionally unstable you know, I get myself over-the-top happy sometimes you know," he is heard to say. "The more you block things out the more numb you become in the heart you know, you get to a point where happiness to you is just like, you know, neither here nor there."The recordings were given to ITV News by a friend of the former bouncer who said they wanted people to see a different image of Moat.In what appears to be increasing paranoia, Moat told Northumbria police in a meeting on 12 October last year that he had installed CCTV cameras around his property in Fenham, Newcastle."There's cameras everywhere, erm, to be honest it was to do with yous," he told the officers."I was getting accused of a lot of things and when I had what about eight cameras on the property hidden in hedges and everything to make sure I could pinpoint where I was in any particular time."Having been played the tapes, Moat's uncle, Charlie Alexander, told ITV News: "It's just a cry for help."Moat's brother Angus, 39, said: "He's clearly gone through the thought processes of how he's going to get this fixed. Unfortunately things were in the way."Angus Moat said he and his family were sorry for what his brother had done."The damage is done and I do stress that my family completely and absolutely have sympathy and feel sorrow for the people caught up in these events which Raoul's perpetrated, particularly the family of PC Rathband and the family of Chris Brown."Facebook has said it will resist MPs' calls to remove a page set up in honour of Moat.David Cameron condemned public sympathy for Moat and described the gunman as a "callous murderer".The prime minister said he could not understand "any wave of public sympathy for this man". Sympathy should be directed towards Moat's victims, Cameron said.
