A former prison officer treated as a "grass" after she reported bullying and intimidation of inmates has won £477,600 compensation, thought to be a record for a whistleblower in the public sector.Leeds employment tribunal awarded the sum, plus about £90,000 legal costs, to Carol Lingard in compensation for constructive dismissal and victimisation after she complained about the behaviour of another prison officer at Wakefield high-security prison in West Yorkshire. The award covers lost income and pension as well as hurt to feelings. The tribunal found in her favour earlier this year in a 67-page decision heavily criticising prison service management, but the award, in a separate decision, was announced only yesterday.Mrs Lingard, 37, said : "I received an unreserved apology from the director general, Phil Wheatley, in April 2005. However, I remain deeply disappointed that despite giving the Prison Service many opportunities to take responsibility for their actions during the last three years, I have had to fight a very long and hard case at tribunal and face two tribunal hearings for this to happen."Mrs Lingard's complaints centred on the conduct of one officer, who she claimed had warned a sex offender he could be slashed by inmates if found with images of children. She claimed the officer attempted to plant incriminating material in the prisoner's cell.A second complaint alleged that the officer had forged another prisoner's records to show poor behaviour and that he was involved in a suspicious assault allegation against the same inmate.She claimed she was discriminated against, intimidated and stonewalled by colleagues and, by then pregnant, was forced to resign after 15 years in the service because she felt the work environment was hostile and unsafe.An initial investigation - later described as "poor" and "not professional" by the tribunal - found "no evidence" to support her allegations. Although she approached the governor and a new unit set up to deal with whistleblowing claims, her complaint went no further.Her solicitor, John Sturzaker, of law firm Russell Jones and Walker - who is her brother - said: "Mrs Lingard was a respected officer who disclosed information highlighting serious wrongdoings on D Wing at HMP Wakefield. Her concerns and complaints were mishandled appallingly and she felt she had to resign her post."Mrs Lingard has now been completely vindicated by the tribunal. In their first decision the tribunal made damning criticisms of the handling of her case by the Prison Service at all levels up to and including the deputy director."In their second decision, just given, the tribunal has emphasised how good her career prospects within the service were and how much she has lost as the result of the actions of the Prison Service."
