Tributes have been paid to a man who died after a stabbing in Leicester and members of a family killed a mile away in a house fire as police continue to question a number of people as part of twin murder investigations.While leaflets seeking assistance from the public were being distributed in the area, those attending the local mosque and other places of worship on Sunday remembered Shehnila Taufiq and her three teenage children, Jamal, Bilal and Zainab, who died after their home was engulfed in flames on Friday.A minute's silence was also held before football matches played by Leicester Nirvana over the weekend out of respect for Antoin Akpom, who coached and played for the club and died after a stabbing on Thursday on Kent Street, about a mile from the fire in the Wood Hill area of the city.Expressing their sympathy with the Taufiq family and appealing for calm, Akpom's relatives described him as "a loving and devoted father and a hard-working young man" recognised as a role model for all sectors of the community. "An innocent life has been lost and the family calls for everyone to remain calm and united and assist the police with their inquiry so the people who did this are brought to justice," the Akpom family said in a statement."Antoin is from a good family. His mother, Cheryl, is known for promoting community cohesion and more than every we need community cohesion now."Leicestershire police said on Sunday that two 19-year-old women arrested in connection with the attack on Akpom had been released without charge but that a 19-year-old man who was arrested in London on Friday remained in police custody. The women were arrested in Warwickshire on Friday.Three women, aged 27, 20 and 19, and two men, aged 49 and 19, were arrested on Saturday afternoon in connection with the investigation into the fire. The 19-year-old man was later released without charge but an 18-year-old was arrested in connection with the fire.The police have said that, while they were investigating a possible link between the two incidents, there was no evidence anyone who lived in the house was involved in the street attack. On Saturday, Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar told of his grief after his family was killed in the fatal house fire, saying that he would "deeply miss" his wife and children."What has happened has happened and nothing can be reversed but I hope justice prevails and in future this should not happen to any family in the UK," said the neurosurgeon, who works in Ireland and spoke publicly after special prayers were said for his family at his local mosque a day after learning of the deaths on his return to the UK.Before making his statement to the media, Sattar also spoke to around 1,500 worshippers during prayers at the Jame Mosque in Spinney Hill.His wife, who was in her 40s, died with her 19-year-old daughter and sons, aged 17 and 15.Speaking near the fire scene, Leicester East MP Keith Vaz paid tribute to all five people who died and said the entire city was in shock."The police have done a superb job so far and I think everyone wants to see the perpetrators of these five deaths brought to justice as quickly as possible," he said.
