Twenty-two people have been arrested in a Metropolitan police crackdown on illegal passport factories and suppliers.More than 100 officers carried out a series of raids, codenamed Operation Greenhill, at 13 addresses across LondonPolice seized £40,000 in cash as well as false passports, driving licences and foreign identity documents.Nineteen people were arrested and taken into police custody suspected of crimes including unlawful facilitation, identity card offences and possession and conspiracy to produce and distribute false documents. Three people were held for immigration offences.Yesterday's dawn raids took place across London in Walthamstow, Rotherhithe, Ilford, Upper Holloway, South Lambeth, Hackney, Brixton, Kilburn, Stoke Newington, Tottenham, Bermondsey and Greenford.The Met's Operation Maxim team led the investigation with assistance from officers from the UK Immigration Service, the Identity and Passport Service, South Yorkshire police and the Department for Work and Pensions.A spokesman for the Met described the operation as one of its most significant crackdowns on illegal passport factories and suppliers.Detective Chief Inspector John Kielty, from Operation Maxim, said: "The Metropolitan police take these criminal networks very seriously. The production of false passports enables others to commit a range of serious crimes. This operation tackles the criminals who try to hide their true identities from enforcement authorities."The operation proves how, by working closely with our partners, we are able to disrupt these various networks and make London safer."Operation Maxim deals with organised immigration crime including illegal-passport factories and people smuggling.The immigration minister, Liam Byrne, said: "We said we would work closer with the police to tackle serious immigration crime and make our borders safer, and we meant it."The operation shows our shared determination to attack the organised crime that accounts for as much as three-quarters of illegal immigration to Britain."The raids come only days after new figures revealed the full extent of fraudulent passport applications. An estimated 10,000 British passports were issued to fraudulent applicants last year.Terrorists are among the groups known to use multiple identities - including Dhiren Barot, who last year admitted plotting September 11-style attacks on both sides of the Atlantic.The Home Office minister Joan Ryan revealed that the Identity and Passport Service received approximately 16,500 fraudulent applications in the 12 months to September last year.In a written ministerial statement, she said "almost half" of those applications were stopped by existing safeguards but the remainder went undetected.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, described the figure as "shocking" and insisted it cast further doubt on the government's controversial plans for compulsory identity cards.· Anyone with information that might help Operation Maxim should contact maximmet.pnn.police.uk.
