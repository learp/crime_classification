Two horses may have had their tails cut off to make hair extensions, police said yesterday. An investigation was launched by police after the animals had about four feet of tail chopped off while grazing.The attacks happened between December 18 and 24 in the area of Old Haldon Hill, Kennford, Devon. A police spokesman said it was believed that horse tails were used to make hair extensions, and those chopped off may have been sold on to a wig maker.The horses were uninjured, but their tails could take years to grow back, said the police, who appealed for information.
