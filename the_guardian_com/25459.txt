A parliamentary committee has said victims of crime in England and Wales should be given the right to restorative justice, once the criminal justice system develops sufficient capacity.'I needed my voice to be heard': readers on restorative justice Availability of the service is presently subject to a postcode lottery, with a report by the justice select committee cautioning that it may not be appropriate for certain offences – such as sexual assaults, domestic violence and hate crimes.Restorative justice usually involves bringing together a victim and the offender in a face-to-face meeting or via video-conferencing. In some cases, trained facilitators pass messages back and forth between them and there is no direct contact. The aim is to make offenders understand the impact of their actions and to help victims repair the emotional damage they have endured. Both victim and perpetrator must be willing participants.  Public awareness of restorative justice remains relatively low, at 28%. The same poll, however, found that 80% of people questioned thought that victims should have the right to meet their offender.If you have taken part in restorative justice we’d like to hear from you.
