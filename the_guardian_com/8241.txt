A nursery worker who sexually assaulted two young boys and was found with almost 18,000 "vile" images of children has been jailed for eight years.Alexander Mortimer, 28, filmed and photographed the abuse of the boys and had 17,967 indecent images and 582 videos of children on his computer.Images found on his laptop and hard drive ranged from level one "erotic" images to level five, which can include sadism.Mortimer, who worked at a childcare facility in Lanarkshire, told police he had researched child abuse for his college course when his home was searched by officers.But in May he admitted a total of five charges relating to the sexual assault of the boys, taking indecent photographs of children and of possessing indecent photos between January 2009 and January this year.The older of the two boys was interviewed by police and social workers, but the younger boy was deemed too young to give a statement.At the high court in Edinburgh, the judge, Lady Stacey, imposed an extended sentence on Mortimer, meaning he will be supervised for a further seven years on his release from jail.She told him his actions were a "gross breach of trust".She said Mortimer, of Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, was "clearly a danger to children" and placed him on the sex offenders register.
