A man strangled his wife after she found out he was having an affair, wrapped her body in polythene and put it in the car boot, and drove to catch a ferry to France, a court heard yesterday.Before leaving, Derek Symmons, 62, phoned the couple's marriage guidance counsellor to tell her he and his wife Christine would not need her anymore.On the opening day of his trial for murder at St Albans crown court, Herfordshire, the prosecution alleged that Mr Symmons drove from Calais to Macon, where he confessed his crime to a hotel receptionist.The couple's daughter, Claire Songhurst, told the jury that her mother learned of the affair last year by accident when his mobile dialled home while he was seeing his lover, Myra Crony. "My mum told me she overheard kissing, overheard her saying 'I love you'.Mrs Symmons began examining bills and phone records, and found the defendant booked double rooms: "She was very nervous about confronting my father. She was scared - she was scared of him."The court heard Mrs Symmons finally confronted her husband following a wedding, when he complained to her that she had not danced "lovingly" with him.Frances Oldham QC, prosecuting, said Mrs Symmons had also told a friend she was frightened: "He will kill me if he finds out I know."Symmons pleads not guilty to murder.The trial continues.
