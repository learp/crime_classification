A man who claimed a vampire movie drove him to murder his friend and drink his blood was yesterday jailed for life.Allan Menzies, 22, said he had made a pact with a vampire queen from a Hollywood movie under which he would be granted immortality if he killed his friend, Thomas McKendrick, 21. Menzies had offered to plead guilty to culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility, but this was rejected by the crown. A jury at the high court in Edinburgh yesterday found him guilty of murder after evidence from experts that Menzies, from Fauldhouse, West Lothian, was not insane when he killed his friend. Sentencing Menzies to life in prison, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 18 years, Judge Roderick MacDonald QC said three experts had diagnosed Menzies as a psychopath. The judge told him: "In my opinion, you are an evil, violent and highly dangerous man who is not fit to be at liberty. You have shown no remorse whatsoever for the abominable crime you committed." Menzies, an unemployed security guard, told the court he had become obsessed with the vampire film Queen of the Damned. He said he had watched it at least 100 times in the months before the killing.
