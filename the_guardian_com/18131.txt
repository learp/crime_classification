A national computer database containing the personal details and photographs of up to 50,000 of the most dangerous offenders in Britain was launched yesterday by the Home Office.The database, which is accessible by every police force in Britain, includes a personal profile on the most serious violent criminals and sex offenders that incorporates details as precise as whether their pet cat wears a leopardskin collar.It also includes the first-ever online national photographic library of the most dangerous offenders in the country, with separate images of distinguishing marks such as tattoos and birthmarks.The Violent and Sex Offenders Register (Visor), will eventually hold details of about 53,000 dangerous convicted criminals, including those who have been listed on the sex offenders' register.It will also hold details of a small number of unconvicted offenders who local public protection panels deem to be "potentially dangerous". Some of these unconvicted people have severe mental health problems.Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart said the system was a big step forward for public protection. "Hours of police time that would have been spent in the past retrieving information on offenders from around the country is already being saved. "The introduction of Visor means that, for example, intelligence entered by a probation officer in the north of the country will become immediately searchable by a police officer in the south."Ms Mactaggart said the inclusion of material such as tattoos meant it would be far harder for an individual to change appearance and re-emerge undetected in another part of the country."Its search and retrieval capabilities will also make it a powerful tool in solving major crimes such as abductions, assaults and murders."A training programme for police officers uses the fictional example of a sex offender who approaches a young boy and tells him about his pet cat with a leopardskin collar. A search in the database is able to identify the offender through the cat.The Â£10m computer database is being made available to probation staff and a pilot scheme has started in one prison to measure its effectiveness for the prison service.Liz Hill of the national offender management service said Visor meant that police, probation and prison staff would be able to share intelligence and risk assessment information instantly through a national database.The idea for Visor was developed by police and probation staff working with sex offenders in Lancashire. It went online with every police force this summer and will be extended across the probation service next year.Harry Fletcher of Napo, the probation officers' union, welcomed the launch of Visor, saying the lack of a suitable database had hampered inquiries into cases such as those involving the murder of Sarah Payne."This will improve matters markedly and will lead to better risk assessment by both probation service and the police," he said."However, information on those not convicted must be treated with caution and sensitivity."
