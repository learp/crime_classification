A spokesman for rank-and-file police officers made a scathing attack today against the independent police watchdog, accusing it of treating officers like "second-class citizens".The attack against the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was by Bob Elder, the chairman of the constables' branch of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents around 139,000 officers.It is the latest of a series of recent attacks by representatives of rank-and-file officers against the IPPC; the Metropolitan Police Federation made a similar attack last month, saying the watchdog had become a "pressure group".In a speech today at the Police Federation's annual conference in Bournemouth, Mr Elder questioned the IPCC's independence, and suggested it was too preoccupied with political point scoring and playing to the media.He suggested renaming the IPCC the "Institutionally Perverse Complaints Commission" because its mantra of searching for the truth had turned out to be "a load of tosh".Mr Elder criticised IPCC statements about the deaths in custody of two black men, Christopher Alder and Roger Sylvester.Mr Alder, 37, a former paratrooper, died in 1998 while lying face down and unconscious in a pool of blood in a police custody suite in Hull while a group of officers stood chatting and joking nearby. An IPCC report in March this year found that officers were guilty of "unwitting racism" and four officers were found guilty of the "most serious neglect of duty".Five officers were cleared of manslaughter and misconduct in 2002 over Mr Alder's death.Today Mr Elder said: "How dare you treat our officers like second-class citizens, accusing them of things like having made 'fatal mistakes' and being guilty of 'unwitting racism' without proper evidence?"You are supposed to be independent; then be it and stop trying to score political points. "The time you are taking to come to decisions is nothing short of scandalous. You've made a mess of so many reviews. The new home secretary [John Reid] must take a long, hard look at you and see if you are 'fit for purpose'. I am exposing your lack of ability to do your job properly."Mr Elder also spoke about the case of Mr Sylvester, 30, from Tottenham, north London, who died at a hospital in 1999 after being restrained for about 20 minutes by police officers who had detained him under the Mental Health Act. He collapsed from respiratory failure and fell into a coma as officers were waiting for a doctor to finish dealing with another patient. Mr Sylvester's life support machine was turned off seven days layer.A coroner's court jury ruled in 2003 that Mr Sylvester was unlawfully killed and that he died from brain damage and cardiac arrest, triggered and exacerbated by breathing problems that occurred during the restraint, and also cannabis-induced delirium.The Crown Prosecution Service said last year that criminal charges would not be brought against the officers due to "insufficient evidence".Today, Mr Elder criticised the IPCC over its handling of Mr Sylvester's case and said: "Stop trying to play to the media and get on with your job. It is not too much to ask that you stop playing politics and start being independent, fair and efficient."The IPCC's chair, Nick Hardwick, who is attending the conference, later told Sky News: "We don't expect to win popularity contests and sometimes we are criticised by the police officers and sometimes we are criticised by complainants when people don't like the decisions that we make."I'm confident we are making significant advances in speeding the system up and making it more proportionate."He said that he did appreciate the "stress and turmoil" suffered by officers involved in IPCC inquiries.The IPCC took over from the old Police Complaints Authority two years ago, with radical new powers to launch its own investigations into complaints.The federation has recently criticised comments by Mr Hardwick about the reluctance of black and Asian people to complain to police.The IPCC's investigation into the Stockwell tube shooting is also a target for anger within the ranks and the federation appears to be bracing itself for action against officers for the death of the innocent Brazilian, Jean Charles de Menezes, last July.Mr Hardwick said today that "rigorous action" had been taken following last August's leak of the Stockwell shooting inquiry's initial findings.
