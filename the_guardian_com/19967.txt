A French court has given a one-year suspended jail sentence to a woman found guilty of defrauding two gay couples who hired her as a surrogate mother. The woman has been named only as Aurore.Surrogacy is illegal in France and the couples who paid for her services also faced charges.The two gay couples who were defrauded were each given suspended fines of €2,000 (£1,580). Another two couples – one gay and one heterosexual – who bought babies from Aurore, 37, were fined the same amount.Using pseudonyms such as Little Stork and Sincere Angel, Aurore landed her first successful contract in 2010 with a male homosexual couple in western France, agreeing to carry a child for them for €15,000.The due date was 21 March 2011, but when the time came she sent a text message to the couple claiming the child had been stillborn.In fact, the baby boy was born in perfect health and sold for about €10,000 to another gay couple living in Luxembourg.In 2012, she promised a baby to another male gay couple for €15,000, then had the child but told them the baby had died. Instead she sold the child to a heterosexual couple in northern France.Experts said the defendant, who testified that she had been raped by her father as a teenager, suffered from “major emotional neglect” and low self-esteem.
