A woman could be jailed after she admitted shouting "bang bang" at the policeman blinded by gunman Raoul Moat.Kelsey Donkin was showing off in front of 12 friends when she made the comment, while gesturing as if she was holding a gun. PC David Rathband had been walking into Newcastle crown court for the trial of two of Moat's accomplices on 2 March but was so upset by the incident that he had to go home.Newcastle magistrates adjourned Donkin's case for reports and she will be sentenced at a later date. Magistrate Brian O'Dwyer warned her that a 12-week sentence was being considered.
