Three men jailed for sexually assaulting an unconscious teenager – who found footage of the attack on her mobile phone – have had their sentences increased by the court of appeal.Judges in London agreed with the solicitor general, Oliver Heald, that the terms of three and a half years originally imposed on Graeme Defty, David Wilcock and Tony McCarthy were unduly lenient.They added two years to the sentences to be served by Defty, 36, from Birmingham, and Wilcock, 34, and McCarthy, 22, both from Lytham St Annes, Lancashire.The trio were jailed at Preston crown court in March after admitting sexual assault.Lord Justice Treacy, sitting with two other judges, said their 18-year-old victim was "unconscious and totally helpless" during the incident at Wilcock's home in October 2011.She said she had no memory of what had taken place. When she woke up she suspected she had been sexually assaulted, but because of the alcohol she had consumed she could not be sure.Treacy said that four days later she discovered that the events had been filmed on her mobile phone, showing her lying "comatose" on a bed while she was assaulted, and the police were called.It was argued on behalf of the solicitor general that the original sentences were inadequate and did not sufficiently reflect the gravity of the offending.Treacy said there were a number of clear aggravating features in a serious crime, including the filming of the incident and the fact that it was a "sustained sexual assault lasting at least 20 minutes".He said: "We regard the recording of the offending as a serious matter."The audio track of the footage "showed there was much laughing and giggling by the offenders" who egged each other on.The judge said the court was "entirely satisfied that the sentences passed were unduly lenient".It considered that the appropriate term in each case was one of five and a half years.Treacy said all three men had been assessed as being ashamed and remorseful over what they had done.
