A 17-year-old girl and her boyfriend were jailed yesterday for torturing a friend with severe learning difficulties before forcing him to fall to his death from a 100ft (30m) railway viaduct.Sarah Bullock, who was 16 at the time laughed as she stamped on the hands of Steven Hoskin while he clung to the viaduct in St Austell, Cornwall, was sentenced to 10 years for murder.Her boyfriend, Darren Stewart, 30, was jailed for 25 years for murder and Martin Pollard, present when Mr Hoskin fell, was jailed for eight years for manslaughter.The judge, Mr Justice Owen, criticised social services for not protecting Mr Hoskin, described in court as a child in a man's body.He said: "The fact is that a man as vulnerable as Steven Hoskin did not receive the support he so plainly needed ... Adult social care was not aware others were living at the flat and taking advantage of him for the whole 15 months he lived there." A review into how agencies acted is being launched.The court heard after moving into his flat, the couple used Mr Hoskin, 38, as their slave, making him wait on them. They forced him to wear his own dog's collar and dragged him around with a lead.On the day of his death, July 5 last year, they forced him to falsely confess that he was a paedophile then beat him, stubbed cigarettes out on him, forced him to swallow 70 painkillers and marched him to the viaduct. Mr Hoskin was terrified of heights but his tormentors told him there were snipers in the bushes who would kill him if he did not climb the bridge. After killing him Bullock and Stewart returned to Mr Hoskin's flat where she pestered Stewart for sex.As he sentenced her at Truro crown court, the judge lifted a legal order that protected Bullock, from being identified. He said Bullock was "infatuated" with Stewart but was an "enthusiastic participant" in the torment.Mr Justice Owen said Mr Hoskin had been "bullied to death" and described their crime as a "most horrific murder" adding: "Your victim ... was subjected to a substantial mental and physical cruelty in which he was violently assaulted, degraded and humiliated." It emerged that Bullock's family tried to get her away from Stewart but the judge said Stewart had "total control over her".
