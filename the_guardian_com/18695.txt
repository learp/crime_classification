David Cameron today promised to remove human rights legislation which he said hampers police from doing their job.The Tory leader sought to woo the Police Federation at its annual conference in Blackpool by pledging to restore trust in officers by giving them back the "discretion" they need to do their job effectively.Current laws led the public to believe the authorities were on the side of the criminals rather than the victim, he said.Mr Cameron said replacing the Human Rights Act with "something that actually works" would be a key plank of Tory policing reform."Too much discretion has been taken away from police officers by a system which no longer trusts professionals," Mr Cameron told the Police Federation. "Your discretion to bring charges has been removed - and it's you who have to deal with the delays in custody, not the CPS. Police officers used to be street corner diplomats. Now, too often, you are agents of Whitehall. You should be crime fighters, not social workers or form-writers."Mr Cameron promised a hands-off Tory government would let the police get on with the job rather than introducing more laws for them to uphold.It promised to remove the targets introduced by the Labour government, which he said interfered with local policing. "Trust the police, not second guess them," he said.He empathised with his audience by insisting that "too much" was being asked of police officers when the reality was that reducing crime should be a shared responsibility with wider society and the government.The government would fight social breakdown, to enable police to focus on fighting crime, he said.And he took the opportunity to distance himself from the "hug a hoodie" comments last year, insisting these were three words he had never uttered. "It has been more misunderstood and more misrepresented than anything I've said."But he added that ensuring children grew up in a "stable loving home" to avoid becoming aggressive hoodies in the first place was also part of the solution. "That's not soft - it's serious."The Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Menzies Campbell, also addressed the police union, where he echoed Mr Cameron's call for less form filling by frontline police officers.The Liberal Democrat leader said police in England and Wales have been transformed into "bureau cops", who spend a fifth of their time completing forms
