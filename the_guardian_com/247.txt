A 14-year-old boy was recovering in hospital this afternoon after being stabbed at a school, the second such incident in just over a week.West Midlands police said officers had been alerted to the stabbing at Birmingham's Heartlands high school by the ambulance service at about 1.20pm. The incident comes eight days after the death of 15-year-old Kiyan Prince, who was stabbed outside the gates of his London school. The immediate area around today's incident was cordoned off by police. Forensic examinations at the school in Nechells were taking place, said a police spokesman. A spokesman for the West Midlands ambulance trust said the teenager had sustained a stab wound to the abdomen and is in a stable condition. He said: "We received a call at 13:18 to a stabbing at Heartlands high school. Paramedics attended the scene and stabilised a 14-year-old male." The boy was taken by ambulance to Dudley Road hospital in Birmingham. The incident comes two days after the government launched a nationwide knives amnesty in a bid to reduce knife crime. Police have sealed off an area of grassland close to the school, at the junction of Wardlow Road and Great Francis Street. Two black rucksacks could be seen beside one of two pathways running through the cordoned-off area. Five police cars were at the school and officers were standing guard at the edge of the taped-off crime scene.
