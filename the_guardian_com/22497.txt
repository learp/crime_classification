A self-styled lord and a Soho sex shop owner have been found guilty of helping to organise an attempt to hack into City bank accounts and steal £229m."Lord" Hugh Rodley, 61, and David Nash, 47, were convicted at Snaresbrook crown court for their part in a sophisticated electronic fraud and money laundering operation.The gang targeted the City offices of the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. If successful, it would have been the largest bank raid ever carried out in the United Kingdom.The gang were defeated, however, by relatively elementary errors in filling out electronic forms on the Swift international transfer payment system. They had acquired account details and matching passwords by installing key-logging software on the bank's computers.Rodley, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, and Nash, from Durrington, West Sussex, both denied conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to transfer criminal property between 1 January and 5 October 2004.Rodley, who styled himself Lord Hugh Rodley after purchasing a lord of the manor title, chose not to give evidence.He was convicted on both counts. Nash was acquitted of the fraud charge but convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property.A Swedish national, Inger Malmros, 58, who lives in Gran Canaria, was cleared of both counts. She insisted she knew nothing of two instructions, purportedly from her company, concerning the planned transfer of some of the Japanese bank's cash.She swayed, gasped in relief and cried as the verdicts were returned. The jury of five women and six men had spent more than 20 hours deliberating over six days.Both Rodley and Nash were remanded in custody. They will be sentenced tomorrow along with three other members of the gang who have already pleaded guilty: the bank insider and security supervisor Kevin O'Donoghue, 34, of Birmingham; a Belgian computer expert, Jan Van Osselaer, 32; and Van Osselaer's recruiter, Gilles Poelvoorde, 35. All admitted conspiracy to steal.In the witness box Nash had claimed: "I was just the driver, the security, working on a need-to-know basis."He accused Rodley of tricking him into putting his name forward for one of the front companies and of using bogus cheques in a bid to swindle tens of thousands of pounds from the watchmaker Casio and the English National Ballet.During cross-examination by the crown it emerged that Rodley was once under police suspicion over £200,000 stolen from an Austrian Embassy account – money allegedly earmarked for a planned diamond buying spree in Antwerp.When interviewed by police, Rodley had agreed he did deal in precious stones but insisted they were acquired legitimately – thought he admitted "trading" them with a member of a notorious north London crime family.
