A former police officer, his wife and one of their daughters have died in a violent incident in the family's house in Melton Mowbray. Two other children, aged 15 and 13, were left in a critical condition.Tobias Day, 37, a former police inspector, who it is thought recently lost his job, his wife, Samantha, a 38-year-old nursery worker, and their seven-year-old daughter were found dead after a violent argument in their home on Thursday.Their eldest child, aged 15, fled the house despite being seriously injured in order to raise the alarm. She ran into the nearby Swallowdale primary school and police were called to the area at 4.23pm, they confirmed.Armed riot police forced their way into the house using battering rams. The two other children are being treated for life-threatening injuries in hospital.Leicestershire Constabulary have referred the incident to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) but a spokesman would not comment on the reasons why.Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.The former officer is believed to have won awards for his bravery as part of his work and ran the London Marathon for a colleague who was stabbed to death by her boyfriend. Twice in 2001 he confronted thieves after spotting suspicious behaviour and stopped them until help arrived, despite suffering a stab wound from a screwdriver on one occasion. On another occasion, he held down a thief who was high on drugs as one of his daughters watched, according to the Telegraph.But it is believed Day had recently lost his job at Leicestershire police. His replacement, Inspector Kev Morris, recently wrote on the force's website: "I intend to build on the good work that my predecessor Inspector Toby Day has achieved during his tenure at Beaumont Leys local policing unit."A Leicestershire police spokesman said: "We are in the initial stages of the investigation but at this stage we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident."The house has been cordoned off to allow for a forensic examination."A spokesman for the IPCC said: "We have been notified by Leicestershire Constabulary of an incident in Melton today involving fatalities."We will be assessing the circumstances to determine whether the IPCC needs to be involved in any investigation."Postmortem examinations will be carried out in due course.
