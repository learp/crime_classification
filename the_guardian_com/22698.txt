The father of Stuart Lubbock, who was found dead at Michael Barrymore's home six years ago, said today he had been awarded £6,800 criminal injuries compensation.Terry Lubbock, whose son Stuart was found in a swimming pool at the entertainer's former home in Essex in 2001, had made a claim for £10,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA).Lubbuck said he was "delighted" by the compensation. "I'll put the money into the fighting fund for Stuart," he said."I am determined that I will get justice for my son and that's what the money will be used for."A CICA spokesman said: "It would be inappropriate for us to comment on individual cases."CICA awards compensation under the 2001 criminal injuries compensation scheme as laid down by parliament. To make a payment under the scheme, we must be satisfied that, on the balance of probability, a crime of violence has taken place."This is a lower burden of proof than that required by a criminal court, which would need to prove the guilt of a defendant beyond all reasonable doubt to secure a conviction."In September, Barrymore was released without charge after being arrested on suspicion of 31-year-old Lubbock's murder.The Crown Prosecution Service said there was "insufficient evidence" to charge Barrymore with any offence in relation to the death. Two other men, Justin Merritt, 32, and Jonathan Kenney, 36, who were arrested with Barrymore in June on suspicion of the murder and serious sexual assault of Lubbock, were also released from their bail by Essex police.
