The brother of new year shooting victim Charlene Ellis was among four men who today appeared before magistrates in Birmingham charged with her murder and that of fellow teenager Letisha Shakespeare.Marcus Junior Ellis, 23, 21-year-old Michael Gregory, Rodrigo Fernando Simms, 19, and 24-year-old Nathan Antonio Martin were all remanded in custody for seven days. The four defendants, who spoke only to confirm their personal details, were each accused of two counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder in relation to the shootings, which happened in Aston, Birmingham. The case against Mr Gregory, of Ryland Street, Ladywood, Birmingham; Mr Ellis, of Devonshire Avenue, Winson Green, Birmingham; Mr Simms, of Whitehouse Drive, and Mr Martin, of St Albans Road, both in Smethwick, was transferred to Birmingham crown court for a preliminary hearing on November 20. Letisha, 17, and 18-year-old Charlene died when they were sprayed with bullets from a sub-machine gun as they stood outside a hairdressing salon in Birchfield Road. Two other young women, Charlene's twin sister, Sophie, and Cheryl Shaw, were wounded in the incident. Police believe that the four girls were the innocent victims of a feud between rival gangs.Of the 103 people who attended a new year party at the Uniseven Studios salon, more than 60 have made contact with officers. At least three people have been arrested and released without charge since the inquiry began. The mothers of the two girls who died in the incident have campaigned for an end to gun crime. Marcia Shakespeare and Beverley Thomas have given evidence to the House of Commons all-party parliamentary group on gun crime. They have also visited New York to find out about efforts to combat gun incidents in the US.
