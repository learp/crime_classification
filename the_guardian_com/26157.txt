Beverley Hughes, the children's minister, has called for further investigations into Haringey council, which was responsible for the care of a baby who died despite 60 visits by health and social care workers over an eight-month period. Hughes said more examination of the senior management levels at the north London borough was needed to see if anyone should take responsibility for the death of the 17-month-old boy, known in court as Baby P. "I think the council has a responsibility, it is an elected body, it has the responsibility to ask itself the question, in the light of this case, whether there is an accountability at another level in the management of this case," she told GMTV this morning. Baby P, who was on the child protection register, died in August last year after suffering more than 50 injuries. His mother, her partner and another man have been convicted of involvement in his death.Sharon Shoesmith, the chairwoman of the Haringey safeguarding children board, said three professionals had received formal written warnings. Haringey council was previously criticised over the death of eight-year-old Victoria Climbi√© in 2000. Lord Laming, who called for a series of reforms in the wake of her death, described the similarities as "dispiriting". Hughes has asked him to prepare an independent report into the implementation of the reforms across the country. "It is unacceptable that in a case like that, we can't say that we can protect children. That is unacceptable. That is why I have asked Lord Laming to give me a view as to what the situation is like in terms of progress of implementing his report across the country," she said."It is why I have also said I am looking personally into the case of Haringey. I think what has happened there does need further examination."
