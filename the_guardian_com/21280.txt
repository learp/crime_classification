Theresa May is to make a statement to the House of Commons on the fresh investigation into the "hugely shocking" north Wales child abuse allegations linked to a senior Conservative.The home secretary said the investigation ordered by David Cameron would "look very carefully" into how the original inquiry assessed the allegations of sexual abuse at north Wales children's homes in the 1970s and 80s and make sure it was "done properly".May told the BBC that the new investigation, to be led by a "senior independent figure", would look at how the original inquiry by the high court judge Sir Ronald Waterhouse was conducted. Steve Messham, who claims he was abused by the Conservative politician, has said the 2000 report covered only a fraction of the alleged assaults.May struggled on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme to explain why the new inquiry was being set up, despite being repeatedly pressed on the issue: "There is going to be a review of the Waterhouse review, looking at the way it was conducted. These issues are hugely shocking and we have to go back and have a review of that inquiry to make sure that it has done the job that it was supposed to do," she said."Given the nature of these concerns, given the background, given the appalling nature of child abuse, we need to look very carefully to make sure that what was done in the past did indeed cover everything it needed to do, and was done properly."The Waterhouse review ran to more than 1,000 pages and concluded that there was not sufficient evidence for the judge to be satisfied that the unnamed Conservative politician was involved.The home secretary said her Commons statement, scheduled for 12.30pm on Tuesday, would also address the question of extra support and resources for the North Wales police to work with the new inquiry.Faced by claims that senior Conservative politicians and other establishment figures may have been involved in the scandal – and a subsequent cover-up – Cameron announced on Monday he would establish an urgent investigation into the conduct of the Waterhouse inquiry, which was held between 1996 and 2000.The prime minister, who is on an official visit to the Middle East, said on Tuesday: "These are very, very concerning allegations, they are dreadful allegations. We must get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible on behalf of the victims."That is why I have ordered this rapid investigation into the previous inquiry to find out whether there was something wrong with it and make sure the victims are properly listened to."Today the home secretary will be speaking to the House of Commons and making sure that the police have the capacity to deal with these allegations and make sure no stone is left unturned in getting to the bottom of these appalling matters."Cameron's spokesman in London said a separate inquiry was expected to be held into how North Wales police handled complaints at the time. That inquiry is likely to be conducted by the National Crime Agency.Up to five different inquiries are under way, or imminent, looking into various aspects of child abuse. But ministers feel they must be seen to be taking the allegations seriously, especially since the government has condemned the BBC over the Jimmy Savile allegations.There is also concern in government circles that victims' allegations about abuse were not taken seriously in the past, and that there must be a clear signal from the top of government that any culture of complacency is changing.Cameron has called on anyone who knew anything about the allegations of abuse to contact the police.He and the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, rushed to act as the media threatened to identify the senior Tory figure close to Lady Thatcher alleged to have been involved in the child abuse.The government said it was acting largely due to the allegations made by the BBC Newsnight programme on Friday night, and not due to the campaign launched by the Labour MP Tom Watson.On Newsnight, Messham said he had been abused by the senior Tory and said the claims had been "swept under the carpet". According to reports at the weekend, as many as three victims have named the Tory grandee as one of their abusers. Newsnight said at least one other victim of abuse in the homes said he was abused by the politician.Messham was due to meet the Welsh secretary, David Jones, on Tuesday.In an extraordinary letter to the prime minister, Watson praised Cameron for acting swiftly, but then made a series of further allegations about the extent of the cover-up in other police forces."It is certainly important that government departments trawl their archives to see what documents they hold," Watson said. "But my experience of uncovering massive establishment conspiracies leaves me in no doubt that what you have suggested does not go anything like far enough. Its limited scope may even slow things down, muddy waters, damage trails. What is needed is a much wider, but equally immediate, investigation."He added: "Since sharing my concerns with you at PMQs, a number of people have come forward to say that they raised their suspicions with the police, but investigations were not carried out. One allegation involves alleged child abuse and a former cabinet minister. We both know that many untruths are told about politicians, but this allegation was specific, informed and appeared well corroborated."The prime minister's spokesman insisted Cameron was "very keen to ensure that everything is looked at properly and thoroughly and that no stone is left unturned".Another alleged victim, Keith Gregory, claimed names of abusers were excised from the inquiry report, apart from individuals in the care homes, and that the culprits included "MPs, solicitors, factory directors, shopkeepers, senior police officers. The list goes on".The Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, said: "The Welsh government takes these allegations very seriously but could I ask that in the first instance victims of abuse who feel the abuse they suffered was not investigated properly should report their cases to the police. My officials have been in touch with North Wales police regarding these matters."Jones said the Waterhouse inquiry had been extensive and many of its recommendations for improving child protection were implemented by the Welsh government.But he added: "I have asked for urgent advice on the terms of reference of the Waterhouse inquiry. I want to fully understand what was included and what was not. That will enable me to consider whether any further inquiry will be necessary."Jones said he would meet the children's commissioner – a role set up following the inquiry – to "hear his thoughts directly".
