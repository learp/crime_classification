Police are hunting for four youths who attacked an MP in a his seaside constituency, leaving him with temporary hearing damage.Former Army officer Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative member for Bournemouth East, was punched in the head after trying to stop a gang playing with a ball in Boscombe high street.A 20-year-old man is also being questioned about the incident on Saturday, which started with abuse and then turned physical when Ellwood, who also suffered cuts and bruises to his face, filmed the group on his mobile phone. The MP, who is 42 and succeeded David Atkinson as the area's MP in 2005, had told the group they were causing trouble and asked them to move on.One of them twice threw the ball at point blank range into his face, according to witnesses, who then saw all four take punches at his head. Ellwood was on his way to meet his wife, Hannah, and son, Alex, after a constituency surgery.He said today: "I was involved in a serious attack involving four youths which resulted in me having to go to hospital. I'm reluctant to say too much because I want it to go to trial."At hospital he was treated for a swollen ear, which has temporarily damaged his hearing, and minor facial injuries.The youths ran off into a nearby housing estate when a police van and several officers on foot patrol responded to a 999 call from the MP, who served for five years with the Royal Green Jackets, including tours of duty in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Kuwait, Germany, Gibraltar and Bosnia.It is not the first time Ellwood has confronted antisocial behaviour. He tackled up to 10 teenagers urinating in an elderly woman's garden in the Townsend estate, Bournemouth, last year.The group of boys and girls, aged 15, 16 and 17, who had been drinking, verbally abused him before pelting him with stones when he threatened to call police. He was hit by some of the stones, but was not hurt in the incident in February.At the time, Ellwood said that ordinary people should be prepared to challenge antisocial behaviour without putting themselves in danger.He came in for some local criticism after the publication of MPs' expenses, which showed he had claimed for a laptop that took him over the yearly incidental expenses limit. The House of Commons fees office knocked Â£240 off the payment, which Ellwood defended, saying the computer was for his staff, not personal use.
