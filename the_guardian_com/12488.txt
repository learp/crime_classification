Winston Silcott, who was convicted and then cleared of the murder of PC Keith Blakelock during the Broadwater Farm riots, has been arrested on suspicion of shoplifting a year after being released from jail.Silcott, 44, is alleged to have stolen goods from the TK Maxx store in Wood Green in north London yesterday afternoon. "A man in his 40s was arrested today at 16.53pm on suspicion of theft at a retail premises in north London," a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said last night. She confirmed that the man was in custody and being questioned. PC Blakelock, 40, was hacked to death during the riot in Tottenham in north London on October 6 1985. Silcott was on bail awaiting trial for the unrelated murder of an amateur boxer, Anthony Smith, at the time. He was convicted of the Blakelock murder in 1987 but cleared on appeal in 1991 because it was found that "unsafe" evidence had been used against him. Silcott was freed on licence last October after serving 18 years for Smith's murder. He received £17,000 in compensation for his wrongful conviction in the Blakelock case and won a further £50,000 from the Metropolitan police in settlement of a civil claim in 1999.
