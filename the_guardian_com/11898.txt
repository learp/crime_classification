The first person to be charged under the new Bribery Act will be a magistrates court clerk who allegedly accepted £500 for fixing a motoring offence, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).Munir Yakub Patel is due to appear before Southwark crown court on 14 October to answer the charge under section two of the Bribery Act 2010, for supposedly "requesting and receiving a bribe intending to improperly perform his functions".The Bribery Act 2010 came into force on 1 July this year. Many companies initially feared it would be used to crack down on the corporate hospitality industry. The Act increases the maximum penalty for bribery from seven to 10 years imprisonment.In its statement, the CPS said it had decided to prosecute Patel, an administrative clerk, in relation to allegations of misconduct during his employment at Redbridge magistrates court, in Ilford, east London.Gaon Hart, reviewing lawyer for the CPS special crime and counter-terrorism division, said: "It is alleged that Patel promised an individual summonsed for a motoring offence that he could influence the course of criminal proceedings in exchange for £500, on 1 August 2011."I have reviewed all of the evidence gathered by the police and considered the director of public prosecution's guidelines on the Bribery Act. I am satisfied there is sufficient evidence to charge Munir Patel with requesting and receiving a bribe on 1 August 2011 intending to improperly perform his functions."Patel has already been charged with misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice. He still faces these charges, which relate to other alleged misconduct during his employment." He is currently in custody.Section 2(1) of the Bribery Act states that a person is guilty of an offence if they request, agree to receive, or accept a financial or other advantage intending that a relevant function or activity should be performed improperly.The main focus of the Bribery Act was to combat the offer of financial inducements in international markets by businesses intent on winning lucrative contracts. It includes a section that criminalises the bribing of foreign public officials.The Act also introduced a corporate offence of failure to prevent bribery by persons working on behalf of a business. Firms can avoid conviction if they demonstrate that they have adequate procedures in place to prevent bribery.
