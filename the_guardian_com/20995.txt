A cabinet revolt has broken out over plans to give police extensive new powers to stop and question in the counter-terrorism bill, according to a letter circulated to cabinet members by the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Hain, and largely endorsed by the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith.The letter from Mr Hain warns: "There is a grave risk that the new power will act as a recruiting sergeant for extremism." The leaked letter is dated May 31. It has been sent to all members of the cabinet's security and terrorism committee, and the domestic and overseas committee. It has also been copied to the cabinet secretary, Sir Gus O'Donnell.In a covering note Lord Goldsmith states: "I agree there are significant risks associated with the introduction of such powers and we should consider very carefully whether they are required. I would also welcome details of the safeguards we might introduce so as to ensure this power could not be portrayed as an assault on civil liberties."The Home Office minister, Tony McNulty, has proposed that the police be given new powers to help track down potential terrorists, and ask them questions after being stopped. The Home Office had claimed that the proposals, due to be published tomorrow, had initially come from Mr Hain, suggesting there is now a cabinet-level briefing war.The new powers would make it an offence punishable with a Â£5,000 fine for a person to withhold their identity or refuse to answer questions. Setting out the plan in a letter to colleagues, Mr McNulty wrote: "Arguably one of the weaknesses of [stop and search] is that although it enables a search of an individual, it does not enable a police officer to ask that individual who they are or where they are going."Police sources told the Guardian that neither Scotland Yard nor the Association of Chief Police Officers had officially asked the government for an extension of powers.In his letter Mr Hain warns: "If people in the black and ethnic minority communities believe that the power is going to be applied in an aggressive and indiscriminate way, they will inevitably use the power as a reincarnation of the old sus laws under which people felt targeted and persecuted by the authorities. There is a particular risk of the proposals provoking concern among Muslims who fear being stopped randomly on sight by the police." Mr Hain, a candidate for the deputy leadership, also says he had warned the home secretary, John Reid, in a letter on April 6 that the proposals needed careful handling. He also complained that he saw it "as unhelpful that this proposed new power had appeared in the press before the details of the proposals had been agreed with government."The manner in which these proposals have become public apparently as a result of hyped briefing from within government means that the new powers are likely to be seen as an assault on civil liberties and on particular communities, rather than as a way of reducing tensions."The bill will also contain powers for post-charge questioning and potential detention beyond 28 days subject to judicial supervision, and there may be a proposal for a cross-party initiative to gain agreement on the use of intercept evidence in court.
