The fugitive Russian oligarch Sergei Pugachev, nicknamed “Putin’s banker”, has been sentenced to two years in prison at the high court after being found guilty of contempt.The 53-year-old billionaire, whose partner is the writer Alexandra Tolstoy, has already had assets worth £1bn frozen during a bitter legal battle with the Kremlin.The former ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, fled to France last year claiming that his life was in danger in the UK because someone was planning to murder him, and that he was the subject of a witch-hunt by the Russian authorities. A warrant for his arrest has been issued.On Monday, Judge Mrs Justice Rose found Pugachev guilty of 12 out of 17 charges of contempt. She sentenced him to a maximum of two years in prison on Friday at the court in London.Deposit Insurance Company (DIA), the liquidator of his failed bank, Mezhprombank, which went bust owing hundreds of millions of pounds, brought the case against Pugachev.Sergei Pugachev: 'Putin's banker' now lives in fear of man he put into power Tolstoy, a distant relative of the War And Peace author, Leo Tolstoy, has three children with Pugachev. They had multimillion pound homes in London and a villa in Nice.Pugachev is unable to sell the properties and cannot spend cash from his bank accounts under the terms of the freeze. He is allowed to spend up to £10,000 a week on living expenses, plus legal bills.The DIA, represented by the law firm Hogan Lovells, alleged that Pugachev transferred hundreds of millions of dollars from his company to an account at a private bank in Switzerland and that he is “vicariously liable” for the bank’s collapse. Michael Roberts, representing DIA, said: “The sentence imposed on Mr Pugachev – the maximum available for contempt of court – reinforces the seriousness of Mr Pugachev’s wrongdoing. “The judge found him guilty of a staggering and quite possibly unprecedented number and range of allegations of contempt of court, confirming that he has repeatedly lied to the court, breached the court’s orders and cannot be trusted.”In the past, Pugachev’s representative in London said the arrest warrant was a “technicality”, adding: “As a French citizen, Sergei Pugachev does not fall under the jurisdiction of the English courts.”
