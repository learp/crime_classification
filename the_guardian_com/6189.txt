Police investigating the murder of an artist at a waterside home where she was house-sitting for friends have appealed for information on anyone who may have been seen wearing blood-stained clothes.They are examining the possibility of a break-in at the property in Bosham, near Chichester, West Sussex, but are also investigating whether the killing of 55-year-old Valerie Graves was connected to someone she knew in her past or more recently.Graves, whose family have described her as a free spirit who enjoyed her life, had significant head and facial injuries when she was found on Monday morning. Police have made forensic searches in and around the house, whose owners were abroad on holiday.Det Sup Nick May of Sussex police appealed for information about anyone who saw someone with blood-stained clothes or who has been asked to wash or dispose of clothing in unusual circumstances to contact them.May said: "One of the lines of inquiry is that this act has been committed by somebody unconnected to Valerie and, yes, that is a possibility. I'm not going to go into the specifics of how somebody may or may not have entered the house. We've got a large number of inquiries ongoing."Graves had gone to bed in a room at the back of the house at about 10pm on Sunday night and was found there dead the following morning.Speaking a press conference, Graves' son, Tom Wood, said his mother had recently moved back to Sussex from Scotland to be closer to her family.He said: "My mum was much loved and will be sorely missed by the whole family. She was a free spirit who enjoyed her life and was a talented artist. She had lived in Scotland for about 10 years, a place she loved and which inspired her passion for art."Wood added: "This has been devastating for the family and has come as a complete shock. We would appeal to anyone who has any information about this, no matter how trivial it is, to contact the police to help us catch whoever has done this horrible act."
