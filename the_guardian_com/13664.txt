A French court today convicted a Spanish man and sentenced him to 30 years in prison for the rape and strangling death of the British schoolgirl Caroline Dickinson eight years ago.After four hours of deliberations, the court in Rennes handed down the verdict against Francisco Arce Montes and ruled him ineligible for parole for 20 years. Montes, 54, could have faced life in prison for the murder of Caroline Dickinson on July 18 1996 as she slept in a youth hostel in Brittany. In the trial last week, Arce Montes admitted to raping the 13-year-old, but said he was incapable of murder. She was asleep on the floor of the packed dormitory. Arce Montes, of the Spanish town of Gijon, has a record of sexual aggression. He said he had been drinking and on medication and was sexually aroused the night of the murder. He said he had wandered into the youth hostel in the village of Pleine-Fougeres after making an initial stop at another hostel some 50 kilometres (30 miles) away. There he found another young girl whom he "wanted to caress" but left when an alarm clock sounded. The trial was the culmination of a wrenching investigation into the killing, with police prodded forward by the teen's parents, John and Susan Dickinson. Nearly 4,000 DNA tests of men living in the Brittany village and surrounding region were taken and some 9,000 people interviewed. The suspect was arrested by chance in Miami, Florida after a break-in at a youth hostel. He was extradited to France in November 2001.
