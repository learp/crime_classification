A former headteacher who was knighted for his services to education has walked free from court after admitting false accounting.Sir Alan Davies, who was head of Copland school in north-west London for 20 years until his suspension and retirement, pleaded guilty to creating a false paper trail on bonus payments and allowances.Davies, 66, who resigned from his £160,000-a-year post in October 2009, was handed a 12-month sentence, suspended for two years.Judge Deborah Taylor, sentencing Davies at Southwark crown court, said: "You were in a position of trust at that school. Your dishonest behaviour represents a fall from grace. You have failed in your duty as head of the school – in failing to ensure proper, transparent management and, more importantly, you lied about it and resorted to dishonest fabrication."What sort of message did that send to the children?"Not guilty verdicts were recorded for five other people arrested in connection with the offences.John Black QC, prosecuting, said the six charges of false accounting that Davies admitted related to payments dating back to 2007 totalling £315,000, including several bonuses for Davies himself.The court heard that Davies created retrospective paperwork to support the payments. Black said: "Suspicions occurred because of alleged impropriety in bonus payments to staff at the school over a period of many years. As a result of [local authority] concerns about possible criminal offences, police were called in."Black said there was no dishonesty in the making or receiving of the payments, money to which he said Davies was entitled. "The dishonesty relates to false paper trails in order to legitimise these payments," the prosecutor said. "The crown say they [the documents backing up payments] were all generated at the same time, after Sir Alan Davies had become aware of the impending or likely scrutiny, to give the impression the right procedure was being adhered to."Conspiracy charges against five others – Indravadan Patel, Richard Evans, Martin Day, Columbus Udokoro and Michele McKenzie – had been dropped, Black told the court.Patel and Day, both former governors at the school, said they were pleased that their long wait for vindication had come to an end in court.In a statement released through their solicitor Sarnjit Lal, they said: "We are delighted that we have been cleared of any wrongdoing, and relieved the ordeal is finally over after four and a half years. We strongly believe this is a case which should never have been brought against two unpaid, voluntary school governors. Nothing can make up for the damage to the reputations, health and livelihoods [we and our families] have suffered."Police began an investigation after Brent council raised concerns.
