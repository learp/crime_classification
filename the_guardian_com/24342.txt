Experts say the main difference between British and American attitudes to investigating online child pornography lies in 'stings'. US officers are allowed to set up fake websites offering illegal child porn in order to flush out potential paedophiles. Offenders are then arrested and charged.In Britain such procedures are considered entrapment and the evidence generated is not acceptable to a court. A limited amount of such stings do occur in Britain, but they are used only to provide intelligence, not evidence. Ray Wyre, a child sex offences expert who has treated some of the most serious paedophiles in Britain, says: 'In America you are allowed to be proactive in searching out internet child abusers. In Britain and the rest of Europe you have to be reactive. In effect you are waiting for a crime to be committed rather than preventing it happening in the first place.' Wyre added that US law enforcement agencies were better funded and had greater access to technology than their UK counterparts.
