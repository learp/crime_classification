The government suffered a humiliating defeat in the House of Lords last night when peers overwhelmingly voted to include deaths in prison and police cells as part of new corporate manslaughter measures. Peers voted by 223 to 127, a majority of 96, to extend the provisions of the new law to the prison service after an impassioned speech from Lord Ramsbotham, the former chief inspector of prisons and now a crossbench peer.Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and crossbenchers combined with Labour rebels to vote against the bill.Among the Tories turning up to defeat the government were Lady Thatcher, Lord Howe and the former lord chancellor, Lord Mackay. Among the prominent Labour peers who declined to support the government were Lord Irvine, the former lord chancellor and loyalists such as Lord Clinton-Davis, and Lord Harris of Haringey, a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority.The bill was originally intended to bring in tougher penalties for companies causing deaths of workers by negligent management in industry, or fatalities and injuries to passengers in public transport. Peers opted to widen its jurisdiction despite a warning from the home secretary, John Reid, that he would drop the entire bill if it was extended to prisons and police cells.They may have been spurred on by an ambivalent response by Lord Goldsmith, the attorney general, who pointed out that corporate manslaughter laws would apply partly to the prison service under the new laws, even without the peers' amendment. He disclosed that if management did not maintain a prison properly or breached health and safety laws in cells and workshops, they could be prosecuted. But if they illegally restrained inmates or put black prisoners into cells with white racists, they would not.This led Lord Wedderburn, a crossbench peer, to challenge Lord Goldsmith to rethink the clause because it meant managers were "liable if a brick fell on a prisoner's head but not if they were illegally restrained".Opening the debate Lord Ramsbotham said: "Had there been a risk that a charge of corporate manslaughter would have been brought against them, managers at all levels would have taken a great deal more care over the detailed exercise of their responsibilities in the cases of Christopher Edwards, Zahid Mubarek, Sarah Campbell, Joseph Scholes, Paul Day, Gareth Myatt and I dare say many others who might still be alive if that care had been properly exercised."He said Labour's Andrew Dismore, MP for Hendon and chair of the joint committee on human rights, and John Denham, MP for Southampton Itchen and chair of the home affairs select committee, had "expressed their dissatisfaction that the government had not cancelled its desire to exclude deaths in custody from the bill and separately they have expressed the hope that this house will vote against that exclusion."I hope in agreeing with these amendments the house will uphold that purpose and the rule of law, demonstrating that we deserve to be called a civilised nation."He was backed by Lord Judd, a Labour member of the joint committee on human rights, and by Lord Dear, former chief constable of West Midlands police.Lord Judd said: "The state has particular responsibility for those for whom it is immediately and directly responsible. To say that everybody else must apply this law but we want an exemption in our own sphere of responsibility is not a convincing position from which to win the real positive support of the nation as a whole."The Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Lee of Trafford, also backed the amendment: "It is our contention that protecting the police from action under this bill can only add to mistrust, to cynicism and suspicion. I am surprised that the normal light sensitive touch, which the home secretary normally displays, seems to have deserted him on this occasion.Conservative peer Lord Hunt, backing Lord Ramsbotham, called on Mr Reid to accept the changes: "The home secretary's threat to pull the bill is indefensible - it is nothing more than political blackmail."Last night the shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "This bill is not about everyone in custody but ... gross breaches of management and duty of care. If John Reid now destroys this bill simply because it applies a responsibility of care to him and his officials, he will be guilty of a disgraceful double standard."
