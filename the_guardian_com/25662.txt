A teenager has died after being attacked with a 'blunt instrument' in a west London park, after he and a friend became involved in a dispute as they got off a bus on their way home from a night out.Police launched a murder inquiry after the teenager, named as 19-year-old Fuad Buraleh from Hayes, Middlesex, was found in Dean Gardens, West Ealing, early yesterday morning. He was taken to hospital but died 40 minutes later from head injuries.Local people said the park had become a magnet for gangs in recent years. Paul Jones, 39, a painter and decorator, said: 'It's a rough park at night-time, with lots of people drinking. You can't go in there with your kids any more.'
