Northern Ireland's Sinn Féin deputy first minister has criticised the handling of a police investigation into murdered Catholic policeman Ronan Kerr.Martin McGuinness hit out at the arrest of a 22-year-old Coalisland man whom he described as "completely innocent". McGuinness said the man's arrest in the County Tyrone town had caused anger in the community.His remarks are bound to put him at odds with Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist first minister of Northern Ireland. Robinson and the DUP's key demand for Sinn Féin's entry into power-sharing government back in 2006 was that the republican party fully support policing and the judicial system in Northern Ireland.The 22-year-old was part one of five men detained under the Terrorism Act earlier this week although all have since been released. A 23-year-old woman remains in custody and is being questioned by detectives at the Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) serious crimes suite in Antrim.McGuinness said the 22-year-old was had been taken from his home in the "full blaze of publicity" but the PSNI said they had a duty to carry out their inquiries."This was according to the police a major operation, it was described as such by the media and there was extensive media attention placed on homes and on business premises," the deputy first minister said."From speaking to the family of the young man and the local community, it is obvious to me that we are dealing with a situation where a young man who was completely innocent, and who was in fact, in the USA at the time of the killing of Ronan Kerr."The Sinn Féin MP for Mid Ulster said it was very important within nationalist and republican communities that innocent people and people who are clearly seen to be innocent "should not be arrested in this fashion"."I do find it quite strange that within a very short period of this young man, who was completely innocent, being released after representations by myself, that the other four people who were also arrested were released," he said."They were basically held just over one day. That doesn't say to me that this was a serious attempt to find those who were responsible for the killing of Ronan Kerr."McGuinness added that he supported the police in their attempts to find those responsible for Kerr's murder, but he still criticised their investigation.
