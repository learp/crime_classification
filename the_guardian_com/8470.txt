The net is closing in on one of Britain's most wanted fugitives after he was spotted outside a bar in the Canary Islands by an off-duty police officer.Mark Lilley, 30, jumped bail during a drug trial at Bolton crown court three and a half years ago. He was jailed for 23 years in his absence for masterminding a large-scale drug operation to supply cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, amphetamines, and cannabis, and possession of a firearm. He absconded while on bail only days after he had given evidence in the court case. The appeal court in London threw out a challenge to the sentence last December, after Lilley phoned his barrister while on the run to give him instructions. He was spotted a couple of days ago outside a bar in the resort of Playa de las Americas by a policeman who was on holiday on the island. National crime squad officers have now flown out to Tenerife as the net starts to close. The police officer, who went to the same school as Lilley, noticed him behind the wheel of a Mercedes. He then drove round the block twice, peering at the officer on each occasion. Detective Inspector Sue Fraser, of the national crime squad, said the public were advised not to approach Lilley. "He is a very dangerous man with access to firearms,and is one of the worst type of drug dealers." Lilley, a keen bodybuilder, weighs 20 stone and is 6ft tall. He is originally from Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside. Nichola Crowther, the mother of his four-year-old son, was jailed for four years in 2001 for money laundering. Lilley has a reputation for violence and was only arrested by police after a listening device was installed in his home. Police in Tenerife are monitoring ports in an effort to prevent Lilley escaping.
