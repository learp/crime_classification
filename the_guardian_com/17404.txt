A man who faked his grandmother's will to receive his father's inheritance was yesterday jailed for four years.Most of Phyllis Davis's money was supposed go to her estranged sons, Robin and Christopher. But Robin's ex-wife, Linda, conspired with their son, Richard, to forge a new will after the 87-year-old widow from Herne Bay, Kent, died in 2002. The pair created the replacement document and faked Phyllis's signature so they could inherit nearly all of her £280,000 estate. Richard Davis, 29, from Herne Bay, also used his grandmother's money to buy a £15,000 Porsche after forging her signature on a letter making him executor of the estate. A jury at Canterbury crown court yesterday took less than two hours to find Richard and Linda Davis guilty of forgery and using a false instrument. He was sentenced to four years, and to a further six months for an unrelated theft. She was sentenced to three years.
