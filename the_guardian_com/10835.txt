Two women have been arrested after a nine-week-old boy was kidnapped from his home in Shropshire before being found hours later.An appeal for help in locating the child had been issued by West Mercia police after officers were called to the child’s home in Arleston, Telford, at about 3pm on Wednesday.The force announced just over three hours later, however, that the baby had been found safe and well. He was taken to a hospital as a precaution and was due to be reunited with his family as soon as medical staff had examined him, according to a spokesperson.“Two local women have been arrested on suspicion of child abduction and are currently in police custody,” the constabulary added. “We have been overwhelmed by the support we received from the public and the media in sharing our appeal far and wide, thank you.”The baby was wearing a blue woollen jacket and a cream Babygro with a teddy bear on the left side when he was taken earlier in the day.The force said at the time: “It is thought the child may be in the company of a white woman with dyed reddish-brown hair, which she wore off her face, and is around 5ft 5ins tall. She is also thought to have a lump under her nose and a gap between her front teeth.”The woman, believed to be between 30 and 40, was last seen wearing a khaki green zip-up jacket and a small black shoulder bag.
