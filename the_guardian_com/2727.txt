The Labour MP Andrew Dismore today talked for three hours and 17 minutes in the Commons, to defeat a Tory backbench bill to strengthen the law against burglars.Mr Dismore's 197-minute effort - the longest parliamentary speech in the 21st century - blocked a private member's bill which would have widened the permitted degree of force that householders could use in defending themselves against intruders.It eclipsed the previous 181-minute record - already held by Mr Dismore, and made only last year - to block a Tory backbench Bill to promote volunteering. Today, his target was Anne McIntosh's criminal law (amendment) (protection of property) bill, which would outlaw only "grossly disproportionate" violence against a burglar.Miss McIntosh (C Vale of York) had told MPs: "The time has come to redress the balance." The present law allowing "reasonable force" was not satisfactory, she argued, and a proper deterrent was needed.Two previous Tory backbench bids to change the law, after the controversy over Norfolk farmer Tony Martin who served a jail term for killing an intruder at his isolated farm, have also been blocked.Miss McIntosh said most people would prefer to allow the police to deal with a burglar.But with rural restructuring of forces, officers had less time to respond, and householders could "regrettably be forced with taking the law into their own hands".Home secretary Charles Clarke recently spoke out against the measure, telling the Sunday Telegraph last month: "The law as it stands does not need to change. It already provides householders and shopkeepers with the powers they need to protect themselves, their family and their property." Mr Dismore, a solicitor, started his speech at 11.13am, saying the move amounted to "vigilante law". He warned: "The bill is unclear, uncertain and will result in people facing prosecution where, at present, they do not."Armed with a sheaf of papers, several reference books and fortified only by a cup of water, he was still speaking as time ran out on the measure at 2.30pm. It now stands no chance of becoming law.The use of the filibuster is not unknown at Westminster - and Mr Dismore's marathon tour de force fell well short of the 20th-century record held by Tory barrister Sir Ivan Lawrence. The then MP for Burton spoke for four hours and 23 minutes during the fluoridation bill's committee stage on March 6, 1985.The all-time record-holder is thought to be Henry Brougham, later the Lord Chancellor after whom the horse-drawn carriage was named, who spoke for six hours on law reform in 1828.In February 1983, Labour's John Golding spoke for 11 hours on the telecommunications bill. But his speech was at a standing committee and not in the Commons chamber - and he was also able to take breaks for lunch and dinner.
