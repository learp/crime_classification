A woman who claimed a voodoo curse had led to her bank accounts being hijacked was yesterday found guilty of a Â£1m benefit fraud.During the trial Remi Fakorede, 46, produced three fingers, claimed they belonged to her daughter, and suggested the digits were proof that she had been forced to act in a fraudulent manner.Fakorede submitted 39 claims for tax credits over five years, largely for bogus children. She claimed her identity and bank accounts had been infiltrated by others, including a relative called Auntie Marian, who she said had voodoo powers.She told jurors that a daughter, now three, had suffered from kidney failure and her fingers had dropped off. She claimed the "voodoo man" said the same thing would happen to her if she told authorities about the plot. Police are understood to be checking the DNA of the fingers and on the welfare of the child.Fakorede, of Hackney, east London, created several phantom families, some with disabled children, and set up several bank accounts using a variety of different identities, Snaresbrook crown court heard. Another daughter, Denise Shofolawe-Coker, 21, aided her mother in laundering profits from the scam and was convicted of assisting the fraud. Fakorede was remanded in custody and will be sentenced next month.Fakorede ran a hairdressing salon and owned two east London properties, but told housing benefit authorities she was out of work.Oscar Del Fabbro, prosecuting, told jurors: "The investigations revealed various characteristics which are often contained in claims of this type - fictitious children who are often twins or disabled, and apparently the claimant is self-employed."Judge Beech refused Fakorede bail before sentencing next month. He said: "You know that custody is inevitable for the crime you have committed. This was a wholesale assault on the benefit system."
