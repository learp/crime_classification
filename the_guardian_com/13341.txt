We're back, slightly later than planned, but then again, there seems to be a lot going on at the moment.In this blog, we are aiming to post up original documents whenever possible. We're kicking off with the judgment in the quashing of the Ratcliffe convictions last month.It can be found here To quickly recap, three court of appeal judges overturned the convictions of 20 environmental protesters for attempting to occupy the Ratcliffe power station as crucial evidence recorded by police spy Mark Kennedy had been withheld.The judgment is worth reading as it shows how the three senior judges had little doubt that the convictions had to be quashed, and how critical they were of Kennedy for over-stepping his legal powers.It also reveals an interesting nugget - Kennedy's code name while he was deployed undercover in the enviornmental movement.Paragraph 11 of the judgment tells us that Kennedy was known as UCO 133. The first three letters are seemingly easy to decipher - UCO stands for undercover officer, but the numerals are more intriguing.133 may just be a random number and may not mean anything, but if there is anyone who knows better, please let us know if they are significant in any way.The judgment also incidentally discloses the name of his handler - David Hutcheson, who must be a member of the National Public Order Intelligence Unit which ran Kennedy.In a previous post, we wrote about how the Ratcliffe court papers had thrown up another intriguing nugget - that Kennedy was deployed as part of Operation Pegasus, whose aim is "to infiltrate extreme left wing groups in the United Kingdom".A quick thanks to all those who have passed on information about Operation Pegasus and please keep it coming
