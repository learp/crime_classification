Four teenagers were arrested yesterday after the death of a 15-year-old girl caught up in fighting on a field near a housing estate in Bradford.Detectives are also investigating reports that Aimee Wellock, who was allegedly kicked and punched, may have suffered from a heart condition which could have played a part in the tragedy. Neighbours on the Allerton estate said Aimee and her friends were pestered by a gang for cigarettes when a fight started. Police are questioning three girls aged 15, 17 and 19 and a 15-year-old boy about the death which is being treated as suspicious, although a postmortem has yet to decide a cause. Aimee's parents Alan and Jackie and her 19-year-old brother James issued a statement saying: "We are feeling absolutely devastated and at a complete loss. Aimee was a typical teenager, full of life and vitality." The teenager left the field after the incident but collapsed after walking only a short way. Paramedics tried to revive her but she was pronounced dead at Bradford royal infirmary.
