A woman in her 60s has been given a police caution for assault after tussling with a protester campaigning against the badger cull in Somerset.The victim, Sharon Doyle, said she and a friend were checking a map at the side of a road on a Saturday night after hearing reports that shooters and police had been spotted in the area.She said: "We had been asked to visit the footpaths in that area as there had been reports of shooters and police and whilst checking our map at the side of the road we were subjected to verbal and physical abuse from the locals. My car keys were wrestled from me resulting in bruising. It is totally outrageous."Avon and Somerset police confirmed that it received an allegation of common assault on 14 September.
