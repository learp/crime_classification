Merseyside police have charged a 43-year-old woman from Southport with possessing and making indecent images of a child, and sexual activity with a child. The woman, whose identity has not been released, is due to appear today at Bootle magistrates court. Police said the charges followed the investigation into Colin Blanchard, who admitted a string of offences at Bristol crown court last month, but were not linked to his co-defendants Angela Allen and Vanessa George, or the nursery where George worked in Plymouth, Devon. The three of them are awaiting sentence.
