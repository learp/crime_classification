A neighbour who tended to Billie-Jo Jenkins as she lay dying after being battered with a metal tent peg spoke of her horror at the extent of the girl's injuries.The 13-year-old died from severe head injuries after being struck at least five times as she painted the patio doors of the family home in Hastings in February 1997.Giving evidence at the retrial of her foster father, Sîon Jenkins, a former deputy headteacher, for her murder, Denise Lancaster told the Old Bailey she had been "devastated" after finding the girl lying in a pool of blood on a binliner on the patio.She said: "Her head was completely shattered. You could see her brain and you could see her skull. It was devastating. I was very scared to do anything to her. I hardly wanted to touch her."Mrs Lancaster was called to the house by Mr Jenkins, who told her there had been an accident. On arrival at the house, he directed her to the dining room. "I could see Billie lying down on the floor with her head to one side and her hand was up near her face," she said. "Her legs were together in a very strange position, I felt."She looked as if she was asleep. I bent down and I touched her hand and touched her cheek. She seemed too injured for me to really touch. I knew she was very badly damaged." She wondered how the teenager could still be alive.Mrs Lancaster told the jury that when the family were leaving her house, where they had been staying after the murder, Mr Jenkins had left behind the blue fleece he had been wearing on the day.The court heard that after Mrs Jenkins, 43, was informed about blood on his clothing, she told Mrs Lancaster she had felt sure he would kill her, if anyone. Mrs Lancaster said: "She cried. She was beside herself. She said to me, 'Why did Sîon kill Billie? If ever he was going to kill anyone, I am sure he would kill me.'"Mr Jenkins, 47, of Aberystwyth, denies murder. The trial continues.
