Scientists are developing genetic tests that will be able to take DNA from crime scenes and churn out possible surnames of the culprits. If the tests work, they could allow police forces to quickly identify families to which a criminal might belong. David Werrett, chief executive of the government's Forensic Science Service in Birmingham, said the tests had become a possibility thanks to new efforts to analyse Y chromosomes, which are only passed down the male line.The tests are based on the idea that people who share the same surname may have more similar Y chromosomes than those with different surnames. For example, the make-up of the Y chromosomes in people called Smith may differ slightly from those called Jones. Although the tests will not be able to identify a culprit's surname with any certainty, they could suggest a number of names for police to follow up. "We want to get to the point where we know what genetic sequences are important," said Dr Werrett. Forensic testing of DNA has increased sharply this year since the government changed the law to allow DNA samples to be taken from people who have been arrested, as well as those charged and convicted. Whether or not a person is found guilty, their DNA is now recorded on the national DNA database, where it is checked against information on DNA taken from crime scenes.
