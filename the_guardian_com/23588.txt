A British government minister has urged the US to order American websites hosting al-Qaida videos to remove them.The security minister Lady Neville-Jones is said to have used a recent visit to Washington to argue that such sites incited "cold-blooded murder" and would be banned in the UK.The move comes after it emerged that a student who tried to murder an MP was inspired by the online preaching of a radical al-Qaida cleric linked to the cargo plane bombs plot.Roshonara Choudhry, 21, stabbed former Labour minister Stephen Timms twice in the stomach after watching sermons by US-born Anwar al-Awlaki on the internet.The cleric is thought to be behind the bomb plot involving packages sent from Yemen â€“ where he is based.US investigators believe he is also linked to the army base killings in Fort Hood, Texas, as well as last year's Christmas airline bomb attempt, and the failed Times Square bombing.Choudhry's attack on Timms is thought to be the first attempt to assassinate a politician on British soil that has been inspired by al-Qaida.According to the Daily Telegraph, Neville-Jones used a speech last week to the influential Brookings Institute in Washington to appeal to the Americans to take action to remove jihadi material from websites hosted in the US."Those websites would categorically not be allowed in the UK. They incite cold-blooded murder and as such are surely contrary to the public good," the newspaper quoted her as saying."If they were hosted in the UK then we would take them down but this is a global problem. Many of these websites are hosted in America and we look forward to working even more closely with you to take down this hateful material."A Home Office spokesman said the UK government always pressed for jihadi material to be removed from the internet."Where sites are hosted abroad our ability to close them down is limited. Nevertheless, we work with our overseas counterparts to encourage them to remove them," the spokesman said.After her arrest, Choudhry, of East Ham, east London, told detectives that she attacked Timms during a constituency surgery in May in revenge for his voting for the war in Iraq. It was discovered that she had also drawn up a list of other MPs who had backed Britain's military action.A source said: "She had researched the voting records of a number of MPs around the Iraq war."But the source said that in relation to her searches of jihadi websites there was "no evidence to suggest there was any contact with anyone" and it was "looking at rather than reaching out"."This was something which was done privately on the internet."
