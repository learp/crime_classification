Lawyers for a man convicted of murdering a South Korean student in Bournemouth in the summer of 2002 are claiming Danilo Restivo may be guilty of the killing.Jong-Ok Shin, 26, was stabbed to death after a night out in July 2002 in Malmesbury Park Road, three streets from Restivo's home in Capstone Road.Her murder took place two months after Restivo arrived in the UK and on the same day of the month – the 12th day – as the ritualistic murders of Heather Barnett and Elisa Claps.A Bournemouth man called Omar Benguit was convicted of Shin's murder after three trials and jailed for life but miscarriage of justice campaigners have expressed concern over the conviction.The Criminal Case Review Commission has received submissions from Benguit's legal team suggesting Restivo could be guilty of Shin's murder. A spokesman confirmed it had been "paying close attention to the trial of Danilo Restivo to see what implications, if any, that these proceedings may have on Mr Benguit's case".A source close to Benguit's legal team said: "The likelihood of two murders by two individuals three streets and four months apart is frankly unbelievable."Asked whether Restivo was responsible for any other killings, Detective Superintendent Mark Cooper said: "As far as we're aware there are no other victims – we're not actively looking for or concerned about anyone else."
