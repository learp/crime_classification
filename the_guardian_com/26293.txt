Loyalist terrorists left four blast bombs beside a children's BMX bike track in south Belfast, police in Northern Ireland confirmed yesterday. They were discovered after a tip-off from a member of the public on Tuesday night.The bombs had been left beside a bench in a BMX park near the railway line on Bentham Drive, off the loyalist Donegall Road area. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said that the devices, while crude, were "viable" and could have "killed or caused serious injury". Detectives are investigating whether the bombs were placed there as part of a loyalist extortion racket or to disrupt rail services.The area where the devices were found is dominated by the Ulster Defence Association - the largest loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland. The UDA has been resisting moves to decommission its terrorist arsenal. Last week it was revealed that the rival Ulster Volunteer Force was preparing to put beyond use its caches of explosives and home-made pipe bombs and hand grenades.As a result of the find, train services yesterday on the main Belfast to Dublin rail link were disrupted while army technical experts carried out a controlled explosion.Chief Inspector Trevor O'Neill said those responsible were "out of touch". "We believe that the devices are linked to loyalist paramilitaries and let me be clear - there is absolutely no place in a civilised society for people to be acquiring crude devices for whatever their misguided purposes are," he said. "Thankfully these devices have now been taken out of circulation.The Northern Ireland chief constable Sir Hugh Orde has confirmed that he has applied to succeed Sir Ian Blair as the head of the Metropolitan police.
