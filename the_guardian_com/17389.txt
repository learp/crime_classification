Police are hunting the driver of a car which mounted a pavement and killed an 11-year-old as he walked home from a church youth meeting.Sam Riddall was walking with a group of friends in Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, on Friday, when the car came off the road and hit him. Three other children, all thought to be aged 11, were unhurt while a man, the father of one of Sam's friends, suffered minor injuries.The driver fled the scene on foot after the incident, which happened shortly after 9pm. She was described as white, in her mid-30s and with long blonde hair. Sam was walking along Eastfield Road when the white Ford Focus estate hit his group. It skidded across the pavement towards a wall, ­colliding with other vehicles parked on the road before coming to a stop.Inspector Rob Pearson, of Avon and Somerset constabulary, said: "The family are absolutely ­devastated by what has happened and our thoughts are with them at this time. We are asking for any witnesses who saw the accident or the driver running away to come forward."The boy's parents, Martin and Rachel Riddall, attended church morning and paid tribute to their "loveable son". Mrs Riddall said: "Sam was a sociable, lovable 11-year-old who enjoyed playing football. He had many friends and enjoyed life to the full." The couple have three other sons aged five, nine and 14.
