A teenager has denied posting a grossly offensive message on Facebook about the deaths in Afghanistan of six British soldiers whose bodies are due to return to the UK on Tuesday.Azhar Ahmed, 19, appeared briefly at Dewsbury magistrates court in West Yorkshire, which was guarded by a heavy police presence as some 40 far-right demonstrators shouted abuse outside.A racially aggravated public order charge was withdrawn and replaced with the new accusation under the 2003 Communications Act. Ahmed, from Ravensthorpe near Dewsbury, was bailed to an undisclosed address after entering his denial and confirming his name and address.He will stand trial at Huddersfield magistrates court on 3 July.The tragedy in Afghanistan involved soldiers of the Yorkshire Regiment, which draws many of its recruits from West Yorkshire and has its historic base at Halifax, near Dewsbury.The soldiers died shortly after arriving for a tour of duty in Helmand province when their Warrior armoured vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device in Lashkar Gah on 6 March. It was the worst loss of life for British forces since 14 servicemen were killed in the RAF Nimrod explosion in 2006.The dead were Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment and Corporal Jake Hartley, 20, Private Anthony Frampton, 20, Private Christopher Kershaw, 19, Private Daniel Wade, 20, and Private Daniel Wilford, 21, all of 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment.Protesters outside the court carried placards demanding jail for people who insult British troops but were kept well away by rows of police backed by four video vans.
