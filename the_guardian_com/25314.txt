A British man wanted on suspicion of murdering a former US marine has arrived in the resort town of Phuket for trial after the first-ever extradition of a criminal suspect from Britain to Thailand.Colonel Sinard Ajhanwong, commander of Thai Interpol region 3, said Britain had previously declined to send suspects back under a 1911 extradition treaty.Lee Aldhouse, now 29, was arrested when he arrived at Heathrow airport in London after fleeing Thailand in 2010.Aldhouse is accused of stabbing Dashawn Longfellow, who had been on holiday in Thailand.Police said Aldhouse allegedly killed Longfellow, then 23, on 14 August 2010, after being beaten up by the ex-marine during an earlier brawl at a Phuket bar.Aldhouse was a semi-professional kickboxer who had been living for several years in Phuket, while Longfellow was also studying the sport.Aldhouse's appeal against extradition had been rejected by Britain's high court."The Thai authorities had fought for his extradition for two years and this is the first time in 101 years that the UK approved a request," said Sinard."Prior to this case, they had declined to send suspects back, even when they were not British citizens. This time, however, they extradited a British national to us, so that emphasises the significance of this case," he said. Thai legal officials accompanied Aldhouse from Britain.Sinard said Aldhouse appeared very nervous about his rights being honoured under the Thai legal system, "but our prosecutors assured him that he will treated according to international standards of justice".He said Aldhouse will be questioned by investigators before police hand his case to prosecutors.
