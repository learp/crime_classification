One of the victims of a double murder in Northern Ireland had been charged with the killing of a teenager 10 years ago.The man, named locally as Hugh McGeough, was found dead in his home with partner Jacqueline McCartney in Craigavon, County Armagh, on Monday evening.Detectives are working on a number of theories in relation to the shooting, including a possible link to drug gangs in the north Armagh area. Both victims had sustained gunshot wounds to the head and were discovered by their son.McGeough had been charged over the killing of Peter McNally in the Westacres estate, Craigavon, in October 2001.McGeough and another man later admitted wounding the teenager, who was shot dead by two masked gunmen as he slept.In November 2007 a Craigavon drug dealer with links to loyalist paramilitaries was accused of threatening to kill McGeough and a number of McGeough's associates in Legahory in a row over weapons. The man was later jailed for assaulting an associate of McGeough and possessing a baton.There was a heavy police presence in the area on Monday night, with one report suggesting a number of young men were "patrolling" around the police cordon.The house of the murdered couple was surrounded with CCTV cameras. Residents said the family felt constantly under threat in the area, which in the past was known to have problems with drug dealingThe issue of drugs and antisocial behaviour on the estate was raised at the most recent district police partnership meeting, which was held in nearby Portadown last week.The Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) councillor Michael McGoldrick has contacted the police commander for the area to clarify possible motives for the double murder.The nearest police station is only around 200 metres from the scene of the shooting. The Craigavon and Lurgan area is a known stronghold for the Continuity IRA but there is a significant number of people involved in non-paramilitary gangs.Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and the Democratic Unionists condemned those behind the killing and called for people to co-operate with the police inquiry. An independent councillor, Kieran Corr, said he had spoken to members of the murdered woman's family and they were "devastated" by the killings.
