Drugs charges against the heir to the multi-billion dollar Tetra Pak fortune and his wife have been dropped, it was announced today.Prosecutor Martha Godwin told a hearing at City of Westminster magistrates court that the charges would be dropped as part of an arrangement that will see the couple given a formal police warning.Hans Kristian Rausing, 45, and his 44-year-old wife, Eva, were charged with drugs possession earlier this month.It came after Eva Rausing was arrested in April for reportedly attempting to smuggle crack cocaine and heroin into the US embassy in London in her handbag. Police later searched the couple's Chelsea house, where they found small amounts of cocaine, crack cocaine and heroin. The couple's lawyer, Philip Smith, said today's decision was "very sensible". Earlier, the Rausing family had released a statement saying relatives were "deeply saddened" by the couple's drug problems. "We hope with all our hearts that Hans K and Eva can overcome their addiction, and we continue to do what we can to help," the statement said. Rausing's Swedish father helped transform Tetra Pak into a hugely successful manufacturer of laminated cardboard drink containers. Judge Timothy Workman said the charges would be formally dropped at a hearing on August 12. The couple, who were not in court, are on bail.
