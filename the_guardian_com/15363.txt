Four gang members who were involved in the "cold-blooded" killing of a 17-year-old in broad daylight were told by a judge today that they must serve minimum prison terms of up to 35 years after they were found guilty of murder.Tarek Chaiboub was shot dead outside a barber's during a feud between factions of Sheffield's S3 gang, named after a postcode. His murder was ordered by Nigel Ramsey, 23, known as the "general", from his prison cell by mobile phone.Ramsey and another defendant, Michael Chattoo, 21, laughed as Judge Griffith Williams told them they must serve minimum sentences of 35 and 30 years respectively. Two other gang members – Ramsey's brother Denzil, 20, and Levan Menzies, 17 – were given minimum sentences of 25 and 20 years.The judge told the defendants, who are all from Sheffield and all denied the allegation: "Britain is not broken, although certain communities are being plagued by the lawless activities of the likes of you and gangs such as S3."The group chanted and shouted as they left the dock, while two women were arrested amid scuffles with police and bystanders outside Sheffield crown court.Tarek had been blamed by one side in the feud for allegedly crossing them by helping to carry out a knife attack, the jury was told.The teenager, himself carrying a handgun, was shot in the back with a sawn-off gun outside Frenchie's barber's shop in Sheffield, around lunchtime on 11 July last year. Chattoo, Nigel Ramsey, and a fifth defendant, Javan Galloway, 20, were also convicted of attempted murder in relation to an incident five days earlier in which Tarek was stabbed a number of times.
