A teenage babysitter has been stabbed to death in her sister's home as she looked after her young niece and nephew.Chatherine Wynter, 19, also known as Katie, was staying at the house on Boxing Day night while their mother was away.However, when another female relative called at the address in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, at 8am on Tuesday they found Wynter's body.The children, aged three and four, were still in the house but had not been injured.Police are interviewing them and do not yet know how much they saw or heard of what happened to their aunt, who regularly babysat as a favour to her sister.The interviewing process is expected to take some time because of their age, Hertfordshire police said.An 18-year-old man from Borehamwood and a 26-year-old man from Islington, north London, were arrested later on Tuesday. The 26-year-old was released late last night with no further action.Officers believe Wynter was attacked at some point between 7pm on Boxing Day and 8am on Tuesday, when they were called to the house.A postmortem confirmed that Miss Wynter, who also went by the surname Briscoe and lived elsewhere in Borehamwood, died as a result of stab injuries.Detective Superintendent Mick Hanlon said: "Firstly, our thoughts are with the victim's family."As you can imagine, this is an extremely traumatic time and they are being supported by specialist family liaison officers. We have a team of detectives currently working on the case who are looking at a number of lines of inquiry to establish exactly what happened. However, I would like to appeal to the communities of Borehamwood to help us."Around eight properties were in the cordon â€“ the row of six terrace houses and two larger semi-detached properties opposite.Police are investigating whether there were any signs of a break-in at the house where Wynter was found but said she and the children were the only people staying there on the night.Floral tributes were left near the scene. One read: "To darling Katy. RIP angel. We will miss you so much."Neighbours described the death as a "tragedy".It is not known where Wynter's sister had gone on Monday night, but police said she was staying elsewhere locally.Wynter's family have released a brief statement through police: "Katie was a quiet girl who enjoyed life."She was a loving auntie to her niece and nephew, who she was looking after on Boxing Day."We would asknot to be contacted by members of the media and that our privacy is respected to allow us to grieve together as a family."
