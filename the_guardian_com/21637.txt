Ken Livingstone promised yesterday to slash crime in London by 50% in the next four years.In a bold prediction which could dominate the coming mayoral campaign, he said his plans for more neighbourhood policing would transform the capital's streets and estates. Borrowing heavily from the tactics adopted in New York, the Metropolitan police plans to send many more patrol officers and support staff on to the streets. Six officers will be based in each ward, and commanders will be discouraged from transferring them elsewhere except in a dire emergency. They will be told to concentrate on such offences as mugging and burglary, but they will also reassure the public by being visible. As part of the plan the number of officers will be increased to 35,000. On Monday the recruitment drive took the strength to 30,000; 4,597 more than in 2000. Mr Livingstone said: "I expect we will see something like a 50% cut in crime by the time we have got neighbourhood policing fully rolled out across the whole of London. If we get government assistance with that, it could be by the end of 2006."Opponents quickly poured scorn on the his strategy. Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrats' mayoral candidate, called the target "unrealistic, unworkable and undeliverable". He added: "Even Batman would struggle to reduce a city's crime rate by the 50% in four years." Steve Norris, the Conservative candidate, said: "If he can solve this in four years, what was wrong with the last four years. He has realised that crime is the real issue in London but I could have told him that. This late conversion will not fool anyone." Glen Smyth, the Metropolitan Police Federation chairman, said the 50% target was probably over-ambitious but neighbourhood policing would have a significant effect.
