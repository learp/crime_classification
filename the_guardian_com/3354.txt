Police are seeking information after a human leg was found in a canal. The limb was discovered by a member of the public at Tetney Lock in Tetney, Lincolnshire.A police underwater search unit recovered the leg, which is thought to be from a white man in his late teens or early 20s.Police believe it was put in the water at Tetney Lock, not washed in from the North Sea.A local resident told the Lincolnshire Echo: "If it had been washed on Cleethorpes beach, it wouldn't have been as shocking, but the fact that it has been deliberately dumped is awful."Detective chief inspector Dave Evison said: "We would like to speak to people who regularly frequent this area such as birdwatchers, dog walkers or holiday makers and who have been in the vicinity recently."
