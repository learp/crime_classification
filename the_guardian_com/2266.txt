Irish politicians on both sides of the border have condemned a Mauritian newspaper for publishing pictures of a murdered woman, Michaela McAreavey.The country's Sunday Times - which has nothing to do with the British title of the same name - ran a front page photograph yesterday of the woman's body. Several other images were published on inside pages, some of which showed Mrs McAreavey's injuries.They were crime scene photographs of the hotel room where she was strangled to death in January last year while on her honeymoon with her husband John.Last week two men were acquitted by a jury of her murder, a decision that shocked Mauritian police and the McAreavey family. Mrs McAreavey was the daughter of Mickey Harte, the manager of a Gaelic football team in Co Tyrone, Northern Ireland. After the family accused the newspaper of being insensitive to their grief, the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, and Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, issued statements echoing the family's opinion.Kenny said: "The publication of these images represents an appalling invasion of privacy and is a gross affront to human dignity."He said the Dublin government would lodge a formal complaint today, in the "strongest possible terms", with the government of Mauritius.McGuinness, noting that the pictures must have come from within the Mauritian authorities, called it "an outrageous abuse" and spoke of the paper heaping "more pain and anguish on to the McAreavey and Harte families."Sources: Irish Times/RTE/Sky News/BBC
