Police are investigating after human remains were found in woodland near the royal family's country retreat at Sandringham House in Norfolk.A member of the public reported the find at Anmer, King's Lynn, on New Year's Day shortly after 4pm, according to Norfolk constabulary.The force said that its detectives were investigating; an area has been sealed off, and a search is being carried out.The Queen's estate stretches over 8,000 hectares, 240 of which make up the woodland and heath of the Country Park and are open to the public. Sandringham House, built in 1870, is used by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh as a country retreat, and traditionally they and their family spend Christmas there.The couple attended a service with other members of the family at St Mary Magdalene's church near King's Lynn on New Year's Day before the discovery at Anmer.There are around 150 residential, commercial and agricultural properties on the estate, according to the Sandringham estate website.A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said that she had no comment to make on the discovery, which was "a matter for Norfolk police".
