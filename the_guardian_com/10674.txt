Yesterday's protest was her tenth.When the van arrived at the prison, Ms Campbell and three other women stood in its way. Police were called and officers asked the women to move. Three did so, but Ms Campbell remained where she was. She was arrested, handcuffed and taken to apolice station.Next month she is due to appear before magistrates in London and in Rochdale, Lancashire, to face charges of obstructing the highway.Mandy Pearson, 37, died in New Hall on October 12.
