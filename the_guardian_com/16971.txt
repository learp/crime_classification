A man who beat his pregnant former fiancee to death causing the death of their unborn baby has been jailed for at least 27 years.Tony McLernon, 24, of North Grove, Harlow, Essex, was found guilty of murder and child destruction following a trial lasting just over two weeks at Chelmsford crown court.The trial heard he lured Eystna Blunnie, 20, to her death in July last year after telling friends she was trying to ruin his new relationship.When they met in Howard Way, near her home in Harlow, he jumped on her, kicked her and left her to die in a pool of blood.Blunnie was due to give birth to a girl within days.

In April he strangled her, causing the baby distress."This killing was not the result of an unthinking moment of anger but instead he had contemplated the attack over a long period of time."The killing was truly terrible. The horrific screams heard by those nearby show the suffering and pain she suffered and for some period of time she would have been aware of the fatal consequences for herself and her child."He has shown not the slightest shred of remorse."Outside court, Blunnie's uncle, Tony, read a statement on behalf of her family.He said: "After a very long and heart-breaking eight months, we have finally received justice for Eystna and her then soon-to-be-born daughter, Rose."Eystna was a loving girl with a unique personality and her whole life ahead of her. We know Rose would have been loved, nurtured and given the best in life that's possible."We are pleased the jury saw through his lies and saw him as the evil person he truly was."Fulford said that women had reported abuse by McLernon's since he was 14. His first girlfriend, Kimberly Mitchell, told the court of a series of assaults in which he punched, stamped on and trod on her head.Another woman told how he painted the words "whore and bitch" on walls near her home.The judge said: "This defendant had a propensity to be violent towards others, particularly young women who he was in a sexual relationship with."His abusive history vividly demonstrates the disturbing way McLernon controls, dominates, degrades, bullies and then attacks women."The trial heard how he lured Blunnie to meet him in the early hours of 27 June by sending her a text message saying: "I've got a surprise for you."McLernon had claimed two other men had been responsible for the killing and he was unable to do anything to help her. The jury took two hours to find him guilty.In the weeks leading up to the murder he had told friends and family that Blunnie was trying to ruin his new relationship, telling one he expected to go to prison for what he planned to do.Giving evidence, McLernon told the court he had been addicted to cheap supermarket alcohol, particularly strong cider mixed with sparkling wine.He became obsessed with the Guitar Hero computer game, playing for hours each day and competing in national online competitions.On one occasion, Blunnie became so frustrated with his behaviour that she broke his Guitar Hero guitar in half, he said.After the case, Detective Chief Inspector Lucy Robinson said: "McLernon sought to cover his tracks and concocted a web of lies to account for where he had been that evening and his knowledge of the murder."He has deprived a family of the special time had with a new mother and baby, Eystna's parents of their grandchild and Eystna the chance to be a mother to the baby she was so looking forward to having."
