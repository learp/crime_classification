Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, is poised to deliver a preliminary report to the inquiry that is investigating what the service knew of the Woolwich terror suspects and whether any intelligence was missed that might have prevented the tragedy.The investigation by the intelligence and security committee (ISC) is already under way, and its chairman, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, told the Guardian he had received a telephone briefing from Parker shortly after the incident in which he had been able to share some information about the background to the men in custody."I have been briefed by the head of the security service, MI5, and we will be receiving an introductory written report from him early next week," said Sir Malcolm. "I have had a chance to speak to him, but the rest of the committee has not. He may well be giving evidence to us in private session over the coming weeks. This inquiry will be treated with a high priority."It will be the first major investigation undertaken by the ISC with its new range of powers, which include being able to scrutinise MI5 operations, and demanding documents and files the committee had previously only been able to request.The security service could only refuse to hand over sensitive material with a direct appeal to David Cameron, but the prime minister said on Thursday he expected the ISC to conduct a rigorous look at the role played by MI5, and the intelligence it had gathered on the two men.Sir Malcolm said Parker might give evidence in private to the nine-strong committee ahead of an unprecedented public hearing, which is due to take place in July.At the public meeting, Parker will join the MI6 chief, Sir John Sawers, and GCHQ director, Sir Iain Lobban, to answer questions from the ISC, whose members include Lord Butler, a former private secretary to five prime ministers, and Sir Menzies Campbell, the former Liberal Democrat leader.It will be the first time the heads of the three agencies have gone in front of the committee together – in public – and it will give the ISC a chance to question them in broad terms about the terrorist threat and the intelligence picture before this week's murder.Criticised in the past for lacking credibility and being too sympathetic to the agencies, Sir Malcolm insisted the ISC now had the powers to hold the security services properly to account, though he warned it would be difficult for the committee to raise some sensitive issues during the joint public hearing.He said the priority remained the police inquiry into the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, but he thought it was possible for the ISC to continue its own investigation concurrently – because the committee will question witnesses, and review files, behind closed doors. "This is the first inquiry that we will have done under the new powers. I am 100% sure the agencies will co-operate with us," said Sir Malcolm.The security service and the police had files on the two suspects, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, who had appeared as peripheral figures in counter-terrorist investigations over the last eight years. Adebolajo has been linked to the now outlawed group al-Muhajiroun. One of the men is understood to have wanted to travel to Somalia to join the al-Qaida affiliate, al-Shabaab, but may have been deterred from going after being approached by the police.Whitehall sources told the Guardian that MI5 was keen for the prime minister to confirm the men were known to the agency at this stage – to prevent allegations of a cover-up.Downing Street has been told that MI5 did not consider the men to be a high risk or a danger to national security, because there was nothing in their background to suggest they would behave in the way they did on Wednesday.Amid some strong media criticism of the service, a former head of counter-terrorism at MI6 said it was "incredibly hard to stop" attacks of this kind, which probably had little planning or preparation."I assume that these people are probably coming out of a small group without necessarily any overseas connections or any other broader connections in the United Kingdom which could come to the attention of the security services more than they did," said Richard Barrett."When does a person who expresses radical views, who joins a radical group, flip over to over to be a violent extremist? To find the signals, the red flags as it were, I think is enormously hard."I should imagine that these two people themselves probably didn't have any intention to commit a crime like this until relatively recently before they did. They must have had some indication that these guys were a problem in order to note their names. But it is one thing to note their names, it is quite another thing to take invasive action to track their movements and so on."Professor Michael Clarke, the director of the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, said Wednesday's attack appeared to be crude operation that was hastily drawn up.
