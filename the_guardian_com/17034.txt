A woman who used her three daughters-in-law as slaves and was preparing a similar fate for a fourth young woman was today sentenced to seven years in jail.Naseebah Bibi, who beat her victims and treated them "like dogs", was said by a judge at Preston crown court to have psychologically and physically traumatised the women, condemning them to live in fear.She used her house in Blackburn, Lancashire, as a prison and factory, forcing her oldest son Fahim's wife to make clothes for 13 years and keeping the money from their sale. Nagina Akhtar was given little more than a month off for the births of each of her three children, and was beaten into doing cleaning and cooking chores when the clothing business collapsed.Bibi was convicted earlier this year of falsely imprisoning Nagina between 1993 and 2006, Tazeem Akhtar from 2001 to 2003 and Nisbah Akhtar between 2005 and 2007. The women had come to Britain after arranged marriages to three of Bibi's six children, who are their cousins.None of them spoke English, and Bibi's trial in April heard that they had seldom been allowed to leave the house. The brutality came to light after Nagina's three-year-old son told staff at his nursery that his grandmother had caused the severe bruising they had noticed on his mother's hands.In a statement to police, Nagina said: "Literally I lived in a prison, not a house. I was so frightened of her I would do as I was told."She later retracted the claims and said her life in Blackburn had been "happy", but she and her husband then moved to Halifax, West Yorkshire, and have broken off all contact with his parents.Bibi's second victim, Nisbah, told the jury that her life had been "hell", with Bibi using brushes, shoes and even an air freshener to beat her into working from 7am every day. After her escape from the house while Bibi was distracted, her husband Nadeem told police he had played no part in the marriage, as he already had a white partner.Nisbah's sister Tazeem, 29, gave evidence by videolink from Pakistan, where she was abandoned by the family after her husband, Nahim, Bibi's third son, rejected the marriage because he was living with a white partner and their two children.The judge, Robert Brown, said he had kept the prison sentence as short as he could because of Bibi's age, poor health and mental state. She will serve three-and-a-half years, with strict monitoring of the situation in her house after she is released on licence.The court passed information to the immigration authorities about an 18-year-old woman in Pakistan called Naeela, who has been betrothed as a fourth intended daughter-in-law. Joe Boyd, prosecuting, said that if this went ahead she could "be exploited in the same way as the other three â€“ the cycle will take place again".The judge said he had taken account of cultural differences and accepted that Bibi followed her own parents' views on arranged marriages. But he said: "That can be no excuse for the degree of cruelty and imprisonment to which the victims were subjected."
