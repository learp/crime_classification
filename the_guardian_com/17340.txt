Detectives investigating historic allegations of abuse at care homes in north Wales have identified 100 alleged offenders, police say.A total of 235 alleged victims or witnesses have contacted police with information, including the names or partial names of 100 alleged offenders, since the investigation began last November.Of the 100 potential suspects, 24 are believed to have died but the remaining 76 are under police investigation.The scale of alleged abuse in the north Wales care system was outlined on Wednesday almost a year after the launch of Operation Pallial, the investigation ordered by David Cameron at the height of the child abuse scandal.Ian Mulcahey, the senior investigating officer in the case, said: "Operation Pallial is currently pursuing a large number of active lines of inquiry, working closely with police forces across the country and agencies and charities that provide support to victims of crime."Those who have come forward to report abuse in north Wales now live across England, Wales and Scotland, and many are receiving ongoing support and counselling as we work hard to bring offenders to justice."Fourteen suspects have been arrested since the investigation began last November, including one man who has been charged with more than 30 serious sexual offences.Detectives emphasised on Wednesday that they would continue to investigate allegations made against people who are believed to be dead. In cases where the suspect has died, victims will be told whether their testimony would have likely led to criminal charges being brought during the abuser's lifetime."We consider it very important for people who have come forward, been interviewed and provided information, to know the outcome of the inquiries we have made in their cases and what view the Crown Prosecution Service has reached," said Mulcahey. "If there are cases where individuals could have faced charges had they been alive, we think it is important for victims to know this."The NSPCC described the past year as a tipping point for child abuse, following the Jimmy Savile scandal, and the CPS said it had undergone fundamental reform in recent years in the way it handled such cases.Ed Beltrami, the chief crown prosecutor for the CPS in Wales, said: "At the Crown Prosecution Service, we have recognised that victims of child sexual abuse often have very real vulnerabilities that because of old myths and stereotypes might have stood in the way of a prosecution in the past. But we have come a long way, working closely with judges, the police, experts, victims' representatives, and government, to ensure the whole system has matured and developed."We are now very clear that the focus must be on the overall credibility of an allegation, rather than the perceived weakness of the person making it. I think it's right that those who have reported abuse in north Wales have their courage recognised by CPS lawyers looking seriously at what they have said, even where the alleged abuser is no longer alive."Police said on Wednesday that, of the 235 people who had contacted officers, 204 had indicated that they were "willing and able to support the investigation".The number of victims or witnesses coming forward has increased by nearly 100 since April, when Operation Pallial published a previous update on its investigation. The National Crime Agency said that 97% of alleged victims have been video interviewed by officers trained with handling allegations of serious sexual abuse.Many of the victims are now spread across the UK, police said, with 54% aged between 40 and 50.Jenny Williams, director of social services at Conwy county borough council, which is supporting the victims, said that the impact of the abuse on people's live had been profound."Some victims have expressed their regret at becoming involved with the investigation, having underestimated the strength of their feelings which have been realised by undertaking the police interview and also as a result of media coverage," she said."However, a much greater number of individuals have felt significant relief, as the investigation has made progress and they have completed their interview."
