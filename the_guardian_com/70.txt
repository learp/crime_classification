A civil servant who took bribes to help an American company win a multimillion-pound contract was jailed for two years yesterday.Southwark crown court heard that Michael Hale funded his lavish lifestyle, including a luxury villa in Spain and exclusive hotels, by handing over confidential information about supplying gas to the British army. He gave the details to California-based Pacific Consolidated Industries, which was subsequently awarded a multimillion-pound contract.The court was told that the company's vice-president, Lee Smith, paid for Hale and his wife to travel to the US, put them up in exclusive hotels and entertained them on his luxury yacht. Mr Smith also sent Hale nine separate payments totalling more than £217,000 over a four-year period. In return Hale provided Mr Smith with information which the court heard was crucial to winning a £4.5m contract to supply gas and gas containers to Britain's armed forces over several years.Christopher Donnellan, prosecuting, said that as well as the five-bedroomed villa in Benidorm, Hale splashed out on two houses in Cambridgeshire.Hale was arrested when auditors noticed suspicious accounting in the books of the US company following a takeover. The information was passed on to the Ministry of Defence, where Hale awarded contracts for gas supplies and equipment, and he was arrested.He initially denied the charges, claiming he had received the "legitimate" payments in return for consultancy work, but later pleaded guilty to nine counts of corruption.Sentencing Hale, Judge Christopher Elwen said yesterday that public officials must realise that corruption of any kind would not be tolerated. "As well as being a punishment to you, these sentences must also act as a deterrent to others in similar positions."
