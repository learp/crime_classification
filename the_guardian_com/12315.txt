Nine men were convicted yesterday of a catalogue of offences against vulnerable girls who were groomed and sexually abused.The group befriended the girls, plied them with alcohol, then took them to "parties" where they were often used for sex. An undercover investigation by Derbyshire police, known as Operation Retriever, was split into three trials, which have run since February.Two of the gang received more convictions for sex crimes at Leicester Crown court yesterday. Thirteen men were charged and 11 stood trial for a string of charges – not all sexual – relating to the case, which involved 26 victims, one as young as 12. At the opening of the first trial, held at Nottingham Crown Court, Yvonne Coen QC, for the prosecution, said: "They preyed on young girls who were vulnerable, either because of their age and because of their own personal circumstances."They exploited these girls either for their own sexual satisfaction or for their friends."Abid Mohammed Saddique, 27, and Mohammed Romaan Liaqat, 28 – both married with children – were said to be the leaders of the gang.Saddique, of Derby, was convicted of four counts of rape as well as two counts of false imprisonment, two of sexual assault, three charges of sexual activity with a child, perverting the course of justice, and aiding and abetting rape.Liaqat, also of Derby, was found guilty of one count of rape, two of sexual assault, aiding and abetting rape, affray, and four counts of sexual activity with a child.Both will be sentenced on 7 January after pleading guilty to causing a person under 18 to be involved in pornography.In echoes of a similar case in Rotherham earlier this month, juries were told the victims were mostly schoolgirls, some estranged from their families and homes.Police said they were from a variety of backgrounds and urged all parents to be aware of the risks of sexual exploitation.The court heard that victims were targeted predominantly by Saddique or Liaqat, who embarked on a "campaign of calls and texts", then plied them with cigarettes, alcohol, drugs and "sometimes a ride in a flash or sporty car".Once they met up, the girls were forced to have sex with, or perform sex acts on, various people, the court heard."The girls involved in the case were young and however cool and grown-up they may have wanted to be or intended to appear, in fact they were naive and impressionable," Coen said."The reason for the main defendants' relentless pursuit of the girls in this way was quite simple. They wanted sex, whether the girls wanted sex or not."One of the girls told the court about a time she was raped in June 2008, when she was 16.She knew one of the men who called her asking to meet up and, after being taken to a petrol station to buy alcohol, she was driven to an isolated spot where one of the men raped her."It felt like it lasted for hours but it didn't, I know that it didn't," she said. "While I was lying there, he said 'Do you like it, do you like it?'. And I said yes."I tried to do everything I could to stop it so at that stage I just said yes. I just thought if I tell him what he wants to hear, it will be done quicker."Other defendants have already been convicted and sentenced.Akshay Kumar, 38, admitted one count of causing a person under the age of 18 to be involved in pornography and was jailed for two years and 10 months.Faisal Mehmood, 24, pleaded guilty to sexual activity with a child before the trial and was jailed for three years.He has now been deported to Pakistan.Mohammed Imran Rehman, 26, was jailed for seven-and-a-half years after being found guilty of rape, while Graham Blackham, 26, was given a three-year sentence after he was convicted of two counts of breaching a sexual offences prevention order.Liaqat's brother Naweed Liaqat, 33, and Farooq Ahmed, 28, pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and were both jailed for 18 months.Ziafat Yasin, 31, was cleared of sex charges but pleaded guilty to being concerned in the supply of cocaine. He was jailed for three years.
