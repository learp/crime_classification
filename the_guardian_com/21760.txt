Prison officers are to be banned from going on strike, the justice secretary, Jack Straw, disclosed last night.Mr Straw told MPs that he was now "actively considering" a statutory ban on industrial action in jails in the wake of the first national 24-hour strike by 20,000 prison officers in August over pay.The decision to ban the Prison Officers' Association (POA), which represents nearly all prison officers in state-run jails, from taking industrial action will reinstate a measure first imposed by Michael Howard when he was home secretary in 1994. Charles Clarke repealed the ban when he was home secretary two years ago - on the condition that a voluntary no-strike agreement was honoured.Mr Straw said last night that in his view the agreement had been abrogated by the POA and the government had the right to reinstate the 1994 legislation. The POA has refused to offer a guarantee that they will not take further industrial action, he said.Mr Straw also revealed to MPs that he is taking urgent action to alleviate the prisons crisis by facilitating the release of nearly 400 inmates on indefinite sentences who have already passed the date for their minimum terms.The justice secretary admitted to the Commons constitutional affairs committee yesterday that the "bounty" from the emergency early release scheme introduced in June, under which non-violent prisoners were released 18 days early, had proved less than expected. He also hinted the 18 days could be further extended. The prison population in England and Wales hit a new record high of 81,245 last Friday.As the prison service grapples with a renewed crisis over inmate numbers, Mr Straw said that he hoped a further 300 new prison places would be built by Christmas but it would take much longer to deliver the government's promise of 9,500 extra places.He made it clear that the explosion in the number of prisoners jailed by the courts for indefinite terms known as indeterminate public protection (IPP) sentences was a major driver of the prison population since their introduction in 2005.He said there were now 3,090 IPP prisoners with 392 on such short tariffs that their minimum terms had already expired but so far only 11 had been released."I don't regard that as satisfactory. We have to take some pretty urgent action to get these people through the system," said Mr Straw. "Of course there has to be a judgment about whether it is safe to release them. But they shouldn't be held after their tariff has expired, unless it is absolutely necessary, simply because procedures are taking too long."Several high court challenges by prisoners on IPP sentences have already succeeded, triggering the review by ministers.
