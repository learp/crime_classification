The teenager accused of murdering Rhys Jones told a girl about his plans to exact revenge on the alleged target of the shooting, a jury at Liverpool crown court heard today.Rhys, 11, was shot in a pub car park after straying into the line of fire of an alleged gang war. Sean Mercer, 18, an alleged Crocky, or member of the Croxteth Crew gang, is accused of murdering Rhys on August 22 2007, as the boy walked home from football practice.Mercer, who denies the murder, allegedly fired three shots at members of a rival gang, the prosecution claimed. The 16-year-old girl, who cannot be named, told the jury she knew both Mercer and Wayne Brady who, it is claimed, was a member of the rival Strand gang and one of Mercer's intended targets on the night Rhys was killed. Questioned by Neil Flewitt QC, prosecuting, she said Mercer once told her: "[Brady's] getting it". Asked by Flewitt if Mercer explained his words, she said: "No. This was years ago, he was just messing, winding me up." She said Mercer and Brady had once been friends but stopped speaking, although she did not know why. The girl, giving evidence from behind a curtain, also said she never passed on the message to Brady or anybody who knew him. During cross examination, Richard Pratt QC, defending Mercer, said the accused had no memory of the reported conversation and put it to the girl that it never happened, to which she insisted that it had. Rhys bled to death in his mother's arms following the shooting at the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth, Liverpool, in August last year. Alongside Mercer, six others are accused of assisting an offender. They all deny the charges.
