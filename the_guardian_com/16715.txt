As a fledgling reporter on the South London Press, the Deptford fire was my first big story (The blaze we cannot forget, 17 January). My recollection of that tragic event, its aftermath and the socio-political context coincides almost exactly with Darcus Howe's typically incisive, impassioned account.He might also have mentioned this: that same weekend a number of teenagers died in a fire at a disco in Ireland, prompting an immediate letter of condolence from Buckingham Palace. No such message was sent to the families of those who died in Deptford. This only fuelled the suspicion that the establishment, the police, the media and white society in general regarded the deaths of black people as less important. They are not "ours", we will not mourn them.Thirty years on, I wonder if the murder of Jo Yeates would have been investigated and reported in the same way if she had been a young African-Caribbean woman from a different part of Bristol? How much newsprint and airtime have been devoted to the floods in Queensland relative to those in Brazil and Sri Lanka? As you say Mr Howe, plus Ã§a change.Martyn BedfordIlkley, West Yorkshire
