The dramatic plea from the Cambridgeshire chief constable, Julie Spence, for government cash to cope with the changing demands of policing a county with one of the fastest growing migrant populations in Britain is well founded.In making her argument for funding to recruit 100 extra police officers, Mrs Spence is very careful not to claim that migrant workers are any more prone to criminality than resident Cambridgeshire folk. But she does point out that along with new migrant communities comes different kinds of crime - in this case more drink-driving, cannabis-factories and human trafficking problems.The Cambridgeshire police clearly say "there is little evidence that the increased numbers of migrant workers have caused significant or systematic problems in respect of community safety or cohesion".But they say the complications in policing set in because of the "inappropriately negative" community perceptions of migrant workers - including confusing them with asylum seekers - means that routine incidents, such as over noise, parking and other petty disputes, can fuel local resentment and, if not managed carefully, turn "critical" and become hugely costly for the police to handle.The Cambridgeshire police say that this is complicated by the demands of policing a community whose people now speak 100 different languages with translation costs for dealing with incidents now reaching Â£1 million a year. The single largest group of foreign nationals detained by the Cambridgeshire police last year were Lithuanians, which added to many cases a new international dimension of having to liaise with the Baltic authorities.As Mrs Spence put it: "The profile of the county has changed dramatically and this simply isn't taken into account when government allocates funding. We now deal with people from many different countries, speaking more than 100 different languages. While the economic benefits of growth are clear we need to maintain basic public infrastructure which means increasing the number of officers we have."Cambridgeshire likes to point out that Peterborough now has the same population as Lewisham but has only 289 officers to police the city compared with 600 for the London borough.But concerns about the pressure of migration on Cambridgeshire - whose teenage population was 96% white only four years ago - are probably more acute than nearly anywhere else in the country.More eastern European migrant workers have gone to East Anglia than any other part of the country, and Cambridgeshire has taken 50% of them. Its population is projected to grow by 12.5% by 2016 - with only Warwickshire more than matching that level of population growth - and the government funding formula based on the 2001 census has so far failed to reflect that change.The rise in immigration is all the more dramatic for taking place in parts of the country that remained almost entirely white while Britain's inner cities went through four decades of ethnic change.This is not a matter of political correctness or a taboo subject. The Commission for Racial Equality in its farewell report, published today, says if there is to be a chance of building an integrated Britain, ministers must shake up funding formulas to help those areas experiencing rapid population change.The government does not disagree. The immigration minister, Liam Byrne, responded to the Cambridgeshire plea today by stressing the government's new-found intention when setting immigration policy to take social impact into account. He is waiting for the new Migration Impacts Forum to make its first assessment of housing, education and policing needs before deciding on future levels of migration.
