Three new centres to help victims of sexual assault are to be set up, the government announced today, while insisting the justice system's handling of rape cases is improving.The new government-funded support projects will be established in Durham, Swindon in Wiltshire, and Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales at a cost of £70,000 each, the Home Office announced.Meanwhile, the solicitor general, Harriet Harman, told Guardian Unlimited that the government's reforms relating to sexual assault cases were beginning to yield results.Ms Harman said the new specialised sex crimes prosecutors had been working for about six months and other measures were increasing the confidence of victims to seek prosecution.The most recent British Crime Survey estimated that there were 190,000 serious sexual assaults and 47,000 female victims of rape or attempted rape a year. However, less than one in seven are reported to police and of those only 6% lead to a conviction.Ms Harman said rape was still less likely to be reported than other serious crimes, and less likely to lead to charges but insisted: "I've definitely seen an improvement in the way rape is treated in the criminal justice system."The 2003 Sexual Offences Act came into force in May last year and included defendants in rape cases now having to prove it was reasonable for them to believe sex was consensual.Ms Harman, who attended a conference with her Scottish counterpart, Elish Angiolini, in Edinburgh yesterday to discuss sex assault cases, said other measures had helped boost the confidence of victims to seek prosecution. "Victims can give evidence from behind a screen so they don't have to look at the accused and the judge can clear the public gallery when they are giving evidence so they don't have to do so in front of people from the neighbourhood."Ms Harman said ideas that came out of the conference - which was attended by Crown Prosecution Service lawyers - included wider interviewing of potential witnesses, rather than just focusing on interviews with the victim. The Sexual Assault Referral Centres (Sarcs) have dedicated staff and facilities to help victims with the after effects of rape or sexual assault. Five existing Sarcs in Manchester, Lancashire, Derbyshire and two in London are also to share a further £100,000 to expand existing services.Ministers believe the centres can help reduce the gap between the reporting of rape and convictions by improving confidence in the way the crimes are investigated. Announcing the new funding, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: "As a result of these services victims can be confident that their case will be treated with the professionalism and empathy they deserve."
