A man has been arrested in connection with the murder of teenage model Sally Anne Bowman, Scotland Yard said last night.The 35-year-old was arrested in Surrey yesterday evening and taken to a south London police station for questioning.Sally Anne, 18, was stabbed and seriously sexually assaulted on September 25 last year in Blenheim Crescent, south Croydon, only yards from her home.Sally Anne was attacked after a night out in Croydon which included a trip to Lloyds Bar, before going to a friend's address and heading home.Neighbours in Croydon heard her screaming in the early hours of Sunday and her body was later found on the pavement next to a skip.Four men were arrested in September last year in connection with the teenager's murder, one aged 20, another 25 and two aged 26. All four were released without charge.Earlier this month, detectives made a fresh appeal on the BBC's Crimewatch programme, based around a new e-fit of a suspect who had been linked by DNA to an indecent assault in July 2001.The e-fit was compiled by the victim of that attack and released six months on from Sally Anne's death.In March, detectives set up a DNA screening centre in south Croydon, asking local men who were white or light-skinned and born between 1965 and 1985 to provide their DNA voluntarily.Hundreds came forward but thousands more still remain to be screened.Sally Anne, who also worked as a hairdresser, had only turned 18 a week before she died.She had attended the Brit School for the performing arts in Croydon where former pupils include music stars Morcheeba, Amy Winehouse and Katie Melua, who topped the album charts last year.But Sally Anne had wanted to follow in the footsteps of Croydon-born supermodel Kate Moss and had already begun appearing on the catwalk.
