It sounds like a George Orwell story: Britain is to use computers to help fix the sentences of criminals and their release dates.Sir Graham Smith, chief inspector of probation, told reporters last week that this would be "a world first". His motives were sound enough: a wish to improve the consistency of sentencing. His service produces 600,000 reports for the courts every year but "we have relied too much on nous, instinct and feel. In the past nous has been important, but people have used it in different ways." Now, as well as the reports, the courts would receive a risk prediction from a computer, based on a large category of factors: criminal record; education, training, employability; lifestyle and associates; alcohol and drug use; emotional stability; relationships; attitudes to crime; general social behaviour; and postcode. This is not such a new invention as Sir Graham implied. A young Home Office researcher, Chris Nuttall, who later be came head of research, devised a similar but non-computerised guide for the parole board 25 years ago, but it fell into disuse. There has been at least one previous computer model. Sir Graham needs to be more honest about the new system's limitations. It will not be able to predict what an individual will do, only place the individual into a risk category. Even a high-risk category - say with a 70% risk of reconviction - would still mean 30% would not be reconvicted. First, how are the civil rights of these "false positives" going to be protected? Second, he needs to release the research showing how good a predictor each of the factors is. Why are postcodes being included? They should be left to postmen, not used for sentencing. Third, he must answer the Law Society's objections: this is a serious shift in sentencing - from what an offender has done to what he or she might do. Computers can be an aid, but never a substitute for human discretion in delivering justice.
