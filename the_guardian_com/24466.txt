Revellers looking for a late-night drink or dance in a Somerset town will soon have to submit to biometric finger scans before being allowed into clubs and pubs.Under the scheme, licensees at late-night premises in Yeovil will ask customers to register their details, allow themselves to be photographed and have their fingers scanned.Champions of the project, which is receiving government funding, say it will help licensees weed out troublemakers, as it will be easy to check if a clubgoer has caused trouble in the past. However, Liberty, the civil rights campaign group, questioned whether the scheme offered a "proportionate response" to tackling troublemakers.The system will not be linked to police computers, but officers accepted it could be useful if a crime was committed at one of the premises using the system.A few individual clubs in the UK already use finger scans. In Yeovil, six of the seven late-night drinking spots will run the scheme together - the first time this has been done.
