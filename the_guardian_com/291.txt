Police are hunting two jewel thieves who broke into Ozzy Osbourne's mansion yesterday and escaped with more than £1m of jewellery.The men used a ladder to get into the former Black Sabbath frontman's £5m home in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, at about 4am yesterday.They stole the jewellery from a first-floor room, but woke Osbourne and his wife Sharon, prompting a chase.It is thought Osbourne grabbed one of the burglars, but the man escaped by jumping about 10 metres (33ft) from a window."Police believe the burglar who escaped would have been injured after jumping from the window," said a spokesperson for Thames Valley police.The man who jumped was described as being of large build, 5ft 10in to 5ft 11in, and wearing a ski mask, a light-coloured jacket and trainers.There was no description of the second man.Police said the men were driving a large vehicle, possibly a van, and are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen one leaving Chalfont St Peter at high speed. Osbourne and his wife are living at the 18th century mansion while she appears in the ITV reality show The X Factor.Their children were not in the house at the time of the incident. Their daughter, Kelly, was in Vancouver, and their son, Jack, was in Los Angeles.Police said that although not many items of jewellery had been stolen, the total value of the items was more than £1m. The thieves were thought to have specifically targeted the high-priced gems.One theory being considered by police was that the thieves may have chosen Ms Osbourne because of her high- profile exposure during The X Factor, in which she and the other judges, Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh, judge would-be pop stars.Ms Osbourne is regularly seen on TV wearing expensive jewellery which could have been spotted by thieves.Osbourne and his family have become world famous over the last few years, thanks mainly to a fly-on-the-wall documentary that has followed the minutiae of their domestic life.The Osbournes, which ran for three series on MTV, reportedly earned the family £46m.It also introduced the veteran rocker to a new audience, and helped sell £27m worth of merchandise, a record for a heavy-metal artist.But last week, Osbourne announced that the family had no plans for a new series."Once is enough," he said at the MTV Europe music awards."When you watch a 25-minute episode, they have been filming for ever. I didn't like having cameras in my life the whole time."Last year, Osbourne was seriously injured in a quad bike accident in the grounds of the mansion.He cracked a vertebra in his neck, and broke his collarbone and six ribs after he fell off the bike and spent two weeks in hospital.
