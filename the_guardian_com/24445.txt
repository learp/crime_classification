Today Transform publishes a cost-benefit analysis comparing the policy of drugs prohibition with a model for the legal regulation of drugs, something the government failed to do before our drug laws were enacted and has studiously avoided doing since - even going so far as to claim that it is impossible.Our report shows that, based on the Home Office's own analysis, the UK is wasting around £4bn every year on a drug war that achieves the opposite of its stated aims while simultaneously maximising harm associated with drug use - and creating £9bn in crime costs. As the report notes: "Current approaches ignore the basic finding that the policy of prohibition itself is the direct source of much of what is perceived as 'the drug problem' - specifically, the vast majority of ... drug-related crime - rather than drug use per se."Will this revelation rock the government to its core and bring about a mature and rational exploration of more effective policy alternatives? No, because the government-sponsored war on drugs is yet another "inconvenient truth" to be spun and marginalised. As Bob Ainsworth MP so candidly put it, when asked at a press conference in 2003 (he was then the government's drug spokesperson) if he would support an audit of prohibition spending: "Why would we do that unless we were going to legalise drugs?"Yet that same year the prime minister's Strategy Unit produced a report that showed precisely what our latest publication does: that the enforcement of prohibition causes most of the harm associated with the production, supply and use of cocaine and heroin.The executive director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, Antonio Costa, has identified the creation of a huge criminal market, policy displacement (from public health to enforcement), and "the balloon effect" where enforcement in one area simply shifts the problem somewhere else.So, what is a government to do when a policy creates more harm than good? During our research, we revisited the government guidelines for what triggers an impact assessment of policy, a process similar to a cost-benefit analysis, obliging government departments to model how a policy change will impact in the real world. It also requires the assessor to show what would happen if the government did nothing or applied alternative policies.According to the government's own guidelines, the trigger for carrying out an impact assessment of drug policy has been pulled at least twice - once when the Strategy Unit recognised significant unintended consequences of current policy, and when the latest drug strategy went out for public consultation. Yet no assessment was done.Transform is also aware of at least two substantial recent pieces of government analysis looking at value for money on drug policy that have not been made public, despite Freedom of Information Act requests. Given the wide concern, the government should urgently publish the analysis it has done, commission a full independent cost-benefit analysis of drug enforcement spending, and launch an impact assessment of the drug strategy and the Misuse of Drugs Act. And while they are at it, face reality and maturely engage in the debate around the legalisation and regulation of drugs.We can only hope that this latest reality check highlighting the terrible costs of 'sending out the right message', and will expose significant wasteful expenditure to meaningful public scrutiny and debate. Failure to do this would maintain the culture of immunising counterproductive wars from scrutiny that stretches back through history.• Danny Kushlick works for the drugs reform charity Transform www.tdpf.org.uk
