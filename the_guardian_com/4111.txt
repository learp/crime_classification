The son of a man who made his two daughters pregnant 19 times during almost 30 years of rape and physical abuse has described the terror his father inflicted on the family.The 56-year-old father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given 25 life sentences last month and ordered to serve a minimum of 19 years and six months.His son said he "couldn't remember a good time with the family" and described how his father picked him up by his ears and beat him, knocking him out on several occasions."When I was in the darkness, in the quiet place when I was knocked out, I just wanted to be there all the time. Then he'd chuck cold water on my face and be back to the misery," he told BBC Radio Five Live.He said he never saw his father sexually abuse his sisters, but heard him constantly call them names and pick on them. The son said he tried to protect his sisters but he was not powerful enough.He described how his father would push their faces onto the bars of an electric gas fire if he thought they had done something wrong "until you squealed 'I did it'. If I didn't do it, I'd admit it so my sisters didn't get hurt".The son, now in his 30s, said he had 49 scars on the back of his head that had been inflicted by his dad, had attempted suicide when aged five, and now suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and needed regular medication to stabilise his moods. He said he was denied any protection, despite being on the child protection register from the age of five. He left home at the age of 15 and only became aware of the sexual abuse inflicted on his sisters when he was 18 and his mother told him that his "nephew" was in fact his half-brother. The son claimed he told the police, who informed social services, but no action was taken."I hope he rots in hell," he said of his father. " You don't do that to your own daughters, you don't physically and mentally abuse your son, you don't physically and mentally hurt your wife. Basically he was just a bully, a big, big bully."
