Police marksmen yesterday shot dead a dog that attacked four people, including a baby who was dragged 60 yards.Officers in Mitcham, south London, received a series of calls after the bull terrier-type dog bit a one-year-old boy on the leg before attacking a bus driver, a 50-year-old woman and another person, who received facial injuries."I saw the dog with a baby in its mouth. It dragged the baby about 60 yards across the green," said Jackie Higgis, who lives next to where the attack occurred. "If the bus driver hadn't come to the baby's rescue he would have certainly been killed. It was absolutely petrifying."The men were trying to hit the dog with a fire extinguisher from a bus and with sticks but it wouldn't let go." She said a man drove a pickup truck on to the green and tried to run the dog over. Police launched a hunt for the animal, helped by a police helicopter and dog handlers, and it was shot dead. Scotland Yard said a 29-year-old woman was arrested for having a dog "dangerously out of control".
