A neighbour of murdered Tia Sharp's grandmother has been jailed for lying about seeing her alive when she was already dead.Paul Meehan, 40, told police he saw the 12-year-old walk past his house. But at that time she had already been murdered and her body hidden in the loft of her grandmother Christine Bicknell's home in Croydon, south London.In May, Bicknell's boyfriend Stuart Hazell was jailed for a minimum of 38 years for the youngster's murder in August last year.On Monday District Judge Karen Hammond said Meehan basked in the attention of being a crucial witness as detectives searched and appealed for help finding Tia.Jailing him for five months, she said: "You basked to some degree in the attention your disclosure brought you."Meehan, a bus driver with one conviction for theft, looked down and closed his eyes when he was told his sentence would begin immediately.Tia was murdered either late at night on Thursday 2 August last year or in the early morning of the following day at 20 The Lindens, New Addington, in south east London.Despite being asked three times about Tia, Meehan did not tell officers he had seen her until late on 6 August.Croydon Magistrates' Court heard that his false information about Tia, described as detailed and vivid, threw police off Hazell's scent and gave her worried family false hope.The district judge said: "You led police down blind alleys, having to chase and check unnecessary details and delaying the interview of Stuart Hazell by 24 hours."She described the consequences of his false report as "significant and substantial"."You did bask to some degree in the attention your disclosure brought you. It was a lie you persisted in for 12 months."It is hard to imagine a more serious example of wasting police time."Outside court, Tia's mother Natalie Sharp said: "I hope he rots."Last week the family marked her murder with a private candle-lit vigil.
