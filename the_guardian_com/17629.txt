While the actions Fiona Pilkington eventually felt driven to were shocking in their violence and finality, the build-up to what happened on 23 October 2007 was commonplace.Neighbours in Bardon Road, a strip of plain but well-proportioned 1930s semi-detached houses near the edge of Barwell, were almost unanimous: bored teenagers with nothing constructive to do picking relentlessly on a family simply because disability marked them out for attention."All it was that the kids hanging round here saw something different and they decided to target it. I honestly think that's all there was to it," said Phil Brown, a 30-year-old brickyard worker using a sunny day off to tinker with his racing go-cart just down the street from Pilkington's former home.Brown, who grew up in an adjoining street, tells a familiar story of the sole youth facility in the town closing down, leaving young people with nowhere to assemble but parks and street corners.Barwell has sprouted several new estates of houses in recent years, with more planned. Some worry what this will do to a community which, along with its shortage of things for young people to do, also has a higher proportion of people claiming income support and single parent households than the regional average."It's not a bad town in any way, and this isn't a bad street," Brown said. "We're having a baby in about three weeks, and I'd never think of moving."One change, however, is immediately obvious — the fluorescent-jacketed policeman cycling slowly down the street on a regular patrol.Nigel Dexter, a 49-year-old car spray painter, recalls a visit to his house one recent evening."It was a council officer and a policeman, They wanted to make sure everything was OK, and asked if I was worried about anything. I just thought, 'That's all very well now, but what about when that family was going through hell. Where were you then?'"Dexter describes the road, a mix of social housing and homes owned by their occupiers, as "mixed", and recounts occasional incidents even in recent weeks of car windows being smashed and teenagers harassing locals.He added: "They leave me alone. They know I'm big enough to look after myself."A couple of doors down from the Pilkington home is where 70-year-old Annie ("Just Annie, the kids round here know me as Auntie Annie") has lived for more than a quarter of a century.She knew Pilkington and her daughter well, going to another neighbour's house to cry when she heard the news.Almost two years on she remains puzzled that the street she knows so well could have driven anyone to such desperate and destructive action."This road's got a bad name now, and it's such a shame. Some of the kids can be a bit rowdy, but they're basically all right. The worst I've ever had was a girl in my front garden who wouldn't leave — I think she might have been on drugs — but I got the next door neighbour and that was that."
