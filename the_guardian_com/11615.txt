Campaigners today expressed concern after Home Office research suggested that elderly people who are burgled are much more likely to die sooner than others of similar age. Age Concern said that the research, which shows that burglary has a greater impact on the elderly than was previously believed, would enhance the fear of crime amongst old people. A spokeswoman said: "Age Concern is deeply worried by Home Office figures which show that older people who suffer burglary are more likely to die earlier than those who have not. "The fear of crime for older people is very real. Statistics such as these enhance that fear." The research, seen by BBC news, examined cases of elderly burglary victims living in sheltered accommodation. It was found that their health deteriorated faster than expected, and some became so frail that they had to be moved into residential care. The research's key finding was that those whose homes had been broken into were twice as likely to die within two years as people of a similar age who had not been burgled. It called for security in sheltered housing to be improved, and recommended that that burglary victims should be kept informed of the progress of their case to help alleviate distress.
