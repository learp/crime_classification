Burglars made off with an unusual but seasonal haul when they stole free-range turkeys from a farm. They took eight oven-ready birds, worth around £800, from a large chiller at a farm in Ocle Pychard, Herefordshire.West Mercia police said the raid happened between midnight on Saturday and 6am on Sunday at the property off the A417 between Leominster and Newtown crossroads. It is believed the thieves got to the chiller in one of the barns by entering through a gate at the rear of the yard.A police spokesman said: "The eight turkeys that have been stolen were each packed in their own individual box ready for cooking at Christmas. The turkeys were all KellyBronze birds and each box was labelled with this name."Six of the turkeys weighed 8kg and the other two weighed 9kg, prepared as part of the KellyBronze range. The total value of the stolen turkeys is thought to be as much as £800."Officers investigating this theft are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen any suspicious vehicles in the Ocle Pychard area over the weekend, or anyone who's offered the opportunity to buy any turkeys similar to the ones stolen from this farm."
