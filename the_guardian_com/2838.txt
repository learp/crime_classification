Children's charity the NSPCC has called for young people to be consulted about local crime reduction strategies to ensure they are safe in their own communities, after it found many schemes failed to address their fears.The NSPCC carried out an audit of 89 crime and disorder strategies set up by the police and local authorities, which discovered that less than half (48%) involved child protection or victim support services.Building Safer Communities for Children also found that just over a third (36%) of the strategies prioritised the increased safety of young people. Less than half (42%) prioritised children's fears, while only 11% tackled those fears.Although 80% of strategies provide information on personal safety, health or citizenship information for young people, many concentrate exclusively on preventing young offending. This is despite the fact that children and young people are more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators of crime.NSPCC chief executive Mary Marsh said: "This report shows that more action is needed to ensure that children and young people are safe in their communities and are consulted about their fears and needs."The survey recommends that local authority partnerships should consult with young people of all ages and backgrounds, addressing their specific risks and fears. For example, while many strategies tackled hate crimes, such as racial and homophobic attacks, few were designed to help young people. Similarly only 36% of domestic violence initiatives were designed to help child victims.Other recommendations included developing separate youth safety strategies, targeting schemes in areas where they are most at risk and appointing a co-ordinator to oversee crime reduction in the community.Rob Hutchinson, chairman of the association of social services directors' children and families committee, said strategies were becoming more sophisticated and better at involving young people.Mr Hutchinson, Portsmouth director of social services, said safe houses for children had been set up in the city after consulting local schools. "These are ordinary people's homes, which are regularly monitored by the police and social services, where children can go if they're in trouble or distress," he said.The NSPCC report also identified several examples of good practice in local authority partnerships. Stockport council has established a corporate youth strategy to improve relations between young people and the police. This followed consultations in schools and youth groups, which found that young people were less likely to report crimes committed against them because they felt harassed by the police.Steve Brown, manager of Stockport youth offending team, said: "We found they resented being moved on from bright areas at night, such as garages and shop windows, because they felt safe there. So we've tried to establish a greater tolerance between young people and adults by getting them to discuss their rights and responsibilities."A spokesman for the Department for Education and Employment's children and young people's unit said the unit would be funding local partnerships to design crime reduction services for children and families."They should ensure play areas are safe and supervised, and provide special advisers to children in distress as a result of crime," he said.Personal careers advisers on the DfEE's Connexions service, which will be piloted in April, would also be trained to deal with such issues, he added.
