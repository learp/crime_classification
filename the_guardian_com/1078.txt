Prayers were said in the McCanns' home village today to mark the two-year anniversary of their daughter Madeleine's disappearance.Villagers gathered at churches in Rothley, Leicestershire, where the family live, to pray for Madeleine, who disappeared in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on 3 May 2007, a few days before her fourth birthday.Her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, are believed to have left the village to spend a weekend away from the public eye, with their four-year-old twins, Sean and Amelie.Father Keith Tomlinson, the priest at the McCanns' Catholic church, the Sacred Heart, dedicated today's mass to Madeleine, who would now be almost six. The Rev Rob Gladstone, the vicar at Rothley parish church, said his congregation prayed for Madeleine every week, but would be giving extra thought to her today."In all our services we pray for missing children and particularly for the McCann family every week. We will give a bit more attention to this, but it has never gone away from here, it's still happening for us. Week by week we pray for the McCann family."The McCanns have made renewed efforts in recent weeks to keep awareness of the campaign to find their daughter in people's minds, including the release of a digitally enhanced age progression image of how their daughter may now look, and an intimate interview with the US chatshow host Oprah Winfrey, due to be broadcast today.In a statement issued ahead of today'sanniversary, the McCanns said: "It is two long years since Madeleine was taken. It is two years since we were a happy family of five. The pain and anxiety does not lessen, but our determination to find our beautiful daughter remains steadfast. We are no longer looking for a four-year-old little girl, but a six-year-old one. This is crucial."The McCanns' spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, said it had been difficult for the couple to see the image of how their daughter would look today, but felt it was important for as many people as possible to see Madeleine as she is now, rather than the three-year-old child seen in previously released photographs."This is the child that somebody who is close to Madeleine may spot, rather than the child in those other photos, and Kate and Gerry are incredibly hopeful that this will lead to the phone call that finds Madeleine and brings her home," he said.The McCanns also hope a Channel 4 documentary about their daughter's disappearance, to be aired on Thursday, will refresh the memories of people who were in Praia da Luz two years ago.The documentary, Cutting Edge: Madeleine Was Here, follows two private detectives, Dave Edgar and Arthur Cowley, as they try to piece together evidence given by witnesses.Until now, the McCanns have not released any possible new leads from the documents, but are expected to reveal some new lines of inquiry in the documentary.Edgar and Cowley, two former British police officers, told documentary makers they believed the answer to Madeleine's disappearance lay in the Portuguese resort.Edgar, a retired detective inspector, said: "You don't start an investigation in Morocco or Spain or France or even Lisbon. This offence happened in Praia da Luz. It is a very self-contained resort, and that's where we've started and that's where I think the answer is."
