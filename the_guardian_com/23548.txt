A teenager who was stabbed to death near Wembley stadium was a hardworking father of a young daughter and a “perfect son”, his family have said. Djodjo Nsaka, 19, was found with a knife wound at about 1.15am on Friday by police responding to reports of an altercation. He died at the scene. He is believed to be the first teenager to have been murdered on the streets of the capital this year.Police are still searching for the person who delivered the fatal wound. A man in his 20s was arrested on suspicion of murder in the early hours of Friday but later released without any further action.Nsaka’s father, Tuna, said his son – a business studies student at Middlesex University – had been working two jobs to pay for his tuition and support his family, including his two-year old daughter.Tuna Nsaka, 62, a porter at Kingston hospital, told the London Evening Standard: “For me, he was the perfect son. He was helping us, he was helping the family. “He is the only son I have. I said to him: ‘Maybe you will be the boss of this family.’ He was helping every day to pay the bills. He was the one who bought food for us on Christmas Day.“He liked to be working, he was a hard worker. He was never involved in anything wrong, he was a good guy.”A postmortem showed he died from a single stab wound to the chest. Another man, aged 20, was treated for minor injuries.Nsaka’s family said he had worked at JD Sports in Wembley and Tesco in Streatham on weekends, while studying part-time. He said Nsaka’s mother, Julienne, 54, collapsed when she heard the news and still believes he is coming back. Falone Nsaka, 26, the eldest of his five sisters, said: “We want justice. He was our only brother, losing him is so painful.”Detectives from the Met’s homicide and major crime command have urged anyone with information to call the incident room on 020 8358 0100 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
