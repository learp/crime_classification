Hundreds of victims of stalkers could be missing out on a government-funded helpline this summer because the only person trained to take calls is on holiday.The National Stalking Helpline, launched in April, is shut for three weeks, presenting callers with a scenario described yesterday as "akin to drowning at sea while the lifeboats are on holiday".The service was developed by three charities in conjunction with the police and is part-funded by the Home Office. It offers a confidential service to people who suspect they are being stalked but feel unsure about reporting it to the police – although, in some cases, the helpline may tell police against a user's wish.In June, the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, one of the charities involved, saidthe helpline had been "inundated" with calls since its inception, dealing with 379 inquiries. But from 23 July, callers to the line have been met with a message saying the service will be closed until 16 August.A message on the National Stalking Helpline website said the line was closed "due to unavoidable circumstances", although an email advice service would still work.Jo Walker, campaign and communications officer at the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, admitted that the person who operated the phone line was on holiday, but said "the person doesn't exist" who could have provided cover for such a short time. "It's very specific training, so to try and get someone to cover that would be very difficult – you'd have to train someone just for those three weeks," she said.The charity could not afford to employ someone on a longer-term contract, she said. While it had people who would respond to emails, allowing someone to answer the phones without training "could do more damage".Asked if it had been a mistake to set up the line with only one member of staff , she said: "We're doing what we can with the funding available. We'd rather it was open 11 months a year than not open at all," she said, adding that it was likely the helpline would apply for more funding from the Home Office later in the year.Dr David Holmes, senior psychologist and director of the forensics group at Manchester Metropolitan University, said it was "a tragedy" that stalking victims would not be able to access the line. "Helplessness is really quite a strong characteristic that some stalking victims feel, and to not get through they would probably begin to think that the whole thing was a plot," he said."They would think that they haven't got a chance, that the stalker has managed to cut them off from that, that there is no means of battling with them and they might as well give up. It's akin to drowning at sea and you ring the lifeboats and find they've gone on holiday."A spokeswoman for the Network for Surviving Stalking said: "This is a concerning situation and one that highlights the need for additional funding for this vital project." A Home Office spokesman said the department is looking to provide extra funding to support the helpline.
