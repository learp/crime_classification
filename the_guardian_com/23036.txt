A man who killed six people including his wife and two young children in a frenzied knife attack has been jailed for 30 years.Damian Rzeszowski armed himself with kitchen knives and stabbed his father-in-law Marek Gartska, 56, wife Izabela Rzeszowska, 30, daughter Kinga, five, and two-year-old son Kacper, at their Jersey home on 14 August last year.The 31-year-old Polish builder also killed his wife's friend, Marta De La Haye, 34, and her five-year-old daughter Julia, who were at the house for a barbecue.Rzeszowski was convicted of six counts of manslaughter but cleared or murder following a trial at the Royal Court in St Helier, Jersey, last August.Judge Michael Birt sentenced him to 30 years for each victim, which are to run concurrently.Judge Birt told the court: "The horror and brutality of these killings is hard to believe. Within a quarter of an hour all six people had died, their lives cruelly cut short at the hand of this defendant."The court is in no doubt from the nature of the attacks that you intended to kill all six victims. This was not a case of murder - the court found you guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility - but you still pose a risk of harm to anyone you are in a relationship with."The court was told that Rzeszowski was still not fully aware of what he did on the day of the killings. It also heard that he had sent letters to the loved ones of some of his victims but had not been able to bring himself to write to his wife's mother.
