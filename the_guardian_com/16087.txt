The security and intelligence agencies want to introduce plea bargaining into British law, enabling their officers to question suspects before a trial, according to legal sources.They are also prepared to look again at the vexed issue of whether to allow the product of telephone taps to be introduced in terrorist trials.Plea bargaining would enable officers from MI5 and MI6 to obtain intelligence from suspects whose cooperation would in turn be recognised by the courts, by shorter sentences, for example.Plea bargaining is not formally recognised by British courts though judges have taken into account cooperation by a suspect before conviction.Earlier this year, an Old Bailey judge told Saajid Badat, sentenced to 13 years in prison for planning to explode a shoe bomb on a passenger aircraft, that he would have faced a 50-year sentence. Mr Justice Fulford said he gave him credit for pulling out of the plot, renouncing terrorism and pleading guilty.The judge said it was in the public interest that "if a would-be terrorist turns away from death and destruction before any lives are put at risk", the courts would pass a lower sentence.Allowing information from telephone taps to be used as evidence in trials is seen now as much a bureaucratic and financial burden as a threat to sources or methods used by the security and intelligence agencies.The defence is likely to demand to see transcripts of the whole of a conversation, not only those parts used by the prosecution to make its case. That process is time-consuming and expensive.These moves are being mooted at a time when the country's three intelligence-gathering agencies - MI5, MI6 and GCHQ - face a huge challenge in their efforts against their priority target, international terrorism.MI5 is said to have discovered nothing in its internal investigation to suggest it had information which could have prevented the London bombings. This points to a significant intelligence gap rather than an intelligence failure. The agency has depended on informants - human agents or sources - for intelligence.Iraq and the US treatment of detainees at Guant√°namo Bay and elsewhere have not encouraged people who otherwise might have done more to provide information, counter-terrorist officials say. The London bombings of July 7, the first by suicide bombers in Britain, may change that.However, it will be harder for MI5 to gather intelligence if its potential targets are young militants who do not attend mosques and distance themselves from imams who do not respond to their concerns.One of the problems faced by the security and intelligence agencies is that militants appear to recruit themselves - they do not have to receive, or rely on, instructions from the al-Qaida network.A plethora of websites provide detailed information about how to make bombs. Security sources say the four London bombers could have made their devices from the internet, without help from anyone else, even though they were "high grade".The IRA was infiltrated by British intelligence whose job was made easier partly because the organisation was hierarchical and structured. Al-Qaida is the opposite - diffuse and international.MI5's resources are to be beefed up by with a new Special Reconnaissance Regiment which women are being encouraged to join. Its role may reflect the army's 14th Intelligence Company, which operated in Northern Ireland.Its plain clothes members, often masquerading as couples, monitored the movements of terrorist suspects. That model may not be the most useful in tracking potential Islamist terrorists.
