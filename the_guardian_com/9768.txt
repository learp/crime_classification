A drug-abusing former Oxford University student was detained indefinitely at Broadmoor secure hospital yesterday after admitting stabbing the daughter of a Harrow schoolmaster to death in a ferocious attack that left her with almost 70 knife wounds.Prosecutors said William Jaggs, 23, whose father also taught at the public school, killed fashion designer Lucy Braham in a sexually motivated "ferocious and unrelenting" assault triggered when she returned a kitten he had offered her.He was found by police standing naked, covered in blood and armed with a kitchen knife, over the 25-year-old's body, which was also naked and lying in a pool of blood, at her family home near the entrance to the Â£24,825-a-year north-west London school in September.Jaggs, who was suspended from his English studies at Oxford University's Oriel College for academic reasons, had become increasingly involved in drugs, including cocaine and LSD, and was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack. He pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The judge said he might never be released.The court heard that he had indecently assaulted a younger pupil while at Harrow, but that he had been allowed to continue living on the school site as his father was a teacher, and that he began taking drugs with a pupil.Ms Braham's father, Jason, art director at Harrow, condemned Jaggs from the witness box, also claiming the school had "badly let down" his daughter by not tackling Jaggs's drug-taking when he was a pupil there. "The school has to be challenged for its failure to act when as the son of a master he continued to live in the community," he said.Mr Braham compared the way his daughter and Jaggs had used their privileged upbringings, saying he "spat in the face of everyone who had given him his advantages - his parents, his teachers, including Julienne [Ms Braham's mother] and myself, and everyone who put him in a position of trust".He added: "Our lovely, funny, creative, principled daughter has been taken from us by the selfish act of a depraved, immature young man."Ms Braham, a London School of Fashion graduate, was stabbed 12 times in the chest, 33 times in the back, five times in her legs and 16 times on her arms, and suffered wounds to her lungs, liver and kidneys. When police arrived at the scene Jaggs began stabbing himself in the stomach, chest and legs and had to be treated in hospital.Jaggs's father, Alan, was a design teacher at Harrow, and the families had known each other for years, although the children knew each other only in passing.Aftab Jafferjee, prosecuting, said Jaggs had been using his parents' bank cards to buy drugs at the time of the attack and was also stealing items from Harrow. He had boasted that he wanted to "pin a girl down" before having sex with her and it did not matter if she objected. He sent a girlfriend a text message saying "As you know, I am a psychopath" and had hallucinated about killing a friend of whom he had become envious, telling a psychiatrist that four days before killing Ms Braham, he had taken his father's chainsaw to kill the man but had not found him at home.Mohammed Khamisa QC, defending, said Jaggs had grown up surrounded by a loving and caring family but became isolated and turned to drink, then drugs."Drink and drugs appear to be readily available at Harrow school," he added. Harrow said no one was available to comment.
