The mother of a British teenager found raped and murdered on a beach in Goa returned to India yesterday to find out why her daughter's internal organs were removed without permission.Scarlett Keeling, 15, was found on Anjuna beach in February and police initially said that she had died from accidental drowning. Her mother, Fiona MacKeown, maintained that her daughter had been attacked and a second autopsy revealed that she had been raped and killed. Her body was brought back to the UK for a third post mortem examination, which revealed that her uterus, kidneys and stomach were missing. Her lawyer, Vikram Varma, said she would be speaking to the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation, who are to take over the case.
