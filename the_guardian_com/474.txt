Collusion between south London criminal families and police officers - together with insidious racism and professional incompetence - led to the failure quickly to arrest the five suspects in the Stephen Lawrence murder, the resumed public inquiry was told yesterday.Opening the final submissions, Michael Mansfield QC, for the Lawrence family, said that "accident, oversight and aberration are quite inadequate to explain how so many wrongs were committed by so many officers".In a day-long analysis of 10,000 pages of evidence, Mr Mansfield accused four officers of lying to the inquiry, others of "offensive and racist" evidence, and four senior officers of colluding in the Metropolitan police's attempt to cover up its shortcomings in investigating the 1993 racist killing.Mr Mansfield's allegations of corruption were based, he said, on a "matrix of connections" between a number of criminal families - of which some of the suspects were members - and the "plainly illicit" activities of one identified detective sergeant.The sergeant, Mr Mansfield recalled, had been seen by undercover Customs officers on three occasions in the later 1980s with Clifford Norris, the now convicted drug smuggling father of David Norris, one of the five.Pointing to criminal connections with the family of two other suspects, Jamie and Neil Acourt, Mr Mansfield said the failure to arrest within the first 48 hours of the murder must have only one explanation."Someone had ulterior motives within that [police] inquiry," he said.That would explain, he said, why an informer with timely and accurate information about who had done the killing was treated like "dirt off the street", and why a surveillance operation on the Acourts' home was a "sham".Bags of what appeared to be clothes had been taken from the house, but the police had not intervened.Stephen, an 18-year-old A-level student, was killed by two stab wounds in Eltham, south London. The Acourts, Norris, Luke Knight and Gary Dobson were charged, but not convicted. Neil Acourt, Dobson and Knight were acquitted after the Lawrence family's private prosecution against them collapsed.Mr Mansfield said that racism lay at the heart of why Stephen was murdered and why his killers had never been brought to justice; a racism "insidious and not articulated, often not recognised and often denied".It was extraordinary, he said, that so many officers on the inquiry believed the murder was not racially motivated. The Lawrences were treated with indifference and contempt.His recommendations included that retired senior officers should not escape sanction for serious negligence.The inquiry continues today with a submission from the Metropolitan police commissioner.
