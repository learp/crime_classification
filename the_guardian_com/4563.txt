In a lifetime observing our justice system in operation, I have yet to see a less appropriate sentence than the 23-year jail term meted out to the 75-year-old so-called “cult leader” Aravindan Balakrishnan (Cult leader jailed as his child reveals new identity, 30 January). That the offence – years of false imprisonment of his own daughter and imprisonment and sexual assaults on two other female devotees – was serious cannot be disputed. But, as the daughter herself said of her father – who, significantly, she has forgiven – he was a “narcissist and a psychopath”, a description confirmed by the examining psychiatrist and mentioned by the judge, Deborah Taylor, who clearly used his lack of remorse, to which she referred, as justification for condign punishment rather than, as it manifestly was, evidence of his mental condition. The man obviously suffers a serious personality disorder and the case cried out for dispassionate treatment rather than the disproportionate prison term suitable to, say, a multiple killer or a terrorist. There ought to be an appeal, with hospital treatment substituted.Benedict Birnberg London• Over five decades of activism on the left I’ve come across Maoists from time to time. Hardly a numerous trend in Britain, they were for the most part good socialists, albeit one could hardly agree with their view of China. The case of convicted sex attacker Aravindan Balakrishnan is a reminder that unlike “official” British communism, in which Moscow showed some interest, Beijing had little concern for its supporters elsewhere in the world. Consequently they could, and sometimes did, claim all manner of views, and in the case of Balakrishnan much worse than that, to be somehow “Maoist”. A better guide was not what they said but what, if anything, they did.Keith FlettLondon• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
