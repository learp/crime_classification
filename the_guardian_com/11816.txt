The government's use of indeterminate sentences today suffered a further blow after the court of appeal ruled there had been a "general and systemic failure" in the sentencing of a sex offender.David Walker, who was convicted of a sexual offence in 2005, contested the controversial indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP), which was introduced two years ago.The sentence binds a prisoner's release to completion of rehabilitative courses to prove he or she is no longer a danger to society.However, Walker's lawyers argued that the conditions of his indeterminate sentence were unrealistic because the prison in which he was serving time did not offer any parole courses. Many prisons do not offer the proper courses, which means some prisoners are left to endure indefinite sentences beyond their tariff.The appeal ruling will be seen as a victory for prison advocacy groups, prison staff, inmates and judiciary members who have opposed IPPs.Only five out of 147 people serving IPPs had been released by the end of April 2007. Most had exceeded their tariffs, which ranged from one to 18 months.Today's ruling, if upheld on appeal, could leave ministers facing a multi-million pound bill as they are forced to plough cash into prison treatment programmes.The chairman of the Howard League for Penal Reform, Frances Cook, welcomed the verdict, saying: "The court of appeal has now recognised that it is unlawful to detain prisoners indefinitely while failing to provide these individuals with the measures that would enable their release."The decision came on the same day as the Prison Reform Trust (PRT) published a report predicting that as many as 12,000 people will be serving indeterminate sentences within the next four years. Currently, 3,000 people are serving them.Juliet Lyon, the organisation's director, said IPPs had "been wished on the prison service without extra resources, leaving prisons under vast pressure and thousands of men held in overcrowded jails beyond their tariff, with no means to show that they do not present a risk to the public".One prisoner told the PRT: "A lot of us with short tariffs are finding it difficult to get to a first stage lifer prison to do the courses being asked of us. It seems that the government have brought in these new sentences without thinking it through."The PRT called on the government to review the 2003 act that brought IPPs into effect and revisit the way in which "dangerousness" is defined - a component in determining whether someone should be given an indeterminate sentence.According to the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, IPPs were stretching an already overloaded prison system. In her annual report two years ago, she wrote: "The inability to progress these prisoners properly through the system is both a casualty of, and a contributor to, our overcrowded prisons."Last night, Ms Owers told the BBC's Newsnight programme that IPPs were a short-sighted policy response. "There was no plan about how the prison system, already overcrowded, already under stress, was going to deal with them," she said.On July 12, in his new role as secretary of state for justice, Jack Straw said he would review indeterminate sentencing. Opposition parties said the court's decision was further proof of the government's failure to tackle the prison crisis."The problem is not the principle of indeterminate sentences, which are designed to protect the public, but the government's culpable failure to provide sufficient prison capacity, which has left the Prison Service unable to provide basic rehabilitation and assessment," the shadow justice secretary, Nick Herbert, said."Meanwhile, thousands of prisoners, including several hundred jailed for violence, are being released early with no risk assessment, some to commit further violent crimes. Labour is all over the place on this issue."The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Jeremy Browne, said the situation showed "Labour's inability to properly manage our prison system"."It's now clear that, when the government introduced these indeterminate sentences, it was hoping to look tough without being clear how they would work in practice," Mr Browne added."Introducing a sentencing regime that you cannot implement is symptomatic of the government's mismanagement of prisons."
