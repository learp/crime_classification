A father and his four young children were found dead in a gas-filled car in north Wales today, in what police fear may have been a murder-suicide.The bodies were discovered in the car at Horseshoe Pass, Llangollen, a local beauty spot, at around 1.30am today. It is believed that the man took the children to Horseshoe pass from their home in Winsford, Cheshire, on an arranged access visit. He was estranged from the boys' mother, but had legal access to the children. North Wales police said that the boys, who have not yet been named, were aged three, five, six and seven.Bill Brereton, the deputy chief constable of North Wales police, described the incident as "horrendous beyond my imagination".He said: "At 12.20 this morning, Cheshire police received a 999 call from a woman in the Winsford area saying she had had a call from her husband, from whom she was separated, and he was threatening to harm himself and their four children. "Clearly, Cheshire police deployed officers, including air support, to trace the man and his children, and steps were also taken to trace the mobile phone. That trace led us to the North Wales area, and we deployed all available resources. "The vehicle was located by a dog handler near the top of the Horseshoe Pass in Llangollen. The vehicle was locked, so he had to smash the window and drag the children out. He did his very best to give them first aid, but sadly they were taken to hospital and declared dead on arrival. "We are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident but, together with Cheshire police, have launched an investigation to establish the precise circumstances. "Post-mortems will take place today to establish the cause of death, but we can say there was a petrol lawnmower in the back of the vehicle," he said.Cheshire constabulary said the boys' mother is "absolutely distraught". She was this morning being comforted by relatives.
