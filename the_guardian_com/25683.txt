A man has been jailed for racially abusing a US army veteran who was told to “get back to Africa” days after the Brexit vote.Robert Molloy, 20, was sentenced to 24 weeks in prison over the racist attack filmed by a fellow tram passenger in Manchester.Molloy was ordered to pay £400 costs and compensation of £50 to Juan Jasso, who has lived in England for 18 years, and two other people he targeted on 28 June last year.The sentencing of his co-defendant, Aaron Cauchi, 19, was delayed when an ambulance was called to Manchester magistrates court because Cauchi was complaining of severe stomach pains.The video of the incident caused outrage after it was posted online, at a time when police across the UK were warning of a rise in reported hate crime in the aftermath of the EU referendum on 23 June 2016.Sentencing Molloy, the chairman of the magistrates bench, Michael Evans, described the incident as an “alcohol-fuelled rampage around Manchester causing considerable fear to members of the public, including children”.He imposed a two-year criminal behaviour order, meaning that Molloy cannot travel on the Metrolink network or associate with his co-defendant.The magistrate told Molloy: “Hopefully when you are released from prison, a lesson will be learned and you will be able to make a positive contribution, and treat people with respect.”The court heard that Molloy, Cauchi and a 16-year-old, who cannot be named, had been up all night and were “looking for trouble”.Jasso said after the incident that the Brexit vote “maybe has pushed people to somehow justify that they think it’s OK now to act out in this way”.The trouble began at about 7.45am when a passenger heard “disgusting, vile abuse” on the tram, the court heard.One of the group was shouting: “I’m going to lick your mum’s pussy.” Jasso stepped forward and told them to mind their language, and all three turned on him. Molloy, the instigator, told Jasso: “Don’t chat shit when you’re not even from England, you little fucking immigrant. Get off the fucking tram now. Get back to Africa.”He then flicked beer over Jasso from the bottle he was holding before all three got off the tram.Minutes later, they surrounded Alistair Lambert, who was with a female work colleague, “with their chests stuck out and shoulders back”, and struck him with a cigarette lighter to intimidate him. Shortly afterwards, Andrew Guest was cycling to work and he passed the three. One or more spat in his face and down his body.One of the defence lawyers suggested during the hearing that the “divisive rhetoric” used during the EU referendum campaign had affected their behaviour.James McDermott, who represented Cauchi, said: “What is significant is the timing of the offence – it happened five days after the EU referendum. Clearly, several months leading up to the referendum, those in positions of great responsibility employed divisive rhetoric that has had an impact – there’s been a huge increase in the number of similar incidents.“That’s not offered as an excuse, but I would suggest the time and background is something your worships can bear in mind.” Molloy, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty on Monday to a racially aggravated assault on Jasso, common assault on Guest, and using threatening words and behaviour towards Lambert. The 16-year-old pleaded guilty to using threatening words or behaviour towards Jasso and Lambert, and common assault on Guest. He was given a six-month referral order and will have to pay a £100 fine and £5 compensation to each of the three victims.
