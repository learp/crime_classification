A teenager and her father are in a critical condition in hospital this morning after a shooting in north Belfast.The 18-year-old girl and her 47-year-old father were shot in Evelyn Gardens off the Cavehill Road at around 8.30am on Tuesday.The Police Service of Northern Ireland have appealed for witnesses.The PSNI said they want to hear from the occupants of a red car that was seen driving away from the area at the time of the shooting.The daughter is said to be in a critical but stable condition in the Royal Victoria hospital but the man, who was shot several times in the abdomen, is said to have sustained life-threatening injuries.North Belfast SDLP councillor Nicola Mallon described the shooting as a "heinous crime" and deeply worrying in an area in which a quarter of the deaths of the Troubles took place.
