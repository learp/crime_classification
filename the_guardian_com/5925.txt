A mother was being comforted yesterday after returning home to find her husband and five-year-old daughter dead.Police believe Martin Bennett, 41, who worked as a quantity surveyor, strangled or smothered his daughter Vicky before taking his own life at their home in Orpington, Kent. The woman, Jill Bennett, returned to the family house, which was covered with Christmas decorations, and found the bodies just after 6pm on Thursday. A murder inquiry has been started by child protection officers. It is believed that police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. Detectives are expected to investigate Mr Bennett's mental history. It is not believed that he had come to the attention of either police or social services before, and the couple were not believed to have been estranged. The Bennetts had lived in the suburban street for nine years. The family's neighbours in the street reacted with shock at the news. Neighbour Donald Farmer said: "They always seemed to be a very happy family. They were very polite and always said good morning." Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: "I was completely surprised because they were a lovely family, an ordinary, lovely couple." Post mortems were carried out yesterday at the Princess Royal University Hospital in Farnborough. A police spokesman said: "Both were pronounced dead at the scene. The next of kin have been informed and the circumstances of the deaths are being investigated. This is a terrible tragedy."
