A young boy saw a hooded gunman on a bicycle fire the shots that killed schoolboy Rhys Jones in a pub car park, Liverpool crown court heard today.The 11-year-old, who cannot be identified, was giving evidence in the trial of Sean Mercer, 18, who is accused of the murder of Rhys. The jury heard a taped interview with the young witness, who was sitting with his family outside the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth on August 22 last year, the night Rhys was killed. The witness recalled seeing someone "pointing a gun at something". He said: "I carried on talking and then I heard a big loud bang. Then there was a pause and then there were another two shots from the lad." The boy said he watched the gunman for about three to five seconds until he cycled away down an alleyway. The youngster was unable to see the gunman's face but said they were dressed in a black jacket and tracksuit bottoms with a black hood over their head. After the shooting, the boy went inside the pub while his father went to where Rhys was lying surrounded by other onlookers. The prosecution claims Mercer fired the three shots across the car park after targeting members of a rival gang who had strayed on to his turf. The second bullet, the jury has been told, struck 11-year-old Rhys in the neck. He died in his mother's arms a short time later.Mercer, who lives in the area, denies murdering Rhys. James Yates, 20, Gary Kays and Melvin Coy, both 25, two 17-year-olds and a 16-year-old deny assisting an offender.
