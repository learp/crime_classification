A retired British businessman today lost the first round of his high court battle against extradition to the United States on charges of price fixing.Ian Norris, the former chief executive of the manufacturing giant Morgan Crucible, is wanted by the US to stand trial on seven counts of conspiracy to defraud and two counts of perverting the course of justice.Mr Norris, who has prostate cancer, denies accusations that, between 1989 and 2000, he fixed prices of components used to power trains. The high court rejected his legal team's argument that the home secretary's decision to order his removal under the Extradition Act was "unlawful and irrational".The 2003 act allows designated countries to use fast-track procedures for extradition, including not having to produce prima facie evidence that a crime has been committed.Alun Jones QC, appearing for Mr Norris, argued at a recent hearing that the US should not be a designated country as the arrangement was not reciprocal - the treaty has not been approved by US politicians.This meant, he said, that the extradition arrangements between the two countries were "hopelessly lopsided in favour of the US authorities".Khawar Qureshi, appearing for the Home Office, argued that Mr Norris's bid to block extradition was "unsustainable" and should be dismissed.Mr Qureshi said: "Far from creating a lopsided arrangement, the US and UK authorities are in fact affording each other extradition assistance on a basis which is practically equivalent."Edmund Lawson QC, appearing for the US government, argued the extradition arrangements were not open to judicial review.They reflected the current respect and trust shown by the two countries for each other's judicial systems, Mr Lawson said.Business leaders and human rights lawyers have attacked the way the new extradition laws - largely justified by the government as being necessary to counter terrorism - have been used against British executives.Earlier this week three former NatWest bankers lost their high court bid to stop their extradition to the US on Enron-related fraud charges.David Bermingham, Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby are accused of defrauding Greenwich NatWest of $7.3m (Â£4.2m) by investing in one of Enron's off-shore operations.Mr Norris is expected to launch a second set of challenges to his extradition based on human rights grounds and the argument that returning him to the US would be "unjust and oppressive".His lawyers have also contended that the offences for which he was ordered to be extradited are not extraditable offences.Ultimately, Mr Norris's fate, and those of the NatWest trio, are likely to be decided on final appeals to the House of Lords, the UK's highest court.
