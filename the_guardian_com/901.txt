Police searching for the missing schoolgirl Amanda Dowler yesterday arrested a 52-year-man inside a prison in connection with the teenager's disappearance.Detectives were last night questioning the man, who had not been named, at a police station in Surrey. He was arrested just before 10am at an unnamed prison. A spokeswoman for Surrey police said: "A 52-year-old man from Ashford in Surrey was arrested in prison in connection with the missing schoolgirl Amanda Dowler. He has been taken to a police station for questioning." Amanda, also known as Milly, was last seen leaving Walton-on-Thames railway station on March 21 while walking home from school. A nationwide hunt and a Â£100,000 reward for information has so far failed to find any trace of the 13-year-old. Last night a police source said the man being held was not believed to have any connection with the Dowler family. The source said police did not know how significant the arrest was at this stage. It is the second arrest in connection with the missing teenager. Last month a 36-year old man arrested in Chertsey, four miles from the Dowler family home, was released without charge. The suspect, described by neighbours as an oddball, was released on bail after being questioned for more than 28 hours. Police have previously said it unlikely that Amanda was snatched from a street in daylight because, despite 4,000 calls from the public, not one has reported seeing a girl involved in a struggle. Detectives are still treating her disappearance as a missing persons inquiry, but experts trained to find hidden bodies in Bosnia have been brought in to help with search. They are advising police on the most likely burial sites and conducting night searches at specific locations using an infrared imaging device.
