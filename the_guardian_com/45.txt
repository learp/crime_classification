The family of a surgeon whose death is being investigated as a suspected murder have praised his "high moral values and exacting standards".Anthony Owen, 68, was found by two members of the public lying next to his white Honda Civic in the affluent village of Hale, in Cheshire, on 11 March.Police were called at about 10.20pm and Owen was taken to the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery with serious head injuries. He died in hospital six days later.Cheshire police said three teenagers, aged 14, 16 and 17, all from Widnes, were arrested on Tuesday and remained in custody.According to reports, Owen was a semi-retired cancer surgeon. In a tribute issued by police on behalf of his family, Owen was described as a man who demanded the best of himself and others.The tribute read: "The family are deeply shocked and devastated at the death of Anthony and the manner of his passing. We remember him as a man deeply committed to his family and his profession."He was one with high moral values and exacting standards who demanded the best of himself and of others around him. Anthony had many friends who he supported and helped and he will be sadly missed."There was speculation that Owen had caught car thieves trying to steal his vehicle, but police said this was not one of their lines of inquiry.Officers were alerted to the incident by a passing motorist who told detectives he saw three males on bikes shortly before he found Owen. Police said two of the males rode BMX bikes, with the third balanced on the back of one of the bikes.Detectives ruled out the possibility that Owen had been hit by a car and said they were still investigating what happened.
