The trial of two terrorist suspects, due to be held substantially in secret, has been delayed until October.Erol Incedal and Mounir Rarmoul-Bohadjar, both 26 and from London, were named for the first time last week. The court of appeal overturned a request to hold the entire case behind closed doors on the grounds of national security and conceal the name of the defendants. The case is expected to last between six and eight weeks. The men, said to be British nationals of Turkish and Algerian origin, will next appear in court on 10 July for further legal discussion. They are both in custody.The beginning of the trial will be heard in open court with a small number of "accredited journalists" allowed to hear part of the "secret" evidence under strict conditions.Incedal is charged with engaging in acts with the intention of committing or assisting in acts of terrorism, and collecting or recording information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. Rarmoul-Bohadjar faces a charge of collecting or recording information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism as well as a further of possession of an identity document that was improperly obtained. They deny the charges.
