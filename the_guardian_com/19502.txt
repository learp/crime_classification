A former bodyguard of the late US singer Michael Jackson has been fined for issuing fake court summons. Matt Fiddes, from Barnstaple in north Devon, admitted during a separate hearing at Exeter crown court last month to one charge of delivering a copy of a paper falsely purporting to be a county court summons.The offence arose at a time when the martial arts and fitness trainer was acting in divorce proceedings, the court was told on Friday.He was handed a £750 fine, and ordered to pay £1,200 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.Judge Francis Gilbert QC said: "You would have saved yourself a lot of the trouble if you had admitted what you did at the start."The court heard that doubts over the authenticity of the papers were raised because they were issued to another man without the customary court stamp."It was rather a stupid thing to have done," the judge said, adding that Fiddes had had "a significant business".The 33-year-old had worked as a minder for Jackon in the past and had been friends with members of the singer's family before a separate court dispute.The defendant is also a former celebrity trainer to Australian singer Peter Andre and British model Danielle Lloyd.
