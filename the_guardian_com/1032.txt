A police chief has said she regrets that the father of an Indian student killed on Boxing Day found out about the murder on Facebook.Anuj Bidve, 23, was shot in the head at point-blank range as he walked with friends near their hotel in the Ordsall district of Salford, in the early hours of 26 December. The murder is being treated by detectives from Greater Manchester police as a hate crime.Subhash Bidve, the victim's father, said he heard the news on Facebook and is now desperate to get his son's body home to Pune in India."Nobody official from the UK government or consulate or the Indian government called us and told us about this," he told BBC Radio 5 Live. "I am really surprised because they confiscated his phone and must have known his father's or mother's number. They could have called us and told us what had happened to him."Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley, who has overall command for the investigation, confirmed that the victim's father read a Facebook post before officers were able to deliver the news."That is not the way anyone should have to find out something so devastating and we completely understand how upset the family are," she said."Social networking is instantaneous and we have no control over when and what people post on such sites, but no one should hear such tragic news in this way."Police said a 16-year-old boy and two 17-year-old boys arrested over the murder had been released on bail pending further inquiries. Two men, aged 19 and 20, remain in custody.Police have offered a Â£50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the murder.Subhash Bidve called for the UK authorities to speed up the process of returning his son's body to India. "That is my only concern," he said. "We do not have a specific date or time frame when it can be done and do not understand it."He said that his family did not know the reasons for the killing but "in Pune and other places it is assumed that this could be racism or a hate crime".Police say they are working with the Indian high commission to help the family fly to the UK as soon as possible.Chief Superintendent Kevin Mulligan, of Greater Manchester police, said: "We have not established a clear motive for the senseless murder of Anuj, and there is no definitive evidence pointing to it being racially motivated."However, we are treating this as a hate crime based on the growing perceptions within the community it was motivated by hate."Mulligan said the murder weapon, believed to be a small handgun, has not been found and appealed for anyone with information about it to come forward."As I said from the start, the solution to this, and the way we can solve this murder, this awful murder, is for members of the community to come forward with information."They can do that anonymously, but the answer to this issue lies with the community," he said.Mulligan said no stone would be left unturned in trying to find those responsible for "this awful crime".Police are trawling through CCTV and making house-to-house inquiries.According to a Facebook page set up in Bidve's memory, he was killed "for not answering a simple question, 'What's the time?'" But Mulligan would not disclose what was said between Bidve and the killer."At the moment all we can say was there was a short conversation. There's no reason to suggest from that conversation that the crime is racially motivated," he said."What we are saying is we do not know whether it's racially motivated or not. But by definition we need to treat any incident of this kind where there is a perception that race is involved or hate is involved and categorise it as a hate incident."Bidve was in a group of nine male and female Indian students visiting Manchester for a short break over the Christmas holidays.The students, who had not been drinking, were walking through Ordsall from their hotel towards the city centre when they became aware of two men on the other side of the street.The gunman, a white male in his 20s who was wearing a grey top, walked across the road and engaged Bidve in a short conversation before producing the gun and shooting him at close range to the side of the head.The killer ran back across the street before the pair fled on foot towards Asgard Drive and the Ordsall housing estate.Bidve was studying for a micro-electronics postgraduate qualification at Lancaster University and was described by tutors as "an outstanding applicant at the very beginning of a promising career".Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said he would be asking for a full report into the circumstances of Bidve's death. He spoke to the family in India on Friday.Vaz said: "I welcome the action taken by the Greater Manchester police on the shocking and deeply sad murder of Anuj Bidve in Manchester on Boxing Day. I will be asking for a full report on the circumstances of his death."Overseas students need to be reassured that the UK has taken every possible step to ensure such a tragic event will not happen again. Most importantly, his family deserve to know the truth about the final moments of their much-loved son."Mr Vaz, who is Labour MP for Leicester East, was contacted by the Bidve family. His spokeswoman said: "They just contacted him as they had some concerns. As the longest serving MP of Indian origin, he is well recognised in India."
