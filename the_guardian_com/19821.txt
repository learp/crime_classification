A smart young blonde woman has been spearheading an audacious identity fraud operation which has already tricked banks in East Anglia out of more than £100,000.The woman targets accounts containing large sums by using bank details which may have been gleaned by rummaging through bins or trawling the internet. She then fakes her identity and withdraws thousands in cash. Police issued a photograph of the woman yesterday, but believe the gang may also be employing other "attractive" females to front the operation as a ruse to charm bank staff. Detectives are examining fake passports belonging to two other women who could be part of the same gang. The blonde woman in the picture released is said to be aged between 25 and 30 and "comes across very well and dresses smartly", according to Detective Constable John Gibbens of Suffolk Police. "She has a lot of confidence and is making appointments to withdraw large sums before returning, say, the following day to collect the cash." Two of the woman's fake passports were taken from her after bank staff became suspicious. The gang is responsible for the theft of £40,000 in Suffolk as well as thefts in Cambridgeshire, Essex and Norfolk, dating back to 2003.
