Detectives investigating the murder of Marsha McDonnell yesterday issued an e-fit of a man spotted at the scene of an earlier attack which is being linked to the killing of the 19-year-old gap-year student.The likeness was drawn up after police were contacted by a new witness who saw the suspect leaning over a 17-year-old girl in Walpole Gardens, Strawberry Hill, south-west London, at 9pm on January 8 as she lay in the snow clutching her head. The man walked away towards Spencer Road. He was described as white, of chunky build, about 5ft 9in tall and in his late 40s with dark collar-length hair. He was wearing a dark thigh-length Barbour-style jacket. The 17-year-old was walking home alone from shops listening to her Walkman when she was beaten over the head. Her parents thought she had slipped in the snow, until Ms McDonnell's murder made them contact police. Tests confirmed she had been attacked. Ms McDonnell was battered over the head in Percy Road, Hampton, just yards from her home, early on February 4. She had been out with friends in Kingston upon Thames. An 18-year-old man was set upon in Hampton, on February 25. He had caught the bus home from a nightclub in Kingston. He escaped unharmed. A "hammer-like" blunt instrument is thought to have been used in all three attacks. Witnesses were asked to contact the incident room at Hendon on 0208 358 0100 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
