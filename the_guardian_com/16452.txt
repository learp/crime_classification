Two police officers who were blamed by a judge for the collapse of a Â£5m gangland murder trial have been removed from detective duties, it emerged yesterday.Detective Chief Inspector Kenny Caldwell and Detective Inspector Darren Shenton from Greater Manchester police were criticised by Mr Justice Penry-Davey at Preston crown court for failing to pass on information about another murder suspect after the brutal killing of David Barnshaw in Stockport. Barnshaw, a 32-year-old drug dealer, was with a friend, John Berry, when they were kidnapped, beaten and Barnshaw forced to drink petrol before he was set alight in September 1999. Berry called the police on a mobile phone while locked in the boot of the kidnappers' car and police operators heard Barnshaw's horrific torture. Berry escaped and was rescued by a passing motorist. Barnshaw was burnt beyond recognition and his identity had to be confirmed through dental records and DNA. The police then failed to disclose critical evidence about another possible suspect to the prosecution and defence teams at the murder trial, which was halted on Monday after almost eight months. The judge described the behaviour of Det Insp Shenton as "at least grossly negligent" and said he had hindered the murder inquiry. He said Det Ch Insp Caldwell had removed documents from a file that suggested another suspect for the murder. By the time the judge ordered it to be produced to the court, eight pages were missing. Arran Coghlan, 31, from Alderley Edge, Cheshire, and five other men walked free after the trial collapsed. A spokesman for Greater Manchester police confirmed that the two officers are not currently involved in criminal investigation work. After the case's collapse the force said: "We are aware of the judge's decision to refer certain aspects of this case to the director of public prosecution with reference to the alleged actions of a GMP officer. We will assist the DPP in any way that is required."
