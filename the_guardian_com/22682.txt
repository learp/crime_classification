The "robustly independent voice" of prison inspectors is endangered by Downing Street plans to create a merged inspection team covering the whole criminal justice system, the chief inspector of prisons has warned.Anne Owers has told the Guardian she is "troubled" by the merger expected to be announced by Tony Blair next month. She fears that the scale of inspections of individual prisons could be reduced. There is concern that the merger plan will reduce inspectors to measuring whether government performance targets are met. Ms Owers said that genuinely independent inspection "lifts the lid on closed institutions on behalf of the public, pulls out common practices, and exposes them to the light of what is normal, and what is right." A consultation paper to be published next month is expected to put forward a Downing Street plan for a single merged criminal justice inspectorate. "There is talk of a wider merger into a single criminal justice inspectorate, capable of looking across the whole criminal justice system, identifying gaps, encouraging joint working and effective process, promoting the overall aims of crime reduction and community safety. This is more troubling," said Ms Owers. "It is difficult to see how a human rights inspectorate can be other than peripheral to a body whose main aims are the effectiveness of the criminal justice process and the reduction of crime."She said that it was a "critical human rights safeguard" that the prison inspectors had the ability and resources to go into any prison at any time without warning, and that they remained sharply focused on inspecting individual places of custody.
