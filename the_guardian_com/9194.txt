Your article (27 July) suggesting “elite universities” are not taking sexual assault victims seriously does not at all reflect the attitude and efforts of Russell Group universities.Our institutions take the issue of any kind of harassment, abuse or violence against students extremely seriously indeed. They have robust policies and procedures in place to deal with these matters, which are a key part of their responsibility to ensure safety and wellbeing.Russell Group universities invest heavily in pastoral services so students have access to the support they need. Our institutions also work with a range of agencies and professional bodies so a network of services is in place for all students.Dr Wendy PiattDirector general and chief executive, The Russell Group of Universities
