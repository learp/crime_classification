A district judge ruled todaythat a teenager had a "reasonable excuse" for refusing to carry out a community order while wearing a high-visibility jacket.Kane Beales, 19, of Caister, Norfolk, had been accused of breaching the requirement by saying that he would not wear clothes with the words "Community Payback" emblazoned across.Great Yarmouth magistrates court heard that Beales, who was given a suspended sentence with an unpaid work requirement for possessing a knuckleduster and a flick knife and an offence of drinking excess alcohol in September last year, was not required to wear the jacket.District judge Philip Browning said: "The requirement to wear the marked vest was introduced and imposed some three months after the defendant signed his agreement, which did not include such a requirement, which in itself was an important and significant change."There is no evidence that the defendant was informed of the new requirement before he attended for work."After the case, Beales's lawyer, Annette Hall, described the ruling as a "victory" but said it was unclear whether Beales would have to wear the jacket when he completed the rest of his unpaid work requirement.
