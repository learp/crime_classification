The new head of the fight against serious and organised crime is a career civil servant with no experience in policing.Sir Ian Andrews was today confirmed as the man to lead the UK fight against organised crime, a multibillion-pound industry that police say pervades every corner of society.Andrews is currently the second permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence, where he has spent much of his career.His appointment is likely to disappoint senior police investigators who work with the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), many of whom would have wanted someone with a closer knowledge of policing and the problems faced on the frontline when tackling organised crime.It comes as the Home Office is about to announce the results of a wide ranging review by the prime minister's strategy unit into serious and organised crime, after years in which police have complained that it has not been given the same focus as counter-terrorism.There are more than 4,000 organised crime groups in the UK, ranging from teenage street gangs to high-level drug trafficking groups that launder millions of pounds of profits. It is the job of Soca to co-ordinate the fight against these gangs, support police forces and run operations to target the criminals.Andrews replaces Sir Stephen Lander, a former head of MI5, who retires this week. There were four candidates for the post. The announcement was delayed when Alan Johnson was appointed home secretary.The Home office report into organised crime, likely to be published on Monday, is the result of a wide-ranging consultation with senior police experts. It began after years in which police officers complained the fight against organised crime was under-resourced and given insufficient priority, despite the creation of Soca.The intervention of the prime minister's strategy unit was seen as a measure of Gordon Brown's concern about the pervasive nature of organised crime and the growing numbers of gangs spreading from the inner cities to the shires, eroding the fabric of almost all of Britain's communities.The review comes after an inspectorate of constabulary report, written six months ago, identified thousands more organised criminal gangs active in the UK â€“ many more than previously acknowledged. Circulated to ministers and senior police officers, it warned the threat would increase and said an effective response must be made.
