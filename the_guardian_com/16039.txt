A career criminal shot and injured by Tony Martin during a raid on the farmer's house may not be able to proceed with his claim for damages since he has been photographed cycling and climbing with little apparent difficulty.Brendon Fearon, who was shot in the leg and groin while trying to burgle Mr Martin's house in Emneth Hungate, Norfolk, was pictured in yesterday's Sun newspaper riding a bike and walking around without a stick. This is despite his insistence that the injuries have stopped him from working, affected his sex life and ruined his hobby of martial arts. Supporters of the farmer expressed fury when it first emerged that Mr Fearon, who is seeking Â£100,000 in compensation, had been given the right to sue and had received legal aid for the fight, while Mr Martin was expected to fund his defence himself. Supporters of Mr Martin, 58, say the images, taken over the past week, prove the 33-year-old is "a con man". Mr Martin was freed from jail last month after serving two-thirds of a five-year sentence for the manslaughter of Mr Fearon's accomplice, Fred Barras, 16, whom he shot dead during the raid on his farmhouse in August 1999. The farmer said last night: "We have a government and a system that allows this - he just wants what the system will allow him to do." One of Mr Fearon's brothers, who asked not to be named, yesterday, repeated a claim made last month that the civil case against the farmer was going to be dropped anyway. Referring to his brother, he said: "I know for a fact that he's dropping it. He's just waiting for his solicitor to come back off holiday." Mr Fearon's solicitor, John Wakefield, has dismissed as "incorrect" claims that his client might drop the case. The legal services commission, which administrates funds for legal actions, confirmed that Mr Fearon's claim for legal aid could be in jeopardy if he were found to have misled the body.
