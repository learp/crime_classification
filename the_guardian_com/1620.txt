Ethical clothing shops – lock up your berets and cashmere sweaters. Waitrose be warned – keep a close eye on the "Brie le grand rustique", shitaki mushrooms and organic coffee beans.Middle class people hit by the recession are behind a surge in shoplifting, it has been claimed. Shoplifting in Britain shot up in by a fifth to £4.88bn in the 12 months to June, as more people turn to theft "to sustain their standard of living".Fashion clothing stores saw one of the highest increases in theft – up 9%, followed by speciality food and convenience stores – up 8.4% and DIY outlets – up 4%. The survey found that an average shoplifter takes goods worth £80.31, with expensive branded goods at the top of their "shopping" lists.The data was compiled from 42,000 shops in 36 countries by the Centre for Retail Research in Nottingham for Checkpoint Systems, a retail security company. Neil Matthews, of Checkpoint Systems, said a common theme reported by companies' loss prevention departments was an increase in amateur or opportunist thieves over drug addicts or career criminals."They are catching shoplifters who from their appearance you would not expect to steal, and whose demeanour when caught show them to be different to your typical shoplifter," Matthews said. "These amateurs also tend to be caught by fairly basic security equipment, whereas career criminals would be able to avoid that."Matthews said items taken include "high end cheeses and meats" – which he attributes to people stealing to maintain a quality of life they can no longer afford. "We are seeing more instances than before of amateur thieves stealing goods for their own personal use rather than to sell on."Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said retailers were concerned shoplifting was not taken seriously enough by police."In terms of value and number of incidents it is the biggest crime area – bigger than domestic burglary or car crime," he said. "But it tends to be seen as a low level thing which is very concerning to retailers, who feel the police and courts don't pay it enough attention. They see it as low-level crime which should be dealt with by retailers."Britain registered the most shoplifting in Europe by value – although it does have the continent's biggest retail sales – trailing only the United States and Japan across the globe.
