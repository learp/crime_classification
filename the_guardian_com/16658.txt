There is much to agree with in David Ramsbotham's comments on private-sector prisons (Comment, April 17). New providers have brought about innovations in prison design, improved rehabilitation and raised levels of decency in how inmates are treated. In the public sector prison estate practices have had to change to reflect the improvements the private sector has brought about.But staff numbers in private-sector prisons are in fact broadly comparable with the public sector. Where they are lower this is because new designs require guards to undertake fewer basic "turnkey" tasks. Pay is competitive with local market rates and staff are trained to the same level as those in the public sector.Prison and probation services should be delivered by whoever is best suited to do so. Huge increases in criminal justice spending have not yet reduced reoffending rates. New partnerships with the private and voluntary sectors might.Dr Neil Bentley Director, public services, CBI
