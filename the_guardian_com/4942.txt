At least 70 people have absconded from an open prison in West Sussex this year, nearly half of whom are yet to be caught, the Home Office admitted.Three murderers are among those who have fled Ford open prison since January, according to information released in response to a parliamentary question.Other inmates had committed offences ranging from burglary, driving while disqualified, possession of a false passport and supplying drugs.The figures show 70 inmates absconded between January and October this year and 28 have yet to be caught. In March alone, 13 inmates went missing while 15 walked out in May and 11 in September.The shadow home affairs minister, Nick Herbert, whose question prompted the official admission, described the situation at Ford prison, which is in his constituency, as a "total disgrace"."Not only have 70 prisoners absconded from Ford this year already, but over a third of them have not been recaptured and many should never have been in an open prison, having committed the most serious offences, including murder," he said."While John Reid chases the next headline, the public are being put at risk by a policy of unsuitable prisoner transfers which the government has admitted will increase the risk of escapes."It is the second time in six months that the prison has been embroiled in controversy. In May, it emerged that 11 foreign national offenders had simply walked out.The home secretary ordered another 141 foreign inmates to be moved to different locations over fears more could abscond.But earlier this month it was reported that Ford was again being used to house foreign offenders amid an overcrowding crisis in the prisons system.A spokeswoman for the Home Office said it was never possible to "guarantee" that inmates would not abscond from an open prison.She also stressed that all the prisoners would have been assessed for any potential risk to the public before being allocated to a low-security jail."Some of these people have been in prison a long time," she said. "You either release them straight from a closed prison or you give them a chance to get re-established by using an open prison." At the weekend, Mr Reid confirmed that he had secured backing from the Treasury to create 8,000 new prison places after the service reached the brink of its capacity.But the new places will not materialise for several years and so far the Home Office has been frustrated in efforts to find shorter-term solutions.
