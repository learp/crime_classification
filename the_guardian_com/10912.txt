A former neighbour of Jill Dando today told a court she saw Barry George acting suspiciously outside the TV presenter's house hours before she was shot dead.Susan Mayes, a City trader, said she was sure the man was George even though she only saw his face for five seconds.He was standing by a maroon car, which was double-parked in Gowan Avenue, Fulham, west London, on April 26 1999.As she approached, the man put his head down and started to clean the windscreen, Mayes told the Old Bailey.She said she made a point of "clocking" his face because two days earlier she had seen a man acting suspiciously near her home. Mayes picked George out of a video identification parade 18 months later.She said: "I was certain that was the person I had seen."Mayes rejected a suggestion from the defence that she may have mistaken the man with George, whom she might have seen walking around in Fulham."I am satisfied he was the person I saw that morning," she said. "I do not believe I have ever seen him in the neighbourhood. The reason I clocked him was that two days before, I had seen someone acting suspiciously outside our house."Mayes said she was going to work at 7am when she saw George parked outside number 28 and looking across at the odd-numbered houses.She said: "As I walked nearer to him, he started cleaning his windscreen in a strange way. He was looking towards the ground as I drew alongside him."I thought at the time: this man definitely does not want to be seen."George, 48, of Fulham, denies murdering BBC presenter Dando, 37, who was shot through the head on her doorstep at 29 Gowan Avenue at 11.30am.The prosecution alleges George had obsessions with celebrities and guns. The jury has heard from a series of women who claim to have been approached by George.The court was told how George claimed to be the cousin of Freddie Mercury - the lead singer of Queen - and to have served in the SAS.The trial continues.
