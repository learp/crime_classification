The target of a major manhunt which locked down part of Edinburgh city centre for several hours was a suspected motorbike thief hiding out on a roof, police have said. Fire crews joined officers in the city’s Old Town from 10pm as crowds gathered around a cordon and rumours of a shooting circulated on social media. Police Scotland has since denied there were any firearms involved. The force also confirmed a man had been detained and was helping with the inquiry, while the cordon had also been lifted, but the hunt was continuing. A spokesman said: “It was never a firearms incident. “Police in Edinburgh were in attendance on the Royal Mile on Saturday evening in connection with an earlier incident of a stolen motorbike and the man was reported to be on the roof of a building in the Cockburn Street area. “A cordon was put in place so there was no risk to the public and no armed police were involved. Inquiries are ongoing to locate the man.” Police added: “A man has been detained and he is helping police with inquiries.” According to reports, more than 50 officers in riot gear were deployed to Cockburn Street, with a police helicopter circling overhead.
