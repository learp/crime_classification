David Davis claimed a "stunning victory" in his campaign to defend civil liberties after he was re-elected to parliament this morning with a higher turnout than predicted.The former shadow home secretary was returned to parliament in a byelection in the Yorkshire constituency of Haltemprice and Howden triggered a month ago by his resignation in protest at the government's plan to detain terror suspects without charge for up to 42 days.The turnout was 34.5%, not as low as some expected, but still lower than the 58% who turned out to vote in the Crewe and Nantwich byelection in May.With many voters choosing to stay at home, unmoved by an election Davis hoped would arouse passions about civil liberties, it is still unclear how easy the former shadow home secretary will find it to rebuild his career.Davis won 17,113 votes and now holds the seat with a majority of 15,355. The English Democrats and the Green party were next, each having won about 1,700 votes. Davis's tally was lower than the 22,792 he won in the 2005 general election when the turnout was 70.2% but Labour and the Lib Dems were standing at that election.Some 23 candidates lost their £500 deposits after failing to poll 5% of the vote. Only Davis, the Greens' Shan Oakes and the English Democrats' Joanne Robinson kept their deposits. The announcement was delayed after Robinson, finishing 44 votes behind the Green candidate, forced a recount.In his victory speech David Davis thanked the other 25 candidates for fighting a "courteous and entertaining campaign" and described his victory as a "shot across the bows" for Gordon Brown. Davis said he now had a "clear mandate" to continue in bid to defend Britain's civil liberties.But earlier in the evening Tory sources had indicated that Davis could not expect an early return to frontline politics. David Cameron, who was intially furious with him for triggering the byelection, is understood to be in no rush to offer him another shadow cabinet post. It is also understood that a possible offer of chairing a commission on civil liberties is unlikely to materalise.Speaking to the Guardian before the results were announced, Davis appeared to recognise this saying he was cheerful about a future on the backbenches, saying that he had always realised that his startling resignation carried no career -prospects. He was keen to speak more widely, on Afghanistan, Europe and other issues, he said.In his resignation speech outside parliament just less than a month ago, Davis said the issue of 42 days was, "perhaps the most salient example – of the insidious, surreptitious and relentless erosion of fundamental British freedoms".Alongside 42 days, Davis wanted to use the occasion of a byelection to draw attention to the proliferation of CCTV cameras, plans for a national identity card scheme and a DNA database.This morning Davis and the 25 other candidates, a record slate, heard the results from the floor of the Haltemprice leisure centre - the usual stage setting for election night results abandoned after organisers feared it wouldn't cope with 26 candidates. Miss Great Britain suffered the rare fate of being upstaged in fashion terms by the Monster Raving Loonies, who deployed their full arsenal of bananas and outsize top hats.Absent from the contest were the main opposition parties. While Davis initially received support from Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg - who declined to field a candidate in support of the former shadow home secretary's position - Gordon Brown dismissed the byelection as a "stunt".Last night home office minister Tony McNulty repeated that claim. He said: "This by-election was a vain stunt that became and remains a farce". "What has emerged from this episode is that the Tories are not only opposed to 42 days but are now also questioning the use of CCTV and DNA evidence - vital tools for the police in the fight against crime in our communities." More than half of the candidates were independents and the first of whom - Herbert Crossman - arrived at the count last night with a ball and chain clasped to his leg and sign around his neck denouncing the cost of the byelection. "For £100,000 they could have employed three gutter cleaners in this area who could have helped stop the flooding," he said.Like the election, the count was dominated by the whacky fringe candidates, who scrutinised the outsize ballot papers hopefully for rare signs of a cross.While David Davis made only occasional fleeting visits into the main sports hall of Haltemprice leisure centre in Hull's affluent western suburbs, the myriad independents treated the occasion like an all-night cocktail party.Haltemprice and Howden byelection results in fullDavid Davis (C) 17,113 (72.06%, +24.60%)Shan Oakes (Green) 1,758 (7.40%)Joanne Robinson (Eng Dem) 1,714 (7.22%)Tess Culnane (NF) 544 (2.29%)Gemma Garrett (Miss GB Party) 521 (2.19%)Jill Saward (Ind) 492 (2.07%)Mad Cow-Girl (Loony) 412 (1.73%)Walter Sweeney (Ind) 238 (1.00%)David Craig (Ind) 135 (0.57%)David Pinder (New Party) 135 (0.57%)David Icke (ND) 110 (0.46%)Hamish Howitt (Freedom) 91 (0.38%)Christopher Talbot (SEP) 84 (0.35%)Grace Astley (Ind) 77 (0.32%)George Hargreaves (Ch P) 76 (0.32%)David Bishop (Elvis) 44 (0.19%)John Upex (Ind) 38 (0.16%)Greg Wood (Ind) 32 (0.13%)Eamonn Fitzpatrick (Ind) 31 (0.13%)Ronnie Carroll (History) 29 (0.12%)Thomas Darwood (Ind) 25 (0.11%)Christopher Foren (Ind) 23 (0.10%)Herbert Crossman (Ind) 11 (0.05%)Tony Farnon (Ind) 8 (0.03%)Norman Scarth (Ind) 8 (0.03%)C maj 15,355 (64.66%)Electorate 70,266; Turnout 23,749 (33.80%, -36.35%)
