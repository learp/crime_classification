Burglars have targeted the home of landslide victim Rosemary Snell and stolen her antique silver collection, police revealed on Monday.Snell, 67, and Michael Rolfe, 72, were killed this month when their car was flattened in a tunnel by hundreds of tonnes of mud and rubble.The pair lay dead for 10 days until rescue crews uncovered their car at the entrance to the Beaminster Tunnel in Dorset.Police used mobile phone and credit card records to track their movements after the couple had been reported missing.But just days after the discovery of their bodies, thieves targeted Snell's home in the village of Misterton, near Crewkerne, Somerset.Police, who had forced entry to the property themselves when looking for Snell, are now searching for the stolen property.They fear the items could be sold at car boot sales and antique fairs.Avon and Somerset police said burglars struck on the night of 20 July.Det Ch Insp Pete Warren said: "This is a despicable crime that has been committed by someone who may have deliberately targeted the property following the national media coverage."The offenders forced entry at the rear of the property and took specific items that are of antique value."I would urge anyone who may know anything about this incident to contact us."I would also ask members of the public to remain vigilant and report any sale of antique silver items to us."He added: "We have increased patrols in the area but would also ask the community to report anyone acting suspiciously to us."
