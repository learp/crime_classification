The son of Pink Floyd guitarist and singer David Gilmour has admitted going on the rampage at a student fees protest.Charlie Gilmour was warned he could face a prison term after pleading guilty to violent disorder. He was granted bail until July to give him time to complete Cambridge University exams.Gilmour was accused of a string of offences during the riot on 9 December. He entered a non-specific guilty plea as he appeared at Kingston crown court, south-west London.The 21-year-old, from Billingshurst, West Sussex, has yet to specify whether he admits leaping on the bonnet of a car carrying royal protection officers escorting the Prince of Wales and his wife to the Royal Variety Performance.Judge Nicholas Price QC granted Gilmour conditional bail as he adjourned proceedings until 8 July.He said he would give Gilmour's legal team time to decide the specifics of the plea before arranging another hearing.Gilmour, a former model, wore a grey suit and dark tie as he spoke to confirm his name and enter a guilty plea.Price told Gilmour: "You have accepted counts of a serious matter and it may well be the course of one of immediate custody."This matter will come back to this court on 8 July."Gilmour is accused of smashing a window at a high street store and throwing a rubbish bin at the royal convoy. The bin missed the royal couple but hit another car, it is alleged. Gilmour had been accused of stealing a mannequin leg but that charge was withdrawn.He was among thousands of people who protested in Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square on 9 December and was photographed hanging from a union flag on the Cenotaph during the march.He issued an apology the day after the demonstrations, describing it as a "moment of idiocy", and added that he did not realise the Whitehall monument commemorated Britain's war dead.Gilmour's biological father is poet and playwright Heathcote Williams but he was adopted by the rock star when his mother, writer and journalist Polly Samson, remarried.Releasing a statement in the wake of the cenotaph incident, Gilmour said: "I feel nothing but shame. My intention was not to attack or defile the cenotaph. Running along with a crowd of people who had just been violently repelled by the police, I got caught up in the spirit of the moment."David Gilmour's former bandmate Roger Waters lost his father in the second world war and has written about his loss extensively throughout his career, including in a number of Pink Floyd songs.Gilmour has been on the books of the modelling agency Select Model Management and has also tried his hand as a journalist but is now completing a history degree at Girton College, Cambridge.His father is admired as one of the world's finest guitarists. The Pink Floyd album Dark Side Of The Moon is one of the biggest-selling releases of all time.In an interview last year Gilmour talked about being bought two Savile Row suits before he headed off to university.A Cambridge University spokesman has said the matter is "for the civil authorities".
