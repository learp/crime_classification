Men accused of attacking and stalking their ex-partners will face restraining orders banning them from approaching their victims even if they are cleared in court, under a crackdown to be announced this week.The move marks a victory for women's groups, which have long argued that too many women are put at risk by violent ex-partners threatening them even after they escape an abusive relationship. Two women a week are killed in Britain by partners or ex-partners.There will also be new safeguards for victims of assault or sex crimes to prevent suspects coming near them again.But the move will trigger a major backlash from the growing men's rights movement, with campaigners arguing that, in the aftermath of failed relationships, women will make false accusa tions of violence in the hope of keeping ex-partners away from the marital home and any children.Under the reforms to be outlined in a domestic violence Bill this week, judges will get discretionary powers to impose restraining orders on a suspect - even if he has been acquitted of harassment - if they have reason to think the alleged victim would be at risk.They would need evidence to do so, but could accept testimony not admissible in court, for example from neighbours or a family doctor. Men who breach the orders - setting out that they cannot go within a set distance of their victim's home or workplace - risk instant arrest.'Just because somebody has not been convicted of harassment, does not mean that a victim does not need protecting,' said a Home Office source.Restraining orders - now only available where men are con victed of harassment - will also be extended to other offences, which could include assault and sexual assault.However Jim Parton of Families Need Fathers said his members thought the balance was tipping too far in women's favour.'I don't see the point of having a trial if at the end you are found innocent and still treated as guilty,' he said. 'There is bound to be a little bit of mud that sticks.'I think this is overkill. There are plenty of civil remedies if somebody is domestically violent or supposedly violent.'Research, however, has increasingly identified stalking as a warning sign that a woman is at greater risk of a serious attempt on her life.The Metropolitan Police, which has reviewed cases where women were murdered by partners or former partners in an attempt to identify early warning signs that could be used to avert future tragedies, found that common factors included having recently become pregnant, and being stalked by an ex.The Bill, which was promised in the Queen's Speech last week, is expected to be published this week - before the Christmas period, which charities say is the worst time of year for reports of domestic violence because the stresses of the festive season put many families under severe strain.
