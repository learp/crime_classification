Police investigating the death of a woman whose severed head and hands were found on a beach have discovered a suitcase containing further body parts in a harbour. Tayside police said they believed they belonged to Jolanta Bledaite, 35, a Lithuanian woman whose partial remains were found on Arbroath beach by two sisters aged eight and 11 last Tuesday. Police said the contents of the case, which was found by a police diver, will now be subject to a full forensic examination. Two Lithuanian men aged 19 and 40 were arrested on Friday in connection with the discovery of the remains. However, no charges have been made, said police. Bledaite was a migrant worker who had been staying in Brechin, Angus. Her father, Sarunas Bleda, said his daughter had always wanted a better life. 'We were poor people as we grew up and she nurtured these dreams to better herself. She worked in a couple of factories over here and once in an office before she moved to Ireland and then on to Scotland. I hope she is at peace and I sincerely hope they get the people who did this.'
