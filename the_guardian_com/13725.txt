The estranged wife of the paralysed former motorbike stuntrider Eddie Kidd has been jailed for five months after she admitted assaulting him.Samantha Kidd, 44, pleaded guilty to four counts of assault by beating days before she was due to face a two-day trial last month.Brighton magistrates court heard on Thursday that Mrs Kidd tried to throttle her husband, slapped him on the face and chest, kicked him and called him a "fucking spastic".Suzanne Soros, prosecuting, said that on one occasion Mr Kidd, who was paralysed and brain-damaged when a stunt went wrong in August 1996, was left shaking and "absolutely hysterical" as a result of his wife's actions.The defendant, of Seaford, East Sussex, showed no emotion as the district judge William Ashworth sentenced her to five months in prison, concurrent on each count, and imposed a restraining order.Opening the prosecution case, Soros said: "The Crown says this was a course of conduct against a man who is suffering with severe disability."In one incident, Mrs Kidd rained a series of blows on Mr Kidd after she was woken up, according to a witness. She told him: "For fuck's sake, Eddie. How do you expect me to sleep?"Soros said Mrs Kidd continued with "a barrage of abuse and swearing" before landing half a dozen blows to her husband's face and head. The witness said in a statement that Mrs Kidd appeared to have "lost the plot" and had to be forced off him.Soros said Mr Kidd appeared to be shaken up by the incident. "He was completely unable to defend himself from the attack from Sam or take any action to protect his face or head."On another occasion, Soros said, Mrs Kidd kicked her husband in retaliation after a carer had difficulty helping him out of a car and into a wheelchair.In a separate incident, the court heard, Mrs Kidd slapped his face in "retaliation and frustration" at his hand coming off a rail and coming into contact with her. Soros said: "In hindsight, she accepts that her view of that had been distorted by her stress and alcohol consumption at the time."Alissa Scott-Beckett, defending, said Mrs Kidd had no intention of rekindling a domestic relationship with the former stuntrider but would like them to be friends in the future, and Mr Kidd had sent her text messages asking to meet, which she had resisted.Scott-Beckett said Mr Kidd had suffered a "serious deterioration" in his physical state, leading Mrs Kidd to binge drink.She added: "Mrs Kidd has suffered from considerable mental anguish. She apologises profusely to any mental stress this has caused him."
