Detectives hunting the armed gang responsible for Britain's biggest ever cash robbery tonight confirmed they had arrested two people.A man aged 29 and a 31-year-old woman were arrested in the Forest Hill area of London by Kent police in connection with the raid on a Securitas cash depot in Tonbridge.The two were taken to undisclosed police stations in the Kent area, and are being questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery.Tonight Kent detectives have issued an appeal to trace the movements of what is believed to be a red former Parcelforce van.The vehicle, found abandoned at a pub, may have been used during the abduction of Securitas depot manager Colin Dixon, 51, his wife Lynn, 45, and eight-year-old son Craig. Earlier, it was announced that a reward of up to £2m was being offered for information about the raid, in which the "armed and dangerous" gang made off with up to £50m.The raid was carried out by professional robbers operating at the "top level" of organised crime, a senior police officer said today.Adrian Leppard, the county's assistant chief constable, described it as a "terrifying raid" which left the eight-year-old son of the depot's manager "absolutely traumatised" after he was taken hostage with his mother.Securitas and its insurers today announced the reward for information leading to the recovery of the money."This is organised crime at its top level. This was planned and executed with military precision," Mr Leppard told a press conference today.He urged criminal associates of the armed gang to turn informant, saying: "A lot of people will know what is going on."If you are one of those people and want to earn the reward, then please get in touch. It's a unique reward. I hope that is going to trigger a lot of interest from people."He told a press conference that a white lorry used by the armed gang to carry the huge haul of cash was still missing.Detectives are also trying to track the depot manager's silver Nissan Almera - registration number WP52 KPV - which has not been seen since he was pulled over by bogus police officers on the A249 near Stockbury and kidnapped on Tuesday evening.Mr Leppard added that the car used to transport the manager's wife and son from their home in Herne Bay to the unknown farmhouse in West Kent where he was held at gunpoint had not been found."Someone may have noticed a vehicle being driven around with a woman and a young boy in it," he said.Officers also confirmed they were investigating the possibility that the raid had been an inside job. "It's an obvious line of the inquiry," Mr Leppard said.Earlier, police today issued alerts to all UK ports and airports in an attempt to prevent the gang leaving the country."I'd like to stress that these men were armed, dangerous, and violently threatening towards the manager, his wife and their son, and towards staff at the security depot," Detective Superintendent Paul Gladstone said."They held the manager in fear of his life and that of his wife and son for more than six hours, and threatened to kill him and his family before raiding the depot. We can be thankful that everyone was found unharmed."The Bank of England confirmed that at least £25m of its money had been stolen from the security depot in the early hours of yesterday morning.Securitas is expected to confirm the exact amount once police forensic work is complete and experts can enter the depot to make a full assessment.Analysts believe the gang must have had inside information on where the money was and the easiest way to get in and out."These people knew where the money was, and how much there was," Jeffrey Robinson, an expert on money laundering cases, told the BBC's Breakfast programme. "They planned how to get in and how to get out again."Mr Robinson said the robbers would have trouble disposing of the money, adding that he thought there was a good chance they would be betrayed by an informant.Kent police are encouraging witnesses to contact a hotline on 01622 652361 or 652366.
