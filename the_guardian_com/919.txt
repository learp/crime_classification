One of the men who killed the British soldier Lee Rigby is suing for compensation two years after his teeth were knocked out during an incident at Belmarsh prison.Michael Adebolajo was convicted last year alongside Michael Adebowale of murdering Rigby, 25, who was run over and hacked to death near Woolwich barracks in south-east London in May 2013.While he was being held at the high-security prison following the killing, Adebolajo had his two front teeth knocked out and claimed he had been assaulted by five prison officers.The officers were suspended from work after the incident but were later told they had no case to answer, with the Prison Officers Association insisting that only approved restraint techniques had been used.The Ministry of Justice said it would robustly defend the compensation claim, which could be as much as £20,000, according to reports.“A police investigation into this incident took place and no charges were brought against members of staff,” an MoJ spokesman said. “The public will be rightly outraged at the thought of this man receiving compensation from the taxpayer and we robustly defend claims made against the Prison Service.”The MoJ said it had successfully defended two-thirds of prisoner claims over the past three years.Adebolajo appeared on camera with bloodied hands clutching a knife and a meat cleaver moments after killing Rigby. He was given a whole-life prison term for the soldier’s murder, while Adebowale was sentenced to life with a minimum of 45 years.At their sentencing, the pair lashed out violently in the dock, screaming “Allahu Akbar” and wrestling with security guards.
