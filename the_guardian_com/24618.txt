Police hunting for the missing architect Joanna Yeates released new CCTV footage today showing her buying a pizza in a Tesco Express on the night she was last seen.The footage shows Yeates, 25, buying a Tesco Finest tomato, mozzarella and basil pesto pizza at about 8.40pm on 17 December in Clifton Village, Bristol.She is seen using a self-service till in the supermarket, wearing a cream-coloured coat with a rucksack on her back.Detectives want to discover what happened to the pizza, because there was no trace of it, the wrapping or the box in the flat that Yeates shared with her boyfriend, Greg Reardon, 27.A police spokesman said: "The video has been released by detectives hoping people in the area at the time will remember seeing Joanna and contact the police."Yeates has not been seen or heard from since an evening out with work colleagues in Bristol on Friday last week.Her boyfriend reported her missing on Sunday night after returning to their flat in Canynge Road, Clifton, from a weekend in Sheffield visiting family.Yesterday her parents made an emotional appeal for her return.Detectives say the possibility that Yeates was abducted is one of several lines of inquiry.At a press conference outside the flat where Yeates lived, Chief Superintendent Jon Stratford said Avon and Somerset police were keeping an open mind and testing out many different hypotheses."Nothing is being ruled in, nothing is being ruled out," he said. "We continue to search the area and we have a lot of patrols in the area, speaking to people, providing reassurance and also trying to identify if there are any witnesses we have not spoken to."The forensic recovery has come to a conclusion inside the house and detectives continue to do a CCTV trawl of the area."Stratford said he was unaware of anything to connect Yeates's disappearance with the murder of Melanie Hall in Bath in 1996. Hall, a 25-year-old university graduate, disappeared after a night out in Bath. Her remains were found beside the M5 motorway in October last year, but her killer has never been caught.Stratford said he was not aware of any contact between the teams investigating the two cases.However, Detective Chief Inspector Gareth Bevan, who yesterday appealed for information about the Tesco pizza, is part of the Melanie Hall investigation team and has spoken publicly about that inquiry.He confirmed that police hunting for Joanna Yeates had spoken to officers leading the inquiry into the disappearance of the chef Claudia Lawrence in York. "I think our investigation team have been contacted by that team but again at the current time there is absolutely nothing to suggest a link between the two disappearances," he said."This is still a missing person investigation and we continue to hope that there is some kind of explanation behind this and we will find her safe and well and return her back to her family."Stratford said there had been a "fantastic response" from the public"We continue to ask anyone who was in the Clifton area on Friday night and even over the weekend, if anyone saw anything that they thought might be suspicious or heard anything suspicious or has got any information which could assist us in finding Joanna, then please do come forward," he said."All we want desperately is to find Joanna safe and well, so if she can hear this, please do get in touch with us and tell us where she is and we will take very good care of her."Thirty detectives are working full time on the investigation, assisted by another 40 staff, including forensic experts and search teams."It is still a missing person's inquiry. I do want to stress that, but obviously it is very, very unusual for somebody just to go missing from their address in Clifton, which is why we do have grave concerns for Joanna, which is why we are putting the level of resource we are into this," Stratford said. "We are determined to get to the bottom of this and find out what's happened to Joanna."Police are asking anyone who has seen Yeates or knows of her whereabouts to contact the Operation Braid incident room on 0845 456 7000 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
