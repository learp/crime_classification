A former racing cyclist has died after an alleged assault in the street near his home. Ray Eden, 42, was taken to Doncaster royal infirmary a week ago but died three days later. He won the national time-trial championship in 1995 and the same year represented Great Britain four times in stage racing. He worked for a cycle company in Rotherham after retiring from racing and was a keen oarsman. Luke Jolly, 24, who lived near Eden in Scawthorpe, was charged with causing grievous bodily harm before the death and appears at Doncaster crown court on Tuesday.
