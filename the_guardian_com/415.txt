The former England midfielder Paul Gascoigne was today given a suspended prison sentence for driving while more than four times the legal alcohol limit.Looking frail and gaunt, the 43-year-old ex-footballer was told by magistrates in Newcastle upon Tyne that the eight-week sentence would be suspended for a year.He was also banned from driving for three years and handed an alcohol treatment order.Gascoigne, now better known for his battle with drink, had been due to be sentenced last month, but failed to appear because he had checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in southern England.He had previously admitted drink-driving after being found to have 142 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath. The limit is 35 micrograms.Gascoigne – who played for Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio, Rangers, Middlesbrough and Everton – was caught driving an MG car erratically by police in Jesmond, Newcastle, at 2.45pm on 8 October.The court was told that he was undergoing a 12-week anti-drink programme in Dorset, where he has seven weeks and five days more to complete. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings in the evenings, and is back at the rehabilitation centre by 9.30pm.Gascoigne appeared anxious at the start of the 15-minute hearing, but relaxed as it was explained that the district judge was not minded to jail him immediately.Judge Stephen Earl said he believed a 12-week sentence, with one-third off as credit for a guilty plea, was appropriate."I am sure some will disagree with me," the judge said, warning Gascoigne that, if he reoffended in the next 12 months, the suspended eight-week jail term would be triggered. The former footballer was ordered to pay £85 costs.Gascoigne, waering a pinstripe suit, white shirt and no tie, smiled when the judge, referring hypothetically to him attempting to drive while banned, said: "He's not a man who can easily pass off without notice, I suspect."In a final comment, the judge told Gascoigne: "I hope not to see you again". Gascoigne thanked him as he left court.Outside, the former international's solicitor, Stephen Andrews, said his client was relieved and that it was a "good result".A separate drink-drive charge, which Gascoigne denies, will be heard at Northallerton magistrates court, in North Yorkshire, next week.
