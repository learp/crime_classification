I praised the Daily Mirror, and its reporter, last week for its sterling work in trapping the serial murderer Levi Bellfield into making a key admission about the murder of Milly Dowler.Though most of the comments were supportive of the work by the Mirror and David Collins, there was one critical remark about the paper striking lucky.This unfair remark was countered by other commenters, so I had no need to wade in with a reply. But I now discover an aspect to the case I had not realised - the Press Complaints Commission had previously cleared the Mirror of breaching the editors' code of practice.When Collins's original story, Hammer killer Levi Bellfield in new link to Milly Dowler murder, was published in April 2009, his mother made a formal complaint to the PCC on behalf of her son.Jean Bellfield told the commission that the story was inaccurate and had been obtained by misrepresentation. It had also intruded into her family's privacy and identified relatives of a convicted criminal.She claimed Collins had obtained an interview with her son – who was already serving life in Wakefield prison for two murders – through subterfuge.She said the reporter had offered to help in her son's appeal and was "only acting in Bellfield's best interests" to help counter false media allegations about him. On that basis, the reporter was then allowed to speak to her son by phone to ask a number of questions which, she said, had not been agreed in advance. The result was the article in which Collins reported that Bellfield had admitted to driving a red car linked to the 2002 murder of Milly. It was a great breakthrough.Mrs Bellfield complained that the article included information taken out of context that put her family at risk, while a follow-up story the next day intruded into their privacy and identified them unnecessarily.The Mirror said the subterfuge was necessary in order to obtain the interview with Bellfield, who had not spoken publicly since his arrest. During their conversation Bellfield made a confession that was a matter of great significance and public interest, which justified the method used by the paper.In refusing to uphold the complaints, the PCC reiterated that the code made clear that it was acceptable for journalists to use misrepresentation if there was a public interest and the material could not be obtained by other means. The commission considered that the facts revealed by Collins were significant and new, and that the subterfuge he employed was therefore "fully justified by his objective of discovering further information about the death of Milly Dowler."As for the brief references to Mrs Bellfield and her other son, these did not contain any private information in breach of the code.Sources: Daily Mirror/PCC
