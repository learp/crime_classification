The government has ordered an immediate review of how sex offenders are managed in Northern Ireland after one of the most closely monitored former convicts in the province was jailed for life for abducting and murdering a pensioner while on parole.Trevor Hamilton, 23, became the first person in Northern Ireland to be told that he would spend the rest of his life behind bars when he was sentenced at Dungannon crown court yesterday.The farm labourer bludgeoned retired librarian Attracta Harron, 65, to death as she was walking home from church in December 2003. The body of Mrs Harron, a mother of five, was found four months later and was so badly decomposed that police could not confirm that she had been sexually assaulted.Hamilton, who showed no remorse during the seven-week trial, was described as "callous and brutal" by the judge Mr Justice McLaughlin. "What you did to Mrs Harron, a good and loving woman, was at once nauseating and horrifying," he said. "It was the stuff of nightmares and the epitome of the loss of innocence in our community."The jury heard that Hamilton, who lived in Co Tyrone, had a history of violent sex offences. At 16 he was caught exposing himself to women drivers and in February 2000 he was found guilty of imprisoning and raping a woman in a caravan after offering her a lift home. Within four months of being released on parole he attacked Mrs Harron. Mrs Harron's family had already demanded a public inquiry into why Hamilton was able to strike again after his rape conviction. They believe that if English legislation had applied in Northern Ireland, he would never have been released in the first place.
