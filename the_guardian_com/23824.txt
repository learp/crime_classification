Four women connected to a school named in an alleged Islamist plot to "take over" schools in Birmingham were arrested at around 7am on Thursday in connection with an ongoing fraud investigation at a Birmingham school, West Midlands police said."It's alleged the women were involved in a bogus resignation letters plot at Adderley primary school in Saltley," the force said in a statement.Adderley primary was mentioned in detail in the original dossier outlining the supposed "Trojan Horse" conspiracy, a document purporting to be a how-to guide for hardline Islamists wanting to undertake jihad by overthrowing headteachers at state schools in Birmingham. But detectives insist the investigation is not linked to Birmingham city council's inquiry into the existence – or otherwise – of Trojan Horse.The Trojan Horse document claimed that four teaching assistants – three Muslim women of Pakistani origin and one white, non-Muslim woman – had conspired to get Adderley's headteacher sacked in a curious disagreement over whether or not all four had handed in their resignations at the end of 2012. But it also makes a number of factual errors and has been dismissed by one of the alleged plotters, Birmingham school governor Tahir Alam, as a hoax and a "malicious fabrication".It is understood that one of the four arrested is Hilary Owens, who is among the teaching assistants referred to in the Trojan Horse document.The anonymous authors refer to the head of Adderley school, Rizvana Darr, as "not a good Muslim" and "not open to our suggestions of adhering to strict Muslim guidelines". Darr was highly praised in the school's last Ofsted report, which graded Adderley good overall, with outstanding leadership and management.The teaching assistants are suing Adderley for unfair dismissal, claiming they were ousted after someone faked resignation letters carrying their signatures. They say they told Adderley they had no intention of quitting and their signatures were forged after they raised grievances about their treatment at the school with the local authority.An employment tribunal for the four was to begin in March but was postponed by a judge after West Midlands police decided to look again at allegations made by them.In January 2013 they told police they had been forced out of the school in December 2012 as a result of the "fake" letters. It is understood that three of the teaching assistants involved are Rehena Khanom, Shahnaz Bibi, Yasmin Akhtar.The alleged plotters in the Trojan Horse letter note that Darr is "procedurally strong and so we had to find a reason for her to be sacked linked to procedures".The document says: "Three of our Muslim sisters … along with an English woman who is their close friend, have raised an allegation of fraudulent resignation letters against the head (even though they did actually write the letters themselves)".The Trojan Horse document is being taken seriously by the education secretary, Michael Gove, who this week controversially appointed Peter Clarke, former head of Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism branch, to lead an inquiry. Birmingham council is running its own parallel investigation.In a statement sent to the Guardian last month, the Adderley school governors said: "The 'Operation Trojan Horse' plot is not unique to Adderley Primary School."It is imperative that all efforts are made to identify how many other schools have been targeted. It is important those involved are not allowed to divert attention from the seriousness of this issue by making false allegations to take the spotlight off themselves and their actions."It is evident that some individuals are now concocting stories to incriminate others to ensure their actions remain hidden."
