A British property developer who lived a millionaire's lifestyle in Palm Beach and once entertained the Clintons was jailed for life today for murdering a tenant who stood in the way of a deal he hoped would save his ailing business.Thanos Papalexis was described as a "devil" by the sister of Charalambos Christodoulides, 55, who was tied to a chair, tortured and strangled in March 2000 at a warehouse in Kilburn, north-west London, where he was the resident caretaker.Papalexis, born in London to a Greek shipping magnate, was part of the Palm Beach social scene at the time of his arrest last year.At his Florida home, formerly the residence of fashion designer Gianni Versace, he held a fundraising gala for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, which she attended with her husband.But in 2000 problems with his US business interests had left him strapped for cash and desperate to force through a deal for the warehouse where Christodoulides, described as "harmless" by the judge and known as Bambi to his family for his gentle nature, had lived for most of his adult life.Papalexis was convicted of murder on 4 September. Sentencing him to serve a minimum jail term of 20 years, Judge Jeremy Roberts said: "You are a totally amoral person in the sense that you do not think twice in doing or saying anything which helps you achieve your own ends. This was an execution carried out for financial gain. You treated Charalambos as completely expendable."Papalexis wanted to buy the derelict site, which housed the warehouse, owned by Christodoulides's brother-in-law Michael Lanitis, for £2m and then sell it on in a "back-to-back" deal to a third party, before paying Lantis, to raise cash.Although Christodoulides's family said he would move out when required Papalexis believed that Christodoulides stood in the way of a quick deal that would save him from financial ruin. He was worried the deal would collapse and needed money for another development.The court was told he was in a "perilous" financial state after his inexperience led to heavy losses on another development in Holloway, north London.He was paying £60,000 a week on a bridging loan and was eager to rid himself of anything which stood in the way of the financial lifeline."You found yourself with a serious problem," said Roberts. "You decided to take a life of a harmless and innocent human being."The body of Christodoulides was found in a car inspection pit in the warehouse two weeks after he was killed.The property deal fell through and the Holloway development was put into receivership with £8m debts.Papalexis was arrested in Palm Beach, Florida, in November after police spent years building a case against him.His ex-lover Rebecca DeFalco, a sex worker, was a key witness. She said Papalexis confessed the killing to her in 2004, telling her that, with two other people, he had strangled a man "giving me problems".Roberts said Papalexis was "the person giving the orders and primarily responsible for what happened". Two alleged henchmen face a retrial.In a statement read in court, Christodoulides's sister Anna, 60, said: "I truly believe he is like a devil for what he has done."Regardless of the length of sentence given to Papalexis it will never justify how a multimillionaire playboy can put the value of money over and above the life of my innocent, harmless brother."No amount of years will allow me to accept the senseless act resulting in the murder of my much-loved brother."Charles was a quiet man, going about his own simple life, harming nobody. Nobody deserves to die in such truly dreadful circumstances."Papalexis's property dealings in the US ran into problems when he was unable to raise funds. He launched a private members' club offering the rich exclusive access to yachts, a private aircraft and a luxury mansion. But the facilities failed to materialise as advertised and he was served with lawsuits.Detective Inspector Brent Hyatt said outside court: "Papalexis has proved to be an enormously arrogant, compulsive and practised liar driven by his desire to make money."
