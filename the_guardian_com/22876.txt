Detectives have released CCTV images of what they believe is a recent sighting of a man wanted in connection with the rape and murder of his ex-girlfriend.The pictures show Michael Cope, who has been on the run for almost three months, buying food at a convenience store on Atherton Road in Hindley, Wigan, at 1.25pm on Sunday 14 July, where he also withdrew money.Cope is wanted for the murder of Linzi Ashton, a mother-of-two who was found dead at her home in Winton, east of Manchester, on the evening of Saturday 29 June.Cope, 28, had a brief, turbulent relationship with Ashton, 25, a barmaid at the Duke of York pub in Eccles, police said. They have made several attempts to arrest Cope since the end of April, when Ashton reported a complaint of rape against him.Previously released CCTV footage showed Cope buying snacks, alcohol and soft drinks at a shop on Liverpool Road, Eccles, at about 10.45pm on the day before Ashton's body was found. Police believe he visited her shortly after this sighting.Her two daughters, aged two and seven, were not at home at the time of death. A Home Office postmortem concluded that she died of pressure to the neck and multiple injuries.Police have urged the people of Hindley and Wigan to remain vigilant and contact them if they have seen the man pictured.Detective Chief Superintendent Darren Shenton said: "We believe Cope is familiar with the canal pathways between Salford and Leigh and may have spent time near the canal and waterways in Hindley."He may have been sleeping rough and we would urge people to report any suspicious behaviour around outbuildings, sheds or gardens, as well as disused railway lines and open land.Police warn people not to approach Cope, who is dangerous and may be armed."We understand these developments may alarm people in Wigan, but I would like to reassure them that we have a dedicated team of detectives, and specialist search officers, whose sole objective is to find Cope safely," said Shenton."Patrols by local officers are being stepped up, and members of the public can raise any concerns with them."Greater Manchester police have teamed up with independent charity Crimestoppers to offer a Â£25,000 reward for anyone who can help trace Cope.Two men arrested on the evening of Tuesday 2 July on suspicion of helping Cope have been charged. A third man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender has been bailed until 15 August pending further enquiries.David Sargeson, 27, of Sarah Street, Eccles has been charged with perverting the course of justice. Craig Blackburn, 26, of Ivy Street, Eccles has been charged with assisting an offender.
