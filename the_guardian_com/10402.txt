Police today began a "fingertip search" of a garden in south London after claims that the bodies of people allegedly murdered by a jailed paedophile had been buried there more than 30 years ago.The search came amid allegations that the terraced house in Walton Green, Croydon, had been the centre of a child abuse ring for decades.Leslie Ford-Thrussell, who moved into the home in 1985, was jailed for 12 years in 2004 over 37 abuses.The Sun newspaper today claimed 72-year-old Ford-Thrussell had operated a paedophile ring at the house with its former owner Stephen Dedman, who died in 1985, and a third man who could not be named.A police spokesman said that, if necessary, officers would excavate the garden."Forensic searches are continuing," the spokesman said. "A fingertip search of the rear garden is taking place. They're doing a phased forensic examination of the site. They will dig if they need to."Police yesterday said they were still not certain whether an offence had been committed, but added that "a significant search like this is not undertaken lightly".The Sun reported that police were first tipped off about claims of bodies buried at the house when Dedman's son Paul wrote a letter to its owners, who moved out three months ago.The anonymous letter was sent a year ago, but police said they had not been able to act on it immediately because of the difficulty in tracking down the writer.Paul's daughter Stacey was quoted in the newspaper as saying she had been abused by Ford-Thrussell when she was a child. "I really believe there are bodies in the garden. When I heard police were digging for remains, I wasn't shocked," she said.
