A group of cross-Channel shoppers today won a landmark court case over the tactics used by customs officers trying to stop illicit alcohol and cigarettes entering the country.A High Court ruling against HM customs and excise now means that passengers and their vehicles cannot be stopped and searched unless customs officers have "reasonable grounds" for suspecting an offence has been committed.But a spokesman for customs and excise said it was not a "green light" for booze cruisers to northern France and Belgium to bring back as much alcohol or tobacco as they wanted.The case was brought by the cross-Channel ferry operator Hoverspeed and a group of shoppers stopped and searched on their return to the UK from a day trip to France and Belgium.Customs officers decided that cigarettes and hand rolling tobacco owned by one of the shoppers, George Wilkinson, had not been purchased for his own use. They seized the goods and a car used by the shoppers belonging to Lynne Andrews, the sister of a member of the party.Lord Justice Brooke said customs and excise had failed to prove to the court that it had reasonable grounds for stopping the car and questioning the occupants. He also said it had suggested in evidence to the court that customs officers might stop passengers for "legally inadmissible" reasons.The judge ordered the return of the goods - or equivalent compensation - and Ms Andrews' car and ruled that individuals must be free to travel across the EU without being subjected to excise duty checks unless there were grounds for reasonable suspicion.A spokesman for Hoverspeed said outside the court that customs officers would now only be able to stop people if they had a "legitimate suspicion that passengers have committed a crime".Travellers within the EU are at present allowed to carry unlimited amounts of duty-paid alcohol or tobacco as long as they can prove it is for their personal use rather than commercial purposes.John Healey, economic secretary to the Treasury, claimed the ruling had "backed the fundamentals" of the UK's approach to tackling excise smuggling."The court has confirmed that it is not legal to bring back alcohol and tobacco other than for your own use without payment of UK duties," he said."Those who bring back large quantities of alcohol and tobacco must accept an evidential burden to provide a satisfactory explanation, the absence of which may well cause customs to conclude that they are not for own use but held for a commercial purpose."The court gave customs and excise leave to appeal.
