A girl aged 14 who killed her 16-year-old sister with a carving knife after a row about clothes and boyfriends was today sentenced to three and a half years' detention.After a week-long trial, the jury of three men and nine women took just over five hours to find the girl not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter by way of provocation.The defendant had admitted killing her sister at their home in the Ovenden area of Halifax, West Yorkshire, on the evening of March 26 after an argument escalated into a physical fight.Sentencing the girl, Mr Justice McKinnon, said she had done a "terrible thing taking up that carving knife and using it to deadly effect". He said: "You stabbed your sister with a large carving knife in the living room of your home."The knife entered the deceased's body at the back just to the side of the left shoulder blade at a depth of 12cm, puncturing the lung and causing severe internal bleeding."As a result of remarks you made at the time about the deceased's boyfriend, the deceased attacked you, grabbing your hair and pulling it hard."You went into the kitchen, grabbed the nearest knife and returned to the living room with it and used it to stab your sister."Earlier, Bradford crown court heard how the girls started arguing after the defendant borrowed her sister's white top without asking. The argument soon became physical after the girls swapped insults about their boyfriends. The defendant told her sister her boyfriend "wouldn't amount to much" by working at a supermarket.The older girl then flew at the 14-year-old, grabbing her hair and kicking her in the head.The mother, who is divorced from the girls' father, managed to separate her daughters.But the defendant ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife before returning to the living room. She told the court she had been "proper upset and angry".The court heard the mother told her to put the knife down before looking on horrified as "blood sprayed up the wall". When the defendant dropped the knife, her sister picked it up and stabbed her in the back of the thigh.At first the defendant and her mother did not realise how badly injured the victim was. Both girls were taken by ambulance to Calderdale Royal hospital, where the older girl died in the early hours of the morning.The defendant had told the court: "I'm sorry and I love her and I want her back."Outside court, Detective Superintendent Andy Brennan of West Yorkshire police read a statement on behalf of the mother and family. "We will all miss my daughter's enormous big smile and the laughter that we shared."We got her GCSE results this summer and she had got really good grades, all As and Bs, and we are very proud of her. "Although my heart is broken for the loss of my beautiful daughter, I feel my youngest daughter should be at home with her family."We feel she will live with this for the rest of her life and I think that is punishment enough as that is like a life sentence in itself."The detective said the case had been "difficult and tragic" but had been dealt with using "the utmost sensitivity"."The consequences of what has happened must send a clear message out to anybody who is considering carrying a knife or using a knife in any way, shape or form," he said.
