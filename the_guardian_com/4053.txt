Melissa Reid, a Briton jailed in Peru for cocaine smuggling, is set to return to the UK “very soon” after Peruvian authorities agreed to expel her from the country, according to the British embassy in Peru.The 22-year-old, who was jailed in 2013, has been seeking to serve the remainder of her six-year sentence closer to home in Scotland.Reid, from Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire, and Michaella McCollum, from Dungannon, Co Tyrone, were imprisoned in 2013 for six years and eight months after admitting trying to smuggle cocaine worth £1.5m from Peru to Spain.A spokeswoman for the British embassy in Lima said Reid had been “granted expulsion back to the UK”, and would be returning very soon, but refused to comment further.McCollum, 23, was freed last month under new legislation on early prison release introduced in Peru last year, after serving two years and three months.However, it is expected that she will have to remain in Peru for a considerable period as part of her parole conditions.The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) said it had received no word of Reid’s expulsion, adding the service would only be notified if she was set to serve the remainder of her sentence in Scotland.A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “We continue to provide consular assistance.”  Michaella McCollum, left and Melissa Reid being questioned by police in Lima in 2013.

Melissa has spent her own 20th and 21st birthdays in prison in Peru.“She missed the significant event of her only brother’s wedding. Events such as Christmas are non-existent for us. There’ll be no celebrations in our house, there will be no Christmas tree until we get her back home.”Reid spoke out in a video warning of the consequences of drug offences abroad.
