It does look to be a violent attack," Detective Chief Inspector Keith Dillon said. "We are treating this as a murder inquiry, but have a completely open mind at this moment in time - it is very early on."Until we have more information, I would just like to make a general appeal for anyone with information to come forward. This is a nice, quiet residential area and I realise that it will have been a shock for those living here to realise what has happened."Officers said there was no sign of a forced entry at the detached two-storey home, and nothing appeared to have been stolen. Extra patrols will be carried out in the Bury area in an attempt to reassure residents.
