Police watchdog investigators are carrying out house-to-house inquiries in the Bristol street where a disabled Iranian refugee was murdered by a vigilante who wrongly believe him to be a paedophile.The Independent Police Complaints Commission's investigators will ask residents about Bijan Ebrahimi's contact with Avon and Somerset police officers in the days, weeks and hours before his murder in July 2013. They also want to speak to anyone who has information relating to Ebrahimi's contact with police over the years.The IPCC team has already dropped letters in the Brislington area of the city explaining what they are doing. Ebrahimi, 44, had complained to police after suffering antisocial behaviour but was killed shortly after he himself was arrested following completely unfounded complaints that he had a sexual interest in children. After the murder, his body was set on fire.The events of July were not the first time he had been the subject of apparent hate crime. He was forced to move out of a previous home after it was set on fire.In a statement the IPCC said: "This renewed witness appeal is to assist the investigation in understanding how Avon and Somerset officers dealt with Mr Ebrahimi in the days leading up to his death â€“ in particular in arresting him for alleged breach of the peace on 11 July 2013."Concerns have been expressed about how Mr Ebrahimi was treated by officers on 11 July and in the runup to his murder on 14 July."Three police constables have already been interviewed under criminal caution for the potential offence of misconduct in a public office by the IPCC. These three are the two police constables who attended Capgrave Crescent, where Ebrahimi lived, on the evening of 11 July, and another constable who was made aware of issues regarding Ebrahimi the following day.A sergeant and a constable who dealt with Ebrahimi in custody on 12 July face gross misconduct charges, as do a control room supervisor, a dispatcher and four call handlers who dealt with phone calls from Ebrahimi.The IPCC said it was taking into account force and national policies on antisocial behaviour, hate crime, and dealing with vulnerable people.The IPCC's commissioner, Jan Williams, said: "Today's renewed witness appeal reinforces our quest to investigate thoroughly and leave no stone unturned. I have assured Mr Ebrahimi's family that we are carrying out a thorough and robust independent inquiry into police contact and that we are doing so as swiftly as we can."Lee James, 24, who admitted murdering Ebrahimi, was jailed for life in November and told he would serve at least 18 years in prison for what the sentencing judge, Mr Justice Simon, called an "act of murderous injustice".
