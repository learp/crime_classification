A murder investigation has been launched after a teenage boy was shot dead when two balaclava-clad gunmen opened fire on a group of four friends in east London.The 16-year-old victim, named locally as Samuel Adelagun, was killed in the early hours of this morning on Chesterton Road, Plaistow, after being shot in the upper left chest. A second boy, 15, was shot in the abdomen and is in a stable condition in hospital. No arrests have yet been made.A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the friends, aged 15 and 16, were attacked from behind by the gunmen at around 3.20am. About four shots were fired. The group ran away during the attack before meeting back on Chesterton Road, where they called the police.Wendy Barrett, 42, who lives in Chesterton Road, said: "I'm absolutely devastated, I can't imagine what his mother must be feeling this morning. I have two children of my own and it makes you think you don't want them to go out." Her husband Dean, 40, added: "This is not the best area to live in. There is nothing for children to do, they go around in gangs."The killing is being investigated by Operation Trident, which is dedicated to tackling gun crime within the black community. Metropolitan Police said 16 teenagers have been killed in London this year. Five of them were shot.
