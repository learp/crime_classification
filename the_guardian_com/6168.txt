Professor Rod Morgan, chairman of the Youth Justice Board, has criticised the "naming and shaming" of youngsters subjected to antisocial behaviour orders as "not the sort of thing that would be tolerated in most countries".As part of Tony Blair's "respect" agenda, government guidance encourages police and local councils to distribute names and photographs of youngsters given antisocial behaviour orders.Professor Al Aynsley-Green, England's children's commissioner, also condemned such guidance as a breach of the UN International Convention on the Rights of the Child.
