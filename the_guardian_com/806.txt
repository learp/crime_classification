An unemployed squatter who "destroyed" an 85-year-old woman's life by wrecking the home where she had lived for more than half a century was sentenced to four months in prison yesterday.Horseferry Road magistrates court in London heard that Milly Martinson, a retired British Legion secretary, had left her house in west London to look after her sick sister and returned two weeks later to find it had been invaded.She got back to her four-storey home in Bayswater to discover the locks changed and a fake legal notice on the door informing her that the new occupants were claiming squatters' rights.The court was told that ceilings had been pulled down, windows and frames taken out and Miss Martinson's prized possessions - including a grand piano and a lifetime's collection of rare books - had been piled into one room. The cost of the damage to the £1.5m property was put at £100,000."The whole place looked like a bomb had hit us during the war," Miss Martinson told police."I was horrified. All my life and worldly goods were in there and someone was inside. If I can best describe how this affected me, I would just have to say it nearly killed me."Matteo Barbarini, 27, had pleaded guilty to dishonestly abstracting electricity at the house and being found on the premises for unlawful purposes. Antonio Pompili, 29, and Emmnanuel Lamy, 24, admitted the same charge and were remanded on bail until Monday for sentence.
