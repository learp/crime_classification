Even before programmes such as Crimewatch UK, reconstructions were a useful way of triggering the memories of potential witnesses and of attracting publicity.Yesterday's exercise was somewhat different. Police think they already know most of the people who were in the park. They asked them back there to pinpoint their movements and crystallise their observations. Police analysts, working in a building near Scotland Yard, will now be constructing a virtual model of Victoria Park as it was at the time of Ms Muller's murder. Every witness who has come forward will be represented by a 3-D mannequin. The mannequins will walk, run, cycle or drive through the virtual park as the people they represent did on that day. Everything that a witness says he or she saw on the morning of the murder will be shown on the computer screen. Once all their movements and observations have been represented virtually, it should be relatively easy for analysts to spot any discrepancies between accounts. So if the killer is among those who have come forward, the reconstruction may highlight holes in his story. If the killer has not come forward, the reconstruction may show up his movements. Such technology has been available to the police since the 1990s but it is more often used once as part of a prosecution case rather than as a tool in an ongoing investigation. For example, the police commissioned a virtual reconstruction based upon the testimony of farmer Tony Martin, who shot dead a burglar at his Norfolk farmhouse, to test if he could have been where he claimed he was when he opened fire. A virtual reconstruction of the Dunblane tragedy was also produced for the public inquiry. If yesterday's exercise proves successful it will be used in investigations in Britain and across the world.
