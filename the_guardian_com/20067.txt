The parents of a skydiver who plunged to his death after his parachute was sabotaged today spoke of their grief.Paul and Mary Hilder said: "We are going through every parent's worst nightmare."They were speaking at a press conference at Hereford racecourse, organised one week after their son Stephen plunged 4,000 metres (13,000ft) to his death. In a fresh appeal for help in catching their son's killer, Mr and Mrs Hilder said they believed someone in Britain's close-knit skydiving community knew who had sabotaged his parachute. The 20-year-old army cadet, an experienced skydiver, was taking part in a national skydiving competition at Hibaldstow airfield, near Brigg, North Lincolnshire.Detectives have revealed that the cord on Mr Hilder's main parachute had been deliberately severed, as had the strapping on his reserve chute. A murder inquiry has been launched. They have taken detailed statements from fellow skydivers, friends of Mr Hilder and local residents, but admit they have been unable to establish a clear motive for the crime. Detective Superintendent Colin Andrews also appealed to the public for information into what he described as a "vile act"."The investigation into the death of Stephen is ongoing and I am appealing for your help," he said."Somebody knows who committed this vile act and I ask that you contact me in total confidence."DNA swabs have been taken from the 70 competitors, staff and spectators who were involved in the five-day student competition. Anyone with information on the death of Stephen Hilder should call 01724 282844.
