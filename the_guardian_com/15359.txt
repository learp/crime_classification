They are alleged to have occurred over the past four years in a park in Bromley, south east London.A joint statement issued last night by Cooper and her husband Ed Balls, the schools secretary, confirmed that a government driver had been arrested and said the alleged offences were not in any way linked to his employment."All the ministers are, of course, very shocked and concerned about the news," the statement added.
