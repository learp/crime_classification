The boyfriend of Joanne Nelson, a young woman who went missing from her home in Hull on Valentine's Day, today admitted responsibility for her unlawful killing.Paul Dyson, 30, appeared at Hull crown court for a plea and directions hearing, where his barrister said he admitted the unlawful killing of the 22-year-old jobcentre worker. Dyson, of Hull, who did not enter any formal plea to the charge of murder, will go on trial later this year in connection with her death. Dyson's barrister Gary Burrell said: "It is important for the court and for the deceased's family to know that Paul Dyson admits the unlawful killing of Joanne Nelson." The recorder of Hull, Judge Michael Mettyear, said the press could report this admission but otherwise normal reporting restrictions applied. Unshaven Dyson appeared during a brief hearing dressed in a dark jacket and dark shirt. He kept his head bowed throughout the brief appearance and only confirmed his name. Miss Nelson's body was found five weeks after she disappeared, following a huge search operation by Humberside police involving hundreds of officers, soldiers and volunteers. The discovery was made on March 24 in woodland near Malton, North Yorkshire. Dyson, who lived with Miss Nelson in Hull, was charged with her murder on or around February 13 "at a place unknown". He was remanded in custody and will appear again at Hull crown court on June 30 for another plea and directions hearing.
