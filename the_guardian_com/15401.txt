Fourteen male prisoners killed themselves during August, making it the worst month for suicides in penal history.Prison reformers say the Home Office figures reveal the bleak reality of summer in overcrowded and understaffed jails in England and Wales. The rise comes at a time when the office of the prisons ombudsman - which now has responsibility for investigating all deaths in custody - is "struggling to cope" with the alarming suicide rate, according to campaigners. So far this year 70 prisoners have taken their own lives in England and Wales. The death toll includes 11 women and five males under the age of 21. It also includes Adam Rickwood, who, at 14, was the youngest person to die in custody. He was found hanging in a single cell in a secure detention centre in County Durham last month. Research by the Prison Service points to a link between overcrowding and the number of deaths. Jails with the highest number of apparent suicides are also the most overcrowded. Juliet Lyons, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, accused courts of failing to use non-custodial sentences for people who did not represent a danger to society. She said mental health issues were also being ignored. "Lack of bail support provision and patchy mental health treatment is pushing more and more vulnerable people into custody," she said. "How long can we expect the prison service to struggle to respond to people in such severe distress?" As in previous years, remand prisoners account for more than a third of all deaths, though they represent only 11% of the prison population. The statistics also suggest that prisons are failing to identify those at risk of suicide early in their imprisonment.
