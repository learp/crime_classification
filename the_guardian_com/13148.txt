A Royal Navy senior rating raped a female colleague after a barbecue on a ship at sea in the Mediterranean, a court martial heard yesterday. Chief Petty Officer Phillip Coates has pleaded not guilty to the rape, which is alleged to have taken place between March 8 and 9 last year.Peter Glenser, prosecuting, told the hearing at Portsmouth that CPO Coates, from Devon, was part of a flag officer sea training team which was visiting the ship when the alleged attack took place.He said that to mark the end of the training period a barbecue was held on the ship's quarterdeck, with alcohol sold to crew members.The alleged victim had drunk a bottle of rose wine, two half glasses of punch and a vodka and lemonade during the evening, he told the hearing, while CPO Coates had consumed a glass of wine and six cans of lager."It caused her to feel merry and not too drunk, and she was in a bouncy, happy, outgoing mood. She has a pretty clear recollection of events."At about 11:30pm, the alleged victim and CPO Coates were alone on the deck and started kissing, but she had not wanted it to continue, the prosecution said.The offence is alleged to have taken place later in a room between decks. The alleged victim said: "As far as I can remember - it's a bit hazy now - he put his hands around my waist and he tried to kiss me. I tried to push him away but he's quite a bit bigger than me and I couldn't get away." She could not remember what happened until she attended a therapy session with a psychologist almost two months later.When interviewed CPO Coates said that the sex had been consensual.The hearing continues.
