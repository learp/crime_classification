A policeman and his family were still out of their home today after an unexploded grenade was found outside their house near the Irish border.The device was discovered under a vehicle in Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh, at about 8pm yesterday.Police Service of Northern Ireland chief inspector, Alywin Barton, said the attempted attack was "inexcusable and inhumane", and police were investigating who was responsible.Suspicion will fall on one of the republican dissident organisations who are violently opposed to the power-sharing settlement in Northern Ireland.The Social Democratic Labour party's policing spokesman, Dominic Bradley, said the planting of a device under the policeman's vehicle was a clear attempt to murder and could have killed more than just the officer.The Newry and Armagh assembly member said: "Thankfully it did not go off and the attempt was unsuccessful. At this time of year most people are focused on Christmas preparations but those responsible for this attempt were focused on the murder and maiming of other human beings."That comparison really shows how far these people are away from the values shared by the overwhelming majority of people here; it also underlines once again the need for communities to unite against those who would rain death and destruction upon us."This type of activity will be condemned by all right-thinking people now and always. The only way to ensure that these people are stopped in their tracks is for the whole community to work closely with the police by being vigilant and sharing information which will lead to the interruption of their activities and their eventual apprehension to face the courts."I would therefore urge anyone who has seen or heard anything in relation to this incident or any other incident to contact the police without delay."
