The BBC this week released a recording of a police interview with Vanessa George, the paedophile who abused children at the nursery where she worked, and distributed photographs of her crimes to others. George is truculent in her refusal to name the children she sexually assaulted, leaving every parent who had a child at the nursery to wonder whether their child was one of those violated. Any future developmental or social difficulties encountered by those children will trigger the same question: "Can this have anything to do with early sexual abuse?"But George, a parent herself, has no desire to make even the most basic of amends, by arming the loved ones of her victims with some knowledge of the experiences their children have undergone, and therefore the ability to address any problems that may ensue. She contradicts the view so widely promulgated, that women tend to abuse children at the insistence of a man. No man is manipulating George into refusing to name the children she attacked. She simply doesn't care about them.Particular disbelief that a woman could be so singularly cruel has been shaken, not only by the involvement of her female co-conspirator, Angela Allen, but by expert opinion that claims female sexual abuse to be much more common than we like to think. Various studies place its prevalence at between 5% and 20% of all cases, and the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, which specialises in helping people who have suffered female sexual abuse, estimates that there could be 64,000 female paedophiles at large in Britain.Perhaps it is time for us to start asking whether the "gender war" may be a consequence of Freud's "narcissism of small differences", instead of evidence of some great gulf between the minds of men and of women. Alongside recent advances in our understanding of "intersex" characteristics, and medical acknowledgement that hormone or surgical treatment for gender reassignment can be justified in very young people, these revelations challenge once again much of what we thought we knew about gender.
