In "A man condemned by psychobabble" (Comment, last week), Nick Cohen appears to dismiss the whole of psychology as an unreliable science and the practice of psychology as a disreputable profession in general. These sweeping and damning conclusions go well beyond the facts presented in his article, which focuses criticism on one idiosyncratic brand of offender profiling which scientist-practitioners in psychology know to be dubious.There are many ways of identifying, prioritising and interviewing suspects. Basing judgments about who might be a suspect on incomplete or biased information and pursuing one favoured hypothesis to the exclusion of others is unscientific. Collecting evidence using methods that are unethical and produce unreliable information, rendering that evidence inadmissible, wastes time and potentially damages participants.Contrast this with the theoretically based and empirically evaluated contributions toward crime investigation of reputable psychological scientists, among them geographical profiling, behavioural profiling, interview techniques to elicit larger amounts of accurate information from witnesses, methods of getting the best from vulnerable witnesses, accurate ways of detecting deception in witnesses and improved accuracy and efficiency of visual identification of suspects.The importance of genetic fingerprinting is undeniable, but, in most cases, you still have to find the person to give you the "print" that matches the information from the scene of the crime.Professor Mary McMurranInstitute of Mental Health, University of NottinghamWhy do we sing this lie?As a volunteer with the World Council of Churches who monitored checkpoints in places such as Bethlehem; who witnessed the daily oppression and collective punishment of Palestinians waiting to go to work or visit relatives, forced to sleep on the ground from as early as 1.30am in order to pass through the wall that cuts off Bethlehem from Jerusalem; who stayed in a Bethlehem hotel as the only guest at the height of the tourist season, looking out of a bedroom window that once afforded picture-postcard views but now is confronted by the eight-metre-high wall, I can fully understand the Rev Stephen Coulter's "logic" to ban O Little Town of Bethlehem from being sung in his parish ("A bad week for ... the Spirit of Christmas", 14 December).Paul MukerjiBirminghamPardon his FrenchEuan Ferguson betrays his chauvinism in his Christmas Quiz (last week). The French do not "insist" on referring to the internet as toile d'araignée mondiale. That is their phrase for the world wide web - literally, world cobweb.Richard WoodsNorfolkThat'll learn 'emThanks to Barbara Ellen for criticising the General Teaching Council ("Our teachers deserve better than a caning", last week), which suggested that teachers must be role models, but unfortunately it is not just the pointless GTC that deems itself fit to dictate how teachers should "conduct" themselves.Evidently, it is not possible to teach a decent lesson if lesson objectives have not been made clear to students beforehand. Each department should have a detailed scheme of work which specifies lesson outcomes for every ability within the class, and teachers are strongly encouraged to follow the schemes in the pursuit of "good practice". Individual creativity is not required.Tom WalkerSudbury, SuffolkThe truth about the ScotsmanYou wrote in your profile of the Barclay brothers (14 December) that when they owned the Scotsman newspaper "readers abandoned the title in droves". That is unfair. Between the second half of 1996 and the second half of 2005 - during the decade when I was publisher of the Scotsman, which coincides with their ownership - sales declined by just under 14%.Not great, but not bad in the circumstances: look at what happened to Scotland's three other big-city quality titles. During the same period, sales of Aberdeen's Press & Journal fell 19%, Dundee's Courier was down 23% and Glasgow's Herald was down 28%. The Barclays worked hard and spent much to make the Scotsman fit for modern times; we didn't do as well as we hoped, but we did better than anybody else.If you want to see readers leaving the Scotsman "in droves", perhaps you should look at what has happened to sales since we sold the Scotsman at the end of 2005.Andrew NeilGrasse, FranceNo dirty tricksForcing retailers to hide tobacco out of sight represents a serious threat to our businesses, the majority of which are already struggling in a tough economic climate ("MPs fall foul of dirty tricks by tobacco giants", News, 14 December).Retailers should not be punished for selling tobacco - it is a legal product. We are entitled to lobby our MPs and many of us have done so - not for the benefit of any tobacco manufacturers, but out of concern for our businesses. MPs who have been contacted by small shop owners can rest assured that they have not been "conned" or fallen foul of a "dirty tricks" campaign.Suleman KhonatVice president, National Federation of Retail NewsagentsLand Rovers are lifesaversCatherine Bennett's comments ("So is this really the great new idea - saving gas-guzzler?", Comment, last week) on Land Rover are written from the viewpoint of the townie without third world work experience.Not only gentlemen farmers and Chelsea housewives own Land Rovers; they are the workhorses of remote areas of the world. The Kenya police use Land Rovers; much taxi work on the high Ethiopian plateau is done by Land Rovers; they are the favoured vehicle for many health professionals in remote Africa. A Ghanaian game warden told me that he had used several 4x4s; only the Land Rover and Toyota Land Cruiser lasted beyond five years.That superb engineering has a purpose in landscapes where mechanical failure can be a cause of death.Stephen SpawlsSpixworth, NorwichWords of discoveryRegarding the "big issue" of Henry Porter's complaint about words lost to The Oxford Junior Dictionary ("Don't deprive children of stoats and catkins", Letters, last week), a dictionary isn't a tool with which children learn the language of their peers - they discover the meaning of podcast, celebrity, gigabyte and happy-slap without necessarily picking up any kind of book. It's more useful for making the unfamiliar comprehensible, so if children don't know what a stoat, catkin or raven is, that's as good a reason as any why they should be able to open a dictionary and find out.Bernard LyallLondon• Letters, which may be edited, should include a full name and postal address and be sent to: Letters to the Editor, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, N1 9GU (to be received by Thursday).
