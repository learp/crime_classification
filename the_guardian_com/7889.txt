A convicted child abuser was today jailed for doing nothing to stop his ex-partner's "horrific" cruelty against her baby son.Paul Husband, 33, and former crack addict Claire Biggs, 27, were arrested after two-month-old Rhys died hours after the last attack at the pair's home in Newham, east London.Husband was jailed for two years and three months today after being convicted of wilful neglect.Biggs was previously jailed for eight years following a conviction for wilful assault.Passing sentence at Inner London crown court, judge Lindsay Burn told Husband: "You failed to give Rhys the medical help you knew he needed for the distress he was in from some cause."The court had previously heard that Biggs repeatedly crushed the child's chest, fracturing 17 ribs, following a catalogue of missed opportunities by health agencies and a breakdown of information sharing.Husband failed to either stop her or help the baby and Biggs went on to twice break the child's right wrist and fracture his shoulder.Medical experts said "severe" force would have been used each time, causing extreme pain.The pair were just charged with child cruelty because the cause of the baby's death could not be established.Quinn Hawkins, prosecuting, told the court that Husband had a string of previous convictions, mainly for dishonesty and motoring matters.But he said that when Husband was 18 he was convicted at Kirkcaldy sheriff court in Scotland of "lewd, indecent and libidinous practices and behaviour" with a child.Hawkins said Husband had rubbed himself against a 10-year-old while lodging with the child's mother.The court heard that Husband had allowed Biggs, who was pregnant with Rhys by another man, to move in with him and was present at the child's birth.Judge Burn acknowledged that Husband had played no part in the baby's physical abuse.He said: "The jury convicted you of child cruelty in which you failed to give Rhys medical help when it was obvious to you such help was required."The jury acquitted you of causing any injuries that put Rhys in any need of such medical help. They were satisfied that Rhys's mother was solely responsible for the injuries to him."The judge imposed an order on Husband banning him from working with children for five years.Sally O'Neill, mitigating, said Husband had been devastated by Rhys's death and had looked on the child as his own son.She acknowledged that Husband should have done more to help the baby, but said he felt that Biggs "knew best".O'Neill said: "He was distraught at Rhys's death, as was apparent to the paramedics arriving at the scene."He thought of Rhys as his own son. He still struggles with what he could have done to help him. He has got to live with that burden for the rest of his life."
