One hundred mobile metal detector arches and 400 search wands are to be provided to the police to screen people going into knife crime hotspots, including pubs, nightclubs and football grounds, under the government's violent crime action plan published yesterday.The 43 police forces in England and Wales will receive at least one scanning arch but future funding will depend on the success of the equipment in dealing with knife crime. Senior police officers yesterday said they hoped the equipment would encourage businesses such as pubs and clubs to install the equipment at their own expense to protect customers. It was clear yesterday that the police have yet to finalise the details of how the arches and wands will fit into their code of practice on stop and search. No mention was made of the use of such equipment in schools. Instead, the emphasis was on a planned advertising campaign, Support Be Safe, to educate 1.1 million young people on the dangers of carrying weapons. The use of the metal detectors forms part of the 50-point crime action plan published by the Home Office yesterday, which pulls together many existing initiatives from across Whitehall to tackle violent crime, including a review of material in video games and on websites.The Home Office said yesterday that violent crime had been falling in recent years, although there have been rises over the past 10 years in a range of less numerous but more serious violent offences such as homicide and crimes with weapons. The document published yesterday discloses NHS data showing that the number of people admitted to hospital after being stabbed has risen from 3,500 in 1998-99 to about 5,500 last year. The Home Office did not start collecting knife crime data separately until last April, and the first full year's data has yet to be published.The action plan emphasises the need for a new drive on prevention as well as stepping up enforcement. Preventive measures include targeting early interventions at people and groups who are "at risk of involvement in violence" as well as those who are known offenders.The Home Office says such groups with a potential to become involved in violence include drug or alcohol dependents and mental health patients, and suggests that social and health services, schools and housing authorities share their knowledge of such individuals with the police.But the Home Office plan also says there are groups who could potentially become involved in violent crime because of their cultural practices and attitudes, and cites so-called "honour violence" as an example.The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, in the action plan's foreword, promises to reduce gun- and gang-related violence, knife crime, and sexual and domestic violence by 2011.But the new government target of reducing the most serious violent crimes, which account for about 19,000 offences recorded by the police each year, will exclude rape and other sexual offences and the most serious incidents of domestic violence. Home Office minister Vernon Coaker said yesterday the government wanted to encourage the reporting of sex crimes and domestic violence, and he would count it a success if the police-recorded crime figures for sexual offences and domestic violence went up.
