A kidnapped teenager who was tortured by his captors has been rescued in west London by armed police who shot at the tyres of a minicab and smashed its back window to reach the 19-year-old.Unmarked police cars surrounded the minicab before the armed officers removed four men from the vehicle in east Acton. Officers searched the car as the men were held face down on the road.The taxi driver who was caught up in the operation on Tuesday had become involved unwittingly. The operation was conducted by Scotland Yard's kidnap unit and firearms officers.The hostage, who had been kidnapped in Bristol on Monday, was taken to hospital after the arrests. Police confirmed that the teenager had been tortured but said that his injuries were not believed to be serious. They refused to give details of the torture to which he had been subjected.A Metropolitan police spokesman said: "At this early stage in the investigation it is believed the kidnap was in relation to crack cocaine drug dealing."It is understood the victim used to live in London but had moved to Bristol. He was captured in Bristol and his kidnappers brought him back to London whilst demands of several thousand pounds were made for his release."A further two men were arrested in Acton. All those arrested, ranging in age from 19 to 29 and from west London, were being held in custody at police stations in central London.
