A 26-year-old man from south London is facing extradition to Britain from Morocco after being arrested yesterday for offences linked to the £53m robbery of the Securitas depot in Tonbridge, Kent.Police in the Moroccan capital, Rabat, swooped on the man and three others in the city's largest supermarket in what the Rabat police described as "a sizeable operation" because the suspects were understood to be "specialists in martial arts and the use of weapons".The arrests represented the culmination of a three-month operation carried out in conjunction with Kent police, who are leading what has become an international investigation into Britain's biggest ever cash robbery.Police have already charged seven people in connection with the raid in the early hours of February 22 and have made at least 18 arrests, mostly within a 40-mile radius of the Tonbridge depot.Investigators have also been chasing lines of inquiry abroad, believing that some of the criminals left the country immediately after the raid.It is understood that of the four people who were arrested by Moroccan police, only one was wanted by Kent police and the others were arrested for offences linked to a disturbance.The raid suspect was not named last night and Kent police's head of major and serious crime, Superintendent Paul Gladstone, will make a further statement today.A spokeswoman for Kent police said last night: "The arrest in Rabat was made by Moroccan police officers working in in conjunction with Kent police. The man is now in custody pending extradition proceedings."The trial of seven people accused of involvement in the raid is scheduled to start at the Old Bailey on July 10 when the accused - John Fowler, 60, Raluca Millen, 25, Stuart Royle, 47, Jetmir Bucpapa, 24, Lea Rusha, 33, Ermir Hysenaj, 27, and Kim Shackleton, 38 - are due to enter pleas.The seven, who have been remanded in custody, face a variety of charges linked to the robbery and the associated kidnapping of depot manager Colin Dixon, his wife Lynn and their nine-year-old son, Craig, from their home in Herne Bay, Kent. So far, £20m has been recovered.
