Paul Whitehouse, the chief constable of Sussex, who handed in his resignation last week over a raid that left an unarmed and naked man dead, announced he was stepping down with immediate effect last night, three months earlier than planned.Mr Whitehouse, who had been expected to remain in charge of Sussex police until September 25, confirmed that he had agreed to cease his "operational role" in the force after a meeting with Margaret Johnson, chairwoman of the Sussex police authority.His resignation on June 26 followed an intervention by the home secretary, David Blunkett, who wrote to the authority urging it to consider sacking Mr Whitehouse to restore public confidence. The force was severely criticised by two independent inquiries into the shooting of the suspected drug dealer James Ashley in 1998, but Mr Whitehouse insisted he had acted properly.He said in a statement last night: "I have agreed with the police authority that while I shall remain as chief constable until September 25, I shall cease working within Sussex police with immediate effect. I am sorry I shall not be able to say goodbye to my colleagues personally."Deputy chief constable Maria Wallis is to take over until a new chief constable is appointed, Ms Johnson said. "The decision that has been announced is a proper reflection of the views held by members of the authority," she said.Ashley, 39, was shot dead at point-blank range in front of his girlfriend by a police marksman. Prosecutions against five officers were abandoned.At a hearing at Wolverhampton crown court last month, Nigel Sweeney QC said it would be impossible to pursue cases against individual officers because there had been a "corporate failure" in the force.A report by Hampshire police accused Mr Whitehouse of "wilfully failing to tell the truth" about the botched operation.
