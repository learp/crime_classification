One man was in a critical condition while another was being treated for serious injuries following what police said appeared to have been "random" stabbings in Hereford.Five people were arrested by West Mercia police, who are appealing for witnesses to "separate, unprovoked assaults on members of the public" between 3.30pm and 4pm on Tuesday evening.A major police operation was triggered by the incidents, the first of which took place at Westfaling Street near to the junction of Holmer Street while the second occurred at a public footpath between Golden Post and the Belmont Estate.One victim remained in a critical condition in the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham, while the other was described as having serious injuries.Four men and a woman were arrested shortly after the incidents were reported to police, who launched an operation involving armed officers and air support.Two people were arrested in an area of south-west Hereford known as the Oval, which is near to the scene of the second incident. The other three were detained in the vicinity of the village of Almeley, close to Kington.Of the five people who were arrested, three are local to the county, according to local media reports.The superintendent for Herefordshire, Ivan Powell, said: "We would like to reassure local people that we believe that we have now accounted for all suspects connected with the two incidents.""We are in the very early stages of our investigation, but what I can say at this stage is that these appear to have been two separate, unprovoked assaults on members of the public.""It is not thought that the victims are either known to each other or know their attackers."He added that a large police presence would remain on the ground while police investigated, as well as carrying out house-to-house inquiries and forensic investigations."I wish to reassure local residents that these are contained incidents: we have people in custody and we believe there is no further threat to the public in the area."
