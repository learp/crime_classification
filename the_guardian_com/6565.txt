Very few verifiable details have emerged from the investigation, but Portuguese newspapers have published detailed accounts of the evening, apparently based on the leaked witness statements of the seven friends on holiday with the McCanns.It has been speculated that police suspicions centre on supposed inconsistencies between the accounts, and the "missing" four hours between the time Madeleine left the resort creche and the moment the alarm was raised. If the reports are correct the discrepancies, with one exception, relate only to minor variations in timing.According to the newspaper Sol, the friends' account is as follows:6pm The McCanns collect Madeleine and their twin siblings from the creche at the Ocean Club7.30 The three children are put to bed8.30 Kate and Gerry McCann arrive at the tapas restaurant8.45 Family friends Russell O'Brien, a doctor from Exeter, and Matthew and Rachael Oldfield, a doctor and recruitment consultant from London, arrive8.55 David and Fiona Payne, both doctors from Leicester, arrive9.00 Gerry McCann goes to check on his children9.05 Mr McCann is returning to the table when he runs into Jeremy Wilkins, an English TV producer whom he befriended on the tennis courts, and the pair chat in the street just outside the McCann's apartment9.10 Jane Tanner, Mr O'Brien's partner, is coming late to the dinner, one of their children having been sick, when she sees a man walking away from the McCann's apartment with a child over his shoulder.
