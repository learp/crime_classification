The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, today apologised for the premature release of data on knife crime.In the wake of the furore when the government released figures last Thursday showing an apparent fall in the number of teenage stabbing victims, Smith told MPs: "I am sorry that I think we were too quick off the mark with the publication of one number in relation to the progress that had been made with tackling knife crime."Smith came under fire in the Commons from her Tory shadow, Dominic Grieve, who accused the Home Office of leaking information when it suited ministers for "political purposes".The row over the release of the knife-crime data blew up on Friday when the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir Michael Scholar, spoke out publicly against the government's "premature, irregular and selective" use of the statistics.Scholar said that ministers had breached the code of conduct that they had themselves had approved to fend off accusations of spin.Grieve asked Smith: "Isn't one of the reasons why there are so many unauthorised disclosures in the Home Office the fact that your department sets the example by engaging in authorised leaking when it suits your party's political purposes?"In this context did you authorise the leak last week of partial and selective knife-crime statistics in breach of the government's own rules and against the UK's own statistical authority, or was that all down to the Cabinet Office and Downing Street?"Smith hit back: "There are lots of arguments about the definition of a leak, but I hardly think issuing a press release counts as a leak." She then went on to apologise in relation to the early release of the statistics.She added: "I would like to commend the police and their crime-fighting partners for the impact that they are already making through the Tackling Knives action programme as spelt out by the other statistics produced last week."The Home Office figures were fed to the media on the morning when Gordon Brown launched the "No to Knives" campaign with actress Brooke Kinsella – whose brother Ben was murdered in a knife attack earlier this year – and Richard Taylor, the father of Damilola Taylor, who was murdered in 2000 age 10.They suggested that a crackdown on knife crime in 10 hotspot areas, including London, Manchester and Birmingham, had prompted a 27% fall in teenagers being taken to hospital with stabbing injuries.Jeremy Heywood, the permanent secretary at No 10, has acknowledged that "insufficient attention" was paid to officials from the NHS Information Centre who protested against the release of the figures.
