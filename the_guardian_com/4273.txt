Tens of thousands of people are paying fraudsters to sit their driving test for them. The Driving Standards Agency says the imposters charge up to £500. The head of its fraud team, Andy Rice, said: 'It is common for them to do over 100, sometimes over 200 tests, before we're in a position to arrest them.'The AA's head of road safety, Andrew Howard, said: 'As the tests get harder more and more people will do whatever it takes to get around the hard exam.'Last week Shazad Akhtar, 34, from Oldham, Lancashire, was sentenced to 200 hours community service and ordered to pay £500 costs after admitting 22 counts of obtaining and attempting to obtain driving licences by deception. The agency, which gathers evidence, has investigated 1,200 cases.
