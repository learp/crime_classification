A husband and three members of his family have been jailed for life for murdering his pregnant wife in an apparent attempt to rid her of an evil spirit.Mohammed Tauseef Mumtaz, 25, had to be carried out of the dock by his father after being jailed for a minimum of 13 years for the murder of Naila Mumtaz, who was smothered at her Birmingham home in 2009.The killer's brother-in-law, Hammad Hassan, was also imprisoned for at least 13 years, while his mother and father, Salma Aslam and Zia ul-Haq, were both given minimum terms of 15 years by a judge at Birmingham crown court.Mumtaz, his parents, who are both aged 51, and Hassan, 24, had denied murder and manslaughter but were convicted of the more serious charge following a 12-week trial that ended in July.The trial heard evidence that Naila was killed during attempts to render her unconscious as family members attempted to drive out a harmful "jinn" spirit. Jurors also heard that Mumtaz, whose wife was six months pregnant, told police she had tried to strangle herself at their home in Handsworth Wood after becoming "possessed".Passing sentence on the four defendants, Mr Justice Keith accepted that they had not intended to kill Naila, who moved to Britain in 2008 after an arranged marriage in Pakistan. Although the jury's guilty verdicts were consistent with a finding that the victim was deliberately smothered by one or more of the defendants as others held her down, the judge said the panel's findings did not explain why she was attacked.Keith said: "The four of you have been convicted of the murder of Naila Mumtaz – she was only 21 years old at the time of her death and had her life ahead of her. She was her parents' only daughter and her death has left a terrible gap in their lives."What aggravates the case is that Naila was pregnant at the time of her death, isolated from her family in a country unfamiliar to her, and spoke little if any English."Possible motives for the offence raised during the trial were that the defendants believed Naila's unborn child was not her husband's or that she was possessed by a jinn sent from Pakistan.The judge urged the prison authorities to house Mumtaz – who has a severe disability – in the same cell as his father so he can be properly supported during his imprisonment.Naila and all four defendants were living at the same house when paramedics were called on 8 July 2009.Ambulance staff did all they could to save the woman, who was found lying on a bed. But she was pronounced dead in hospital. The judge urged the prison authorities to house Mumtaz - who suffers from a severe disability - in the same cell as his father so he can be properly supported during his imprisonment.In a statement issued by West Midlands police, Naila Mumtaz's relatives said she was a "happy, confident and beautiful" young woman.The family statement read: "She came to Britain to be with her husband; we entrusted our most treasured, beloved only daughter to him and his family."Naila was almost six months pregnant with her unborn son when she was killed in her home, destroying her hopes, dreams and opportunities for the future."We are very grateful for the jury using plain commonsense in bringing the perpetrators to justice."
