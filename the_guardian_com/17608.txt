A neighbour strangled Joanna Yeates then sent a text to his girlfriend saying he was bored, a court has been told.In the days after killing the landscape architect, Vincent Tabak attended parties and dinners as he coolly maintained the pretence of a worried neighbour, the prosecution claims.The Dutch engineer looked on from the dock as Nigel Lickley QC, for the Crown, told a jury he had already admitted the manslaughter of Yeates.Lickley told the jury: "He was able to mislead and manipulate others and to hide his inner feelings. He was in complete control and knew what he was doing."Phone records showed he had contacted his girlfriend saying "bored" in the hours after the killing, Lickley said.Neighbours at a Christmas party near Yeates's flat in Clifton, Bristol, heard screams as the killing took place on 17 December, Bristol crown court heard.Lickley said Yeates's body was found by a couple on Christmas morning who had opened presents early and set off for a walk with their dog in Failand, on the outskirts of the city."They walked past a mound of snow," Lickley said. "Something triggered in the mind of the man."From a distance he saw features that indicated that a human body was buried in the snow â€¦ a patch of skin and some denim."Lickley added: "The missing person inquiry that had commenced became a murder inquiry from that moment."Vincent Tabak, 33, denies the premeditated killing of Yeates, 25. Her parents, David and Teresa, looked on from the public gallery solemn-faced on the first day of evidence.Tabak, who lived in a ground-floor flat adjoining Yeates's home, killed her after she went for festive drinks with colleagues, the court heard.She was reported missing two days after disappearing, when her boyfriend, Greg Reardon, returned to their shared flat after a weekend visiting family in Sheffield.The trial continues.
