The jury in the trial of Max Clifford has retired to consider its verdicts on a string of indecent assault charges against the celebrity publicist.Jurors began deliberating their verdicts at 2.34pm on Tuesday at London's Southwark crown court, where Clifford has been on trial for six weeks accused of sexually assaulting seven teenage girls and women.Clifford denies 11 counts of indecent assault relating to the seven teenagers, aged between 14 and 19, spanning from 1966 to 1984.Throughout the trial, the prosecution tried to convince the jury that Clifford was a "master in the art of intimidation and manipulation" who preyed on starstruck girls by promising to introduce them to the world of showbusiness in return for sexual favours.The millionaire publicist, who has represented a string of on-screen stars in his five-decade career, denies claims he used his Bond Street office as his own "sexual fiefdom" and impersonated Hollywood icons to lure girls into his grasp.Clifford convinced one 18-year-old aspiring actor she could meet David Bowie if she performed a sex act, jurors heard. Another was said to have been promised a role in a James Bond film and he allegedly told a third he would secure her a role in Dynasty to repay her favours.The 70-year-old has said the allegations are "utterly repulsive" lies by fantasists and opportunists.
