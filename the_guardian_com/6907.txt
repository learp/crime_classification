Eight suspected leaders of a multi-million pound people smuggling gang were today arrested in dawn raids on 10 addresses in London, two in Kent and one in Lincolnshire.Police believe the pan-European network could be responsible for smuggling tens of thousands of people - mainly Turkish Kurds - illegally into Britain in the last few years.Senior officers consider it to be one of the largest, if not the largest, people trafficking gang they have encountered.The gang is thought to have lured thousands of economic migrants from eastern Europe to Britain with the promise of a better life.Each would have probably paid between £3,000 and £5,000 to be smuggled - in groups of up to 20 at a time - from the Balkans.They would be brought across mainland Europe to the continent's northern coastal ports - a tortuous journey lasting several months.Once there they waited in safehouses until the time was right for them to be smuggled into Britain in cramped secret compartments hidden in lorries, cars or ferries.The people smuggling ring is estimated to have made tens of millions of pounds from the racket, some of which have been invested in businesses such as cafes and snooker halls.The raids were the culmination of a huge two-year Scotland Yard investigation, codenamed Bluesky, which has involved 200 officers and cooperation from Europol and law enforcement agencies in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.The eight men arrested were held on suspicion of facilitating immigration. Two of their spouses were also arrested. Officers arrested a further six people on suspicion of immigration offences, two on suspicion of theft and on one suspicion of money laundering offences, bringing the total number of arrests to 19.More than 200 police officers were involved in this morning's raids at five houses in Enfield, north London, two in Bexleyheath, Kent, and one in each in the London boroughs of Barnet, Haringay, Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Hammersmith. The 13th house was in Boston, Lincolnshire. The network's main figures are thought to have come to Britain from Turkey as asylum seekers and have since been granted indefinite leave to remain.Much of the money has flowed out of the country and police are still trying to trace where and to whom it has gone. Tarique Ghaffur, head of the Metropolitan police's specialist crime directorate, said raids were aimed at those "right at the top of this network".He said those who benefited from the racket were those at the head of the people smuggling ring."Our commitment is to take out such networks and this operation is the latest in our collaboration with the growing number of law enforcement agencies in Europe to work robustly to achieve this mission," he said.Detective Chief Superintendent Bill Skelly, one of the lead officers in the operation, said the network could potentially make up to £100,000 from each lorry load of 20 people smuggled into Britain.Det Ch Supt Skelly confirmed that police had entered business premises as well as residential addresses in this morning's raids and that a substantial amount of cash had been seized.
