Two more people have been arrested today in connection with the investigation into child abuse at the Haut de la Garenne former children's home in Jersey.The arrests came as four more milk teeth were found at the home, bringing the total number found so far to 52.A 70-year-old man and a 69-year-old woman were being questioned in relation to the investigation into the Jersey care system in the 1960s and 1970s.Police said today that while the matters are connected to Haut de la Garenne, it is not alleged that the crimes took place at the home.Haut de la Garenne became the centre of the historic abuse inquiry in February after what was initially thought to be part of a child's skull was found there. It was later believed to be wood or part of a coconut.Forensic teams have since found a network of four secret underground chambers, and have also discovered at least 30 charred human bone fragments.Police have identified around 70 suspects or "people of interest" that they want to question as part of the inquiry.The arrests bring the total number of people held as part of the island abuse inquiry to six.
