A teenager was paid £50 by a "fixer" to brandish guns on the BBC's Panorama programme, a court heard yesterday.The 17-year-old, who cannot be identified because of his age, was filmed assembling a shotgun for the programme about guns and gang culture on Merseyside.The teenager, a member of the Marsh gang, was approached by an intermediary and paid to "show off" the weapons on camera, Liverpool crown court was told.After the Young Guns documentary was broadcast in July last year Merseyside's chief constable, Bernard Hogan-Howe, wrote to BBC director general Mark Thompson asking if young people had been paid to pose with guns.The 17-year-old pleaded guilty on 11 December to possession of a shotgun, a handgun and ammunition.Jason Smith, defending the youth, said: "The defence contention is not that he was paid directly by the Panorama film producers but he was paid money by an intermediary who had been paid money to fix it on their behalf."Smith said the intermediary, referred to as Male C, was a leading figure in the Marsh gang. "On the evening of 30 June last year the defendant was offered £50 by Male C to collect some guns and go in front of the TV cameras to make threats and show off on behalf of the Marsh gang."After collecting the guns he went to a location where he met Male C and a cameraman and was told to show off the weapons. After the filming he took the guns back to where he had collected them and was told 'nice one' by Male C and was given £50."Ian Davies, prosecuting, said the crown accepted the teenager's version of events. The case was adjourned for sentence on 23 January. The BBC said it had made no payments and the programme-makers had abided by its editorial guidelines.
