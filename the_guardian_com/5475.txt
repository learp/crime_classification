The Observer has obtained a letter to David Cameron and Nick Clegg from former police and intelligence chiefs who say the UK's ability to combat international crime will be severely limited if it turns its back on further European Union crime co-operation.Written by William Hughes, director general of the Serious Organised Crime Agency from 2004 to 2010, it is signed by former Metropolitan police commissioners Lords Blair and Imbert, as well as Sir Stephen Lander, the ex-head of MI5, and other eminent figures.Their intervention places them firmly in the camp of the pro-EU Lib Dems, but at loggerheads with the predominantly Eurosceptic Tory party. It follows a letter to the prime minister in February by 102 Conservative backbenchers who demanded he opt out of EU police and justice policies, including the European arrest warrant, to prevent any further loss of sovereignty.With Cameron reluctant to promise a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, an opt-out on justice and home affairs issues is seen by Tory strategists as a possible alternative to appease Eurosceptic backbenchers.The UK must decide by next summer if it wants to remain fully involved with existing EU justice and police measures or opt out. In their letter to Cameron and Clegg, the signatories say the latter course would have disastrous consequences for the fight against international paedophile gangs and investigations into terrorist networks."The growth in cross-border criminal activity within Europe is both an inevitable byproduct of the free movement of goods, services, capital and people under the single market, and a serious policing and security challenge," they say. "Responding to an increasingly international criminal environment requires modern international legal and policing tools, fast and effective cross-border co-operation and the ability to raise standards and share best practice with our closest security partners."British officers, they say, are at the forefront of shaping effective co-operation. "British law enforcement bodies are now constantly communicating, co-operating and collaborating with EU agencies and other national policing partners in pursuing serious organised criminal and terrorist networks."A key success, they say, was Operation Rescue – a three-year investigation by Europol across 30 countries between 2008 and 2011 which led to the discovery of the world's largest online paedophile network. There were 184 arrests and 230 children were freed, including 60 in the UK.The former officers say scrapping or opting out of the European arrest warrant would be entirely self-defeating.
