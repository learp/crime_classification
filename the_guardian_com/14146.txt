The Sunderland striker Djibril Cissé has categorically denied the allegation that he assaulted a woman outside a Newcastle nightclub.Cissé was arrested during the early hours of Monday morning and later released on police bail after an alleged incident with an unnamed woman outside the Diamonds lap dancing club at 3am.However, his spokesperson insists the French international voluntarily handed himself into Northumbria police to help with their inquiries and has vowed to clear his name. Despite reports to the contrary, Cissé, who is a teetotaller, had not been inside the club, nor had he been drinking, and was on his way past the Diamonds bar when the alleged fracas took place."Djibril categorically denies any assault," said the spokesperson. It is not thought that he will be disciplined by Sunderland as the incident took place six days before their next match and he was not under the influence of alcohol.
