Police arrested a fourth person today in connection with a murder inquiry after parts of a boy's dismembered body were found dumped in a canal and scattered around nearby streets.Investigators found the child's severed arm in the Grand Union canal in Loughborough on Sunday. Yesterday police discovered the child's legs on Alan Moss Road, and another, unidentified set of remains near playing fields in Roseberry Street. All the body parts had been wrapped in plastic bags. Men aged 19 and 26 and a 15-year-old girl were arrested yesterday evening on suspicion of murder. An 18-year-old man was arrested today in connection with the investigation. "They are now being held in separate police stations across Leicestershire," said a police spokeswoman.Police originally believed the victim was female, but pathologists confirmed that the body parts belonged to a boy between 5ft 5ins and 5ft 11ins tall. Police said they believed they knew the victim's identity, but formal identification has yet to take place. Detective superintendent Bob Small, leading the investigation for Leicestershire police, said he believed that the child had been murdered "sometime over the weekend" and that door-to-door inquiries were continuing today. The boy's ethnic origin is not yet known, but Home Office pathologists said that the victim was probably not north African or Afro-Caribbean. House-to-house inquiries and extensive searches of the sites took place before last night's arrests. Officers want to talk to anyone in the area between 6am on Friday and 3pm on Sunday. Anyone with any information is asked to contact Leicestershire police on 0116 222 2222.
