Ministers are drawing up a rigorous new testing regime for Britain's police forces to ensure they target crimes that most affect the public.Amid concern that the pace of police reform is going too slowly, officials for the home secretary, David Blunkett, have devised plans for a "crime weighting" regime that would reveal which forces deal best with the most serious crimes. At present, police performance figures do not differentiate between offences in terms of their seriousness. The resources involved in trying to solve particular offences and the impact on the community are to be considered. However, as part of advice to the Home Office, seen by the Guardian, consultants Accenture say the choice of weights to be used in performance assessment is "ultimately a political decision". Eric Ollerenshaw, the Conservative leader in the London assembly, said: "This could be yet another attempt by the government to find a way to fiddle the performance figures."
