Britain's senior police officers said today that treatment should be considered for some drug users instead of conviction.The Association of Chief Police Officers said that addicts need treatment if the so-called "war on drugs" is to be won. The report follows a major review of the police stance on tackling drugs and comes six months after the home secretary, David Blunkett, called for a relaxation on laws surrounding cannabis. Today's report said success in tackling drugs was "more likely to be achieved through treatment programmes that seek to manage prolific offenders" while still targeting dealers. Commander Andy Hayman, chairman of the Acpo drugs sub-committee and deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said the review was "timely" in light of recent government announcements. He said: "The drugs issue has never been more prominent in the minds of all in the community and government. "In publishing these proposals, Acpo is demonstrating its strong commitment to continue to work with its partners to make an impact on the drugs problem and the associated criminality. "The overall aim of the Acpo drugs policy is to disrupt and reduce supply, while at the same time working to achieve demand reduction." The move has been welcomed by drugs groups who have long campaigned that imprisoning addicts does not solve the problem. Roger Howard, the chief executive of the charity Drugscope, a research and drugs policy advisory body, said the report came as no surprise. He added: "We strongly support efforts to get drug users quickly into treatment rather than using a prosecution and pressing criminal charges. "This is a new and welcome departure in how we respond to the heavy end drug users. The police are recognising that treatment works rather than just processing addicts through the courts."
