The National Crime Agency is to lead an investigation into allegations of bribery relating to Northern Ireland’s largest ever property deal.It was confirmed on Thursday that the Police Service of Northern Ireland has called in the NCA to take the lead role in the inquiry into an alleged multimillion pound pot to make payoffs on the fringes of the sale of 850 properties to a US investment fund.The National Assets Management Agency (Nama), the body set up by the Irish government in the wake of the 2008 financial crash to deal with toxic assets, agreed the Project Eagle portfolio sale in April 2014, in the biggest deal it has done to clear property, land and developer loans from bailed-out Irish banks. Some £4.5bn was originally borrowed by developers, investors and speculators for the property assets in Northern Ireland, but Nama sold them for £1.1bn, a loss of about €283m (£203m) after acquiring the loans from banks. At the heart of the allegations is that £7m was found in an Isle of Man bank linked to the deal. The offshore money was discovered by the leading Belfast law firm Tughans as it carried out an audit of the work it did on the Project Eagle sale for the successful US bidders Cerberus. It has been claimed that money was destined for a politician or political party. Senior partners at Tughans said that the £7m was diverted without their knowledge and has since been retrieved.The NCA’s deputy director of operations, Graham Gardner, said: “The NCA has considered a request from (the) PSNI and has agreed to lead an investigation, calling on support as necessary from PSNI officers.“We will not be providing a running commentary on our progress but will provide updates as and when appropriate.”It emerged on Thursday that £5m was to be paid to a Belfast businessman – a former Nama adviser – by one of the nine bidders for the Project Eagle properties.Nama’s chairman, Frank Daly, told the Irish parliament’s public accounts committee (PAC) that the US investment firm Pimco used “fee arrangements” worth £15m, which was “split three ways” to aid them in their bid to buy the 850 properties in Northern Ireland.Among those receiving these fee arrangements was Frank Cushnahan, who resigned from the Northern Ireland committee advising Nama on how to sell off the Project Eagle property portfolio several months before the deal with Cerberus was agreed.Daly said Pimco was forced to withdraw its offer for the huge property portfolio after it revealed that third-party fee arrangements were in place, saying the body was appalled by the revelation.He added that the investment house told Nama that £15m was due to be paid to Cushnahan, the American law firm Brown Rudnick acting for Pimco in the bidding and later for the successful bidder Cerberus, and a managing partner of Tughans, which acted for both bidders from the Northern Ireland end. All of the private firms involved in the Northern Ireland asset sale have denied wrongdoing.The PSNI confirmed on Wednesday it has launched a criminal investigation concerning allegations by another Irish parliamentarian, Mick Wallace, that a special account was created in the Isle of Man for a Northern Ireland politician as part of the property sell-off.Wallace has declined to give evidence to the PAC and instead has called for an independent inquiry into his allegations. Although he used Dáil parliamentary privilege to air his claims, Wallace did not name the politician allegedly involved in the sale.Daly told the PAC meeting in Dublin on Thursday that Nama never provided any knowledge about debtors who once owned these properties, which would have given Cushnahan inside information.“We are talking about Northern Ireland. We are talking about a relatively small business community where there’s an awful lot of information about debtors and properties, who’s in Nama, who’s not in Nama. But it did not come from Nama,” Daly said.PSNI assistant chief constable Will Kerr said the police believed there was sufficient concern in relation to potential criminal activity surrounding the Project Eagle property deal to warrant an investigation.The Isle of Man bank account in question is thought to have been controlled by Ian Coulter, a former partner in Tughans. The Law Society in Northern Ireland confirmed this week that it has been investigating the circumstances of Coulter’s departure from Tughans since January.Coulter has not yet commented publicly on Wallace’s claims. Meanwhile, Gareth Robinson, one of the sons of Northern Ireland’s first minister, Peter Robinson, denied that he or his PR company had any involvement in the sale of Nama’s assets to Cerberus.A spokesman for Gareth Robinson’s company said: “At no time has Verbatim Communications Ltd been employed by Nama, Pimco or Cerberus.“No Verbatim Communications Ltd employees or representatives facilitated or were in any way involved in the sale of Nama assets to Cerberus.“While neither the company, nor anyone representing Verbatim Communications Ltd, acted for anyone in the Nama sale to Cerberus, Verbatim Communications fully supports all investigations into the matter whether in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland.”The company added that: “Three years ago, Verbatim Communications Ltd was engaged by Tughans to assist with a very successful event relating to third-level education.“Verbatim Communications Ltd acts in a professional and ethical manner at all times and any suggestion to the contrary will be vigorously challenged.”
