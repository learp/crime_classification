An obscure slang last used by Elizabethan thieves is undergoing something of a revival. The Ministry of Justice has issued a security alert after officers at HMP Buckley Hall in Rochdale noted certain terms from "thieves' cant" - "onick" for heroin, "grade" for money, "warbs" for police and "inick" for sim card (though you imagine this might just be a latter-day intervention) - cropping up in prisoners' letters and phone calls to facilitate drug deals.Secret languages such as this have an obvious appeal for those who have something to hide. One language used by African slaves, called TUT, was based on phonetics, and used to help teach children to read. Victorian market traders, meanwhile, are thought to have dreamed up "back slang" - in which a word is spoken backwards, giving us "yob" for "boy" - in order to single out customers on whom to palm off shoddy goods. And the gay dialect Polari was popular in the 60s, before the legalisation of homosexuality removed the need for secrecy. Among its colourful terms are "luppers" for fingers, "strillers" for piano, and "oglefakes" for "glasses".Much more widely used, is the children's favourite, Pig Latin - which, in its most common form, cuts off a word's first consonant and sends it to the end, followed by the syllable "ay" (igp-ay atin-lay, etc). I eschewed that at school, in favour of an infinitely superior secret language one of my friends learned from her mother. Called "Arp", our language - which, 10 years on, we still resort to, especially when discussing intimate matters in public, or deflecting unwanted attention in bars - inserts the syllable "arp" after each syllable of a word, or, if it's a monosyllable, just before. It's brilliantly simple, easy to learn, and (we hope!) almost incomprehensible to the uninitiated.
