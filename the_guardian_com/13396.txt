In 1997, the former shipping tycoon Abbas Gokal was jailed for 14 years for his role in the collapse of Bank of Credit & Commerce International. Levene could take some comfort from Gokal's experience; he was released after just six years despite failing to meet the terms of a £3m confiscation order against him.Another high-profile scalp for the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) was Asil Nadir, Britain's most famous fugitive from justice until he was jailed for 10 years this summer. Nadir has since been ordered to pay back £5m of the £29m he stole from his Polly Peck business empire or serve an extra six years in prison. Nadir claimed he was broke and has been living off handouts from his mother for the past 17 years, but the judge was unmoved.The (SFO) also likes to trumpet the 10-year sentence meted out in 2010 to Kevin Foster, who set up a pyramid scheme that managed to squeeze £34m from 8,000 victims in former coal-mining towns in south Wales. Foster used the money to finance his lavish lifestyle, buying properties including a £600,000 farm in Kent, complete with swimming pool, exotic animals and koi breeding pools.Also in the 10-year club is Peter Clowes, sentenced in 1992 for stealing £16m of investors' money. To the fury of his victims, Clowes was released after serving less than half his sentence. Some 10 months later, Clowes was caught making false claims for jobseekers allowance for which he received a four-month sentence in May 1999.Then there was Robert Maxwell, who stole more than £450m from pension funds to prop up his own businesses. Maxwell, of course, escaped sentencing with his mysterious death in 1991. Josephine Moulds
