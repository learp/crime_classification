The Notting Hill carnival will go ahead this year, but will close early each night amid heightened fears of trouble after last week's riots.The Metropolitan police's acting commissioner, Tim Godwin, testifying before the home affairs committee, said: "I want it to go ahead."A formal decision is expected to be made on Thursday after organisers meet the police. So far no council or police chief has told carnival organisers they want it cancelled.The number of letters to Kensington and Chelsea council calling for the carnival in west London to be scrapped is understood to be roughly the same number as every year.Police will be out in force at the two-day event over the August bank holiday weekend. It is a showcase for African-Caribbean culture and can attract crowds of one million people.Carnival organisers have decided the parade of floats will finish by 6.30pm, and the static sound systems by 7pm, earlier than usual.The aim is to finish so that crowds of people have dispersed by the time it gets dark, which is believed by police to be the time when trouble is most likely to occur.The other reason for the earlier finish is that parents may keep youngsters taking part in the carnival away, fearing an increased chance of trouble.In a statement, the carnival organising committee said it would continue "to assess the severity of the impact the riots may potentially have on Notting Hill carnival 2011 and to discuss measures that will be put in place to avoid any untoward incidents".
