Jurors in the Old Bailey retrial of Sion Jenkins over the murder of his foster daughter, Billie-Jo, today retired to consider their verdict.Mr Jenkins, a 48-year-old former deputy headteacher of Lymington, Hampshire, denies murdering the 13-year-old in February 1997. Billie-Jo was battered over the head with an iron tent peg at least 10 times as she painted patio doors at the family's home in Hastings, East Sussex. Mr Jenkins was jailed for life for Billie-Jo's murder following a trial in 1998. A retrial was later ordered following two appeals. Jurors failed to reach a verdict at the Old Bailey retrial in July last year, and a second retrial began three months ago. The prosecution at the current trial alleged Billie-Jo's murder followed other violent incidents that she "suffered in silence". However, the defence claims Mr Jenkins has been the victim of a miscarriage of justice and points to a mentally-ill man known as Mr B, who was in the area at the time of the murder.The trial continues.
