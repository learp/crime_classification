An SAS-trained hitman who mistakenly killed an innocent teenager instead of a drug dealer has been jailed for life.Darren Waterhouse, 39, from Luton, was sentenced at Liverpool crown court after being convicted of the murder of Craig Barker, in Everton, Merseyside, in April last year. The court heard that Waterhouse was hired by drug dealer William Moore to kill a rival, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, because of a feud. Moore, 45, from Everton, was also convicted of murder and jailed for life. Mr Justice Henriques made a recommendation at the hearing on Saturday that they serve at least 30 years before being eligible for parole. "The effort in planning this conspiracy was matched only by your bungling incompetence in covering your tracks," the judge told them. The court heard that Waterhouse fired eight bullets at a Ford Galaxy. Seven of the bullets hit Mr Barker, who was in the passenger seat, having swapped places with the intended target. A retrial of Moore's brother John will take place later this year after the jurors failed to reach verdicts on the murder charge against him. The prosecutor, Andrew Edis, said: "They are still guilty of murdering Craig Barker, even if they intended to shoot someone else." Waterhouse, who trained with the SAS and served with the Coldstream Guards, was awarded the Military Cross in the early 1990s for bravery in Bosnia. He had just escaped from prison, where he met William Moore, who was serving nine years for drug dealing. He spent some of the estimated Â£10,000 he received for the killing on plastic surgery.
