One of three defendants accused of murdering Damilola Taylor was cleared today by an Old Bailey jury.In the second trial over the death of the 10-year-old, Hassan Jihad, 20, from Peckham, south London, was found not guilty of murder.The judge told the jury of seven women and four men that he would accept majority verdicts for the two others facing trial, brothers aged 17 and 18, who cannot be named for legal reasons.The judge sent the jury home for the evening after they failed to reach majority verdicts. They will continue their deliberations tomorrow.Damilola bled to death from a stab wound to his left thigh in a stairwell on the north Peckham estate in November 2000. The Nigerian-born boy had been in Britain for only three weeks when he was killed. The prosecution alleged he was attacked with a broken beer bottle during an attempted robbery. The defendants denied being involved in any way.The case was re-investigated after four youths previously accused of the murder were acquitted in 2002 and new evidence came to light. No forensic evidence had linked them to the death.During the second trial, the jury heard how laboratory staff had overlooked crucial evidence. Two spots of Damilola's blood were only found after detectives asked forensic scientists to re-examine items of clothing seized in the days after the murder.One spot was found on a white Reebok trainer belonging to the 17-year-old brother. A fibre from the trousers Damilola was wearing when he was stabbed was found within the blood spot. Another speck of blood was found on the cuff of the sweatshirt of the other brother. Fibres from Damilola's clothes were found on the clothing of all three boys.At the time of Damilola's death, Mr Jihad was aged 14, while the two brothers were aged 12 and 13.A carpenter had been returning to his office on the first floor of the building when he noticed a trail of blood. He found Damilola after following the trail up two flights of steps and called for an ambulance.
