An investigation into the growing and widespread black market in parking passes for the disabled has found that tens of thousands of motorists are using forged or stolen blue badges to avoid parking and congestion charges.The inquiry has discovered that thieves are selling passes for up to Â£1,500. Fakes change hands on eBay and thousands of disabled people are having badges stolen from their cars.The Local Government Association says the trade is booming because motorists are greedy for the same privileges as the country's 2.2 million legitimate badge holders, who are entitled to park for free in disabled parking bays and can leave their vehicles on single yellow lines for three hours without penalty. Its inquiry has disclosed that cheats are using badges belonging to disabled people who have died.
