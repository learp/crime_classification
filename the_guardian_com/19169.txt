Emails sent by Anthony and Linda O'Malley's killers to the National Missing Persons Helpline were released yesterday. They used the codename Phoenix and claimed to be "a professional specialised in finding people".One email claimed that a contact had sold Phoenix the O'Malleys' passports, credit cards and jewellery."It was Tony's passport and I paid €4,000 for that passport and credit card. They had Linda's too, but I did not have the money ... He gave the ring shown on the picture, and said belonged to the lady of the passports."He told me Tony and Linda were driving close to Malaga when they took a secondary service road and ... hit a motor home parked on the side, killing a three years old boy."Apparently Tony was inadvertently driving in the wrong side of the road. The owner of the motor home, a Romanian Gypsy travelling with his family and father of the boy, took Tony and Linda to where they are now, to pay for what they had done."I was told that Tony is alive but almost blind, because they took away his glasses, and Linda had lost a lot of weight and was sick. I ask him how much they want for their release, and he said £50,000."Phoenix demanded an immediate payment of £12,500 and a further £20,000 to secure the O'Malleys' release. "Keep in mind that, due to Linda's health, time is of the essence."
