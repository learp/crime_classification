The growth of the knife crime crisis in England and Wales is confirmed, with the figures showing a 28% rise in the number of incidents described as attempted murder with a knife.A similar rise - 29% - is recorded in the number of incidents described as grievous bodily harm with intent, although about one-third of this increase is put down to the change in the counting rules.The data comes after Monday's fatal stabbing of a 16-year-old by a group of youths outside a Liverpool youth club, which triggered a presentation by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, to the cabinet on Tuesday. Smith said yesterday that 2,200 knives had been seized since the Tackling Knives Action Programme was launched in June.Separate knife figures have only been collected by the police since April 2007, and yesterday's statistics compare April to June 2008 with April to June 2007. Quarterly figures for homicides in which a knife was the murder weapon will be published for the first time in December.But figures for attempted murder with a knife rose from 50 in the April-June quarter of 2007 to 64 this year. Incidents of grievous bodily harm with intent to threaten life also rose 29%, from 1,253 to 1,616. Home Office officials said about one-third of this rise was due to the change in the counting rules.The number of robberies in which a knife was used fell from 3,422 to 3,278 and the number classified as GBH without intent fell from 662 to 455, but this was partly due to the exclusion of some wounding offences from this category.Overall, the figures show a total of 8,610 violent and sexual offences involving a knife or a sharp instrument between April and June this year.Gun crime fell 6% in the 12 months to June 2008, from 9,862 to 9,306. The number of people shot dead fell from 53 to 48 and shootings which resulted in injuries fell by 15% from 3,181 to 2,718.
