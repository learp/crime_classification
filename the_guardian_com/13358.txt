Asian businesses ranging from multinational firms to corner shops are to create a multimillion-pound social fund in an attempt to stop young men in their community drifting into crime and extremism, the Guardian has learned.Under a scheme being launched in London today, Asian-run businesses and firms which employ south Asians will be asked to contribute £250 each to finance what is being described as the first "post-7/7 initiative to tackle serious crimes" in those communities.The money will finance diversion schemes, training, education projects and community engagement initiatives. The huge Asian commercial sector is seen as a good source of funding. In 2003-04 the turnover of Asian businesses in London was £60bn.An immediate task will be to find 200 "vulnerable young people" jobs by the end of this year. The scheme is to be run jointly by Scotland Yard, the Safer London Foundation - a policing charity - and the London Chamber of Commerce's Asian Business Association.They say alienation and deprivation make young people an easy target for criminal gangs and extremist groups. Three of the four terrorist bombs that exploded in London last July, killing 57 people, were detonated by Asians recruited by extremists in deprived communities.Senior officers say the level of crime involving Asians is still comparatively low, but they are increasingly concerned about the severity of the offences: murders, which have seen a steep rise; kidnappings; blackmail; and intimidation against shops and restaurants.Tony Sarin, of the Asian Business Association, said: "There is a generation of young people who have the values of this country but who do not feel they are getting the opportunities that they should. The incredibly successful south Asian community is going to try to facilitate long-term opportunities for that generation."
