The parents of Hannah Foster, the Southampton teenager murdered last year while returning from a night out with friends, will be in the Punjab capital Chandigarh today to meet a prominent politician who claims that the suspected killer has taken refuge with a Sikh religious sect.Trevor and Hilary Foster addressed a press conference in New Delhi yesterday after arriving in India to help trace Maninderpal Singh Kohli, the prime suspect in the rape and murder of their 17-year-old daughter, who was abducted from close to their home in Portswood, Hants, on March 14 last year.Kohli, a sandwich delivery van driver, flew to India on March 18, leaving his wife and two children behind in Southampton. He stayed with his family in Punjab, but fled on March 29 after a phone call from the UK warned him that police were on his trail. "Sixteen months on, we come to you in desperation, seeking help to obtain justice for Hannah," Mr Foster said, announcing that a special hotline had been set up in India asking for information on the 36-year-old's whereabouts. "Please help us find Kohli. By staying silent and letting him remain free, you may be putting your daughters at risk," he continued. The appeal by the Fosters received wide coverage on Indian TV news channels, which highlighted the 5m-rupee (Â£70,000) reward for information leading to Kohli's arrest. Mr Foster said they had asked for meetings with India's minister of state for external affairs, Rao Inderjit Singh, and the Punjab chief minister, Amarinder Singh, but had yet to get a response. However, a meeting was scheduled today in the Punjab capital Chandigarh, 180 miles north-west of New Delhi, with Bir Devinder Singh, the deputy speaker of the Punjab assembly, who reportedly believes that Kohli has taken refuge with a Sikh group. The Fosters also plan to meet senior police officers in Chandigarh. The Indian press has accused the police of not doing enough to trace Kohli.
