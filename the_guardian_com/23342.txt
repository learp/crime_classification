Police in Spain yesterday continued to question a man and woman suspected of plotting to extort money from the parents of the missing four-year-old Madeleine McCann.It is claimed that the man, from Italy, and woman, from Portugal, were planning to con Gerry and Kate McCann out of some or all of the Â£2.5m reward that has been offered for Madeleine's return.They were alleged to be pretending to know where Madeleine was being held.The development is the latest false lead to raise hopes that Madeleine could be found, yet Mr and Mrs McCann still tried to be positive about it. In his blog Mr McCann said: "This appears to be a clear signal from European police forces that they are treating all information relating to Madeleine's disappearance very seriously."Police made the arrests in the resort of Sotogrande, near Gibraltar, on Thursday. The couple were named in Italy as Danilo Chemello, 61, from Sandrigo near Venice, who was said to have made a fortune from a gravel business, and Aurora Pereira Vaz, from Portugal.The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that they had met when Ms Vaz was married to a Roman businessman. She left him and the pair then travelled around Europe, living lavishly.In 1996 they were tried on charges of plotting to murder Ms Vaz's by then ex-husband but were convicted of lesser charges and escaped jail.In 2003, Mr Chemello began an 18-month jail sentence in France for maltreatment and neglect of the daughter he had had with Ms Vaz; the child was five years old.He was arrested on Thursday on an international warrant issued from France, where he was wanted in connection with an association it is claimed that he had with a criminal group.Portuguese police were involved in the arrests, which at first suggested that this was a genuine breakthrough. By yesterday, however, it seemed that it was another false lead.Madeleine was four days away from her fourth birthday when she vanished from the bedroom of her parents' holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on the Algarve. Her parents were eating dinner at the time in a nearby restaurant.She was apparently taken from the room while her two-year-old twin siblings slept beside her.Despite a huge search nearby during the days after the disappearance and an energetic publicity operation, with posters of Madeleine distributed throughout Europe and north Africa, there have been no confirmed sightings of her since she disappeared.Mr and Mrs McCann toured European and north African cities to try to widen the appeal for information; they visited Rome, Lisbon, Madrid, Berlin, Amsterdam and Rabat.But the breakthrough for which the family longs has not happened.Initially the search was concentrated on the country where she vanished, and within a few days police revealed that they had investigated 350 separate suspicious incidents.Reports of sightings included local expatriates spotting a young girl who was walking along a road in a nearby town with two people.A balding man was seen dragging a girl towards a marina in the nearby town of Lagos.Another man was seen driving away at speed from a central Portuguese village.However all these appeared to be false alarms.Attention then focused on a British expatriate, Robert Murat. Police questioned him and searched the villa where he lives with his mother; it is only 160 metres from the place where Madeleine was snatched. Mr Murat remains the only named suspect, but has not been charged with any offences.He has denied any involvement with the child's disappearance. So has a Russian computer expert, Sergey Malinka, who lives in the same area and has worked with Mr Murat.Meanwhile, in the UK, a man accused of stealing cash from a collection box for the Madeleine fund failed to show up for a scheduled court appearance. Magistrates at Cannock, Staffordshire, have issued a warrant for the arrest of Graham Hartshorne, 22.
