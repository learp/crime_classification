When groups of child abusers are convicted the Guardian always specifically tells us when the guilty are of south-Asian origin, even though we can guess this from their names. I am reminded of the time when we were specifically told that a lawyer or police officer was female even though we could tell that from her name too.But when the guilty are white, this fact apparently does not warrant specific remark (Woman at heart of paedophile ring among three found guilty of rape, 28 July). Here is a norm (of whiteness) remaining unmarked even though it would be a public service to highlight that child sexual abuse is an equal-opportunity activity where the common features are the cruel and predatory attitudes of the adults, and their disregard of the humanity of their victims. Instead your headline writers for this case carefully marked out another non-normative characteristic – that the apparent ringleader was a woman.Rather than keeping the attention focused on Asian men – or, failing that, on a female central figure – it’s time for the Guardian to say specifically that crimes of this kind can also be committed by ordinary white men (not only priests), and that it’s time to face up to that.Naomi StandenBirmingham
