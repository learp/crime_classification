Two robbers have held up a post office while armed with a crossbow. CCTV caught the two men, one armed with a knife and the other aiming the crossbow at point-blank range towards the sub-postmaster.The men targeted the shop shortly after it opened for business yesterday in Plymouth. The pair did not wear masks as they carried out the robbery at the Efford Road post office. One image shows the sub-postmaster's hands raised over the counter in a clear signal that he is unarmed and no threat to them. He holds up a newspaper in confusion.Another shows the man with the crossbow leaning over the counter to jab the weapon at the postmaster's face. His accomplice then holds a white plastic bag over the counter for the sub-postmaster to fill with cash and packets of cigarettes, which spill on to the counter.A police spokesman said: "The shop owner received a minor injury when the crossbow was thrust in his face."Both men are considered dangerous and were armed at the time of the robbery. They should not be approached by members of the public."The man with the crossbow was described as wearing a mid-length green jacket with the hood pulled over his head.He also wore blue jeans, red shoes with a white band around the edge and white laces, plus grey gloves.The other suspect was of medium build, with dark hair and wearing a white hoodie top with a full zip at the front.He also wore black gloves, a dark-coloured ski hat with flaps covering the ears, blue jeans and black training shoes with a white stripe.Both were estimated as being between 20 and 35 years old.
