Detectives investigating the killings of the Rev John Suddards and the pensioner Betty Yates are appealing for help in tracing a rucksack and mobile phone.Police believe the missing rucksack and phone could be vital to their investigations and may be on farmland or in an outbuilding or barn in the south-east of England, potentially in the Eastbourne area.Suddards, 59, was found stabbed to death in the hallway of his vicarage in Thornbury, south Gloucestershire, last month. Yates, 77, was discovered, also having been stabbed, at her riverside home near Bewdley in Worcestershire, in January.Avon and Somerset police asked farmers to check for the rucksack and phone, which they said may have been discarded between 14 February and 18 February.The Eurohike Hydro rucksack is olive green and black and has a distinctive orange belt clip on the side straps which doubles as a whistle.If anyone finds this bag they are asked not to touch it but to contact the police immediately as it may need to be preserved for forensic evidence.Police are also looking for a missing purple Blackberry 9300. If anyone knows the whereabouts of this phone or has been offered one for sale since 14 February they are asked to contact the police.Stephen Farrow, 47, of no fixed abode has been charged with the murders of the vicar and pensioner and remains in custody.
