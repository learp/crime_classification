Police arrested two men last night in connection with London's second teenage murder of the new year . The arrests came amid fresh demands for tougher laws to tackle the capital's growing problem of knife crime.This latest tragedy triggered calls for stricter sentences for knife possession, since 27 teenagers were killed in shootings and stabbings in London last year. Police were called to a tower block in Erith, south-east London, at around 3am yesterday following reports of an 'altercation' and found a teenager dead and two others with stab wounds.As forensic teams continued their search for the murder weapon, detectives were investigating reports of an argument with suspects who then fled the flat on the Larner Road estate where the stabbings took place. One teenager remains in a serious condition at the Royal London Hospital, while the other has been discharged.Residents said the block of flats at the centre of London's latest murder inquiry had become a meeting area for gangs and should have been demolished years ago. Others described a gang known as RA, standing for Rebel Assault, which had been terrorising the neighbourhood. Police believe the attack was gang-related.Norman Brennan, of the Knives Destroy Lives Campaign, reiterated his demand for a mandatory five-year prison sentence for anyone who carries a knife unreasonably. His call came as Islington borough police commander Bob Carr called for automatic prison sentences for anyone found carrying a knife.On New Year's Day, 17-year-old Henry Bolombi was also fatally stabbed following an argument. Hours after celebrating the New Year, Bolombi was chased by a group of youths and stabbed in Edmonton, north London.Meanwhile, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith will unveil new plans today to crack down on crime. One initiative will be to outlaw deactivated guns which are converted by criminals into firearms.
