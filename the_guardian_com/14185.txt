Justice ministers are looking at proposals to turn community sentences into intensive programmes that run five days a week and are enforceable by the withdrawal of benefits, in an attempt to create alternatives to prison that are perceived as credible by the public.Facing big budget cuts, Kenneth Clarke, the justice secretary, will publish a green paper on sentencing in the next fortnight which will introduce new private agencies, as opposed to probation services, to enforce tougher community orders.Clarke is eager to reduce the number of people serving short sentences, and Downing Street is determined that the alternative of community sentences should be seen to be tougher.The plan would also include private property among the areas in which work schemes can take place.Under Labour, the former attorney general, Lady Scotland, conducted a pilot on withdrawing benefits if jobless people who were found guilty of offences failed to carry out community orders, but the scheme was not extended.Some of the proposals are expected to be drawn from a new report by the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange. A poll for Policy Exchange showed that 60% of the public still think community sentences are a soft option.More than half of community sentence projects are not completed successfully. There are 240,000 community orders each year, with offenders carrying out more than 11m hours of unpaid work. The use of community sentences has risen by 70% since 1998.Andrew Bridges, the chief inspector of probation since 2004, has approved the use of private sector oversight of community sentences, saying he has no objection in principle to outsourcing.The Policy Exchange report won support from the victims commissioner, Louise Casey, who put forward ideas to toughen community sentences to the last Labour government.Casey, who is known to have the ear of Clarke, warned that the time was "not right for another makeover of community payback," and called for "something a bit more radical that hits the nail on public confidence".She added: "If we take away bad consequences when people commit crime, you make committing crime a very rational choice, so if a fine is not enforced, if community payback is not done in a way that is punitive, and prison is not there, then we as a society are essentially saying to people: 'Commit what you want, because you won't get punished.'She added: "If we want the public to come with us when we say prison is not the only answer to crime, we need to show the other sanctions are tough."In opposition the Tories called for schemes requring offenders to wear orange jackets as a gimmick, but in office there has bene a volte face with a determination to change what is being described as a culture of indifference."
