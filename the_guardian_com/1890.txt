The Wigan striker Marlon King has been ordered to stand trial for allegedly groping and punching a woman in a nightclub. The 29-year-old, who is on loan at Middlesbrough, allegedly attacked the 20-year-old at the Soho Revue bar in London last December.He spoke only to confirm his name and deny two charges when he appeared at a 15-minute plea and directions hearing at Southwark crown court. The first count accused him of sexual assault "by touching". The second claimed he assaulted the woman – who cannot be named for legal reasons – "occasioning her actual bodily harm".It is understood that trial dates were available in August but, as the player's wife is expecting a baby that month, King's five-day trial has been scheduled to start on 26 October.The Jamaica international, from Briarswood Goffs, Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, who was bought by Wigan from Championship side Watford for £5m in January 2008, has been allowed to remain on unconditional bail.
