Shrien Dewani has been detained in a secure mental health hospital, a court has been told.The British businessman, who is accused of ordering his wife's murder on their honeymoon in South Africa, is being compulsorily held at Fromeside Clinic, in Bristol, under the Mental Health Act.He is said to be suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder following the shooting of his bride, Anni Dewani, in Cape Town in November.Although on bail, he will now be virtually imprisoned behind the locked doors, concrete walls and perimeter fence of the hospital, City of Westminster magistrates court, in London, heard."Security is effected by staff – he has no ability to leave," his lawyer, Julian Knowles, told the court during a brief hearing.Dewani, who owns a Bristol care home, was admitted to Fromeside after he was ordered out of the Priory clinic when, according to staff, his behaviour became disruptive and aggressive.South African authorities are seeking to extradite the 31-year-old for his alleged part in the killing.But Knowles indicated that Dewani's legal team would fight this on the grounds of his poor mental health and prison conditions in South Africa.He said: "If it was the case – it plainly is the case – that Mr Dewani is seriously mentally ill and he were sent back to a prison system that simply cannot cope with that level of mental illness, that is a violation of article three [of the European convention of human rights, which prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment]."District judge Howard Riddle renewed Dewani's bail, agreeing that Fromeside's secure environment meant his electronic tag was no longer necessary.A full extradition hearing will begin at Belmarsh magistrates court, in south-east London, on 3 May.The hearing will be split into two parts, with further time allowed for a psychiatric report on Dewani's condition to be carried out.A Dewani family source said: "We're keen that Shrien gets the best treatment to allow him to recover as soon as possible so that his name can be cleared of all these false allegations."
