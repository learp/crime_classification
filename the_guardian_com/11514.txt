Debt collectors linked to General Motors and private equity firm Cabot Square Capital were named yesterday in a court case over the black market in private information stolen from government databases.A private investigator used by companies chasing vehicle hire purchase and bank debtors was convicted at Kingston magistrates court in south-west London. Nicholas Munroe, 32, of west London, conned civil servants into giving home addresses of more than 250 people over the phone. He was convicted of 44 offences of stealing and selling private data in a prosecution brought by Richard Thomas, the information commissioner, and fined £3,200 plus £5,000 costs.The companies say they told the private investigator at the time not to break the law.In a practice known as "blagging", conmen trick employees in banks, call centres and government departments into disclosing private details such as addresses or details of bank accounts, tax returns and mortgages. The blaggers often pretend to be from another section and use jargon and knowledge of computer systems to sound plausible. Prosecutions by Mr Thomas have shown that City law firms and national newspapers have used blaggers.Mr Thomas has persuaded ministers that jail terms are needed to stamp out the trade and wants to prosecute companies that buy the information.Yesterday Phil Taylor, solicitor for the information commissioner, told the court that Munroe was paid £25 for each address, and on one day alone made £6,000 by obtaining 245 addresses through a "few telephone calls". His company, Infofind, had an annual turnover of £100,000.Mr Taylor said Munroe or an employee rang up officials in the Department for Works and Pensions who had access to national insurance and child support databases, posing as a colleague who needed the details for official purposes.On:Line Finance, a hire purchase group based in Cardiff and owned by General Motors, instructed Munroe "to trace a number of outstanding debtors" and Munroe had supplied addresses, the court heard. He was also used by Leeds-based Lowell Group, which buys debts from lenders and is funded by Cabot Square Capital, run by two US merchant bankers, James Clark and John van Deventer.On:Line Finance said it was "most concerned" at the activities and cooperated with the investigation. Lowell Group boss Andrew Bartle said it did not condone Munroe's illegal actions and had stopped outsourcing such work.
