The three young men who killed 16-year-old Ben Kinsella were today given life sentences at the Old Bailey in London.There were cheers from the public gallery as Juress Kika, 19, Jade Braithwaite, 18, and Michael Alleyne, 20, from London, were told they would serve minimum terms of 19 years for killing Ben, the brother of the former EastEnders actor Brooke Kinsella.The judge at the Old Bailey, the Common Serjeant of London Brian Barker, told them: "Your blind and heartless anger that night defies belief."He had in front of him a lifetime of promise. You have taken all that away from him in a brutal, cowardly and totally unjustified attack."There was loud cheering and shouts of "bye bye" from the public gallery, where dozens of Ben's friends and family gathered as the killers were taken down.Kika and Alleyne both turned and jeered, making gestures towards them.Members of the defendants' families exchanged angry words with Ben's friends and relatives in the public gallery before they were led out.Ben and his friends had been to a bar to celebrate the end of their GCSE exams when a row broke out in Islington, north London, on 29 June last year. Although the confrontation had nothing to do with him, Ben was chased along the street with other youngsters and stabbed to death when he stopped running. He was stabbed 11 times in five seconds by the three youths in revenge for the "disrespect" shown to Braithwaite.Lawyers for the defendants told the judge that the killers had been served with letters from the prison authorities following fears of retaliation.The letters, asking inmates to discuss any fears or incidents, are given to prisoners who are likely to be targets of retribution.Prisoners with fears could be placed in solitary confinement for their own safety.Nerida Harford-Bell, defending Braithwaite, said: "Jade Braithwaite understands he is a marked man."She said Braithwaite's mother, grandmother and aunt had either moved or were in the process of moving home. Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC, for Alleyne, said he had also been served with a letter, adding: "It is an unusual step."James Nichol, solicitor advocate for Kika, said of his letter: "It is being taken seriously."All three of the killers had criminal records and were described by police as "depressingly familiar characters".Sentencing the three men, the judge said: "Your behaviour generates outrage in all right-minded people and your blind and heartless anger defies belief."He said there was no suggestion Ben had been involved in the trouble preceding the stabbing and was instead trying to get away when he found himself encircled and attacked."No attempt was made to help him in any way and not a hint of remorse has been shown by any of you."The judge said there was "no possible excuse" for what happened."I can only deduce that in your minds someone had to pay the ultimate price, whoever that might be."What you have done has caused untold anguish," he said."This was a terrible attack and you knew exactly what you were doing and you must take responsibility for your actions."The crime was aggravated by the fact that they picked on "an obviously younger and smaller lone victim", the judge added.After the verdicts were read out, it emerged that Kika had been on the run from police for 10 days after a robbery in which a man was stabbed.After the sentencing, Brooke Kinsella, 25, said: "It's good enough but it is little more than Ben lived, so it is not really enough."Her mother, Deborah, 46, had told the judge: "We had brought Ben up to always walk away from trouble. This sadly cost him his life … He walked away to get safely home and they took advantage of that – he was one boy on his own."We, as his family, have been left devastated and in total despair. Our whole world has been totally turned upside down."
