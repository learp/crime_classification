The best friend of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence today called for Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon to resign in the wake of the publication of the Lawrence report. Duwayne Brooks, who was with Stephen on the night when he was fatally stabbed in Eltham, south London, told a news conference that he thought Home Secretary's Jack Straw's decision to let Sir Paul stay for the time being was totally and utterly wrong.  He said: "When Mr Condon took up the job in 1991 he said he would eradicate racism.  "Today is 1999 and racism is still here and has played a big part in this case and in many others.  "For Jack Straw to say that Mr Condon should stay is totally wrong. I think Mr Condon should do the honourable thing and resign."  The 24-year-old, who has suffered from the last six years from post-traumatic stress disorder, told the news conference in London that he was relieved that the inquiry had admitted that racism was an inherent part of the Metropolitan Police.  He said: "Racism killed my best friend Stephen. Racism also stopped officers from administering first aid whilst he was lying on the pavement.  "Racism also allowed the officers investigating this case to treat me like a suspect and not a witness. "Racism also rubbished our chances of convicting those killers of the murder of Stephen Lawrence. "Racism has also shattered my life. But today I am pleased to say that the inquiry has found without any doubt whatsoever that the way I was treated by the Metropolitan Police during this whole investigation was down to me being black."
