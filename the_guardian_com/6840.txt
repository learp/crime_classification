The leading civil servant at the Home Office at the time the foreign prisoner crisis first surfaced has apologised for failing to spot the scale of the problem.Sir John Gieve, permanent secretary at the department from 2001 to the end of 2005, said the issue had been overlooked because staff and money were being diverted to solving asylum issues, which at the time had a higher profile."Of course there were definite failings in the handling of foreign national prisoners which I very much regret," Sir John told MPs on the Commons home affairs select committee yesterday. "I'm sorry I didn't pick up on this earlier and take a personal interest. Obviously, we didn't spot this one in time and I regret that very much."Sir John said he had not been overly concerned when it emerged in October last year that 400 prisoners had been released without being considered for deportation, because by then he believed the government had devoted the resources to dealing with it.The admissions add further fuel to the controversy surrounding the management of the Home Office, and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) in particular. They also suggest that targets set by Tony Blair to tackle asylum played a part in distorting the department's priorities.In April it emerged that 1,023 prisoners had been released without being considered for deportation over seven years. Tony Blair sacked Charles Clarke as home secretary after a public outcry.Sir John, who moved to become a deputy governor of the Bank of England, had a difficult relationship with Mr Clarke. Sir David Normington, who had been Mr Clarke's permanent secretary at the Department for Education and Skills, took over at the Home Office in January.Sir John said the government "lost control" of asylum in the late 1990s.In further evidence to the committee, Stephen Boys Smith, head of the IND from 1998 to 2002, said the unit had been "run down" from 1995 onwards. There had been only 100-150 experienced asylum caseworkers to deal with a backlog of 100,000.Last week the current head of the IND, Lin Homer, said it would take "years, not months" to sort out the directorate. It had suffered "a near classic case of demand outstripping supply", with casework run by junior managers.At least 200 of the 1,023 prisoners who have had their cases reconsidered after the controversy surfaced are to be allowed to stay.John Reid, the new home secretary, told the committee last month that his department was "not fit for purpose" and "averse to a culture of personal responsibility, technologically ill-equipped for an era of mass migration and led by officials that are incapable of producing facts or figures that remain accurate for even a short period of time".
