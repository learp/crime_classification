The commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Sir Ian Blair, has been asked to report on whether his officers did enough to investigate an attack on a young father which took place previously to him being shot dead in east London this week.The call from the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) is one of three separate investigations that have been begun into the police's handling of the case.Peter Woodhams, aged 22, a television engineer from Canning Town, east London, was shot dead on Monday evening after he had confronted a gang of youths who had harassed him. His family say that he had previously been attacked last January by a group of youths who held him down, stabbed him in the neck, and slashed him across the face when he remonstrated with them for throwing a brick at his car.His fiancee, Jane Bowden, 23, who has a son Sam, aged three, has claimed she rang police after the stabbing, but that they did little to investigate.In a statement issued yesterday, the MPA offered its condolences to the family and stated that they had asked the commissioner to "report fully ... on both incidents and investigations relating to Mr Woodhams."The statement added: "We will want to know how police responded to the earlier stabbing incident in January when Mr Woodhams was allegedly attacked with a knife, and whether the handling of that incident had any bearing on his murder."Aneeta Prem, the MPA member with responsibility for the Newham area, said: "We will be asking the commissioner for a detailed report into all aspects of this case so that it is clear how police responded to the earlier stabbing, and what bearing that may or may not have had on Mr Woodhams's murder."The Metropolitan police's directorate of professional standards is also conducting an inquiry. Last night, the Independent Police Complaints Commission announced that it, too, was carrying out the third inquiry.On the night of the killing, it is understood that Mr Woodhams was driving his black Ford Focus when he was involved in a dispute with youths near his home. He told a family member about the argument when he returned home. He then left the house, and soon after was shot fatally in the chest. Local police have denied that the area is out of control.The officer heading the investigation, Detective Chief Inspector Ian Stevenson, called for anyone who had information to come forward. "I'm appealing for anyone who saw the victim or his vehicle near the shops to contact the incident room. I'm also particularly keen to speak with anyone who witnessed the shooting, or sightings of suspects running away."A 14-year-old youth, who was arrested on Wednesday, has been released on bail. The murder inquiry is running separately from the three inquiries into the Woodhams family's complaints, which will include claims they were constantly harassed by a gang who behaved in a threatening way towards the family.A spokeswoman for the MPA said it was unusual for a report to be requested from the commissioner in this way, and it reflected the serious concern about the circumstances of the murder.Other reports have been requested in the cases of the fatal shooting of the Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes last year, and the unsolved murder of the south London private detective, Daniel Morgan, she said.David Petch, the IPCC commissioner, said his organisation was responding because of the considerable public concern. He added: "It is vital that Mr Woodhams's family, the police involved, and the public at large can have confidence that their concerns about the initial incident will be robustly investigated."He said that the family had not yet made a formal complaint to the IPCC, which can initiate its own inquiries.Jim Fitzpatrick, MP for Poplar and Canning Town, urged the Metropolitan police to quickly conclude its own investigation, running parallel to the IPCC inquiry, into their handling of the January stabbing.Mr Woodhams's grieving family, including three-year-old Sam, deserved an urgent response to their concerns, he said.
