Back in December I posted this blog about an interview I did for an anarchist radio show called the Circled A show.I posted it as it seemed to be quite a good overview of the controversy of how police have sent undercover spies into political groups since 1968.The first part of the interview can be found here, with a guide here to the running order of topics under discussion. This also has some background on the Circled A show and Resonance FM, the radio station on which it is broadcast.I recorded the interview last year, and although a lot has happened since then, it still seems worth posting a blog about the second and third parts of the interview.These last two parts can be found here. As before, it is quite a long interview so I have given a guide to the order of subjects we talked about, starting with the second part:* whether there are still undercover spies deployed in political groups at the moment and whether the spies are still having intimate relationships with the people they have been sent to spy on. (Britain's most senior police officer, Bernard Hogan-Howe, is - according to this - not sure that his spies have stopped sleeping with their targets);* how police and campaigners are constantly trying to outwit each other over the unmasking of undercover spies;* how suspected police infiltrator Rod Richardson appears to have adopted the identity of a baby who died two days after being born;* how ex-police spy Peter Francis has disclosed what he did undercover, compared to Mark Kennedy who has yet to tell the truth of his secret mission;* how police sent Francis and other spies to infiltrate the groups that were campaigning for a proper investigation into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence;* how police chiefs threatened to prosecute Francis on several occasions for breaking the official secrets act;* can the public trust the police to investigate themselves over the allegations of misconduct by the undercover spies;* how Bob Lambert is alleged to have set fire to a Debenhams store when he was undercover and whether he may have been authorised to do so;* how Lambert skilfully obtained vital intelligence to enable police to capture an animal rights activist, Geoff Sheppard, without arousing any suspicion against himself;* how Kennedy spied abroad in countries such as Germany, Iceland and Denmark and police exchanged intelligence across borders;* the motivations of Kennedy and how campaigners managed to unmask him and other undercover spies.The third part of the interview is here :* the undercover infiltration of right-wing groups such as Combat 18;* the differences between undercover officers who infiltrate political groups (to collect intelligence) and those who penetrate serious criminal gangs (to gather evidence);* the infiltration of anarchist groups such as Class War, and the reasons for the establishment of the National Public Order Intelligence Unit in the late 1990s;* What is the justification for the deployment of undercover spies in political groups;* the trauma suffered by women who subsequently discovered that their long-term partners were police officers;* the stress, pressure and confusion experienced by the undercover officers and the neglect of their mental welfare by their superiors;* the police's policy of neither confirming nor denying the identities of undercover spies and how the parents of dead children whose identities were stolen by the police officers will never be told the truth.Interspersed in the interview are songs including Baby, I'm an Anarchist! and Junior Murvin's Police and Thieves.And to finish, I would like to thank Yodet and Janey from the Circle A show for taking the trouble to interview me.
