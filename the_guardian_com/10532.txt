The husband of one of Harold Shipman's alleged murder victims told Preston crown court yesterday how the doctor contacted him by mobile phone to say his wife had died.Jean Lilley, 59, was the only woman of 15 alleged victims who was married at the time of her death in April 1997. Shipman, 53, of Mottram, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, denies murdering the women and forging the will of one of his alleged victims. Alfred Lilley said Shipman told him that he had been with his wife "for quite a while" and had claimed he had been trying to persuade her to go to hospital, but she would not go. Shipman had told him: "She won't go because you're not here." Mr Lilley said his wife had every faith in doctors. When he left her at 5am on the morning of her death to go to work, she had been suffering from a cold. Mrs Lilley's neighbour Elizabeth Hunter found her neighbour's body within moments of the doctor leaving her home. Mrs Hunter found her friend sitting in a chair. She said he didn't seem surprised about her friend's death. Home office pathologist John Rutherford told the court that Mrs Lilley had died from a lethal dose of morphine. The case continues today.
