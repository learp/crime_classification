A violent and controlling cricketer who walked free from court after he beat his wife with a cricket bat and made her drink bleach, could face an investigation over claims that he perverted the course of justice.Mustafa Bashir, 34, was spared prison despite forcing his wife to drink bleach, throttling her in public, and hitting her with his bat. He admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was given an 18-month prison term.But the decision by the judge, Richard Mansell QC, to suspend the sentence for two years and order Bashir to instead attend a workshop entitled “building better relationships” provoked outrage from pressure groups and politicians.Attorney general urged to review release of man who beat wife with cricket bat Speaking to the BBC, Bashir’s ex-wife said she was “disappointed in the comments which the judge made about my vulnerability”.She added: “I am a confident and strong woman because of what I have suffered. I was suffering for my life but the judge didn’t believe me.”Bashir’s lenient sentence was partially due to the court being told that he would sign a contract with Leicestershire County Cricket Club if he was spared jail.But it is now being suggested that Bashir could have misled the judge after the Leicestershire club stated that it was “bemused” by the claim and said that any suggestion that it had offered Bashir a contract was “completely false”; the club had never spoken to him or an agent, nor offered him a contract.Bashir, who was also ordered to pay £1,000 costs and banned him from contacting his wife, Fakhara Karim, could have given false instructions to his barrister over the claim.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is considering whether to apply for a review of the sentence in light of the new information from Leicestershire.The crown court has the power to alter a sentence within 56 days of the date it was made, under the 56-day “slip rule”. The maximum sentence that can be imposed for perverting the course of justice is life imprisonment. There is also the option of a fine or community order. However, the CPS sentencing guidelines recommend a prison sentence of between four and 36 months.A top barrister has commented on the verdict in a blog post. Writing under the pseudonym The Secret Barrister, the lawyer said: “If I were Mr Bashir I would be worried.”The lawyer said Bashir could face the same predicament as the Sledden brothers, two drug dealers who received suspended sentences but were hauled back into court after celebrating their near miss by inviting the judge on Facebook to, inter alia, “suck my cock”.The lawyer wrote: “The court of appeal has made plain, as recently as last year, that it is proper for this [the 56-day slip rule] to be exercised where subsequent to the sentence hearing something arises which casts doubt over the veracity of the basis on which the judge sentenced. “In the widely reported case of the Sledden brothers, the judge said that had she known of the defendants’ true lack of remorse for their offending she would have sent them straight to prison. Which is what, under the slip rule, she did. The court of appeal duly upheld her decision.“HHJ Mansell QC, no slouch from what I’m told by Manchester practitioners, will be keenly aware of this. Do not be surprised if, when this is brought to his attention, Mr Bashir finds himself facing a further day in court, with a far less fortuitous outcome.”The lawyer later went on to suggest that Bashir could face a fresh charge of perverting the course of justice.Bashir met Karim in their native Pakistan and married her in 2013. The court heard that he berated her for wearing western clothing, tried to turn her against her own family, would call her a “slag” when she went out with her female friends, and repeatedly beat her.The court was told that Bashir once struck Karim over her back with his cricket bat because he felt she spent too long talking to a friend on the phone, saying: “If I hit you with this bat with my full power then you would be dead.”On another occasion, Bashir, who plays in a local cricket league in Oldham, Greater Manchester, forced his wife to take tablets and drink bleach, and told her to kill herself during an argument concerned with his going on a cricket tour to the Netherlands.Karim eventually went to the police and said: “I did fear for my life; he told me he was going to kill me.”However, Mansell said he was “not convinced she was a vulnerable person”.The suspended sentence was condemned by campaign groups, who accused Mansell of “perpetuating damaging myths” about domestic violence only happening to “poor families on council estates”.Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, said she would raise the case with the attorney general and justice secretary. She was joined by Greater Manchester’s interim mayor and police and crime commissioner, Tony Lloyd.Lloyd said: “Very few of us will agree with the judge’s comments about the vulnerability of the victim. All of us are vulnerable at some point in our lives and anyone can become a victim of abuse – men and women. Domestic abuse does not discriminate and neither should the criminal justice system. Justice must be done, and must be seen to be done – and in this case justice has failed.”The attorney general’s office said it would not be able to intervene in Bashir’s case as it had the power only to call for a review in a “limited number of offences”. But a spokesman added: “The government is currently looking to extend the scope of the Unduly Lenient Scheme, so a wider range of sentences can be challenged.”
