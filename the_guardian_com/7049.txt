A cocaine-addicted policeman who masterminded a series of cashpoint raids to fund his £600-a-week habit was jailed for six years yesterday. Jason Singh, 23, an officer with Northumbria police, led a team who attacked ATMs with power tools in well-planned raids across Tyne and Wear.Newcastle crown court heard how Singh also used confidential information from a police computer to target a vulnerable woman's £30,000 savings.Singh, of Dunston, Gateshead, was a promising footballer who, until the age of 18, was signed up by Newcastle United, said Tony Hawks, defending. He turned to crime to feed his addictions after being unable to cope with the pressures of his work at South Shields police station.The gang was caught after a series of attacks on ATM machines in the Gateshead area from November 2005. The spree, which netted £13,000, was thwarted by police after a botched strike in December 2005. Singh was arrested after an undercover investigation by Northumbria police, during which his car was bugged.Singh appeared with his brother Craig, 20, Mark MacDonald, 26, Shane Faife, 25, Justin Brown, 28, Joseph McDonald, 27, and Peter Chisholm, 27, all from the Tyneside area. They pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal on the day their trial was due to begin. Jason Singh, Brown and MacDonald also admitted conspiracy to steal cash from a vulnerable woman.Passing sentence, Judge Esmond Faulks told the PC: "The public is entitled to expect the highest standards of its police officers. You have let everybody down."Craig Singh was sentenced to 12 months in a young offenders' institution. Mark MacDonald was jailed for 4½ years; Brown for three and a half years, and Faife and Chisholm for two years each. Joseph McDonald will be sentenced on Friday.
