A key suspect in the rape and murders of two teenage women who were found bound and gagged was a "shifty" man who did not like policemen, a former beat constable told a jury in Edinburgh yesterday.John Rafferty, 50, said he had seen the two 17-year-olds in Edinburgh's Old Town on October 15 1977, the last night they were seen alive.At the trial of Angus Sinclair, 62, Mr Rafferty said he had been on patrol when he helped one of the two victims, Christine Eadie, after she slipped and fell with a "thud" outside the World's End pub.As he tried to steady her, another woman came out of a crowd to help her. He became aware of another man watching him silently."I assumed he was with the girls," Mr Rafferty said. "He wasn't making any kind of eye contact. He was looking away from me. Having been a police officer for a number of years, I felt this person was a bit shifty with me."You get the impression when you are a police officer that some people don't like police officers and the way this chap was looking at me, he didn't like police officers." Joined by a second man, he then walked off with the t wo teenagers.The bodies of Ms Eadie and her close friend Helen Scott were found the next day some eight miles apart in East Lothian. Both women had been raped and strangled with their own clothes.Sinclair, 62, denies raping and murdering the teenagers, and has blamed the man police allege was his accomplice, his now dead brother-in-law Gordon Hamilton, who was then 22, for the murders.Sinclair also claims the women consented to sexual intercourse. The trial continues.
