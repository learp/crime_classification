A Premier League footballer confronted by police officers as he looked in a jeweller's shop window suggested yesterday he was targeted because he was black.Victor Anichebe, a Â£15,000-a-week Everton striker, was met by police officers while window shopping with a friend near his home in Knutsford, Cheshire.The 20-year-old Nigerian international, who said officers accused him of attempted robbery while outside PR Jones on Wednesday, also said one officer had tried to take away his crutches to prevent him from escaping and handcuffed his friend. He said that, despite an apology, he was "deeply upset and very angry"."Both myself and my friend, Lee, were accused, by Cheshire police officers, of 'attempted theft'. Sadly, even when I explained who I was and what I was doing, they continued to treat both of us as not just suspects but as criminals. I am currently having to use crutches to walk as I recently underwent surgery and, astonishingly, one of the officers even tried to grab the crutches in order to prevent me from 'escaping'. "While I do not wish to turn this unfortunate and unnecessary incident into a race issue, I believe it is a question which does need to be asked."Police were called after CCTV operators reported the men "acting suspiciously".Sean Reynolds, a phone shop director in the town, said police had been heavy-handed and that bystanders looked confused as to why the footballer was being questioned and detained." In a later apology, Cheshire police said the applying of handcuffs was less than a proportionate reaction. Cheshire police said they would be meeting Anichebe to resolve any further concerns.
