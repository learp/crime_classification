A pub chef and his manager have both been jailed after a Christmas dinner served at their restaurant left a mother dead and dozens of other diners ill with food poisoning.Mehmet Kaya and Ann-Marie McSweeney, the chef and manager of the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch, Essex, were jailed at Snaresbrook crown court for 12 months and 18 months respectively for perverting the course of justice.Mitchells & Butlers, the chain which owned the pub, was fined £1.5m after being found guilty of placing unsafe food on the market.Kaya and McSweeney both lied to police, hindering the investigation by forging records relating to the cooking of turkey meat.Mother-of-one Della Callagher, 46, died two days after eating the four-course Christmas meal at the pub in December 2012, which left a further 33 people ill.Havering council carried out a year-long investigation into the incident which found the food poisoning was caused by Clostridium perfringens bacteria and that the turkey meat was either not cooked adequately or not reheated properly.The court heard that on Christmas Day 2012 the pub put on a lunch for 128 customers.But turkey meat prepared the day before was not cooled properly after it was cooked, and then was not adequately reheated before it was served to guests.Diners were left with food poisoning and two days later Callagher died.The court was told that food safety records had not been filled in, and so McSweeney, of Hornchurch, Essex, who had worked at the hotel for 24 years, concocted a plan for her and Kaya to falsify them.The pair “covered their own backs” by retrospectively filling out false due diligence logs over the cooking, cooling and reheating of the meat before environmental health inspectors could carry out an investigation.Andrew Campbell-Tiech QC, prosecuting, told the court it was “highly likely that other food-related records were fabricated”.Sentencing the pair, judge Alastair Hammerton said the evidence had revealed “systematic failings” in record keeping at the Railway Hotel, saying: “I am satisfied that when the decision to fabricate records was reached, both of you suspected that inadequate care had been taken by someone in respect of storage and/or cooling and/or cooking of turkeys that was to be served on Christmas Day.”
