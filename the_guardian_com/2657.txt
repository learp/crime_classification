Victims of serious crimes will be given their own lawyers to represent them in court, Labour pledged today.The move would be a significant change in the way trials operate in England and Wales, with barristers able to speak up for victims' rights during a trial.A Labour spokesman said "victims' advocates" would be able to appear in murder cases - on behalf of the dead person's next of kin - and to represent the victim in rape cases.Poorer victims or their next of kin could have their legal teams funded by legal aid, while those who did not qualify for legal aid could pay for an advocate themselves.The advocates could be extended to other crimes later, the spokesman said. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer of Thoroton QC, said: "Labour is on the side of victims of crime - and for the first time Labour will make sure that victims and their families will have the right to be represented in court. "A voice for victims will rebalance the way serious cases like murder and rape are tried, so that the courts take fully into account the victims' view."The advocates would be able to advise the victims or their families about the case, and even object to a defence lawyer's aggressive questioning of a victim in a rape case, for example. The Labour spokesman said: "The crucial point is to establish that these people have the right to be represented. "At the moment everybody in court has a lawyer, apart from the person the crime was committed against." He said the measure was likely to require a change in the law but it was not yet clear whether a bill would be necessary. The cost of the proposal was "a substantial figure, but not great in overall public spending terms". "This is a significant change and we want to apply it to the cases where the difficulties are most harsh," he added. There were 853 recorded murders, manslaughters and infanticides in 2003-04 - but it is impossible to know in how many cases victims' families would qualify for legal aid.There were 13,247 recorded rapes in the same period, which could amount to a significant demand on the legal aid budget under the proposals.
