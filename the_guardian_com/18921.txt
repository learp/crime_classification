A 35-year-old married man stood for eight minutes in a Dewsbury court yesterday while he was formally accused of the murder of a Leeds University student, Jacqueline Hill.Miss Hill, aged 20, from Middlesborough, was found dead at 10am on Tuesday, November 18, in Alma Road, Headingley, at the rear of the Arndale Centre in Leeds, near students' flats. The man, Peter William Sutcliffe, a lorry driver, of Garden Lane, Heaton, Bradford, was brought into the court room packed with nearly 100 journalists at 4.58pm. He had been driven from the local police cells through a crowd of more than 1000 people shouting and jeering. A police cordon was placed around the court buildings.The accused also faced a further charge of stealing two car number plates valued at 50p in Mirifeld, between November 13 last year and January 2 this year. Reporting restrictions were not lifted.Mr Maurice Shaffner, the county prosecuting solicitor, said that the accused man was not legally represented. He asked the magistrate, Mr John Walker, to remand him in custody for eight days. After the hearing pressmen were not allowed to leave the court building until the van carrying Sutcliffe had left the area.Police at Wakefield, West Yorkshire, last night refused to disclose where he was being held. Hundreds of people began gathering outside the court building early yesterday morning. They braved bitingly cold weather to push forward, stand on walls opposite the court, and climb on nearby buildings to gain a better view. Their numbers were equalled by the police officers who at times stood three and four deep around the court building. Missiles were thrown as Sutcliffe with a blanket over his head was rushed out of a police van which had been escorted to the court by a convoy of police cars. Journalists were called out individually to enter the court building and had to sign in before taking a seat in court.
