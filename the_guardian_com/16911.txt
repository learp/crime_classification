It is hard to understand why Gordon Brown invested so much political capital in last night's vote on 42 days pre-charge detention when the power will be of marginal use to police investigating serious terrorist plots.Ministers emphasised the precautionary nature of the legislation when they argued that the power to hold a suspect for six weeks at Paddington Green high security police station would hardly, if ever, be used. In practice this means that when the counter-terrorism bill reaches the statute book the police will have an extra fortnight to question someone arrested on suspicion of a serious terrorist offence before they are required to either charge or release them.Although Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, yesterday stressed the exceptional nature of the circumstances needed to trigger the use of the new power, once it is on the statute book the police will have an extra fortnight "in their back pocket". There is a danger that once the police have the power they will use it and it will become routine.Britain has gone down the slope of pre-charge detention rapidly. It was the Terrorism Act 2000 that allowed terror suspects to be held for 48 hours, extendable to seven days with the permission of a judge. That was doubled to 14 days in 2003 and doubled again to 28 days in 2006. Now that 42 days is heading to the statute book it can be expected the police will come back again after the next election to press the case for 56 days or more.Other countries that have suffered from terrorist attacks manage with far less. The US has a two-day limit; Spain five days and Turkey seven and a half days. The amount of political capital invested in 42 days is also surprising given the other contents of the bill. The director of public prosecutions has said a new "threshold test" which allows charges to be brought on the basis of suspicion make the 42-day power unnecessary. The bill's provisions to allow post-charge questioning appear to reduce the need for it even further.
