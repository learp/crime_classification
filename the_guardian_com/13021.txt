A gang of three vigilantes were handed life sentences yesterday for brutally beating to death a suspected paedophile at a village bus stop.Daniel Poole, 21, was jailed for a minimum of 13 years and two months, his uncle Steven Poole, 37, was jailed for at least 11 years and two months and Richard Greyham, 31, was told he must serve at least 12 years and two months for their part in the murder of Matthew Murray in their Derbyshire village. All three were found guilty by unanimous verdicts last week of murdering father of three Mr Murray, 39, in Stretton, Derbyshire, last July. The three neighbours from Mickley, near Alfreton, "took the law into their own hands" after rumours spread that Mr Murray had sexually assaulted a young girl. Sentencing the three at Nottingham crown court yesterday, Mr Justice Gage said: "The motive for this assault was a belief by all of you that Murray had sexually assaulted a young girl but that is no excuse for what you did." Mr Murray, who was staying at the home of his ex-wife's father in Mickleover, was first attacked in the house by the two Pooles and Daniel Poole's then girlfriend, Michelle Warriner. She was jailed for eight months on one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Almost three hours after the first assault, Mr Murray was waiting at a bus stop when he was subjected to the fatal attack. Mr Murray was punched, kicked and stamped on with such force that he suffered 51 injuries and died when his heart was ruptured. The three men then drove off, leaving him at the side of the road, where motorists pulled over to help. During the trial the three men had tried to pass the blame for the death on to each other. Steven Poole, who lost a leg in a motorcycle accident as a young man, had told the court that he could not have struck the fatal blow because of his disability.
