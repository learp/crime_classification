The justice secretary, Jack Straw, apologised today for failing to disclose the reason why Jon Venables, one of the two killers of James Bulger, has been sent back to prison, but he said it would not be in the public interest for him to do so.Venables, now 27 and living under a new identity, was put back in jail last week after breaching parole, the Ministry of Justice confirmed earlier.Venables and Robert Thompson were both 10 when they took two-year-old James from a shopping centre in Liverpool, beat him with bricks and an iron bar and dumped his body on a railway line.The killers, who were playing truant from school, walked James around the streets of Liverpool for more than two miles, stopping occasionally to kick and punch him. They told adults who intervened that he was their brother.The Ministry of Justice has refused to say what Venables did to breach his licence and whether it involved violence or any other criminal act. But the government has come under pressure from James's mother, Denise Fergus, and the detective who led the murder investigation to release the details to the public. In an interview on Sky News, the home secretary, Alan Johnson, said the public "have a right to know and I believe they will know all the facts in due course".But Straw said: "I am sorry that I cannot give more information at this stage on the matter of the alleged breach."He added: "There are good reasons to withhold this information and that's in the public interest."The justice secretary said he could "fully understood the frustration" felt by the public over the lack of information. At one point during the interview Straw said James's parents had been told details of Venables's breach before he was corrected by someone off camera and had to clarify that they had not been told.He said it was "too early" to say whether James's killers had been released too early but added: "It's well known that I was, as home secretary, reluctant to see either Thompson or Venables released at the stage when they were released."Straw was forced to refer the decision on their release to the then lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, after a ruling by the European court of human rights.Johnson said more details would be released. "At this juncture I can say nothing more than confirm that Jon Venables is back in custody," he told Sky News."I believe the public do have a right to know and I believe they will know all the facts in due course. But I must in no way prejudice the future criminal justice proceedings," he added.Venables will appear before a hearing of the Parole Board to consider the reason for recall. This is expected to happen within 28 days of his recall last week.The hearing, before a three person panel including a judge, will rule whether he should stay in prison or be released.The outcome of such hearings is not usually made public.But a spokesman for the Parole Board said it was likely the result would be released because of the high profile nature of the case.Albert Kirby, the detective who headed the Bulger investigation, said there "must have been a build-up of incidents" for Venables to be put back in jail and it was unlikely to have been for a minor infringement of his licence conditions."They wouldn't – using football parlance – have given him a red card and go to prison for one infringement," he told Sky News."It would help to clarify and put this to rest once and for all if the public did have some indication of what it is he has done."Kirby said the recall posed the question: "Did the authorities fail in making the assessments of his suitability to come back into society?"Last night, Fergus, 42, said on her Twitter account: "Would like to let everyone know Jon Venables is where he belongs tonight, behind bars. Is this my son's justice." A spokesman for her said: "Denise has always said she did not believe that it was safe to parole Venables and Thompson at 18, before they had ever spent a day in an adult prison."She believes this breach of parole shows that she was right … But she believes that she and the public have a right to know what Venables has done and what is to be done with him now he is an adult offender."The conditions placed on the killers after their release included that they did not contact each other and stayed away from the Liverpool area.They were convicted after a trial at Preston crown court and ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, the usual sentence for life imprisonment when the offender is a juvenile.The trial judge, Mr Justice Morland, told the pair they had committed a crime of "unparalleled evil and barbarity".CCTV images of James's abduction were seared into the nation's consciousness, with the pictures showing the toddler being led away by the hand.On their release, the pair were given new homes, new passports and new national insurance and social security documents. The media were gagged from revealing their new identities or where they lived.Yesterday evening's statement announcing Venables's recall to prison was made by the government before his breach of his licence conditions was revealed by a newspaper.David Blunkett, who in 2001 as home secretary told the House of Commons of the Parole Board's decision to release Venables, said: "It is with great regret that I have learned of the breach – but it is a great credit to the professionals undertaking the supervision and the continuing follow-through work that action has been taken and the original terms enforced."
