Harold Shipman's suicide 'could not have been predicted or prevented', according to a report published today, although the government watchdog nevertheless criticised officers' treatment of Britain's most prolific serial killer.The mass murderer's suicide at the high-security Wakefield prison in West Yorkshire in January 2004 raised serious concerns about how prison staff dealt with the former GP in the weeks prior to his death, said the prisons and probation ombudsman, Stephen Shaw.Mr Shaw said the procedures for dealing with at-risk prisoners such as Shipman needed to be re-examined.He specifically criticised the withdrawal of Shipman's privileges in the weeks before he killed himself, which meant he could no longer afford to ring his wife Primrose. A prison doctor described the killer as "very emotional" and "close to tears".Shipman's privileges had been dropped from standard to basic because he refused to take part in offending behaviour courses in which inmates are encouraged to discuss their crimes and admit their guilt.The ombudsman rejected claims that prison officers had taunted Shipman into killing himself. But he added: "I am critical of the fact that staff at Wakefield do not appear to have been alerted to the man's long-term risk of suicide or what might finally trigger it."Shipman killed himself while serving 15 life sentences for murder. He had only served four years. Some families of victims said they felt "cheated" and were angry at prison authorities because the mass murderer had been able to take his own life.The doctor, who killed at least 250 of his patients over 23 years, made a ligature out of bed sheets and hanged himself from his cell window. His body was found at 6.10am on January 13 2004, the day before his 58th birthday.The ombudsman's report criticised record-keeping at Wakefield prison, which meant exact timings for the sequence of events leading up to Shipman's death could not be established.He also said instructions for entering the cells of high-level category A prisoners at night were "not clearly understood by staff".His report said prison staff continued trying to resuscitate Shipman for approximately half an hour despite "clear indications that the man was dead". They then failed to call an ambulance, and a doctor did not arrive until nearly two hours after the body was discovered.Mr Shaw said: "I am critical both of the failure to call paramedics and the delay in contacting the doctor.But he added: "I have no reason to believe the doctor could have got to the prison any faster, however, as he lived on the other side of Leeds."The ombudsman said it was "extremely regrettable" that the jail had the wrong next of kin details for Shipman and that his wife found out about her husband's death from a family member who heard it on the radio.
