Police in Manchester arrested two people today in connection with the murder of a mother and her three children in their home.Police said they arrested a 35-year-old woman at around 7am in a house in Burnage on the outskirts of Manchester, and later a 40-year-old man. They are both being held on suspicion of murder, Detective Superintendent Martin Bottomley told a news conference this afternoon. Uzma Rahan, 32, was killed along with her sons Adam, 11, Abbas, 8, and daughter Henne, 6.Det Supt Bottomley said postmortem examinations found that all four died as a result of head injuries."I would like to stress that we are still looking for Rahan Arshad, who left the country around July 29. We will be liaising with our colleagues internationally to trace him. I would ask anyone who has seen him since July 29 to contact the incident room."Officers were called to their end-of-terrace house in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, on Sunday after neighbours noticed flies buzzing around the letterbox and complained of a "stomach-churning" smell. It is thought that the bodies may have lain in the building undiscovered for at least a month.Police on Monday night discovered a BMW 320 sports car belonging to the children's father, Mr Arshad, in a car park at Heathrow Airport, where it had been parked for several weeks.It is thought Mr Arshad, who is believed to have worked for a taxi firm in the Manchester suburb of Didsbury, may be in Pakistan, where he has relatives.Yesterday, a yellow and white tent and a mobile incident room remained outside the family home, and neighbours and friends had laid flowers by a side wall.Police said the family had lived in the house for about 18 months. It is thought that Mrs Rahan, who was born in Pakistan, and her British-born husband had married in Manchester in 1993. Mr Bottomley said officers were in contact with members of both families, but had not yet spoken directly to relatives in Pakistan. Mr Arshad's brother lives in Heald Green, less than a mile from the murder scene, but declined to speak to reporters yesterday.
