A man who amassed one of the largest collections of child pornography found in the UK was jailed for a minimum of four and half years yesterday and banned from using the internet for life.Michael Knapinski, 57, from Forest Hill, south-east London, had more than 480,000 images of children on his computer and almost 2,000 videos, including one of a baby who was just a few months old.At Woolwich crown court yesterday, Judge Philip Norris told Knapinski that child pornography was as much an addiction to him as narcotics would be to a habitual drug user."That means there is a significant risk to members of the public as well as a real risk of causing psychological harm to internet users," the judge added.The divorced freelance draughtsman first came to police attention after German police passed on information gleaned from their own investigation into child pornography.He had pleaded guilty at earlier hearings to 29 counts, including 25 of making indecent images of children, two counts of distributing indecent images and one of perverting the course of justice.Yesterday the judge told Knapinski, a father of two, that there were a number of aggravating features in his case.The first was that while on bail he had continued to collect more images of children that he stored on a hard drive which he then hid in a vacuum cleaner bag. When he was later remanded in custody, he asked a friend to dispose of the incriminating evidence, although police learned about what he had done and recovered the new material.Another disturbing feature of the case, according to the judge, was that following Knapinski's arrest, he went online to warn other child porn collectors that he had been "busted."The judge added that because of the seriousness of his crimes and the potential risk he posed to the public, Knapinski faced an indeterminate sentence.He said that Knapinski would definitely not be released for at least four and a half years, but added that there was no guarantee that he would regain his freedom then, adding that in theory he could spend the rest of his life behind bars.Just before ordering Knapinski to be taken to the cells, the judge warned him that he would not only be banned from ever using the internet again, but also that he would never be allowed to work with children.Outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Dave Marshall welcomed the sentence which he described as "fantastic".He added: "This is a very specialised area of work, and credit should go to those dedicated officers who spent hours viewing the images in order to support this successful prosecution."DCI Marshall paid special tribute to the Metropolitan police's child abuse investigation command unit, which collected the evidence for the prosecution.
