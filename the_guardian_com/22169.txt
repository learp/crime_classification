A radical initiative to bring London's soaring street crime under control appears to be working, with dramatic falls recorded in recent figures from the Metropolitan police.There was a 13% drop in street crime in the 12 weeks up to May 29, compared with the 12 week period before. Year on year, the figures are also beginning to improve. In the first week of June last year, almost 1,400 incidents were reported. This year the figure was 1,116, a 14.6% drop. The Met is predicting further falls across London over the coming months. If the trend continues, the force will meet the prime minister's pledge to bring street crime "under control" by the end of September, though senior officers admit the operation has strained resources to the limit. "It's tough, but this is non-negotiable," said the Met's assistant commissioner, Mike Todd. "We are not going to let up. We are convinced we are getting on top of street crime." Street crime across London increased by 38% in the year to April 2002, a fourth annual rise which prompted the prime minister to convene the cabinet's civil contingencies committee, known as Cobra, to discuss ways of beating the problem. In February, the Met launched Operation Safer Streets in the capital's nine worst affected boroughs; it extended the scheme to another six boroughs in April. By diverting staff from other duties, the Met has been able to flood the 15 boroughs with 2,000 officers working solely on curbing street crime. Mr Todd said that "hot-spotting" the worst areas on a week by week basis had enabled the Met to focus resources where they were needed, so that crimes were not being displaced from one patch to another. "We are not planning to extend the safer streets project beyond the 15 boroughs, but if we had to, we would," said Mr Todd, who is in overall charge of the Met's territorial policing strategy.
