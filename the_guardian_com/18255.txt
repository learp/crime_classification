A lorry driver who killed a police officer when his truck strayed on to the hard shoulder of a motorway has been jailed for two years and nine months.Andrew Abernethy's truck left the M1 near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, trapping PC Mark Goodlad between his police car and another vehicle, Leeds crown court heard. Goodlad was helping a stranded woman motorist with a flat tyre.A judge heard that Abernethy, 45, of Rembrandt Walk, Oldham, was driving an orange Scania articulated lorry that hit PC Goodlad's marked BMW X5 police car and a grey Suzuki Swift on the southbound carriageway of the M1, near the village of Crigglestone, in October last year.The police car and the Suzuki were both stationary on the hard shoulder and officers said Goodlad, 41, was between the two vehicles, helping the 51-year-old woman, Sharon Burgess. Abernethy admitted causing death by dangerous driving.Judge Scott Wolstenholme heard that Abernethy, who worked for a parcel firm in the Oldham area, set off from work with a load of bedding an hour before the collision. The defendant told police he "lost momentary concentration" because he felt he had something in his eye and took his glasses off to try to remove the problem.Police investigators believed the accident showed signs that Abernethy had fallen asleep at the wheel. But with no other evidence to support this theory, the judge said he had to sentence on the basis of the defendant's version of events.Prosecutors said the lapse of concentration was not momentary. Andrew Dallas, prosecuting, said a detailed investigation showed the lorry travelled down the hard shoulder for between 120 and 250 metres, which translated to between 4.8 and 10 seconds. Dallas said this showed "prolonged and complete inattention to the road ahead".The prosecutor said: "He drifted on to the hard shoulder and stayed there, notwithstanding the highly conspicuous obstruction ahead of it."The court heard that Goodlad had pulled Burgess over to tell her about her flat tyre. He began to help her change the tyre and was leaning into her boot when the lorry struck his patrol car, which was displaying its emergency lights.Burgess suffered a glancing blow which resulted in minor injuries but the judge was told she also suffered severe psychological problems following the crash.Judge Wolstenholme said to Abernethy: "You hadn't been paying attention to the road for a considerable period of time in driving terms, all the while, trundling along in that enormous truck at 50mph."He said it would have been "obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving in that way would be dangerous".As well as the prison sentence, Abernethy was banned from driving for three years and ordered to take an extended test on his release.
