The full extent of the damage and chaos caused by a night of sustained rioting and widespread looting in Tottenham, north London, has become apparent.Twenty-six police officers were injured after trouble erupted on Saturday night, two days after a man was shot by police in the area.After a peaceful protest by members of the community outside Tottenham police station to demand "justice", the mood soured and buildings and vehicles were set alight.Two police cars, a bus and several shops were attacked and set on fire as looting spread to a retail park near Tottenham Hale tube station, where shop windows were smashed and goods plundered from stores.Teenagers and adults were said to have turned up in cars and filled them with stolen items, unimpeded by police. Others arrived on foot and piled shopping trolleys with looted televisions and other electronic goods.Police said 26 officers were injured, with two remaining in hospital on Sunday morning. Three members of the public were injured, with two still in hospital. Forty-two people were arrested for offences including violent disorder, burglary and theft.Politicians united in their condemnation of the rioting. A Downing Street spokesman described the events as "utterly unacceptable"."There is no justification for the aggression the police and the public faced, or for the damage to property," the spokesman said. "There is now a police investigation into the rioting, and we should let that process happen."By midnight, police had managed to secure a 200-metre stretch of Tottenham High Road, the scene of some of the worst rioting on Saturday night.But as fire engines entered the street and began putting out blazing cars and buildings, the rioters spread north and west through back streets.To the north, at Tottenham Hale, an Aldi supermarket was ransacked and set on fire. A nearby carpet shop was also set alight, causing a huge blaze.Large groups of youths congregated in the surrounding streets, armed with sticks, bottles and hammers.Some wore balaclavas and prevented cars from accessing streets as buildings were broken into. Others used large rubbish bins to create burning barricades across the road.However, some of the most dramatic looting took place further west, in Wood Green, and continued into the early hours of the morning.Earlier, officers on horseback and others in riot gear clashed with hundreds of rioters armed with makeshift missiles in the centre of Tottenham following the protest over the death of Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old father of four, who was shot on Thursday.There was still no police presence in Wood Green High Road at 4am, even after dozens of stores had been smashed and raided, setting off multiple alarms.Around 100 youths targeted game shops, electrical stores and clothing chains such as H&M.Windows were smashed and the looters – mostly young men masking their faces – swarmed in and emerged with handfuls of stolen goods. "I've got loads of G-Star," said one teenager, coming out of a clothes shop.Three teenagers ran down the street with suitcases filled with stolen clothes. Around 10 young men stood outside a smouldering Carphone Warehouse, the windows smashed. In suburban back streets, residential front gardens were used to sort and swap stolen goods.A boy who looked about 14 drove a stolen minicab erratically down a side street. On an adjacent street, a man who emerged from his home to find his car burned out remonstrated with other young men, who ran past carrying clothes.Passersby, including people returning home in the early hours from nights out, were stunned to discover the mayhem on the streets.With no sign of police, buses refused to take passengers through Wood Green High Road, and traffic was brought to a standstill.
