A 26-year-old man was today jailed for eight years for taking part in the armed robbery in which PC Sharon Beshenivsky was killed.Raza ul Haq Aslam had effectively acted as a lookout during the fatal raid on the travel agency in Bradford nearly two years ago.The defendant was convicted of robbery in March following a retrial at Newcastle Crown Court. He had been acquitted of murder, manslaughter, robbery and a string of firearms offences in December last year.Today, ul Haq Aslam, of Kentish Town, north London, returned to Newcastle Crown Court to be sentenced.Jailing him for eight years, Judge John Milford told ul Haq Aslam that the length of his term reflected that he had not known that other members of the gang were carrying firearms."You were one of a team of seven men taking part in a robbery at the Universal Express travel agents in Bradford," the judge said."During the course of that offence, those in the premises were subjected to violence and were tied up and injured."In addition, and most terribly, two female officers were shot, one fatally. It was a crime that shocked the nation."It goes without saying that this offence is so serious that any sentence other than imprisonment cannot be justified."Gang member ul Haq Aslam is the fifth person to be convicted in connection with the botched robbery in which PC Beshenivsky, 38, was shot and killed in November 2005.Her colleague, PC Teresa Milburn, 37, was also shot and seriously wounded in the incident.Four other men have already been sentenced to a total of more than 100 years in prison following the shootings outside the travel agency.Muzzaker Imtiaz Shah, 25, was said to be one of the "absolutely ruthless" key members of the gang who carried out the robbery. He and 20-year-old Yusuf Abdillh Jamma, of Birmingham, were told they must both serve at least 35 years before being considered for parole.Hassan Razzaq, 26, and his younger brother, Faisal, 25, both of Sebert Road, Forest Gate, east London, were cleared of PC Beshenivsky's murder but convicted of her manslaughter, robbery and firearms offences.Faisal Razzaq was given a life sentence and told he must serve at least 11 years before being considered for parole, while his older brother was also jailed for life and sentenced to a minimum of 20 years.PC Beshenivsky was shot as she arrived at the scene of the robbery in Bradford, on the day of her youngest daughter's fourth birthday.She was the first woman police officer to be shot and killed on duty since PC Yvonne Fletcher was gunned down outside the Libyan embassy in London on April 17, 1984.West Yorkshire Police are still hunting two other men in connection with the robbery in which little more than Â£5,000 was stolen.A force spokesman said they were "confident" that the two men wanted in connection with the shootings - Mustaf Jamma and Piran Ditta Khan - would be caught and brought to trial.
