John Reid declared "I am not a quitter" today as he sought to regain control of the headlines that are threatening to engulf the Home Office.The home secretary dropped a broad hint that he expects Gordon Brown to keep him on as home secretary for at least two years if the chancellor becomes prime minister when Tony Blair steps down.Mr Reid preceded an article he wrote in today's Guardian with a round of television and radio interviews in which he said problems uncovered at his troubled Whitehall department would take two-and-a-half years to fix - and he would "see it through".However, he refused to deny outright that he might still challenge Mr Brown for the Labour leadership.In an interview with GMTV, Mr Reid said: "I'm not a quitter. The reason I was put into the Home Office is because or the problems."It does not come as news to me; I am the person who told everyone that there were problems, when I used the phrase 'not fit for purpose'."In a separate interview, with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the home secretary said: "I set down a timescale for what I thought was necessary - two-and-a-half years."I am not daunted. I will see it through. If it needs endurance, if it needs determination, it will be there."In words which will be closely scrutinised, the interviewer, John Humphrys, asked: "Will Gordon Brown keep you in the job when he is prime minister?"Mr Reid replied: "Gordon and I work very closely on this. We discuss penal policy...""And you expect to be working for him as prime minister, do you?" interrupted Humphrys.Mr Reid said: "I never guess the future, John, but I can tell you as late as last night I was discussing these matters with Gordon, and we continually discuss them.""So obviously you are not going to run for the leadership, then?" responded Humphrys, and Mr Reid replied: "John, I am going to be home secretary."In his Guardian article, Mr Reid likened revamping the Home Office to interior decorating, saying peeling off the wallpaper revealed new cracks and problems.But the Conservatives claimed Mr Reid was "papering over the cracks because he cannot solve them" , while the Liberal Democrats claimed that the collapse of confidence in the department was due to 10 years of Labour mismanagement.The Tories also moved to try to blame the chancellor, Gordon Brown, for some of the Home Office's problems.The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, claimed the chancellor had "prematurely frozen" the department's budget, supported the Â£20bn ID card scheme instead of building new prisons, set up too many performance targets and blocked new private finance initiative jail projects because they would add to the government borrowing figures."Gordon Brown likes to claim he has been the one running the government for the past 10 years, but when trouble arrives he quickly vanishes," Mr Osborne said.The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said of Mr Reid: "First he blamed his predecessor, then the judges, then the civil servants and now we are asked to believe that the problems in the Home Office are because of dodgy wallpaper in a fictional house in Whitehall."The Home Office was hit by a weekend full of damaging allegations about police failures to monitor 322 sex offenders, and a failure to enact travel bans on 147 convicted drug offenders.Mr Reid appeared today to suggest in his Guardian article that there will be further failings to come.He also said that his proposal to split the Home Office into security and justice departments had been put to the cabinet, without a decision yet."I have put my views to the prime minister on that. I have also discussed it with cabinet colleagues," he said.The Daily Mirror reports today that Mr Reid hopes to create 2,500 more prison places by the end of the year by building cells on existing prison sites and reopening disused jail buildings.In his GMTV interview, Mr Reid said the measures he had taken since being appointed home secretary included ordering 8,000 more prison places and a review of how to better control sex offenders.
