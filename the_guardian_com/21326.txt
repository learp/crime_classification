A mother was charged yesterday with the attempted murder of her 31-year-old daughter, who suffered from ME, after her body was found in December last year. Kathleen Gilderdale, 54, known as Kay, was released on police bail after her daughter Lynn's body was found at her home in Stonegate, East Sussex, on 4 December. Sussex police said that she had been charged with attempted murder and bailed to appear at Brighton magistrates court on Tuesday.Lynn Gilderdale became ill with ME (myalgic encephalopathy) at the age of 14. In a statement after her death, relatives described her as "young, beautiful, loving and caring" and said that before her illness she had been an active, healthy teenager.Her illness left her paralysed, unable to speak, eat or drink and she required round-the-clock care which, relatives said, "was provided by her totally dedicated mother, with continuous support from Lynn's father". About 250,000 people are estimated to be affected by ME in Britain, according to the ME Association. Common symptoms include severe and debilitating fatigue, painful muscles and joints, disordered sleep, gastric disturbances and poor memory and concentration.
