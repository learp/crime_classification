The inquiry into the murderous medical career of serial killer Harold Shipman reopened yesterday, as another 30 suspicious deaths emerged following newspaper appeals last month.The public inquiry, chaired by Dame Janet Smith, took the unusual step of placing advertisements in national newspapers requesting information on the deaths of 82 of the GP's patients in the 1980s. Several relatives came forward and 30 cases stretching back to 1977 will now be examined, bringing the total deaths under investigation to 431.Shipman, 55, Britain's worst serial killer, was convicted last year of the murders of 15 patients and is now serving life in Frankland prison, Co Durham. He has never admitted guilt and has refused to cooperate with the inquiry.The inquiry yesterday heard the story of Elizabeth Battersby, 70, a widow who lived alone in Hyde, and died in her front room on the day Shipman visited to take a blood test. Her daughter, Olive Gardner, said her mother appeared in "very good health" on the morning before her death.The inquiry's final report is expected in 2003, but publication of an interim report will be delayed from December to the new year, because of the volume of evidence that has emerged.
