A man was charged yesterday with child abduction and sexual grooming over the internet following the disappearance of 15-year-old schoolgirl Hannah Rodrigues, who was still missing last night.Mehdi Boudjedra, 31, of Shepherds Bush, west London, will appear at a court in Hertfordshire today. He was arrested at an address in central London. Hannah left her St Albans home on Wednesday afternoon and is believed to have travelled to Regent Street in central London. The teenager contacted a friend on Wednesday evening to say she was "all right" but has not been heard from since.On Friday police released a photo of the man they think she met in London. The photo, which is believed to have come from Hannah's computer, shows him in front of what is thought to be the Harrods Depository building near Barnes, south-west London. A spokeswoman for Hertfordshire police said Hannah had been sighted in the Fulham area of west London. She said: "We would ask anyone who sees Hannah, or Hannah herself, to contact police urgently."
