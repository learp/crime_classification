In London last Monday a Latvian, Janis Nords, was caught trying to skip out on a £1,000 bill at the St James's Street restaurant L'Oranger. His subsequent arrest ended his spree of eat-and-runs: with an unnamed companion in tow he had spent weeks touring London's best restaurants, hoovering up food and booze and then scarpering before pudding. "He was trying to impress a girl," a lawyer later explained.Janis, we've all been there. I'm just not convinced this was the right way. Consider, for instance, how impressed she might have felt while sprinting up Mayfair after a luxury feed at Hélène Darroze. The pre-cheque flip from L'Autre Pied in Marylebone, just last week, came after you'd both sunk £500 worth of foie gras and '97 Bollinger. That'll slosh.To give due credit, Nords, a 27-year-old film-maker, deployed some crafty touches. At The Glasshouse in Kew, in October, a decoy parcel was left behind as insurance when the pair decamped. At Pearl in Holborn, a fortnight ago, Nords covered the early retrieval of his jacket from cloakroom staff by promising not to run away (before running away).Not to advocate the practice of bill evasion, but there were surely less sweaty alternatives. He could have tried some kind of journalist-based ruse, for instance – talking on the mobile to an imagined editor and making elaborate notes about things like the butter tray, hopeful the owner might notice and waive the bill. Or he could have gone for the multi-tiered mega-complaint ("My foie gras isn't rich enough... ... I have never been so appalled by the state of staff bow ties...") in a bid to shame the maître d' into hacking off costs.The best solution, really, would've been to order like any sane person in a restaurant they can't afford: hammer the complimentary bread basket and get creative with side dishes.That or choose a cheaper joint – which couldn't be much more degrading, could it, than insisting that your date wears a good pair of trainers to dinner?
