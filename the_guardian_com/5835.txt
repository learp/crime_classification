A bankrupt Chinese dissident has been convicted of murder for bludgeoning to death a reclusive millionaire author in an elaborate attempt to plunder his savings.Wang Yam was yesterday found guilty at the Old Bailey of killing Allan Chappelow, a prize-winning 86-year-old scholar, at his £4.1m home in Hampstead, north London, in May 2006.The court heard Yam buried Mr Chappelow beneath a 4ft pile of his own page proofs and posed as him to dupe bank officials into transferring thousands of pounds into his accounts.Large sections of the trial were held in camera – including much of Yam's defence – on grounds of national security, an unprecedented reporting restriction in a murder trial. Explanation was refused.Yam, 46, a British citizen who fled China after the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989, denied the killing and claimed he was framed by foreign fraudsters.Mr Chappelow had written two biographies of the playwright George Bernard Shaw, and an account of the first organised tourist visit to the Soviet Union. The court heard he was a wealthy man, living off inherited money in one of London's most upmarket neighbourhoods.Yam had declared himself bankrupt in 2004 owing £1.1m, and had a track record of fake mortgage and insurance deals, said Mark Ellison QC, prosecuting.The identity thief managed to transfer £20,000, but his accent raised suspicion. Yam was eventually caught trying pay four cheques made out in Mr Chappelow's name into another account.Police broke into Mr Chappelow's home on June 14 and found his decomposed body. He had been beaten so badly that he could only be identified by dental records. Yam fled the country on Eurostar but was tracked down and was extradicted from Switzerland.Yam was convicted in April last year on the fraud charges but a jury could not reach a verdict on the murder count, prompting this month's retrial. He is due for sentencing on Monday.
