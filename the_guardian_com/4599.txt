Ministers will announce today they are pressing ahead with plans for a nationwide scheme to dock housing benefit from so-called neighbours from hell. The welfare minister Malcolm Wicks will issue a consultation paper setting out the plans as part of its rights and responsibilities agenda.Critics have said the proposals breach human rights law and are more cumbersome than the simple alternative of fining persistent offenders. Mr Wicks said in some cases neighbours run riot, fail to look after their children or pour excreta through letter boxes. Some MPs in working class areas, such as Frank Field, claim the issue is the most important facing Labour voters. The consultation paper will ask for views on whether housing benefit should be docked if someone is found guilty in the courts for an anti-social offence, or if a local government officer has received a complaint from a neighbour. Mr Wicks said: "There is something specifically wrong about someone being able to make the life of their neighbour hellish and being able to do it courtesy of a subsidy from the taxpayer in the form of housing benefit." He said he would consider whether a nationwide scheme should be introduced, or whether the powers should only be available in particularly difficult estates. He said some form of mechanism, possibly a national register of offenders, would be needed to ensure that an anti-social neighbour could not simply move to a different council to avoid having benefits docked. The consultation will end in August, giving Mr Wicks the opportunity to put the proposals on the statute book, possibly by adding the measure to the anti-social behaviour bill.
