A police investigation was under way last night after a gun and knife attack in a public park left a 16-year-old girl dead and her 18-year-old friend fighting for her life.The 16-year-old, who has not yet been formally identified, was found covered in stab wounds and blood by police at 5.30 yesterday morning after an alert from a passer-by. Her friend had been shot and stabbed and was taken to hospital where she remains in a serious condition. After what police described as an 'horrendous' attack, Detective Superintendent Mark Warwick said he was keeping an open mind over the motive. He said it was not yet clear what the girls were doing in the park. The pair were found near the Mansion House pub in Prospect Park, Reading, Berkshire. Police say three men in their 20s from the London area were arrested and are being questioned concerning the attack in the park, which is popular with families and dog walkers. Police said the dead girl's body was found after the older girl asked for help from a passer-by. The 18-year-old victim is helping police with their investigation from her hospital bed. She is in a 'serious but stable' condition, but her injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. Warwick appealed to members of the public who may have information to come forward. 'This is a rare and terrible crime and we need your help to find out who is responsible,' he said. A neighbour who did not want to be named, said: 'We've lived here for 30 years and the area is going downhill. That's why we are moving - this is the final straw. You only need to walk five or 10 minutes down the road and there are drugs and prostitution.' A post-mortem examination into the girl's death was due to be carried out late last night.
