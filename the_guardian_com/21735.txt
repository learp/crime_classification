Teachers may be awarded powers to search a whole class of pupils for knives under the latest proposals put forward by the education secretary, Alan Johnson.Mr Johnson wants to include such a measure as a last-minute amendment to the violent crime reduction bill, currently being debated in the House of Lords.According to a spokesman, Mr Johnson may extend proposed search powers beyond individuals teachers believe are carrying blades to cover an entire classroom. He believes this would ensure pupils could not escape detection by passing a weapon to a classmate.The bill has been debated while a number of violent crimes in schools have occurred, including the case of a 13-year-old girl who last week was given a two year supervision order for slashing a classmate across the face, leaving her needing 30 stitches. MPs have already approved the violent crime reduction bill, which contains a series of measures to clamp down on knife and gun crime. Under the bill, teachers would be specially trained in searching, another adult would be present while they searched a class, and strip searches would not be permitted.The home secretary, John Reid, has also told MPs he is "giving serious consideration" to increasing sentences for knife crime.The general secretary of the teachers' union NASUWT, Chris Keates, said: "It is sensible and logical for such powers to apply to groups of pupils and not just individuals.""However, the union has maintained consistently that this should not be on the basis of heads or teachers carrying out the searches themselves. [That] would be counterproductive: not only are there risks involved but it could have an adverse effect on the nature of a teacher's relationship with pupils."Mr Keates called for head teachers to be able to commission searches either from specialist school security staff or from external experts.
