The government reacted angrily to Tuesday night's big defeat in the Lords over attempts to restrict the right to trial by jury. "We shall reverse this decision in the Commons," the Home Office announced, moments after peers had voted by 210-136 to knock out the option of judge-only trials in long and complex cases. Yesterday, Downing Street was just as adamant about its intentions. "We are determined to reverse the defeat," the prime minister's official spokesman told the press. "We are committed to seeing it through," Tony Blair confirmed at the last question time before the recess. Opposition to his measure - which included several Labour peers - was "absolutely shameful," he added, for good measure.A few hours later, however, Downing Street issued a statement that took a strikingly more emollient approach to the will of parliament over an equally tricky subject. January's voting on reform of the House of Lords, the government announced in a statement, had "made it difficult for it to continue" with further Lords reform. Since there was "no consensus about introducing any elected element" in the Lords, the government had decided not to do so. From now on, it announced, the government would limit itself to trying to remove the remaining 92 hereditary peers from the upper house, and to establishing a new independent appointments commission which would shape the now non-elected, non-hereditary second chamber.Every time that abolition of jury trial reaches the upper house, whether under Tory or Labour governments, the Lords vote it down. They did so again on Tuesday, by a commanding majority. A more humble government than this one might get the message and not persist with its plans. This one, though, intends to press ahead. Less than 24 hours after that, the government makes clear that it now prefers to create a wholly appointed second chamber. How is it that one is not in the least bit surprised?
