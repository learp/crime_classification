Fibres found on items belonging to a forklift truck driver accused of murdering five women in Suffolk matched those found on all his alleged victims, a court was told today.Tiny fragments discovered on the naked bodies of Anneli Alderton, Annette Nicholls and Paula Clennell, all of whom were sex workers, matched those found at Steve Wright's home, in his car and on his clothing, jurors at Ipswich crown court heard.Wright, of Ipswich, denies murdering Clennell, 24, Gemma Adams, 25, Tania Nicol, 19, Alderton, 24, and Nicholls, 29. Their naked bodies were discovered near Ipswich over a 10-day period in December 2006.Ray Palmer, a fibres expert, told the jury the discovery of such fragments "would not occur by chance".Palmer said fibres linked to the Tesco tracksuit bottoms worn by Wright when he was arrested were found on the bodies of Alderton, Nicholls, Clennell and Nicol. Red acrylic fragments from the back seat and parcel shelf of Wright's Ford Mondeo were "indistinguishable" from microscopic material found on the bodies of Alderton, Clennell and Adams, he added.Palmer said the presence of the fibres on the women suggested contact with Wright shortly before their bodies were dumped. "They would have had to have been in contact with an item from the home environment or indeed the car," he said, adding that the fibres were likely to have been transferred through a "forceful direct contact". The trial continues.
