One of the UK's biggest Victorian jails is a dirty, vermin-infested institution where 40% of inmates have been assaulted or insulted by staff, according to an official inspection report published today.Pentonville prison, where 14 staff were last month suspended on corruption allegations, is so poorly run that new prisoners were told on arrival not to expect to be given a pillow or a toothbrush, says the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers.One evening during the inspection there was not enough food to go round at the only cooked meal of the day. She says the basic operations at the prison are at best patchy, at worst non-existent.Her follow-up inspection carried out in July found that while external areas of the north London prison were better cared for, many internal areas remained dirty and vermin-infested, and overcrowding was so acute that it held 1,125 prisoners when it was only built for 897.Staff-prisoner relations have worsened since her 2005 inspection and with five out of six recent suicides taking place within days of arrival, more prisoners said they felt unsafe on their first night. Only 43% said they were treated with respect by staff, compared with 64% a year ago."Fewer prisoners than in 2005 said they felt at risk from other prisoners, but many more felt at risk from staff. Forty per cent, compared with 29% last time, said they had been insulted or assaulted by staff," says Ms Owers, noting these figures are far higher than for many other local jails.The chief inspector says that easy availability of illegal drugs inside Pentonville lies behind much of this fear of violence, but adds that some prisoners feared reprisals if they complained about ill treatment by staff.Ms Owers confirms that "use of force" by staff was high and the recording of how and why it was used was inadequate.At her previous inspection, the chief inspector found that prisoners were routinely locked in their cells for most of the day. She says it is commendable that they are now out of cells for more time, but the 140 unemployed prisoners are still locked up for 22 hours a day.Michael Spurr, director of operations for the Prison Service, said Pentonville's senior management team had been strengthened and the governor was dealing firmly with allegations against staff. The operational capacity of the prison was temporarily reduced by 116 places after the 14 staff were suspended in the corruption inquiry.
