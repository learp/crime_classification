A man has been jailed following a string of burglaries after a Find My iPhone app was used by police to help finally capture him.Ion-Liviu Radita, 36, stole an iPad during one of 11 break-ins committed during a three-week crime spree in Kent from 3 May. But unknown to him, the Apple device had an app installed that enabled police to track it down to one of several properties in Ilford, Essex.Outside one of the homes was a red Nissan Primera which detectives were able to prove was used to travel to Kent at the time of the burglaries. A raid on Radita's home then uncovered a gems box with about 100 pieces of jewellery inside. Police said laptops and other electronic devices were also taken during the break-ins. Radita was convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary by a jury at Maidstone crown court and jailed for seven years.Detective constable Bill Looker of Kent police said: "With the help of the Find My iPhone app, we were able to tie his location down to a small number of addresses, and from there it was a case of using other tools available to us, such as automatic number plate recognition cameras, to keep tabs and track the car we knew was being used to commit these burglaries."These cameras proved the car was in the area of those burglaries at that time and was seen to go back to Essex after they were committed."
