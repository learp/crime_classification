An 18-year-old woman has been raped after being held down and robbed by two other women.The victim was approached and thrown to the ground in Manchester city centre early on Wednesday by a male assailant before he and a woman held her down while a second woman robbed her.The male offender then raped the teenager before all three ran from the scene in Major Street towards the city’s Gay Village area.Detective Inspector Dave Moores of Greater Manchester police’s serious sexual offences unit said: “This was a horrendous attack on a young woman which has, understandably, left her extremely distressed.“We are providing her with support from specially trained officers and have launched a full investigation.”The first woman, who helped restrain the victim during the robbery, is described as about 18, of mixed race, scrawny build with a ponytail. She spoke with a local accent.The second woman, who committed the robbery, is described as mixed race, in her early 20s and a messy ponytail. She also spoke with a local accent.The man is described as white, in his early 20s, of slim build and with a clean-shaven face. He was wearing sports clothing.Detectives are appealing for anyone who saw a group matching the description of the offenders before or after the rape took place, between 2am and 3am on Wednesday, to contact them.Anybody with information should contact police on 0161 856 1911 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
