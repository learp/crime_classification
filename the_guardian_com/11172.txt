Plans for a comprehensive fraud offence to replace nine offences and make cases easier for juries to understand were unveiled in a Home Office consultation paper yesterday.A new fraud bill would aim to simplify existing laws and introduce a single offence of fraud. At present, there is no such crime as "fraud" and cases have to be shoehorned into one or more of eight offences of deception under the theft acts, such as obtaining property by deception, and obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception. The new crime of fraud would replace the eight offences as well as the common-law offence of conspiracy to defraud, used when two or more people plan a fraud together. Fraud costs Britain an estimated Â£14bn a year and ministers say laws focus too closely on specific offences rather than combating the wide range of fraudsters' activity. Existing legislation is also failing to keep pace with technology, particularly the growing number of internet transactions.
