A "self-styled vigilante" who doused an innocent man in petrol and set fire to him because he thought he was a selling heroin was today jailed for 24 years.Shane Wheelhouse suffered severe burns to his face, head, hands and arms after he was set alight by Andrew Taylor.Taylor, 33, was found guilty of attempted murder following a week-long trial at Sheffield crown court. Judge Lawler QC described it as one of the worst cases of attempted murder he had seen in his career.Mr Wheelhouse had been driving through Barnsley, South Yorkshire, on February 1 when he pulled over to the side of the road to take a call from his brother. When Taylor tapped on Mr Wheelhouse's window, he opened it, recognising Taylor as the partner of an acquaintance.The court heard that Taylor said: "Are you selling smack down here?" He then began splashing petrol through the window, soaking the top half of Mr Wheelhouse's body so that it was dripping from his face.Mr Wheelhouse shut the window and tried to pull away in first gear but was panicking and the clutch was faulty.Taylor continued to empty the can over the blue Ford Mondeo before crouching at arm's length and starting the fire.Mr Wheelhouse told the court how he was trapped in his car by his seatbelt as the flames burned his hands and face.His seatbelt eventually burned through and Mr Wheelhouse leapt from the car, trying to pat out the fire.Mr Wheelhouse suffered severe burns to his upper body and was taken to a specialist burns unit in Liverpool for treatment.Taylor was arrested after he approached police officers at the scene at 3am on the morning after the incident.Jailing Taylor, the judge said: "This case must be, and is in my fairly long experience, one of the very worst of its kind and requires a very long sentence."Your conduct acting as some self-styled vigilante was totally beyond the pale. On any view, this is at the top end of the scale of offences of attempted murder."Speaking outside court, Mr Wheelhouse thanked the police and jury for their work.He said: "[Taylor] has done what he has done and has got his sentence."Asked about his feelings towards Taylor, he said: "I still have anger inside me. I haven't had time to just sit down and think about things. I want to try and put this behind me and get on with the rest of my life."
