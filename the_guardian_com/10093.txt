Aim"To make provision about serious crime prevention orders; to create offences in respect of the encouragement or assistance of crime; to enable information to be shared or processed to prevent fraud or for purposes relating to proceeds of crime; to enable data matching to be conducted both in relation to fraud and for other purposes; to transfer functions to the Serious Organised Crime Agency."Main provisions• Creates the Serious Crime Prevention Order (SCPO), a civil order nicknamed the "gangster asbo". SCPOs can be used to restrict where an individual can live and limit their work and travel arrangements. SCPOs can last for up to five years and breaching them can result in up to five years' imprisonment.• Allows widespread data sharing between the government agencies with the aim of tackling fraud. These data matching exercises could include databases registering tax, pension and benefit records.• Abolishes the Asset Recovery Agency and redistributes its functions; recovery of the proceeds of crime becomes the responsibility of the Serious Organised Crime Agency.• Replaces the common law offence of incitement with three new statutory offences of encouraging or assisting a crime.BackgroundSCPOs were designed to allow the police to target suspected crime bosses without bringing criminal charges. The government estimated that the act would be used to target about 30 crime lords a year.The decision in this act to allow large-scale data matching exercises - a fishing expedition in which several databases are searched to identify suspicious patterns of activity – marks a major shift in the government's rules on data sharing. A 2006 report from a cabinet committee overturned the basic data protection that personal information provided to a government department for one purpose should not, in general, be used for another. The new principle approved by the cabinet says that "information will normally be shared in the public sector provided that it is in the public interest".CriticismJUSTICE, an independent all-party legal and human rights organisation, described the SCPOs as a "dangerous departure from the principle that the criminal justice system should have primacy in controlling criminal behaviour". The House of Lords Constitution committee pointed out that the criminal justice system "includes a range of procedural and substantive protections" designed to prevent miscarriages of justice.The committee expressed doubts about using civil orders to target organised crime. Its report said: "a broad question for the house is whether the use of civil orders in an attempt to prevent serious criminal activity is a step too far in the development of preventative orders."Whether or not the trend towards greater use of preventative civil orders is constitutionally legitimate (a matter on which we express doubt), we take the view that SCPOs represent an incursion into the liberty of the subject and constitute a form of punishment that cannot be justified in the absence of a criminal conviction."
