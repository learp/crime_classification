Retired market trader Ann Timson, 71, who foiled an attempted robbery at a jewellers' in Northampton by beating off six robbers with her handbag, is to auction the handbag for charity. Speaking on NBC television alongside her son, Andre, 47, after being flown to the United States, she said: "I'm not a hero or a heroine or a supergran.I just thought a kid was being hit. I think the adrenaline got going and the second thought was how dare they do a daylight robbery? That was it. I was mad."Asked if she was going to sell the bag on eBay, she said: "Andre [her son] is going to deal with something like that and maybe we can give the funds to charity if anybody wants to buy it, they are more than welcome".Ms Timson, who suffers from arthritis and sometimes needs to use a wheelchair, was wearing support bandages at the time of the incident because she was on her way to a dance class.She described her dash towards the robbers as "an amble" rather than a run and said she was sore for four days afterwards.Speaking of the way she wielded the bag, she said: "It was just a two-handed thing. They had mega helmets on. It was not going to impact on them and hurt, but hopefully it would distract them from doing what they were doing."Every time I whacked I said, 'go off'."Towards the end of the incident she said she was confronted head on by one of the robbers, who was carrying a sledge hammer.She said: "We just stood up, eyeball to eyeball and he just put it down. I think he realised I was just an old biddy anyway."Asked if it bothered her that nobody came to her aid, she said: "It did a bit."But she added: "I think they stood absolutely mesmerised and somebody afterward said they thought it was a wind-up for a show."Four men aged 18, 22, 25 and 39 have been charged with robbery and theft.
