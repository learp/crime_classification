A police officer feared for his life when an intoxicated man got him in a bear hug and threatened to tip them both off a bridge over the A1, a court has heard.Michael Walker, 28, a cocaine addict from West Denton, Newcastle upon Tyne, was jailed for five years after he pleaded guilty to attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. A charge of attempted murder was dropped at a previous hearing.Walker had punched a female neighbour in the face and run off when the police arrived at about 6.30am on 12 November.When PC Richard Wilkinson, who is 6ft 3in, confronted him on the footbridge 14 metres above the ground, Walker, who had been drinking wine and vodka, grabbed him.Mark Giuliani, prosecuting, told Newcastle crown court how Walker then tried to tip himself and Wilkinson over the railings on to the embankment below.

But as he tried to handcuff Walker, the suspect grabbed Wilkinson and squeezed his windpipe.During the struggle the handcuffs were lost, but Wilkinson managed to call again for back-up and three more officers arrived to help, eventually carrying Walker off the bridge but only after the suspect had kicked PC Stacey Elhala.When he sobered up at the police station, Walker said he had no recollection of attacking his neighbour or the incident on the bridge.He had banged on the 51-year-old woman’s door in the middle of the night demanding toast and punched her in the face when she slapped him in her attempt to get him to leave.Robert Woodcock QC, defending, said Wilkinson must have been terrified during the ordeal on the footbridge but it was only for a brief period. He said his client had now confronted his problem drinking.Sentencing Walker to five years for the attempted grievous bodily harm with intent, assaulting the neighbour and attacking the other officer, Judge Paul Sloan QC said: “I accept you are now genuinely ashamed of your conduct that night.”Acting Ch Supt David Felton said: “Walker is a dangerous man and what he did that day could have endangered his own life and that of our police officer.“It eventually took a number of officers to restrain Walker, just showing how powerful and dangerous he was and what an incredible job the PC who responded did.”Felton added: “This type of situation is faced by many of our officers every day and exemplifies how dangerous and difficult the job of a police officer can be.”
