A DNA breakthrough is pointing towards a convicted sex killer as the prime suspect for the murder of Rachel Nickell, which puts the man previously cleared of killing her in line for compensation.Colin Stagg was charged with stabbing the 23-year-old ex-model to death on Wimbledon Common, south London, in front of her three-year-old son, in 1992. But a judge threw out the case after refusing to allow "honeytrap" evidence from an undercover policewoman, who befriended Mr Stagg and got him to admit bizarre sexual fantasies, although he never confessed to murder. Twelve years on, Mr Stagg, 41, who lives in Roehampton, says his life has been ruined. Scientific advances now mean police have obtained enhanced DNA from Nickell's underwear. Scotland Yard said it would not comment while inquiries are ongoing. But the Guardian understands the new information points towards Robert Napper, 38, a psychopath detained indefinitely in Broadmoor secure hospital. Napper raped and sexually assaulted several women in the early 90s and was finally caught in May 1994, after murdering a young mother and her daughter. Detectives have not spoken to him to date. Mr Stagg, who spent a year in custody before his acquittal, said: "I'm entitled to every penny I can get. I've never been able to get a proper job." Mark Stephens, a lawyer with Finers Stephens Innocent, thought Â£500,000 in compensation might be realistic.
