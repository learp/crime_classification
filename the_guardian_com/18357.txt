A railway guard convicted of the manslaughter of a teenager after he signalled for a train to move as she was leaning against the carriage has been jailed for five years.Christopher McGee, 45, gave the signal for the driver to depart as Georgia Varley, 16, was leaning drunk against the window from the platform.

"As the guard of the train, you were in complete control of the movement of the train. That control carries with it the direct and personal responsibility for the safety of passengers."Much has been made on your behalf during this trial of how intoxicated Georgia was, but that did not relieve you of the duty of care which you owed to her."You alone determined whether the train remained stationary or began to move. Your decision and your action determined whether Georgia Varley was safe from risk."The judge said McGee's negligence "can be measured in seconds" and "must be viewed against a background of more than 20 years' conscientious service on the railways".He was told McGee had received a police caution in 2009 for growing nine cannabis plants at his home in Wallasey, Wirral.  Georgia Varley. Photograph: PAGeorgia, described as "wonderful" by her mother, was on a night out in Liverpool with friends when she fell between the train and the platform at the city's James Street station on 22 October last year.The Birkenhead sixth form college student, from Moreton, Wirral, was three times over the legal drink-driving limit and had 0.083mg of the drug mephedrone, or Mcat, in her system at the time of her death, the court heard.The prosecution said McGee was negligent because he gave the signal to the driver to start the train when Georgia was in contact with the train and was in an "intoxicated state".McGee, who denied manslaughter, told the jury he thought Georgia was moving away from the train when he gave the signal to depart. He also said he did not know how drunk she was.Completing his sentencing remarks, Holroyde told McGee: "In my judgment, the CCTV footage is unequivocal, Georgia Varley was not moving away and she was not showing any sign of moving away."She only moved when the movement of the train deprived her of support and caused her to lose balance and fall to her death."I am satisfied that you merely hoped and assumed she would get out of the way when the train began to move, and on that wholly inadequate basis you took a terrible risk."The footage of the teenager's death was shown to the jury during McGee's trial. Georgia, described to the court as "legless", was seen mistakenly getting off the train just before 11.30pm, and then turning around and leaning against the side as she realised her friends were still on board. She was then seen to stagger and fall down the gap as the train moved off, before stopping after travelling around 10 metres (30ft).The defendant will be entitled to apply for parole after serving half his sentence, the judge ruled.
