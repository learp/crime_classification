One in four teenage schoolchildren admit they have committed a crime in the past 12 months, according to a survey published last night by the government's youth justice board.The most common offence was fare dodging, and the detailed survey results suggested that levels of youth crime have remained relatively stable since 1999. In the 2002 Mori youth survey 26% of teenage pupils said they had committed a crime in the past 12 months. This compared with 24% in 1999. The most common profile of a teenage offender was a white male aged 14-16, living in London or the north-east, who was excluded from school and had committed more than five crimes in the past year. The survey revealed much higher levels of crime among teenagers who had been excluded from school, with 64% of this group admitting they had been involved in crime - down from 72% in 2000. This group of teenagers was engaged in much more serious crime. Some 60% said they had been involved in handling stolen goods; 55% said they had carried a weapon other than a gun, and 25% admitted they had stolen mobile phones. The only crime in which there appeared to have been a drop was shoplifting, down from 58% to 49% among excluded children in the past year. The results also showed that more schoolchildren who were caught were being punished. In 2001 some 22% said they were not punished after being caught for an offence. This figure fell to 16% last year. But there were big variations around the country in the chances of a teenage offender being caught. Only 11% of those in London who admitted they had committed a crime said they had been caught, compared with 43% in Wales and 44% in the north-east.
