A senior British diplomat in Thailand broke through three pairs of plastic handcuffs, threatened to kill fellow airline passengers and abused cabin staff after drinking heavily on a flight to London in the aftermath of the tsunami, a court heard yesterday.Fellow passengers seated near Colonel Peter Roberts, defence attache at the British embassy in Thailand, said it became clear very quickly that he was an important man with an important job.But as the Etihad Airways flight from Abu Dhabi to Heathrow flew over Belgium in February last year, Col Roberts' behaviour deteriorated until he went berserk, Isleworth crown court heard.At one point he screamed at cabin staff and passengers who tried to restrain him: "You are a fucking wanker, you're fucking dead. Do you know who I am? I'm the head of the British government in Thailand and you're treating me like this."Gareth Rees QC, prosecuting, said Col Roberts had drunk two or three bottles of wine - of the small size served by airlines - three Black Label whiskies and some port on the plane.He had also been drinking wine on his connecting flight from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi and the court heard he had been taking the antidepressant Seroxat, which should not be mixed with alcohol. He was seen drinking whisky at the airport.Fellow passenger Anil Mohun Kumar said the defence attache launched a foul-mouthed tirade against the country of Thailand. "He said 'Fuck this country, fuck the king, fuck the Buddha,' " Mr Kumar said."He made several threats to kill the people trying to restrain him. It took five people at one stage to restrain him."During a continuing tirade of abuse, his ramblings included his personal views on North Korea, a country he labelled as "untrustworthy", according to Kevin McGuire, another passenger.Flight attendant Roseanne Montero said she found Col Roberts sitting on a seat reserved for cabin crew during the flight: "I saw him lean across and try to grab a female passenger and I saw him trying to grab a woman with a small boy about two years old and the woman and the small boy looked terrified."This was accompanied by shouts of 'Fuck off, fuck off.' "She said Col Roberts then went "mad" and attempts were made to restrain him with plastic handcuff straps.But he broke through three pairs before cabin staff and passengers finally managed to bind his wrists and feet. He was arrested when the plane landed at Heathrow.Col Roberts denies being drunk on an aircraft. The case continues.
