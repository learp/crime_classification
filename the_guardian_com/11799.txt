Police and Olympic organisers have warned that scam websites are trying to sell non-existent tickets for the 2012 London Games but have unveiled plans to clamp down on thousands of known touts.Detective Inspector Nick Downing, leader of the Metropolitan police's 36-strong Operation Podium taskforce, said it would employ a range of tactics including seizing the assets of known touts and obtaining exclusion orders around the Games.Following the release of price and schedule details for the 6.6m tickets that will be available to members of the public from 15 March, the London organising committee is launching an online checker so prospective purchasers can find out whether ticket sites are genuine.Organisers said they had also already bought up hundreds of domain names to try to prevent overseas operators from selling unauthorised tickets for the Olympics, which is illegal under legislation passed to stage the Games.Recent major sporting events and music festivals have been hit by a spate of scam websites that take payment for tickets and hotel rooms that do not exist.In the UK, only the official website, travel partner Thomas Cook and hospitality providers Prestige Travel and Jet Set Travel are authorised to sell tickets."This is the greatest show on Earth â€“ it is our objective to make sure it doesn't degenerate into the greatest scam on Earth," said Lord Coe, the chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (Locog)."This is a very complex area but it is our objective to make it as hard as possible for this process to be subverted."Downing said British ticket touts were an "unwanted export" and were prevalent at sporting and music events around the world, with a close-knit network running sophisticated operations."They have a business model they follow and we are now looking to break down that business model to make it harder for them to operate."He said that they would be targeted in the runup to the Games, using a range of powers including seizure of assets, fraud legislation and exclusion orders.He said his unit had already made 32 arrests for a variety of offences since it was set up in June 2010 and had run nine separate operations that had uncovered clear links between networks of ticket touts and organised crime.Downing warned touts they would face a "hostile environment" during the Games but accepted it would be impossible to stamp them out entirely.Paul Deighton, Locog's chief executive, said that it would take a "commonsense" approach to ticket holders distributing them among their family and friends but that it had the ability to track the buyer of every ticket.A key driver of its ticketing strategy was to distribute them to ensure they got into the hands of fans who would not want to sell them on. The six-week sales period would avoid the need for panic, he said, and Locog would provide a mechanism where unused tickets could be resold at face value."This is one area where I draw on my old financial services background. When you sell shares or bonds, the key thing is to get them into the hands of the people who want them. This is focused on getting these tickets into the hands of people who will not part with them for any price," he said.But he acknowledged that one of the biggest challenges would be managing the 1.06m tickets that will be distributed to other national Olympic associations, each of which has its own arrangements with official resellers.He said their allocations would be targeted according to their track record of success in previous Games, the size of their team and the number of tickets they had previously had."We have a very clear contract with the authorised ticket resellers that they use to market the tickets. It is crystal clear: any illicit activity and we just don't give them the tickets."Also, London 2012 organisers said they have taken inspiration from Roman amphitheatres and US baseball stadiums to design temporary venues for the Games that make the capital's landmarks a star attraction.New computer-generated images showed how archery events staged on the hallowed turf at Lord's, equestrian events in Greenwich Park and the purpose-built whitewater canoeing course at Lee Valley will look next summer.The London Games, won partly on the promise it would not leave behind any white elephants, is using four times as many temporary seats as other recent Olympics. Some will form temporary arenas at London landmarks while others will build up the capacity at new and existing sports venues.
