The nursery will reopen tomorrow.Superintendent Sara Glenn said tonight: "The investigation was swift and thorough and I am confident there is no case to answer."

We have officers making sure she is well looked after."In a full statement, the force said: "The safety of children is Dorset police's top priority and working together with our colleagues at [the] borough of Poole children's service and Bournemouth and Poole primary care trust it is our duty to respond to any allegation that suggests a child is at risk."This investigation has now concluded and the police decision is that no further action will be taken and the person arrested has therefore been released from any bail requirement."The decision to reopen the nursery was taken after consultation with Ofsted.
