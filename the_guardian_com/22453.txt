Relatives of murder victims will be given the right to speak out in open court about the effect of the loss of their loved ones on their lives, under plans to be unveiled by the Department for Constitutional Affairs next week.They will be allowed to make their speeches, either in person or through their own lawyer, at the hearing which decides the killer's sentence.The idea, to be outlined in a consultation paper, is part of a programme intended to "rebalance" the criminal justice system more in favour of victims.At present, ministers believe, there is too much emphasis on defendants' rights and too little on victims' needs.The plan is not to influence the sentence imposed but to give relatives an opportunity to vent their grief in open court as part of the criminal justice process, rather than outside on the court steps.At present, although the trial of a loved one's killer is acknowledged to put bereaved relatives under severe strain, they have no one to represent them in court and no voice, unless they are witnesses at the trial.A criminal trial has traditionally been seen as a contest between the state and the accused, with only an incidental role for victims.Under the present system, relatives have only the option of making a written victim impact statement, which is filed with the court papers.Judges are told that they can take account of the impact of the crime on the victim in passing sentence, but to disregard any opinion the victim expresses about the sentence that should be passed.As part of the new "victims' rights" agenda, families of murder victims will be able to have their own lawyer to help with the trauma of the trial and to speak up for them in court. Legal aid could pay for the lawyer if a family qualifies on financial grounds.Relatives will also have the right to answer back if the victim's character is maligned as part of the accused's defence - for instance, if it is claimed that the defendant was provoked by the victim's behaviour.Victim impact statements date back to the mid-1970s in the United States, where most states allow courtroom speeches by the families of homicide victims.Sentencing hearings in the US and Canada often feature impassioned pleas from several family members who may ask for a particular sentence. Speeches are sometimes posted later on family websites devoted to the victim's memory.However, the statements are controversial in the US, where critics argue that the speeches introduce an arbitrary element into the sentencing process and may lead to longer prison terms for killers whose victims' relatives happen to be particularly eloquent.One way round such fears is to allow the relatives to speak after the sentence has been handed down, some critics suggest.
