A gang of burglars stole more than 100 gold boxes and other treasures during an early morning raid yesterday on Waddesdon Manor, home of the celebrated Rothschild collection. Five burglars, described as "professionals" wearing boiler suits and balaclavas, were believed to have raided the National Trust-owned stately home near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, Thames Valley police said. Officers said the raiders "knew exactly what they wanted". Cautious estimates have valued the losses in the tens of thousands of pounds. The manor's website describes the gold boxes as "one of the most superb features" of the collection. It was thought the burglars escaped using a blue Toyota Hi-Lux car which had been stolen from Ludgershall. Police made an extensive search using tracker dogs and a helicopter, but the suspected getaway car was later found burned out and dumped.
