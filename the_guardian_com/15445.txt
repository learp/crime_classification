A headteacher is in hospital after she was stabbed in the face and neck with a screwdriver.The 39-year-old was attacked as she got out of her car outside her home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, just after 5pm on Thursday.Police were called to the scene following reports that the woman had been stabbed three times. She was airlifted to hospital and is in a serious condition, although her injuries were not thought to be life-threatening.The alleged assailant was reportedly wrestled to the ground by a passing motorist. A 47-year-old local man was arrested at the scene and is being questioned on suspicion of attempted murder.Detective Inspector Andy Aston, of Greater Manchester police, said: "This incident will understandably have caused a lot of concern and anxiety in the local area and I'm sure everyone in the community will be thinking of the woman and wishing her a full recovery after her ordeal."I also understand there may be lots of rumour and speculation about what has happened but I would stress that, as we are still at the outset of our investigation, it is important we establish all the facts first. However, what I can say is there is no threat to anyone else in the community and it is also important to stress that reports about this being a neighbour dispute or neighbour feud are wrong, so I would ask that people do not speculate. We will of course keep the community informed of any developments with this case."
