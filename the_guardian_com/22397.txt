A twinge of guilt may just have resulted in the return of the amethyst stone that formed part of the moderator of the Church of Scotland's ceremonial ring, stolen in a burglary last Christmas Eve.The stone was returned anonymously in an un-postmarked, handwritten envelope sent to the church's head office in Edinburgh, nine months after the break-in at the Helensborough home of the Right Reverend John Christie.The engraved gold ring in which it was set, however, has not been returned. Insurers and the police think it may have been melted down.The church's insurance company, Ecclesiastical, is comparing the return of the stone to the plot of a Dan Brown novel, and as the conclusion of one of its most intriguing heritage insurance claims in recent years. Clare Pardy, its fine art and heritage underwriting manager, said: " It is enormously satisfying when we are able to recover important historic artefacts like this. The monetary value is almost irrelevant. What matters is the restoration of a long-standing tradition. Even though the gold band has not been returned, we will reset the stone in a new but identical band, so that it can be returned to the moderator to play its traditional role in the Church of Scotland's ceremonies."The ring, which has passed from moderator to moderator for more than a century, was engraved with a burning bush and the Latin motto nec tamen consumebatur which, in line with the Biblical story from Exodus, means "yet it was not consumed". It was among a number of personal items stolen from the moderator's home, none of which have been recovered. An arrest has been made.Katri Link, a spokeswoman for the insurers said: "I don't know whether someone had a pang of conscience, or whether they just found the ring difficult to sell on."
