Controversy surrounding the age of criminal responsibility in England dates back centuries, and has been revisited each time a high-profile case results in the conviction of a young child. England once had the lowest age of criminal responsibility in Europe, with children as young as seven deemed capable to have offended under the common law. Since 1963 primary legislation has provided for criminal convictions from the age of 10 – still one of the lowest ages of criminal responsibility in Europe – with only Scotland and Switzerland having lower ages, at eight and seven respectively.The conviction today of a 10-year-old and an 11-year old for attempted rape reinforces the need to retain that age, some prosecutors and lawyers say. But many campaigners argue that children under 12 cannot understand wrongdoing and should not face prosecution. Their calls to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 14 form part of a package of demands for changes to the way the criminal justice system deals with children, including holding trials in open court with media and public spectators, the questioning of child witnesses in court, and the use of custodial sentences. They argue that children should be dealt with through intensive supervision in a non-custodial environment, rather than through detention and punishment.In 2009 the House of Lords looked again at whether young offenders older than 10 should be prosecuted if they did not know their actions were wrong. Ruling in an appeal case, brought by lawyers acting for a boy aged 12 who was convicted of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, the law lords found that a young offender had no such defence under English law.The issue could prove divisive for the new government. The Conservatives have distanced themselves from calls for the age of criminal responsibility to be raised, while the Liberal Democrats have supported the calls.
