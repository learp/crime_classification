ITV News was this afternoon allowed back into press conferences about the murder of Joanna Yeates, after Avon & Somerset police lifted a ban on the broadcaster.Avon & Somerset constabulary repealed its ban following what it considered an "accurate and counterbalanced" report on ITV's lunchtime news.The force prohibited ITV News reporters from attending this morning's press briefing on the murder of the Bristol landscape architect, after broadcasting what it deemed an "unfair, naive and irresponsible" report on ITV1's News at Ten last night.According to ITV's head of home news, Toby Castle, police said the broadcaster was allowed to attend future press conferences after "accurate and counterbalanced reporting at lunchtime".However, the constabulary said it would not "hesitate to adopt similar tactics" if the media "hampers our investigation".An ITV News spokesman said the broadcaster was not party to any agreement to run favourable reports to retain access to press briefings.The force already complained to Ofcom over last night's News at Ten report, which was critical of its investigation into the 25-year-old's murder, claiming that police were no closer to finding her killer 10 days after her body was found.Reporters from ITV News were turned away from the press conference, and reporters from the broadcaster's regional operations were only allowed in if they agreed not to share their footage.David Mannion, the editor-in-chief of ITV News, called the force's decision "irresponsible" and claimed it had developed into "an issue about the freedom of the press".• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
