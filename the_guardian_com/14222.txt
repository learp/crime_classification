A firearms officer has said that Mark Duggan had been shot after raising a weapon at police, but said he had omitted this fact from the first statement he made about the incident.The shooting of Duggan on 4 August 2011 in Tottenham, north London, triggered riots that spread across the capital and to other cities across the country.The firearms officer was giving evidence at the trial of the man accused of supplying the gun to Duggan.The accused, Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, denies handing over the gun just 15 minutes before Duggan was confronted by police and shot.A jury at Snaresbrook crown court in east London heard the firearms officer, known as W70, give a dramatic and detailed account of the shooting from behind a screen.W70 told the jury Duggan raised a handgun and was shot, falling to the ground as officers surrounded him after having forced a taxi he was travelling in to stop.Hutchinson-Foster's barrister, Stuart Denney QC, asked W70 about the fact that his initial "short-form" report of the shooting did not mention Duggan raising a gun. However, this was mentioned in a fuller report made 48 hours later.Denney asked: "Would it be entirely incorrect to suggest that you left out details such as that until you and your brother officers could check you were all singing from the same hymn sheet?""That is not true, they are deliberately brief," the officer replied.Denny asked: "Did you see any sign of a police officer bringing a non-police weapon to the scene? Did you see any police officer moving a non-police weapon?"W70 replied no to both questions.W70's account was that Duggan appeared to raise the weapon from beneath the jacket he was wearing.The firearms officer told the jury that after police stopped the taxi, he was five metres away from Duggan. He said Duggan could be seen hiding something under the left-hand side of his jacket, in a pocket or in the waistband of his trousers."It very much appeared he was concealing something in his right hand with that jacket," W70 said."As he was pivoting in that position [to exit the car], concealing something in his right hand, at the same time he has very quickly drawn out his right hand from the left-hand side of his waistband and inside his jacket. He was holding a self-loading pistol or a handgun."As he has quickly drawn his right hand up and out of his jacket I have heard two shots from my left."Duggan fell to his knees clutching his chest and W70 said he pushed him to the ground. The officer said he had no doubt Duggan was holding a handgun.After the shots W70 and 12 other officers searched Duggan for a gun but could not find one.Denney, defending Hutchinson-Foster, asked what had happened to the gun.The firearms officers replied: "I have no recollection of what happened to the firearm after I saw it exiting the jacket."In evidence earlier this week, the jury were told by an officer that a gun was found nearby. The crown say a BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun, modified to fire 9mm bullets, was recovered.The trial continues on Monday.
