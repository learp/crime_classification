The murder trial of a young mother accused of drowning her daughter in the bath was dropped today when she admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.Laura Fletcher, 22, sat quietly in the dock at Liverpool crown court with three psychiatric nurses as prosecutors accepted the plea and a judge cancelled preparations for the trial.The court heard that two doctors, working independently of one another, had agreed that Fletcher was suffering from serious mental illness at the time of the tragedy earlier this year.Chloe Fletcher – who was four and part-way through her first year at nursery school in Wallasey – died some time between 26 April, when she was last seen, and the early hours of 30 April, when her mother walked to a nearby phone box and called the police.Judge Henry Globe QC, the recorder of Liverpool, told the court that there was uncertainty about exactly what had happened over the three days. "There was an issue as to whether she tried to take her own life after the death of her daughter," he said. A cord had been found in a cupboard, tied to a water pipe.Fletcher sat impassively through the 20-minute hearing, wearing a salmon-pink blouse and with her hair in a bun.The court heard that when police arrived at the red-brick semi they found Fletcher waiting inside and the body of Chloe laid out, fully dressed, on a bed upstairs. Fletcher was interviewed by police and detained.She was later transferred to psychiatric hospital under the Mental Health Act and examined by the two independent specialists, who had written "extremely long and detailed reports".Chloe was described by neighbours as "a lovely little child who would always say 'hi' when you saw her". It emerged soon after the arrest that the family had been in contact with Wirral social services and other agencies.A serious case review, commissioned by the local Safeguarding Children's Board, has been examining the circumstances and will report after the end of legal proceedings. Judge Globe adjourned sentencing until 9 October to give time for a third doctor, who is currently treating Fletcher, to submit a further report.Neil Flewitt QC, defending, said Fletcher realised that a prison sentence was possible in place of a hospital order. He told the court: "Her doctors are satisfied she understands the nature of the proceedings and implications of the plea she has entered."Andrew Menary QC, prosecuting, said: "At the relevant time Laura Fletcher was suffering from a serious mental illness. Both doctors have independently reached the same conclusion, that it was likely that the abnormality of mind caused her to do what she did. The crown accepts the manslaughter plea."Fletcher spoke only to admit the charge.
