A current affairs programme that screened an interview with the five men suspected of the murder of Stephen Lawrence was right to televise it, the Independent Television Commission has ruled.The ITC rejected the complaints of 15 viewers who claimed that the interview, by Martin Bashir for the launch of ITV's Tonight programme in April, was offensive because it gave the men a platform on which to defend themselves. Three other viewers claimed that the five had been treated too harshly by Bashir. The ITC said it was persuaded the interview did not breach taste and decency standards. Bashir's "robust style of questioning was anything but a 'platform' for the five". Neither did it support complaints that they had been treated too harshly: none had been forced to participate.
