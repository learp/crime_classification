In my opinion, based on medical evidence, they clearly prevented far more serious injuries to Chloe."Officers were at the scene within minutes of the stabbing by the main gates. Johnson said: "On arrival, they saw that there was indeed a young lady, who we since know to be a pupil at the school, with serious injuries, believed to be knife wounds."They also found that a young man, who we have since established does not attend the school, had been detained by members of the public here in the street."Johnson said the injuries to Chloe's upper body and face were no longer life threatening and that she was conscious.Wollaston councillor Margaret Cowell, who lives nearby, said: "I've lived here 50 years and in all that time I've never heard a police car go up with its sirens on."Ridgewood's head, Clive Nutting, said: "Police were called to the school today before 8.50am after one of the pupils was attacked on their way to school."
