Lord Lane, the former lord chief justice of England and Wales, perhaps best known for his judgment in throwing out the appeal of the Birmingham Six before their convictions were later quashed, has died at the age of 87.Despite enjoying a mostly distinguished career, it is his role during the appeal case of the Birmingham Six for which he is often remembered.At the time of the trial Lord Lane said: "The longer this case has gone on, the more convinced this court has become that the verdict of the jury [at Lancaster crown court in 1975] was correct."Seen in hindsight, these words have returned to haunt him throughout his retirement.The convictions were quashed four years later on the grounds that confessions to police officers had been improperly admitted in evidence.Born Geoffrey Dawson Lane, he was lord chief justice between 1980 and 1992.Lord Falconer, the lord chancellor, paid tribute to him last night. "Lord Lane was a great lawyer and compassionate judge," he said."Though he is perhaps most associated in the public's mind with the Birmingham Six case, that should not overshadow his lasting contribution to the law as a high court judge, lord justice of appeal and as a lord chief justice."Lord Lane is widely regarded as having been a highly skilled and effective lord chief justice of England and Wales during a period of challenge for an outdated criminal law system.Legal experts view him as one of the judges who put criminal law on a modern footing. He was renowned for his attentiveness during hearings, and enjoyed an impressive judicial record for impartiality.The former lord chief justice, famed in legal circles for his intellect, was educated at Shrewsbury and went on to read classics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he excelled as a scholar and a sportsman.Before pursuing a legal career, Lord Lane served in the RAF during the second world war, reaching the rank of squadron leader.He was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in 1946, before becoming a QC in 1962. He served as a high court judge between 1966 and 1974, and as lord justice of appeal from 1974 to 1979.After retiring in 1992, he accepted an invitation from the Prison Reform Trust to chair an independent committee to consider the mandatory life sentence for murder.Lord Lane felt that the mandatory life sentence was an anachronism that had the potential to result in injustice.His is survived by his wife of 60 years, Jan, and their son.
