One in four young women who regularly go to clubs and pubs had their drinks spiked last year, according to the first national survey of the crime. It revealed that as many as 30 women a week were potential rape victims after their drinks were spiked.The number of such rapes is not known, but the survey, by the Guardian and the Channel 4 programme Dispatches showed that thousands of people of club-going age, mostly women, but also gay men, have had their drinks spiked. It is a crime that is extremely difficult to prove. Traces of the drugs used can disappear from the body within 12 hours. The survey found many women had no memory of what happened to them, either waking up with a strange man, or being helped home by friends. Researcher Kate Quine said: "What was quite moving was that a lot of the time some people would be very sincere and very confused about what had happened to them. "It would be very much a case of they had had one drink and their friends were telling them how they were acting weirdly and they could not remember anything at all." In the past five years, only 15 men have been convicted for drug facilitated rape. Next month the police will begin a national survey, recording all drug rape and drink-spiking complaints.
