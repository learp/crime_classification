Two Leeds United fans told an inquest yesterday how they tried to give the kiss-of-life to a stabbed friend, as a gang of Turkish football supporters kicked them and hit them with home-made clubs.Mark Valentine, who was in Istanbul for his team's Uefa Cup semi-final against Galatasaray, told the Leeds inquest that he was knocked forward by one blow into the prone body of Christopher Loftus, 35, who died of stab wounds.Mr Valentine said he had spotted Loftus lying in the street during fighting between fans. Some 50 Turkish fans had mounted an "organised ambush," he said, hurling cafe chairs and hitting out with pieces of wood.Loftus, a telecoms engineer, and Kevin Speight, 40, a publican, died in the violence in April 2000. A former Turkish soldier was jailed for 15 years for their murder but the conviction was quashed and a retrial ordered by a court in Ankara.Another Leeds fan, Peter Hopton, told the hearing that he had also tried mouth-to-mouth on Loftus and then put him in the recovery position.Summarising his evidence, the coroner, David Hinchliff, said: "You started to roll Mr Loftus on his side and saw a large pool of blood underneath him. You thought then that he might be dead but you kept this to yourself. While still kneeling on the floor, you started being hit and kicked by Turks."The hearing continues.
