Three white officers who won a claim of race discrimination against the Metropolitan police have been awarded a total of £90,000 in compensation, it emerged yesterday.Detective Constable Tom Hassell, 60, Acting Detective Inspector Paul Whatmore, 39, and Detective Sergeant Colin Lockwood, 55, won their case against Scotland Yard on Monday following an employment tribunal in Stratford, east London. The men faced disciplinary action after an Asian officer alleged that Mr Hassell had made racist remarks at a training day in 1999. Later cleared on appeal, they said they were victims of political correctness. Scotland Yard today confirmed that the two parties had agreed a settlement. Mr Hassell is to receive £25,000 - £15,000 for "injury to feelings" and £10,000 in "aggravated damages". Mr Whatmore and Mr Lockwood will both received £32,500. Mr Lockwood told the Evening Standard: "We have had to fight tooth and nail for this compensation but it is still a fraction of what some other officers from minority ethnic groups have been awarded in the past." Mr Hassell brought the case after the men were investigated for remarks he apparently made during a police training session in 1999. The tribunal heard that in a bungled presentation on Islam, Mr Hassell referred to Muslim headwear as "tea cosies", mispronounced Shi'ites as "shitties" and said he felt sorry for Muslims who fasted during Ramadan. Although Mr Hassell apologised immediately, a complaint was made by Det Sgt Shabnam Chaudhri, who also criticised Mr Whatmore and Mr Lockwood for not taking appropriate action over Mr Hassell's words. Giving evidence, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, denied trying to leave the officers "hanging out to dry" over the comments simply because they were white.
