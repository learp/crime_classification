Five members of a gang of armed robbers were found guilty today of stealing £53m from a Securitas depot in the UK's biggest ever cash robbery.They were convicted by an Old Bailey jury over the robbery in Tonbridge, Kent, in February 2006.The gang got away with what was described as a "king's ransom" in cash but left behind £153m because they could not fit any more into their lorry.The raiders, seen in CCTV footage wearing balaclavas and holding guns including a shotgun and an AK47, threatened to kill staff in the depot if they did not cooperate.The jury of seven women and three men was sent out earlier this month by trial judge Mr Justice Penry-Davey.Today some of the conspirators were convicted for their part in a heist as spectacular as it was doomed.The gang convicted today were: Lea Rusha, 35, a former roofer of Lambersart Close, Southborough, Tunbridge Wells, Kent; car salesman Stuart Royle, 49, of Allen Street, Maidstone, Kent; unemployed Jetmir Bucpapa, 26, of Hadlow Road, Tonbridge; garage owner Roger Coutts, 30, of The Green, Welling, south-east London; and Emir Hysenaj, 28, a Post Office worker, of New Road, Crowborough, East Sussex. They had denied charges of conspiracy to kidnap, conspiracy to rob and conspiracy to possess firearms.Car dealer John Fowler, 59, of Elderden Farm, Chart Hill Road, Staplehurst, Kent, was cleared of all charges.The jury later acquitted a seventh man, signwriter Keith Borer, 54, of Hempstead Lane, Maidstone, Kent, who was charged with handling stolen money.The scale of the robbery meant police were certain to focus huge resources on the case and the gang made basic mistakes - DNA was found on masks.The verdicts at the Old Bailey come after a seven-month trial that heard the robbers were forced to leave more than £150m behind because it would not fit inside the 7.5-tonne lorry.The night raid, in February 2006, began when two gang members posing as police officers kidnapped the depot manager Colin Dixon, 51.After being pulled over for what he thought was a routine check, he was told by two men dressed in police uniforms he was being arrested for speeding offences. They put Dixon into the vehicle and handcuffed him.They later appeared at the bunker-style cash depot with Dixon at 1.30am. Staff thought it was their boss arriving with the police and allowed them through the high steel fence.The gang then ran inside with guns and took control of the 14 Securitas staff on duty, handcuffing them and making them lie on the floor while they used a forklift truck and a shopping trolley to move cages full of cash to the getaway truck, which was sat in the loading bay.The raid was a "tiger kidnapping", so called because of its predatory nature, in which Dixon's wife, Lynn, 45, and their child were held hostage to force the depot manager to comply.Colin Dixon called the raid "the worst night of my life". At one stage in the depot, he told his staff: "Just do whatever the bloke says."One member of staff was so convinced the depot, which stores millions of pounds in banknotes before they are redistributed to banks and cash machines, was so impregnable he thought the robbery was an exercise.The whole raid took only one hour and six minutes. The court heard that as the robbers left, they told staff: "Don't do anything silly - we know where you live." One robber thanked them sarcastically for their "cooperation" as they locked them in cages where the money had been stored.The prosecution was aided by testimony from Michelle Hogg, a 32-year-old hairdresser who had created the latex masks worn by the gang, and who was originally charged with conspiracy. She started the trial as a defendant before turning crown witness.So far, £21m of the stolen money has been recovered. A large chunk of the remainder is thought to be in Northern Cyprus, which has no UK extradition treaty. Some of the money is thought to be in Morocco.At least two further trials connected with the case are expected this year, although one of the accused is resisting extradition attempts from Morocco. One key figure remains at large.
