Police are searching for a group of up to four teenage boys who set fire to a man as he lay asleep while sunbathing in a park.The 37-year-old victim, who suffered serious burns to his back, was attacked in Kirkdale, Merseyside, last night.Police said he was woken shortly before 8pm by an intense pain in his back and found himself on fire. They believe he was attacked by a gang of four youths who set his clothes on fire and ran off.The man was taken to Royal Liverpool University hospital where he will require surgery but his condition is not thought to be life threatening.Detective Chief Inspector Tim Keelan, of Merseyside police, said one of the man's shoes was missing and he believed the offenders may have run off with it."This was a particularly callous attack on a man who had fallen asleep in the summer sunshine," he said. "This is a main route in and out of the city and I would appeal to any motorists, or pedestrians, who saw anything to contact us."The offenders are thought to be between 14 and 16 years old. One was wearing a dark top and the others had light-coloured clothing. Keelan appealed for anyone who had seen a brown Kicker-style shoe to come forward.People living nearby went to the man's aid and called the emergency services.Police spoke briefly to the victim in hospital last night and were hoping to speak to him again today.
