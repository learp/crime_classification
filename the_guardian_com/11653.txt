An abusive husband has been convicted of gunning down his mother-in-law on her doorstep in Pakistan in a revenge killing after his wife left him.Tariq Rana, 31, shot Ghulam Asia at her house in Pakistan in retaliation after 28-year-old Ayesha Riaz split up with him. Rana travelled from his Wolverhampton home to track down and murder her relatives. He went to Asia’s home in Lahore with an unnamed accomplice, dressed as a delivery man.The pair rang the doorbell and when Asia, 49, went to the gate to sign for the delivery, Rana shot her. She died hours later from internal injuries caused by two gunshot wounds.Rana then made a series of telephone calls to Riaz’s brothers, threatening to kill them all unless she came back to him, according to police.Rana will be sentenced on 31 July at the Old Bailey after he was convicted at Woolwich crown court of murder.He claimed during the trial that he had nothing to do with the shooting and was at Asia’s home with a bodyguard to try to reconcile with his wife.An argument ensued, during which two gunshots were fired by either the bodyguard or a member of Asia’s own family, he told the jury.Rana was prosecuted in the UK under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 for the attack on 27 July 2013. The act gives authority for a UK national to stand trial for a murder committed overseas.DCI Tim Duffield of the Metropolitan police’s homicide and major crime command, described Rana as a violent and controlling man who murdered his mother-in-law “in the most callous and brutal way”.“This was not a spontaneous event, but rather a revenge-driven premeditated attack aimed at causing the maximum distress and suffering to his estranged wife and her family,” he said.“It is also important to recognise the considerable assistance we received from the Pakistani authorities, without which justice for Mrs Asia’s family would not have been possible.“My deepest sympathies go out to Mrs Asia’s family who have shown great dignity and courage throughout.”Rana’s sister Nargus Ahmed, 33, and brother-in-law Muhammed Adeel, 35, were both acquitted of assisting an offender following the four-week trial.
