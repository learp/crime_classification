A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a police officer died last night while on duty in north London.Two police officers were called to a home in Brinkburn Gardens, Wembley, at around 5.45 pm yesterday following reports of a disturbance. A man was arrested for assault at the scene but the charge was upgraded to murder after the officer collapsed and died.Few details emerged last night of the events that lead up to the police officer's death. He had at first complained of feeling ill minutes after the incident took place, police sources said, but then fell to the floor outside the address.A disturbance that preceded his death is not believed to have involved any weapons. A post mortem will be held today.A senior Scotland Yard source could not rule out the possibility that the alleged assault triggered a heart attack. Peter Smyth, vice chair of the Metropolitan branch of the Police Federation, said that fellow officers would be stunned by the news. He said: "Obviously we're very shocked. It's particularly poignant because of the time of year."Our thoughts are with the friends, family and colleagues of the officer. We will do everything we can to support them."A Metropolitan police spokesman said: "On arrival officers entered the address where a man was arrested for assault on a police officer. An officer subsequently collapsed outside the address."London Ambulance Service attended and the officer was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead."The death is a reminder of the dangers officers face on duty. Earlier this year PC Ricky Grey was shot in the head by a man who then turned the gun on himself. Peter Medlicott, 33, shot 43-year-old PC Grey with a rifle he used to shoot vermin.In November 2005 PC Sharon Beshenivsky was shot dead in as she responded to an alarm at a travel agent's shop in Bradford. Two years earlier Detective Constable Stephen Oake, 40, was murdered by Kamel Bourgass during a raid on a flat in Manchester.
