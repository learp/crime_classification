Prisons in England and Wales are almost at full capacity and urgent action is needed to avert a summer of chaos, a report warned today.The current jail population in England and Wales is 77,004, around a thousand spaces short of capacity. Research by the Prison Reform Trust said the record population of 77,774 could be passed in "a couple of months".The campaign group said scarce prison places should be reserved for more serious offenders, or there would be a "chaotic mess" with "police cells, prefabs, prison motorway vans and decommissioned hulks" having to be used to house prisoners.Last October, prisoner numbers in England and Wales reached an all-time high and were temporarily just 373 shy of absolute capacity. Today the PRT said that the figures had dipped over Christmas, but that the rate of incarcerations had increased again since the turn of the year.The trust's study said: "The annual Christmas slowdown in processing court cases pulled [the prison system] back from the brink of its capacity limit. From the beginning of 2006 the pace began to pick up again."The trust added: "What is now becoming an annual crisis in capacity looks set to hit earlier and harder in 2006."The PRT said many officials admitted privately that the prison system would be "entirely full" by the summer, and that new admissions would have to be temporarily suspended.A previous overcrowding crisis in 2002 led to inmates being kept in police stations at a far greater cost than keeping them in normal prison cells.The study said: "Prisons should be places that hold securely, and [attempt] to rehabilitate, serious and dangerous offenders. The skills and focus of those who run them should be wholly directed towards that aim in the interests of public safety."Instead, rapidly rising numbers have reduced many prisons to locked warehouses in which prison officers are called upon to act merely as turnkeys, processing people in transit from jail to overcrowded jail."The reconviction rate of former inmates leaving overcrowded prisons in 2004 was 64%, compared with 51% in 1992, the report said.Juliet Lyon, director of the PRT, told the BBC: "Overcrowding and reconviction rates are spiralling out of control."Unless government acts now to reserve scarce prison places for serious and violent offenders, the summer will collapse into a chaotic mess."
