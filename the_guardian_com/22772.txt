A recently retired Kent firefighter deported from Portugal during the Euro 2004 football tournament for inciting a riot faces an extradition hearing today that could see him returned to the country to serve out a two-year sentence.Garry Mann was arrested three hours after the riot in Albufeira on the Algarve and convicted within 24 hours under a fast-track process brought in for the championships. The court had one English-speaking interpreter, two lawyers representing 12 men and little opportunity for the accused to call witnesses.Mann was found guilty and accepted voluntary deportation from Portugal, understood at the time to be in place of serving his sentence in Britain. This led the then home secretary David Blunkett to declare: "I have not given up on the idea that we're going to nail this individual."Four years ago a magistrates court considering an application for a banning order to prevent Mann from attending football matches abroad found his trial to have contravened human rights standards and Justice Stephen Day refused to impose a ban.Earlier this year Mann was arrested under a European arrest warrant issued by Portugal, which is requesting his return to serve the two-year sentence.A magistrates court will today hear arguments on the manner of the Portuguese trial as Mann's lawyers fight the extradition.Mann has always maintained that he was drinking at the Blues Bar with his brother and a friend at the time of the Albufeira riot, involving about 100 people, which he was convicted of inciting.Mann's lawyer, Look-Chi Wang, said: "It would be a travesty if after a period of five years Garry is returned to Portugal to serve a sentence for a crime he did not commit. The object of the European arrest warrant is to facilitate the quick return of fugitives, but this has to be balanced with issues of human rights."Hugh Robertson, Mann's MP, said: "Having looked at Gary Mann's case in some detail over the years, I have real doubts about whether the correct and just verdict was reached. In addition, the case poses some real questions about the operation of the European arrest warrant."The extradition request came as a shock to Mann, who had returned to his job as a firefighter in Faversham, Kent, and to his partner, two daughters and four stepdaughters.He said: "I was just going to work one day and there was a knock on the door. After five years I've heard nothing from the police, nothing from the British government, nothing from the Portuguese government. I've never known I was due to serve a sentence."
