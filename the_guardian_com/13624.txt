Police have unearthed more potential human remains at a former children's home in Jersey. The discoveries were made by officers searching the cellar complex beneath Haut de la Garenne, where officers fear youngsters may have been murdered during decades of alleged sexual and physical abuse by the staff.The fresh findings are potentially the most significant development in the investigation since shards from a skull were removed from the care home five weeks ago. The results of carbon testing on the skull will be announced this week. Meanwhile, Jersey police are believed to have assembled a series of 'robust' cases against a number of individuals and arrests are imminent. After last week's BBC Panorama, which uncovered more cases of alleged abuse, Harper said that 'important information' against principal suspects had been received. However, he would not confirm whether former police officers were among those who were on their list of potential suspects. Forensic teams are continuing to search the third and fourth cellars found under the children's home.
