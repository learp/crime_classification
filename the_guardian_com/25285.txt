The attorney general, Dominic Grieve, is considering whether to put newspaper and broadcast editors in the dock for contempt of court after a judge dismissed the jury in the Levi Bellfield trial at the Old Bailey, blaming media coverage.The trial jury, which on Thursday convicted Bellfield of murdering schoolgirl Milly Dowler, had been due to continue deliberations on a separate charge that the former wheelclamper attempted to abduct 11-year-old Rachel Cowles in March 2002, the day before Dowler disappeared.Mr Justice Wilkie, said he was forced into the deplorable position of dismissing the jury after Bellfield's defence counsel, Jeffrey Samuels QC, argued there had been "avalanche of publicity adverse to the defendant".Wilkie, who stopped short of singling out individual papers or broadcasters for criticism, said material had strayed into allegations "of a hugely prejudicial nature".Some of the material was based on prosecution evidence submitted at a pre-trial hearing this year, which the judge had ruled inadmissable at trial. This included evidence from Bellfield's former partners, who claimed he had submitted them to repeated violent attacks. His former wife Johanna Collings said he had boasted about raping women.The judge also ruled out a retrial. Cowles, who is now 21, said she was "extremely hurt and angry that some of the media reporting has robbed me of justice".It is understood the attorney general's office believes the press is demonstrating a casual attitude towards its duty to report high-profile court cases responsibly, although it is not thought there are plans for a crackdown on the media or tightening of the policy on contempt.The penalty for contempt is up to two years in prison and an unlimited fine.The attorney general rarely uses his powers to bring contempt prosecutions, though Grieve did win permission in May to bring proceedings against the Sun and the Daily Mirror over their coverage of the police investigation into the murder of 25-year-old Joanna Yeates.Yeates's landlord, former teacher Chris Jefferies, was arrested on suspicion of murdering Yeates in December but released without charge. Dutch engineer Vincent Tabak has since admitted the manslaughter of Yeates but denied murder. He faces trial later this year. By this time several papers had already run negative profiles of the former English teacher.No date has been set for that contempt case but it is likely to be heard in the first two weeks of July, according to legal sources.
