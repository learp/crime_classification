A 15-year-old girl was found stabbed to death today in a block of flats in central London.A Metropolitan police spokesman said a man in his 30s had been arrested in Lambeth this afternoon in connection with the killing and was in police custody.The teenager was discovered with a number of wounds in Matheson Lang House in Baylis Road, near Waterloo station, Scotland Yard said.It is understood the girl's body was found in a lift."A murder inquiry has been launched," a police spokesman said. "Officers from the homicide and serious crime command are on their way to the scene."Officers were keeping an open mind in relation to the motive of the killing but it was not believed to be gang-related, Scotland Yard said.The girl's body was found by a neighbour returning home with her eight year old daughter, according to one resident, Sharon Moore. The woman described the teenager lying on the floor with a knife handle sticking out of her."One of our neighbours just brought her daughter in from school and opened the lift door and saw the young girl lying there and called the emergency services."Moore said residents in the flats were given security fobs on Friday as part of measures to tighten up security."You think you are fine once you are in the building, this is the last thing you expect... I feel very insecure and afraid for my children and for the other children in the block," she said.The girl has not been formally identified and a postmortem examination has not yet been arranged.A spokesman from the London ambulance service said it was called to the incident in south-east London at 3:45pm."We sent a fast response car, an ambulance, the air ambulance and an officer to the scene, the first of which arrived in under four minutes,'' a spokesman said."Sadly, despite extensive efforts to resuscitate the patient, she was pronounced dead at the scene."The victim, who has not yet been named, is the 16th teenager to die violently in London since the beginning of the year.Robert Knox, 18, who had a role in the latest Harry Potter film was stabbed to death in a fight outside the Metro Bar in Sidcup, 10 days ago. His death followed the murder of 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen, who was attacked on May 10 with a shard of glass outside a bakery in Lee, south-east London.Last week, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, announced that close to 200 weapons had been seized after officers stepped up stop and search measures as part of Operation Blunt 2, in response to a spate of knife crime in the capital.There have been more than 4,000 stop and search operations carried out so far by officers during the operation. Officers have also arrested more than 200 people and seized several 6in-carving knives, pen and craft knives, and kitchen knives, the most common weapons used in teenage stabbings.
