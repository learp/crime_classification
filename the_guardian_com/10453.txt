Abdulla, a highly educated young Iraqi doctor was a central figure in the three-man terrorist cell.He blamed the British and Americans for what had happened in his homeland since 2003, and wanted to give Britain a "taste of fear" and a sense of what life was like in a war zone.Born in Aylesbury, Bucks, Abdulla, 29, returned to Baghdad with his family when he was five and graduated from the University of Baghdad medical school in 2004.He returned to England later that year to continue his training and set up home in Cambridge where he met Kafeel Ahmed.Abdulla was well known for his encyclopedic knowledge of Islam and Arabic, and friends in Cambridge said he became increasingly angry about what was happening in his mother country.In May 2006, he visited Iraq for three months before joining the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley, Scotland, as a junior house officer in general surgery.Abdulla maintained that he was a 'healer not a killer' and the London attacks had been just a stunt.
