A website that pays the public to monitor live commercial CCTV footage has been criticised by civil liberties campaigners.Internet Eyes says it offers up to Â£1,000 to online subscribers who can spot crimes as they happen and click an alert button to notify the business owner."All too often criminals get away with crime because, although their activity is monitored by CCTV, it is not observed at the time of the offence but only later on reviewing the footage when it is too late to stop commission of the crime," said a spokesman for the company.Any company wanting to have its CCTV systems wired up to the site will have to pay a subscription and viewers who sign up can see the images on their screens.Every viewer is allowed five alerts each month to prevent abuse of the system. More than 13,000 people have indicated their interest and more are expected to join once it has launched. The cameras are based in stores across the UK, but the rewards are open to anyone from the EU.However, civil liberties campaigners say the idea encourages people to spy on each other. They urged anyone affected "to contact us with a view to legal action".Charles Farrier, of No CCTV, said: "This is the privatisation of the surveillance society - a private company asking private individuals to spy on each other using private cameras connected to the internet. Internet Eyes must be challenged." He said he feared people would upload copies of the live stream to file-sharing networks.A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said: "Our CCTV code of practice makes it clear that CCTV operators should use appropriately trained staff to monitor images."We have provided advice to Internet Eyes on its own data protection compliance. We will be checking to ensure it has followed this and investigate any complaints we receive."
