A man has been arrested over historic child abuse alleged to have taken place in north Wales.The man was held in Ipswich, Suffolk, on Tuesday morning over "a number of serious sexual offences against a number of individuals", the Serious Organised Crime Agency said. He is being taken to a police station in north Wales where he will be interviewed over recent allegations of historic abuse.The man is the first person to be arrested under Operation Pallial, launched in November, which focuses on allegations of abuse in children's homes in north Wales in the 1970s and 80s.A report on the progress of the investigation is due to be published on Monday. In December officers revealed they had received information from 105 potential victims.A high court judge, Mrs Justice Macur, has been appointed to carry out a separate review of the Waterhouse inquiry, which was set up in 2000 to look at alleged abuse. It focused on claims at homes in the former council areas of Gwynedd and Clwyd since 1974. Recently potential victims have said the inquiry examined only a fraction of the abuse that took place.The judge is looking at whether specific allegations were not investigated and urged alleged victims and all other interested parties to give further evidence.
