Police officers today threatened to stage protests over controversial reforms proposed by the home secretary, David Blunkett.Leaders of 126,000 rank and file officers are thought to be planning a mass rally at Wembley Arena against the changes, which will see overtime pay cut and only paid after an officer has worked 42 hours, rather than at the current level of 40.Civilian community support officers will also take on police duties and may be given police-style powers to use "reasonable force" to detain suspects, possibly with batons and CS sprays.The chairman of the Police Federation, Fred Broughton, said: "We are in the middle of difficult negotiations and we have a very angry workforce."Officers are disgruntled at the prospect of working longer hours for less money, and the proposals to introduce wardens and private security policing."A public rebellion by police officers - who are not allowed to strike - would be deeply uncomfortable for Mr Blunkett, but he has warned he will force through the changes if police fail to agree.A Home Office spokeswoman said: "The whole aim of the police reform programme is to make the police as effective as possible in reducing crime and the fear of crime. "To do this, the police service needs modern management and personnel practices." Glen Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said there was "absolutely massive anger" among rank and file police officers about the home secretary's proposals."I think Mr Blunkett is trying to paper over the cracks and the fact that that we are likely to lose police officers in the future. Certainly, the Met is likely to lose between half and two-thirds of its officers over the next 10 years," he said. The full scope for conflict between police officers and Mr Blunkett became apparent two weeks ago when the Police Federation accused the Home Office of publishing misleading "propaganda" about the reforms.In this week's edition of Police Review magazine, Mr Broughton warns: "If we feel that officers are not receiving fair and reasonable treatment we will not hesitate to take our case to a wider audience." The Police Federation claims that introducing civilian community support officers and another scheme to give police accreditation to private security guards and street wardens amount to privatised policing being introduced "by the back door".
