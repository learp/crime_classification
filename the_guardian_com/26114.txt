One of the prime suspects in the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence has been cleared of trafficking illegal immigrants into the UK in a trial where one of his close friends was jailed.Neil Acourt, who has changed his name to Stuart, walked free from Canterbury crown court yesterday. The case was dropped against him after there was found to be insufficient evidence to prove his involvement in trafficking John Caetano, 27, and Acourt had been charged jointly with concealing seven people from India and Ecuador in a van bound for Dover. The vehicle was stopped in the British zone of the Eurotunnel terminal in Calais as it was about to board a tunnel train. Two of the other Lawrence murder suspects, Gary Dobson and Jamie Acourt, Stuart's brother, were also questioned over the smuggling in December 1999, but not charged. Caetano, of Eltham, south east London, was at the wheel of the van when an immigration officer ordered the vehicle to stop. The illegal immigrants were found hiding behind 27 crates of lager. The jury heard from Caetano that he had been on holiday in France and that the seven had probably sneaked into the van while he shopped. He was sentenced to four and a half years in jail. After admitting a separate charge of possessing an offensive weapon, Acourt was sentenced to 50 hours community service and ordered to pay Â£100 court costs.
