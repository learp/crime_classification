The government's spending watchdog has attacked the failure of Britain's prisons to help inmates find jobs after being released.The Offenders' Learning and Skills Service provides prisoners with skills and training while inside. Half of those in custody have no qualifications and almost 40 per cent have a reading age below that of a competent 11-year-old. Studies suggest improved training could help reduce crime. But a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) has found the service's performance is patchy. 'It has made less progress than it might,' said Tim Burr, head of the NAO. 'Some of the fundamentals, which departments have known about for years, are still not in place - like identifying which courses most help offenders to get a job, which offenders need which skills, and helping more of them to finish a course.'
