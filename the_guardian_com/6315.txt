A woman juror was yesterday discharged by the judge in the Damilola Taylor murder trial at the Old Bailey.Mr Justice Hooper said the trial over the death of Damilola, 10, would continue with the remaining jury of four women and seven men. He told them: "I have decided she cannot any longer sit as a juror. I am not going to go into the matter with you." He warned them not to contact the discharged juror and said they should disregard any opinions she had expressed. The move is the latest in a series of dramatic developments since the trial began 10 weeks ago. On February 28, Mr Justice Hooper threw out the evidence of a 14-year-old girl who claimed she had witnessed Damilola being killed. Later that day he directed the jury to return not guilty verdicts on boy C, 17, one of four youths charged with murdering Damilola. On March 19, he gave a similar direction for boy D, 15, who was also discharged. Two 16-year-old brothers, boys A and B, remain charged with murder, manslaughter and assault with intent to rob. They deny the charges. Damilola died on November 27 2000, from a thigh injury caused by a broken beer bottle on the North Peckham estate, south London, where he lived. The prosecution alleges he was attacked as he walked home. The defence for boy A has argued the fatal injury could have been an accident. The case continues today.
