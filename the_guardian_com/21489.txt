A sex offender who stalked TV presenters Fiona Bruce and Emily Maitlis is facing life imprisonment after being convicted yesterday of a rape more than a decade ago.David Decoteau, 45, was caught after detectives used his DNA to investigate the attack in 1996, when he bound and gagged a 22-year-old shopworker in the storeroom of an Ann Summers shop in central London. A year later he was jailed for 12 years for the Christmas Day rape of a 15-year-old girl in Northolt, west London.The attack on the shopworker remained unsolved until the "cold case" team found a DNA match which was said to have been "one in a billion".He was found guilty at Southwark crown court of rape, false imprisonment, robbery, indecent assault and possessing a handgun with intent to commit robbery. He will be sentenced next month.The court heard that while Decoteau was in jail he had been writing to Ms Bruce and the Newsnight presenter Ms Maitlis, whom he called his "special lady".On arrest at his south London bail hostel, he was found to have pictures of Ms Maitlis on his wall and a DIY rape kit which included tips on "sexual deviancy".Detective Sergeant Jackie Murphy said: "David Decoteau is a dangerous sexual predator who has shown no remorse. The sentence will finally allow the victim to bring to a close this traumatic attack."The technology is such now that rapists cannot be confident they have got away with it."
