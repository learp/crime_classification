The Conservatives today demanded an independent inquiry into the Home Office criminal records debacle.David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said that it was "entirely inappropriate" for a civil servant to be handling the investigation into how 27,000 files on offences committed by Britons abroad were left sitting in the Home Office rather than filed on a police database.And he asked why a Home Office official had been suspended at the weekend for "admitting the truth" about the fiasco when ministers had not for "hiding it".The clashes between Mr Davis - who has previously claimed the scalp of Beverley Hughes, the junior home office minister, and helped hound the previous home secretary, Charles Clarke, out of his post - came as the row over the affair entered its second week.An unnamed Home Office official has been suspended over the failure, but argument still rages over how much information was given by the police to Home Office ministers about the growing backlog in record-keeping.At question time in the Commons, Mr Davis warned the government: "The public want the police to be able to do their job and as a result they want to know three things: what's gone wrong in this fiasco, who is responsible and what is going to be done about it."And he warned: "Since this may involve ministerial decisions, it is entirely inappropriate for a civil servant to carry out the inquiry."It's also bogus nonsense to claim that an internal investigation should preclude the public from knowing what has happened."At the centre of the row is a letter sent from the Association of Chief Police Officers to the Home Office in late 2005, alerting them to difficulties in entering data onto the police computer database.That was sent to the policing minister, Tony McNulty, but replied to by another junior minister in the department, Joan Ryan. The opposition are calling for replies and minutes regarding the letter to be published immediately.Mr Reid, Mr McNulty and Ms Ryan have insisted that they were not informed of the backlog in notifications of British criminals' European convictions or police requests for extra resources to clear it.But they have accepted that meetings were held between Home Office officials and police about the problem.Mr Davis demanded: "Why can you not publish the letters and minutes now?"Why can we have not an independent inquiry and why is it that civil servants get suspended for admitting the truth and ministers don't for hiding it?"Mr Reid told MPs that he had had "a very helpful discussion" with the EU's justice commissioner, Franco Frattini, this morning about the need for "stronger modifications and stronger standardisation" of EU-wide data-sharing.Mr Reid has already announced a root-and-branch review of Britain's criminal databases in a bid to quell the burgeoning records row.And Ms Ryan will meet her EU counterparts in Dresden this week to discuss improvements in systems for sharing information.Mr Davis asked today whether ministers were confident that criminal convictions from non-European countries were properly recorded on the PNC.And he asked whether foreign criminal convictions for foreign citizens approved to live and work in Britain were also recorded.Mr McNulty replied: "The position, as I understand it at the moment, is yes - in part rooted in Interpol - and beyond that it's rooted in bilateral and other relationships between the UK and other countries."He reiterated an earlier claim that he "could not say with confidence" that every record from every source was on the database.But he insisted: "I think the review that [Mr Reid] is carrying out will clear this matter up entirely and get to a stage where collectively the house can be assured in public protection terms."Mr Reid was not questioned directly about the debacle during question time, but alluded to it while responding to concerns about human trafficking.Referring to data collection systems, he said: "The old systems - as illustrated by some of the problems we are facing - have not always been able to cope."Sir David Normington, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, has appointed Dusty Amroliwala, director of human resources services, to work on the inquiry, which is expected to last about six weeks.
