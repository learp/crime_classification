The following update was added on Thursday 18 November 2010Mark Andrews appealed against his conviction for causing actual bodily harm. In November 2010 he won his appeal. The appeal judge said he was satisfied that Sgt Andrews did not intend to throw Ms Somerville into the cell and that injuries she suffered "were probably caused by her falling to the floor after letting go of the door frame. A police officer who was convicted and jailed after being caught on video assaulting a woman in custody is receiving his full police pay, it has emerged.Sergeant Mark Andrews, 37, left Pamela Somerville bleeding on the cell floor after the assault at Melksham police station in Wiltshire.He was jailed for six months after the assault was caught on CCTV and his actions were reported by a fellow police officer.Andrews was released from prison this week pending an appeal after serving six days of his sentence. Wiltshire's chief constable, Brian Moore, revealed Andrews was entitled to resume receiving his full salary.In papers prepared for a meeting of the Wiltshire police authority, Moore wrote: "Wiltshire police have invoked Home Office circular 8/07, which allows for the force to withdraw his salary on the grounds he was serving a custodial sentence further to conviction."Further to his successful bail application on 13 September 2010 the required conditions in relation to this provision were removed and Andrews returned to the status of being suspended on full pay."Chris Hoare, chairman of the Wiltshire police authority, said: "Whatever the impression that leaves with the public, there is no option under the police regulations but to continue to pay his salary."Asked if he thought this was a sane arrangement, Hoare replied: "It may not be, but I didn't draft the regulations."Somerville, 59, needed stitches to a gash above her eye after the attack in July 2008.She was arrested for failing to provide a sample for a breath test after being found asleep in her car. The charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence.Somerville, a market researcher from Chippenham, Wiltshire, described the attack as a "horrific nightmare".She said: "I will never forget it. I would love to be able to take a tablet to make me forget it but I never will."It was just a horrific nightmare. I thought they had mistaken me for a murderer or drug smuggler or terrorist."Passing sentence, deputy district judge Peter Greenfield said Andrews had abused his position of trust and only a custodial sentence was appropriate.The Wiltshire police assistant chief constable Patrick Geenty described Andrews's assault as "a disgraceful incident which breached the standards of care which every police officer gives to the public"."There is no place in Wiltshire police for an officer like this. I fully support the comments of the judge and the sentence that he has handed down."Andrews's appeal hearing is listed to begin at Oxford crown court on 15 November. A police conduct hearing, which will decide his future in the force, is scheduled to take place the same month.A spokesperson for the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it had no powers to act in the matter because "this is a local investigation."
