Many of the 43 police forces in England and Wales could be merged as a result of an official report published yesterday, heralding the biggest shake-up in the structure of British policing in 30 years.The review, by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, said 21st century threats like international terrorism and organised crime meant policing needed "significant rationalisation" of services to put it on a "stronger, more efficient footing."Denis O'Connor, former Surrey chief constable and the report's author, did not make any prescriptive recommendations, and the home secretary, Charles Clarke, is expected to give chief constables and police authorities about three months for consultation when he meets them on Monday.But the HMIC report pointed out that forces with less than 4,000 officers tended to fall below standard, with smallest forces faring worst. Thirty-six of the 43 forces have under 4,000 officers and 19 have fewer than 2,000.Mr O'Connor said: "Very few forces assessed fully meet the required standard. Larger forces are likely to have much greater capability and resilience, whilst smaller forces, in many cases, find it harder to provide the services to an acceptable standard."Vulnerability was particularly evident in relation to counter-terrorism, domestic extremism, serious and organised crime and public order. The review also highlighted concerns over smaller forces' ability to handle incidents like the Soham murders. But many forces, regardless of size, scored badly on intelligence.Policing representatives agree on a need for change, but there is no clear consensus on restructuring. It has been suggested the number of forces could be cut to between 20 and 30, but the Police Superintendents Association wants a single, national force with existing basic command units providing local policing.
