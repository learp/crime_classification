A home affairs select committee suggests that forced marriage should be criminalised. Weirdly, though, Keith Vaz, its Labour chairman, says that this would be a "bold step". Dear heavens. Forced marriage is sexual and domestic slavery, an affront to every human right protecting individual freedom, dignity and self-determination. It's quite clearly and obviously a world away from arranged marriage, which is an entirely consensual match-making process. There are no grounds whatsoever on which the practice can be defended, and those who wish to do so should be left in absolutely no doubt that this is the case. The "bold step" would be continuing to pander to such an outrageous form of abuse, as has been done with such abject cowardice for so many shameful years.
