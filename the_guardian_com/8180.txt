A series of blunders by police allowed a man to kill his pregnant ex-girlfriend less than a week after she reported that he had attacked and threatened to kill her, a report concluded yesterday.Police had two chances to arrest Hugo Quintas before he cut Hayley Richards' throat and on one occasion officers were directed to help a dog in a locked car rather than pick him up. The report from the Independent Police Complaints Commission highlighted "systemic" failures in the way Wiltshire police dealt with the case and recommended a raft of changes.Ms Richards, 23, of Trowbridge, Wiltshire, was murdered on Saturday June 11 last year by Quintas, who is serving life.On the previous Sunday Ms Richards dialled 999 to tell police that Quintas had assaulted and threatened to kill her. An officer went to her home, but it was judged that the risk of Quintas attacking again was low, though she was pregnant and recently separated from him, factors which ought to have rung alarm bells.Between June 5 and 11, the IPCC said, there were two opportunities to arrest Quintas. On one occasion Ms Richards told police he was in a pub in Trowbridge. Four officers were on patrol at the time, but by the time officers got to the pub Quintas had gone. On another occasion Quintas was stopped by traffic officers for a minor motoring offence. But they were from a neighbouring area, so let him go.The report also highlighted that the force's domestic violence unit did not try to contact Ms Richards until June 10. Even then the unit did not reach her, only trying her landline and not her mobile.The IPCC's commissioner, Ian Bynoe, said: "The force failed to give a victim of domestic violence the priority and protection she deserved."
