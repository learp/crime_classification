Two men were today found guilty of harassing a dolphin when they frolicked in the sea with it after leaving a party in the early hours of the morning.Michael Jukes, 27, and Daniel Buck, 26, were found guilty of intentionally or recklessly disturbing a wild animal under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.Dover magistrates court heard how the pair had "touched and stroked" Dave the dolphin as they went for a late-night swim at Sandgate, near Folkestone, Kent, in June last year.The bottlenose dolphin was a popular tourist attraction for visitors to the Kent coast, but a lack of recent sightings has led to speculation that Dave has since died.A witness to the incident on June 9 last year heard one of the men shout: "People pay hundreds of pounds to do this in Florida, and I'm doing it in Folkestone."During the trial, Buck admitted being pulled along by the dolphin by grabbing its dorsal fin, and Jukes said he had stroked its belly.The pair had decided to have a swim at about 5am after they had been to a party at a friend's house, where they had both been drinking heavily.The two men said they had not realised they were doing anything wrong in swimming with Dave, and even thought the animal had "enjoyed itself" as much as they had done.The presiding magistrate, John Offord, said a number of experts confirmed the dolphin's normal pattern of behaviour was disturbed and troubled by the defendants' actions in the sea.He referred to DVD footage of the incident filmed by a witness that showed the dolphin swimming towards the men and breaching the water, signs which showed the animal was distressed.James Barnett, of the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, said interaction with the defendants put the dolphin at risk of becoming tame, and therefore endangering it.Barnett, a vet with nearly 20 years' experience, explained that when dolphins become too familiar with humans they can become unpredictable and dangerous - and even make sexual advances towards them.In summing up, Offord said the defendants had refused to leave the water even when police ordered them to, and that they had admitted being drunk in interview.He described the pair's actions as those of "recklessness", rather than an intentional effort to disturb the dolphin.Jukes, a pipe fitter of Castle Hill Avenue, Folkestone, and Buck, a civil engineer of Church Road, Folkestone, looked shocked as the guilty verdict was read out. They were ordered to complete 120 hours of work in the community within the next 12 months, and pay Â£350 each in costs.
