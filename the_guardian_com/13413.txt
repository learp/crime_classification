Pauline Campbell, a former civil servant and college lecturer, was arrested outside Holloway prison yesterday while protesting about what she said was the inhuman treatment of women inmates.The arrest - her third - came after an alleged attempt to prevent a prison van from bringing inmates to the north London jail.The protest was her sixth in as many weeks, and followed the death of 28-year-old Heather Wait, who was the second woman to die in Holloway in recent weeks.Mrs Campbell, from Malpas in south Cheshire, has vowed to demonstrate outside every prison in Britain where a woman has died.She has been a vociferous critic of the prison system since the death of her 18-year-old daughter, Sarah, at Styal prison in 2003. Sarah, an only child, was the third of six women to die at the Cheshire jail in a 12-month period.Mrs Campbell's last protest was at Durham jail, where she was also arrested while allegedly trying to stop a van entering the prison. Yesterday Anne Owers, the chief inspector of prisons, described Durham's women's wing as "bleak and grim" and called the regime there "oppressive".The Home Office has now ordered the Prison Service to close down the women's unit at Durham.Speaking to the Guardian before her protest yesterday, Mrs Campbell said that her aim in trying to stop vans entering jails where a woman had died was to demonstrate that they were unsafe places which constantly failed to uphold the duty of care that the Prison Service has to all prisoners.As a bereaved mother, she says that she is aware of the effect of a premature death on the children and parents left behind."One of the worst imaginable things that can happen to a child is for its mother to die. Two-thirds of women prisoners are mothers. When a woman prisoner dies, not only does it remind me of the loss of my daughter, but, if she was a mother, there is the added pain of knowing that the motherless children will suffer. I speak from experience: my mother died when I was three."Deborah Coles, of the campaign group Inquest, attacked the Home Office's attitude to deaths in custody, saying that the government's answer to prison suicides had been to build more prisons."The humane solution to this shameful death toll is to stop sending some of the most damaged and vulnerable people in society to prison in the first place," Ms Coles said.Heather Wait was the eighth woman to die in a British jail this year.In 2003, 14 women took their own lives in British prisons - an all-time high.The Guardian has learned that a woman inmate who was taken from Holloway to hospital at the beginning of May remains in a coma.
