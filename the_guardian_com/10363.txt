Police investigating a string of rapes and attempted abductions in Northampton said yesterday they were no longer hunting a gang of "predatory men".After an eight-week operation by more than 50 officers, Northampton police took informal action against a 15-year-old girl for wasting their time over an alleged attempted abduction on August 1. They are now considering action against an 18-year-old over claims of an abduction and rape on the same day.Officers are still investigating the harassment of a 25-year-old woman on August 3, and the alleged rape of another on August 8.
