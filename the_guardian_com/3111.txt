Fourteen members of the British element of an international cocaine smuggling network were jailed for between five and 27 years today.Police said the group - dubbed the "Bling Bling" gang because of their high-living lifestyles - were one of the biggest drug rackets ever brought to justice in the UK.The gang, whose members were mostly of Guyanan and Caribbean descent, had bases in London, Paris and New York and made huge profits.Police said the British contingent, who were mainly foreigners whose legal immigration status had lapsed, had smuggled about £50m worth of cocaine into the UK in just two years.The gang turned the cocaine into crack, a highly addictive form that could have been sold on for as much as six times its unaltered value.During sentencing at London's Snaresbrook crown court today, Judge Timothy King said the gang was part of a "global conspiracy" motivated by greed. He said the drugs had brought "untold misery and human degradation" and caused enormous levels of crime.Crack with a street value of up to £3m was being produced every week by the Bling Bling gang and distributed around the UK.MulesThe raw cocaine was first brought into the country from the Caribbean by either manipulating legitimate courier services or by hiding it with drug mules using passenger flights.The mules were often young women, including single mothers, who had become addicted to drugs and were forced into smuggling to pay off debts.The court heard that the gang used a rented house in East Ham, east London, as a "crack factory". When officers raided the premises, they uncovered more than £1m worth of crack cocaine in pizza-style pans in the kitchen that was cut and ready for distribution.The gang used the profits to fund a lavish lifestyle, buying villas in the Caribbean, property in Africa, designer cars and clothes, Cartier and Rolex watches and diamond jewellery.Police said they found receipts for goods totalling £450,000 and more than £6m in assets had been seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act.British police were tipped off about the gang after 16 couriers were arrested in France.SentencesScotland Yard said 65 gang members around the world had now been imprisoned, including 17 in the UK, 25 in France, 13 in Guyana and 10 in the US. A total of 208 years were given to the 17 people jailed in the UK, Scotland Yard said. Three were imprisoned before today's sentencing.Judge King today gave the longest sentence - 27 years - to Ian "Bowfoot" Dundas-Jones, 35, of Leyton, east London. The judge said he was the "top player" and controller of the gang.Dundas-Jones, who was also recommended for deportation, was convicted in September last year of importing cocaine and manufacturing crack. The judge said he ran two smuggling systems, one with drug mules and one using the courier firm DHL. His wife Sandra, 44, was also sentenced today to 10 years for cocaine smuggling and booking the flights.Bernard "Kofi" Clarke, 31, of Romford, Essex, who was described in court as a "principal player", was jailed for 18 years and recommended for deportation after pleading guilty to importing cocaine and manufacturing and supplying crack.His partner, Lisa Bennett, 39, of South Tottenham, north London, was also sentenced to 18 years imprisonment and recommended for deportation. The court heard that Clarke and Bennett had acted as the "cooks" to produce the crack.Another of the gang members, DHL delivery driver Segun Fisher, 29, of Peckham, south-east London, was jailed for 14 years. He was found guilty by a jury of importing cocaine and possessing it with intent to supply. The judge said he had willingly betrayed his bosses by intercepting packages of drugs and passing them to others higher up in the gang's hierarchy.The couriers used specially adapted shampoo or perfume containers, vases, rum bottles or suitcases to smuggle the cocaine, either in powder, paste or liquid form, into Britain. They would also be expected to smuggle tens of thousands of pounds out of Britain and back to the Caribbean. Around three mules would be sent on each assignment, because the gang knew that if one was picked up they could still profit from the other two.Tarique Ghaffur, assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, described the gang as "one of the most significant organised criminal networks involving crack cocaine" that British police had ever dismantled.He said: "Today's sentencing and the millions of pounds seized demonstrates how we have effectively wiped out a significantly major gang who preyed on the vulnerable people and taken away the profits which they had been harbouring."
