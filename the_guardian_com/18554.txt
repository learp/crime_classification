The Guardian and the Times splash on tactics to counter the spread of gangs. Witnesses who give evidence against gang members will be guaranteed anonymity so they can be free from fear of reprisals, the Times reports. Ministers are also exploring ways of giving police wider powers to restrict the movement of gang members with court orders, the paper says, as the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, addresses the issue of gangs today.Witnesses are already giving evidence without revealing their identity in gang-related cases, the Times reports on its inside pages. It cites the case of Jesse James, the 15-year-old who was shot in Moss Side, Manchester. Witnesses gave evidence from a secret location and their voices distorted, although charges have yet to be brought. For the first 11 months, police received little help from the public to make an arrest.The Guardian focuses on measures schools are considering to deal with gangs. Headteachers will be advised to screen pupils' computer accounts and gather proof, including photographic evidence, in cases where they suspect teenagers and even primary schoolchildren of joining gangs.Schools and ministers are said to be particularly concerned that girls were "being used in particular ways that puts them at risk", the paper reports.* This is an extended extract from the Wrap, our daily digest of the day's papers
