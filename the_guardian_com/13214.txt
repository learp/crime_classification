There was standing room only for the latest act in the drama that has surrounded the murder, more than eight years ago, of the television presenter Jill Dando. For many in court four of the Royal Courts of Justice in London this would be the third time they had heard evidence about who killed - or did not kill - the woman whose job it was, as presenter of the BBC's Crimewatch UK programme, to help solve complex crime mysteries.The last person to arrive in court, accompanied by three prison officers, was Barry George, the 47-year-old "local weirdo", as he has been described, from Fulham, west London, who is serving life for shooting Dando on the doorstep of her home in April 1999. George was convicted of her murder in 2001 and is now appealing, for the second time, against his conviction.But before the case could start the three appeal court judges, Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips, Lord Justice Leveson and Mr Justice Simon, made it clear that they did not appreciate attempts that might have been made to influence their judgment in one of the most high-profile appeals in recent years.Lord Phillips said they had received "correspondence" about the appeal, but had not read it, as it should not have been sent. Nick Ross, Ms Dando's former co-presenter, sent an open letter to the judges at the weekend suggesting that George was guilty and that they should not be swayed by the campaign to free him, or by any suggestion that there had been a miscarriage of justice."I think the judicial process got the right man, even if the process was imperfect," wrote Ross to their lordships. He told them in his letter that "you are only human and, given the febrile atmosphere surrounding this case, it would be remarkable if you had not been influenced in some way".Lord Phillips did not see it quite like that. "Justice in this country is administered in public and it is important that the public should see or hear any submissions made to the court through the lawyers conducting the process," he said sternly. "If anyone has anything they think should be brought to the attention of the court it is to be done through the lawyers involved."Lord Phillips also said that he and his fellow judges had not seen either of the recent television documentaries - one on Channel 4 the previous night and last week's BBC Panorama programme - which suggested that the case against George was deeply flawed.At the end of the appeal, he said, the court would consider "the propriety of those broadcasts".At the heart of the latest appeal is one tiny particle of firearm discharge residue (FDR) found in the pocket of George's Cecil Gee coat, nearly a year after the murder. The particle, the court was told by George's barrister, William Clegg QC, was "one two-thousandths of an inch in size" and could not be seen with the naked eye. Under the current guidelines of the Forensic Science Service, said Mr Clegg, it should have been regarded as "neutral". Instead, he argued that the jury had been "misled" into thinking that it was "crucial". Because expert witnesses had failed to give their evidence in a balanced way a retrial should be granted, he said.Mr Clegg had barely started his argument when a man stood up in the public gallery behind him and delivered an impassioned attack on the QC for failing to put the case across properly. "This man is not doing his job," he shouted before he was led out.He turned out to be Paul Cleeland, who was jailed for murder back in 1972 and who is still trying to prove his innocence, after being released after serving 26 years.George listened quietly, occasionally talking to a clinical psychologist beside him, as he suffers from severe learning difficulties which his family and supporters have claimed would have made it impossible for him to have committed the crime.The court was told that he had falsely claimed to be related to the singer Freddie Mercury, and to have served in the SAS.Watching George was his sister, Michelle Diskin, who was in court throughout the first of what is scheduled to be a three-day hearing.Christopher Moynehan, formerly of the Forensic Science Service and a specialist in firearms residue evidence, told the court that the FDR evidence was "inconclusive". A former colleague, Ian Levett, who has been with the forensic service for more than 40 years, agreed.Orlando Pownall QC, for the crown, cross-examined both men and will today call more evidence as the case unfolds.
