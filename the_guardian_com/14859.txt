A young care worker has been killed after apparently being caught in the crossfire of a gun battle between two gangs.Magda Pniewska, 26, is believed to have been hit by a stray bullet after gangs opened fire in a residential street in south London. Police are investigating whether the shoot-out was linked to a dispute between drug dealers in the New Cross area. Police found the victim, who was wounded in the head, lying outside flats at Stunell House at about 6.20pm yesterday. One witness told the Evening Standard newspaper that two gunmen had been standing just yards apart by a car as they exchanged up to five shots. She described how one man "pulled out a handgun from his trousers and fired two or three shots at the car". "The other guy then got out a similar gun from his pants and shot back using the bonnet for cover," she said. "There were about five shots in total. There was no shouting, nothing, just the shots. This woman came from nowhere." The shooting is the latest in London's growing gun and gang violence culture. The victim, who is believed to have worked at a nearby Bupa care home, was taken by ambulance to King's College hospital, where she was later pronounced dead. Metropolitan police documents leaked earlier this year revealed officers were monitoring at least eight gangs based in and around New Cross, in the borough of Lewisham. At least 20 teenagers have been murdered in London this year, some of them victims of fighting between gangs.Scotland Yard said armed police were sent to the scene last night after neighbours heard gunshots and dialled 999. Three men and a woman have been arrested. A vehicle has also been recovered, but no weapon has been found. A spokesman said: "At this early stage we believe that the victim was caught up in the crossfire."
