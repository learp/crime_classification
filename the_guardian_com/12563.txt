Government plans to boost councils' influence over local policing is a "long overdue step" and a major victory for local democracy, the Local Government Association said today. Dame Sally Powell, chairwoman of the Local Government Association's safer communities board, welcomed moves to make the police "more responsive and accountable" to communities.She was speaking in response to the policing white paper outlined by the home secretary, David Blunkett, Building Communities, Building Crime.The next phase of the government's reform of the police service includes a drive to increase neighbourhood policing through dedicated police teams, backed by greater "visibility, accessibility and accountability". It sets out 10 new commitments for police forces to make to their communities, and includes a review of the multiagency crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs), introduced under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, with a view to giving local authorities an increase role "both as partners and scrutinisers". Dame Sally said: "I am delighted that this white paper recognises councils' role as community leaders, and the part they have to play in ensuring more police resources are deployed on the issues that matter most to local people."CDRPs are not accountable or transparent enough to their communities and local authorities need a much stronger leadership role. More decisions about deployment should be put back into the hands of the community," she said. However, Dame Sally admitted that the calibre of elected councillors sitting on police authorities also needs to be addressed in some quarters. Those who serve on police authorities "must have the necessary expertise and knowledge of their communities' safety issues," she said.
