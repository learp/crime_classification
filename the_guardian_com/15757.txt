Police chief Brian Paddick today launched a scathing attack on the Mail on Sunday for seeking "sickening levels of detail" about his private life in two "kiss and tell" articles, following an out-of court settlement that will cost the paper an estimated £350,000 to £450,000 in costs and damages.His attack came as the newspaper agreed to another big payout, this time to Mohamed al Fayed, over a story concerning the health of his business. Mr Paddick was speaking after a settlement was announced with the paper, which paid Mr Paddick's former lover, James Renolleau for an article that included the claim that he smoked cannabis, a claim the Mail on Sunday accepts was false. The paper also paid for a "kiss and tell" with his ex-fiancee."The sources were paid over £100,000 to provide intimate details of our lives together and when I say intimate details, some of the questions required them to go into shocking and sickening levels of detail. And much of the information they gave was false," he said.Today's settlement comes after Mr Paddick launched a legal action against the paper "to assert my right to privacy and the rights of others, to a private life".And the police chief, who had been in the spotlight for pioneering a softly-softly approach to cannabis use, said he hoped his victory would "serve as a warning to the media that there are limits to press intrusion and publishing intimate details of personal relationships in cases such as mine over-step that limit".Mr Paddick, who was recently promoted to the post of acting deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said he supported the press' right to publish information that is "genuinely in the public interest" but that newspaper reports were increasingly intruding into people's private lives."Just because I am a high-ranking police officer does not mean I am not entitled to a private life; the fact that I am gay is irrelevant. There has to be a limit to press intrusion and this case helps to draw that line," he said.Mr Paddick's two former partners were paid £100,000 and £6,000 respectively by the paper for their stories but the Mail on Sunday has now accepted the allegation that he smoked cannabis was false and has agreed to pay damages, publish an apology, pay Mr Paddick's legal costs and not repeat the allegations.Mr Paddick's solicitor, Tamsin Allen of Bindman & Partners, estimated the overall cost of the case to the Mail on Sunday's owner, Associated Newspapers, at between £350,000 and £450,000, including the estimated cost of its own lawyers.She said Mr Paddick would receive "substantial five-figure damages" from Associated as part of that total cost.At a press conference following the settlement, Mr Paddick launched a blistering attack on the Mail on Sunday and made a plea to the media to let him get on with helping to police London without further intrusion into his private life."What I would say to the ladies and gentlemen of the media is just leave me alone to get on with my job," he said.Ms Allen added: "This is a significant victory for Mr Paddick. It helps to establish that individuals have an effective right to privacy under existing laws. It is hoped that Mr Paddick's private life can remain private from now on."The Mail on Sunday said it would be making a statement on the case later today.· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857· If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly "for publication".
