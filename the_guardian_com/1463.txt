David Cameron is chairing a meeting of ministers on Tuesday morning as the government comes under pressure to bring in emergency measures to help contain the rioting that has engulfed London and spread to other cities around Britain.Some MPs have been urging the government to impose curfews, involve the army in the operation to restore order or allow the police to use water cannon – an anti-riot device that has been used in Northern Ireland, but never on the mainland.Theresa May, the home secretary, played down the prospect of introducing these measures in interviews before the Whitehall meeting – which was due to start at 9am – but refused to rule out any of them."The British model of policing has been different [from that used on the continent]. It has been based on consent with local communities," she said.But May said ministers would be listening to the police because they wanted to hear "what [the police] think they need in order to do their job".Cameron and May were both on holiday 24 hours ago, but May returned to London on Monday afternoon and Cameron came back to the UK in the early hours of Tuesday morning on a special RAF flight.The escalation in violence on Monday night persuaded the prime minister to fly home early from Tuscany, where he was halfway through a two-week family holiday.The Downing Street announcement of his return, at 9pm on Monday, came hours after No 10 had said Cameron had no plans to come home early.The prime minister is chairing the emergency Cobra meeting, where Tim Godwin, the acting Metropolitan police commissioner, will brief ministers on the disorder, which has lasted three nights.Nick Clegg, who has cancelled a visit to the south-west, is also attending. Boris Johnson, the London mayor – who was flying home overnight after cancelling his family holiday in north America – is due in London at lunchtime on Tuesday. Cobra stands for Cabinet Office briefing room A, which is used for crisis meetings.Ed Miliband and Harriet Harman have also cut short their holidays.A No 10 source said Cameron had decided to return home as he watched the violence spread across London and to Birmingham. "You only have to look at your television screen to see the situation has deteriorated," the source said."It [an early return] was being considered early on. But you could just see the situation became serious this evening."Miliband, who is returning to London from a family holiday in Devon, welcomed the prime minister's decision to fly home.The Labour leader said on Monday night: "I am shocked by the scenes we are seeing in parts of London and Birmingham. This violence and vandalism is disgraceful criminal behaviour."What we need to see is the strongest possible police response to restore calm and security to our streets and for communities to work together."It is right that the prime minister is chairing Cobra. We need a co-ordinated response to ensure public safety and help those people who have lost homes and businesses."Clegg is likely to report back to Cobra about his visit to Tottenham on Monday. The deputy prime minister, who spoke to Tottenham High Road shopkeepers whose businesses were badly damaged, condemned the violence as "completely unacceptable".But he added: "We need to start talking together to identify everything that happened so we can rebuild, not just physically but socially."I should stress I don't regard this as a fleeting visit. I think the government has to engage actively at all levels and on an ongoing basis, because clearly this is something that leaves big scars and we need to work together to start to heal those scars."Ken Livingstone, the former London mayor who is standing as the Labour candidate in next year's mayoral contest, claimed on Monday night that the government's spending cuts were in part to blame for the violence."There is clearly criminality, there is this real problem with social networks that allow people to come to these riots much more rapidly than they did in the early 1980s," he told Newsnight."But I have been in about 18 London boroughs this year, gone into colleges. Young people are so uncertain about their future. I have been in a college in Tottenham where half the kids thought they might not be able to afford to continue their course because of the removal of educational maintenance allowance."That is not an excuse. We can have a whole load of clapped out politicians come on and denounce criminality. We can do it again next summer when it happens or we can find a way to stop it."On Tuesday morning, in an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, May said the disorder was on a scale "not seen in this country for many, many years".Describing the rioting as "sheer criminality", she appealed to people to name the troublemakers involved in rioting and said parents should ensure their children were not involved in rioting."We need to make sure that people are brought to justice so that people see there are consequences to these actions," she said.Diane Abbott, a shadow minister and the Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said on Tuesday that the government should consider imposing curfews."These young people, who seem to have no stake in society, are trashing their own communities," she said. "We cannot continue to have increasing numbers of looters on the streets night after night."On Twitter, some MPs, such as Tom Watson and Grahame Morris, have been saying the army should be called in to provide logistical support to the police.Those suggesting that water cannon should be used in London include Patrick Mercer, a Tory MP, and Livingstone.
