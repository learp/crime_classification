Police are to issue an efit of a suspect in the Madeleine McCann investigation as they make a new appeal for witnesses aimed at identifying a man who was seen near her family's apartment on the evening she disappeared, it is understood.The British police investigation into the disappearance in May 2007 of the three-year-old child from an apartment in the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz has identified more than 40 people of interest, but it is known that the inquiry team is particularly interested in one individual, who is being viewed as a possible suspect.On Monday, BBC Crimewatch will broadcast an appeal for witnesses and the Metropolitan police will release their first efit of a suspect in the case, it is understood. The Met team, led by Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, has worked with the Crimewatch team to carry out a reconstruction of the events leading up to the child's disappearance, which will be broadcast on the programme.The Met police would not comment on Wednesday on the significance of the efit, saying: "The MPS will release the relevant material at the relevant time."

Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, will appear on Crimewatch alongside Redwood to make the appeal.Mobile phone data from the handsets of thousands of people – holidaymakers, staff and local people who were in the vicinity of the McCanns' holiday apartment at the time – which is being examined in a targeted fashion, police say, could hold the key to the girl's disappearance. British police are working on new theories about what happened to Madeleine while her parents were dining with friends in a nearby tapas bar in the holiday resort.A number of sexual offenders have been identified as being in the area at the time and are being sought as persons of interest to be questioned. Other individuals who were using mobile phones in the vicinity of the resort at the time have yet to be identified and efforts are focusing on putting names to the handsets – many of which are pay as you go, making the police task more difficult.

Negotiations are ongoing with the Portuguese authorities to allow a team of British detectives to be permanently based in the country as part of the new inquiry, but as yet the investigation is being handled in Portugal by six detectives from Faro, who are following up inquiries from the Met team.
