Police are questioning two men after the theft of 50 metres of railway signalling cable, which delayed scores of trains.Huge disruption was caused on the east coast mainline and Yorkshire commuter services early on Tuesday by the raid.British transport police (BTP) said 10 trains were cancelled outright, on top of 175 that were delayed, including the busy stretch between Leeds and Doncaster, which takes high-speed London services.The incident, near the former mining town of South Kirkby in West Yorkshire, is the latest in a spate that has led the BTP to rank cable theft second only to terrorism as a national priority.Detective Sergeant Granville Sellers said: "This sort of attack causes serious disruption to train services and the travelling public. The act of stealing cable is an extremely dangerous crime, which is costly to the rail industry and to the thousands of passengers who rely on the rail network."Officers are clamping down on cable thieves and with specialised operations in key hotspots we are arresting more people than ever before. So far we have had over 700 people arrested around the country for cable-related offences and we shall continue to have a high-visibility presence to catch and deter criminals."We also conduct regular visits to scrap metal dealers to check any cable which may have been sold by the thieves for profit. What they don't realise is just how little they make. Is it worth risking your life accessing the rail line for £50 in your pocket?"The two men being questioned were arrested in north London close to the east coast line. One is 30 and from Middlesbrough and the other 38 and from Newham in east London. They were held on suspicion of cable theft after a police helicopter joined the search.West and North Yorkshire are among the worst areas in the country for theft, with some 200 incidents in the year to last April. Compensation to passengers for services delayed nationally by cable theft topped £1.3m in the same period.Richard Lungmuss, route director for Network Rail, said: "Once again our railway has come under serious attack from thieves, with three separate cable thefts on our route overnight, bringing misery to hundreds of passengers. Our engineers have worked to resume services as quickly as possible and we will be working with British transport police to catch those responsible."
