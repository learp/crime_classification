An "exceptionally dangerous" woman who attacked two strangers with a knife has lost a bid to appeal against her conviction and sentence.Nicola Edgington, now 33, of Greenwich, south-east London, killed Sally Hodkin, 58, and tried to kill Kerry Clark, 22.Edgington stabbed her mother to death six years earlier, but was released to live in the community.She was found guilty at the Old Bailey in March of murdering Hodkin and attempting to murder Clark and was jailed for life with a minimum term of 37 years.Three judges at the court of appeal in London on Friday dismissed her applications for leave to appeal against her murder conviction and her "excessive" minimum term, although they said that the 510 days she had spent on remand in custody had to be taken into account.The attempt to appeal against conviction and sentence was rejected by Lord Justice Treacy, Mr Justice Green and Sir David Maddison.They heard that Edgington has been transferred to Rampton hospital in Nottinghamshire.She had a sudden relapse in her mental health, two years after being released from a mental unit, in October 2011.She was taken to an A&E department in south-east London but walked out after becoming annoyed at being kept waiting.She took a bus to Bexleyheath and attacked the two strangers who were going to work.When Clark, and artist, grabbed the blade and kicked her away, Edgington ran to a butcher's shop and snatched a larger knife.She attacked Hodkin, a law firm accounts clerk, with such force that she almost decapitated her.The recorder of London, Judge Brian Barker, jailed her for life with a minimum term of 37 years for murder and gave her a concurrent sentence of life with a minimum term of 20 years for attempted murder.He told Edgington her behaviour had been "consistent and calculated".He said: "You are manipulative and exceptionally dangerous. What you did could not have been more selfish."I disagree that the responsibility for these acts can be laid on others. You made your choice and these were terrible acts for which you must take responsibility."You have come as near as can be to having three deaths on your hands."Clark escaped with only cuts to her hands because of her bravery and quick action, he said.
