A man has been arrested in Switzerland in connection with the murder of Allan Chappelow, 86, a reclusive millionaire from Hampstead, north London, Scotland Yard said. Mr Chappelow, an author, was found dead at his home in June. A postmortem showed he died from head injuries. The man, 45, who was detained near Zurich on Friday on an international arrest warrant, is in custody pending extradition proceedings. At the time of Mr Chappelow's death, it was reported that bank officials tipped off police after becoming concerned that he had lost money through a series of bogus transactions.
