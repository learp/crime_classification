A convicted rapist who acted as his own lawyer and presented his case from prison via a video link has won a ruling in his favour from the appeal court.A spokesman for the lord chancellor's department said the case was believed to mark the first time the appeal court has heard a case argued from prison by video-conferencing. The man, named only as R to protect the identities of his two young daughters, is serving 10 years for five counts of rape and six counts of indecency. He lost a court battle for contact with his daughters but wanted to use psychiatric and other reports produced for that case in other court actions he was considering, particularly in an attempt to have his conviction quashed. He also wanted to be able to use a report on him by a psychiatrist, prepared for the contact case, to try to get another medical opinion on his mental state, with a view to treatment or removal from prison to a hospital. He was not in the county court when his application for permission to disclose the documents was originally heard, and the judge ruled against him without giving any reasons. In the appeal court, he argued he had been denied a fair hearing in the county court, and won his appeal despite opposition by a barrister representing the girls' mother. Lady Justice Hale and Lord Justice Latham ruled that there was "an appearance of injustice" from the way the hearing had been conducted. It was hard to see why the father ought not to be granted permission to disclose a report on his own psychiatric condition to another psychiatrist responsible for his future care. Provided that the peace and security of the children's primary carer was not disrupted, and their anonymity was not disturbed, the children's welfare would not be prejudiced by limited disclosure of the material to responsible bodies. The judges sent the case back to the county court for a ruling on which documents could be disclosed and to whom.
