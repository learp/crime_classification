A man was arrested today in connection with the murder of a woman who was stabbed to death in a field near stables, police said.The 38-year-old man was seized in Watlington, Oxfordshire, shortly before 11am on suspicion of the murder of Rana Faruqui, Thames Valley police said. Detectives said yesterday they wanted to interview Ms Faruqui's former boyfriend, Stephen Griffiths, 38, about the killing. The body of Ms Faruqi, 35, a business analyst from Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire, was found murdered at Jennings Farm, Burnham, near Slough, at around 9pm on Saturday. The man being questioned is understood to be Mr Griffiths, a former surveyor, whom police have been wanting to question since the murder.Ms Faruqui was a member of the British Carriage Driving Association and took part in events at the Windsor Park Equestrian Club, of which the Duke of Edinburgh is president. She had gone to the stables at Jennings Farm to tend to the horse she kept there when she was murdered in what police called a "frenzied attack" in a field about half a mile away from the stableyard. Ms Faruqui, a keen horsewoman and animal lover, managed to dial 999 on her mobile phone to say she was being attacked. But by the time a police officer arrived, 15 minutes later, Ms Faruqui was dead and her attacker had fled the scene. She had been stabbed repeatedly, possibly with a hunting knife, which has not been recovered. Detectives from Thames Valley police launched an international manhunt for Mr Griffiths, from whom she had an acrimonious split three months ago.
