Detectives searching for April Jones have arrested on suspicion of murder the man they have been questioning in connection with her disappearance.Mark Bridger had been held since Tuesday on suspicion of abducting the five-year-old, who went missing from her home in Machynlleth, mid-Wales, on Monday evening.But at a news conference in Aberystwyth, police said the status of Bridger and the thrust of the search had changed.Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan said: "Mark Bridger has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of April Jones."He remains in custody at Aberystwyth police station where he continues to be questioned. The arrest does not detract from our efforts to find April and we remain committed to finding her."Her family has been informed of this development and as you would expect they continue to be supported by a family liaison officer."While this is a significant development in the investigation, I once again appeal to the public for information which may help us find April."We are looking to trace the movements of Mark Bridger between 6.30pm on Monday [when April was last seen] and 3.30pm on Tuesday [when he was arrested] and any sightings of him between these times."Bevan, who is leading the investigation, added that police also wanted information regarding the movements of a blue Land Rover Discovery – registration L503 MEP – between these times.The arrest of Bridger on suspicion of murder does not affect the time he can be held. Police still have until 5pm on Friday to release him, charge him or go back before a court for extra time. If they do go back before a court, they could be granted an extra 24 hours to question him.Bevan and fellow officer Superintendent Ian John wore the pink ribbons that April's family have asked people to don as a sign of hope.John said the "significant development" had an "impact on our search for April. We want to acknowledge and are extremely grateful for the efforts of the community volunteers who have supported the professional searchers in trying to locate her. They have been a vital part of our team throughout this search operation."The dynamics of the search have now changed and due to the passage of time and the developments within the investigation it is no longer appropriate for us to expect untrained members of the public to continue the search."So now we only require professional searchers to be involved in the ongoing search which continues in and around Machynlleth."
