Two men have been arrested on suspicion of murdering a woman after a house fire. A 26-year-old man and another in his late 40s are being held after a blaze in the Walworth area of south London. Emergency services were called to an address in Alosando Drive shortly after 12.30pm on Friday. A woman believed to be in her mid-20s was taken to a west London hospital where she subsequently died. A postmortem examination is to take place on Monday. Next of kin had been informed, although formal identification was yet to take place, the Met police said. The 26-year-old suspect was in custody at a south London police station, while the older man was being treated for unspecified injuries in hospital.
