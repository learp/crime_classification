Police tonight confirmed that a second set of human remains found at a house in Margate are those of 18-year-old Dinah McNicol, who disappeared in 1991."Police believed that the clothing and jewellery found with the body were consistent with those owned by the 18-year-old, and DNA samples have today confirmed it is her," an Essex police spokeswoman said. "Dinah's family have been informed." She added that the examination of the inside of the three-bedroom property at 50 Irvine Drive IN THE Kent seaside town was ongoing and was likely to last the rest of the week.Earlier, police had said no more significant finds were expected at the terraced house following the discovery of the remains of McNicol, from Tillingham, Essex, and that of the 15-year-old Scottish schoolgirl Vicky Hamilton, who also disappeared in 1991, in the back garden.Speaking at the scene, Detective Superintendent Tim Wills, of Essex police, said officers were not expecting to find any more bodies. "We are looking for evidence now, rather than people," he added. "That could be just a very small thing." He said officers would remain at the three-bedroom house until Friday, having spent more than a week searching it for human remains and clues.Peter Tobin, 61, appeared in private at Linlithgow sheriff court, West Lothian, last week, charged with Vicky's murder. He will return to court on Thursday, the Crown Office said.
