Boxer Amir Khan is so worried by the growing number of alienated and disillusioned young men that he has ploughed £700,000 of his own money into a community gym and is running a four-week, intensive course for volatile youths with a history of criminal and violent behaviour.'It is very easy for kids to get sucked into the negative side of street life,' he says. 'So many young people growing up today have no roots or structure to their lives at all.'Khan was a troublesome, hyperactive eight-year-old when his father took him to the gym to see if boxing would help him burn off his excess energy. 'It gave me discipline,' says Khan. 'Now I want to give youngsters the chance to develop their character and self-esteem by aiming for new goals and making new friends in a safe environment.'Khan agreed to take part in a three-part Channel 4 documentary, Angry Young Men, which starts a week on Tuesday. In it, he attempts to use both boxing and faith to succeed where the police, courts and anger management classes have failed: to convince six difficult youths with long histories of violent behaviour to channel their aggression and turn their lives around.'I was actually very shocked,' says Khan. 'I saw how alienated and alone these lads were: they didn't have any strong, positive role models in their lives. They didn't have any hope or aspirations. They'd never achieved anything.'If these youths are a reflection of others out there, then society is storing up trouble for itself if it doesn't do what it can now to help them.'· Angry Young Men, Channel 4, 21 August, 11.05pm
