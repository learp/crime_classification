An extra 4,500 probation staff - an increase of one-third in the number of frontline posts - are to be recruited over the next three years, the Home Office minister, Paul Boateng, announced yesterday as part of the government's attempt to arrest the rising crime rate.The extra staff are to be financed as part of a Â£500m programme designed to cut the 56% reoffending rate of convicted criminals by a further 5%. Mr Boateng told a probation service "what works" conference in Manchester that the staff and money were to be invested in developing programmes to tackle the root causes of criminal behaviour. The extra 4, 500 staff would include 1,500 probation officers, 2,500 probation service assistants and 500 support staff. "The research evidence from both the prison and probation service is that the accredited programmes do work, with each achieving reductions in offending of the order of 15%," Mr Boateng said. Among the programmes are a "think first" reasoning and skills course, and others tackling sex offending, violent behaviour by women and persistent drink-driving. Some 10,000 offenders are expected to undergo such programmes next year, rising to 30,000 a year over the next three years. A new target is also being set to improve the reading and arithmetic skills of offenders. Mr Boateng said 80% of jobs needed at least the literacy and numeracy skills of an 11-year old, but 40% of those under probation service supervision lacked even those skills. He wanted to see 12,000 offenders a year achieve at least this level by 2004. He also revealed that Lord Birt, the former BBC director general, has been asked by the home secretary, Jack Straw, to review which court punishments will most cost-effectively reduce crime.
