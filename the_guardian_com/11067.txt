A woman told a court yesterday how she was stabbed and raped by the man standing trial for the murder of 18-year-old Sally Anne Bowman.DNA belonging to Mark Dixie, 37, the chef accused of murdering aspiring model Bowman, was found on the underwear of a 19-year-old student who was attacked in Perth, Australia, in 1997. The chance of the DNA belonging to anyone else was one in a billion, and Dixie lived in Australia at the time, the jury heard.Talking from behind a screen at the Old Bailey, the now 30-year-old victim, who cannot be named, described how she was knocked unconscious and raped by a man who climbed in through the open window of the house where she was staying. Giving evidence yesterday afternoon, Dixie denied raping and stabbing the woman in Australia. "The only explanation I can give is that I picked her up on a night out, or that she was a working girl," he told the court. He said he visited prostitutes once or twice a week in those days. The woman said she had not been a sex worker.Dixie denies murdering Bowman, but has admitted having sex with her dead body. His barrister, Anthony Glass QC, told the Old Bailey: "He did not know she was dead until intercourse had concluded ... he allowed his lust to get the better of him. The scientific evidence of the case undoubtedly proves that he had sexual intercourse. It does not prove that he was the murderer." The trial continues.
