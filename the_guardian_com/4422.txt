The Manchester United football player Carlos Tevez has had his £140,000 Bentley seized after it was found he did not have a full UK driving licence, Greater Manchester police said today.The Argentina international was stopped by traffic officers on the M60 near Stretford in Manchester and they impounded his white Bentley Continental GT Speed.A spokesman for Greater Manchester police said Tevez was pulled over at 9.20am yesterday near junction 7 because traffic officers suspected the car's windows were too dark."They were tested and found to be too dark so a prohibition notice was issued to the driver," he said."When asked to provide his documentation, it was discovered the driver did not have a full UK driving licence and was advised to arrange removal of the car. "As he could not arrange this, the car was removed under Section 165 of Road Traffic Act 1988."Tevez, 25, was now being investigated for driving without a valid licence and could face prosecution, a police source said.The maximum penalty for the offence is a £1,000 fine and six penalty points.In 2007, fellow United player Cristiano Ronaldo was stopped by police and fined for having blacked-out windows on his £140,000 Bentley convertible.Ronaldo was stopped again on Thursday afternoon and given "advice" by police who thought he was speeding but did not manage to register his actual speed, Greater Manchester police said.A police source said that, by the time the officers had prepared their monitoring equipment, the Portuguese player had slowed down from about 55mph in the 50mph zone.A police spokesman said: "Traffic officers on A34 Kingsway stopped a car they believed was being driven at speed. The car slowed as officers approached it so no official speed check could be made."However the driver was pulled over, had his documents checked and was advised on his driving. There was no evidence that any offences had been committed."
