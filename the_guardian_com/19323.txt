Women are still overlooked by government policymakers despite six years of "mainstreaming" of female issues, a Labour MP alleged yesterday at the launch of an inquiry into women in the criminal justice system.Research repeatedly illustrates the failure of the criminal justice system in its dealings with women. Domestic violence, experienced by one woman in three, is a notoriously difficult area in which to secure convictions, while only seven out of 100 reported rapes result in conviction. Meanwhile, the number of women in prison has more than doubled in the last 10 years. Every year, 8,000 children under 15 see their mothers imprisoned. Vera Baird, a QC and Labour backbencher who succeeded Mo Mowlam as the MP for Redcar at the last election, said the criminal justice bill now going through parliament was a typical example of the failure to consider women. "The bill gives defendants a new right to opt for trial by judge alone," she said. "Most judges are white men. They are not representative of society and often seem out of touch with modern life. It could mean in rape cases a woman victim would have no alternative but to have her case heard by one man. Justice demands that juries should continue to give rape case verdicts." Ms Baird is to chair the inquiry, set up by the campaigning Fawcett Society to assess what happens to women victims, defendants and practitioners in the criminal justice system. The inquiry, in the form of a commission, has recruited prison governors and a senior policewoman as well as lawyers and magistrates to produce a series of reports intended to coincide with both the criminal justice bill and a white paper on domestic violence due next month. It will also look at the slow progress in appointing more female judges and try to establish reasons why there are still no women in Britain's highest court, the House of Lords. It will report next year.
