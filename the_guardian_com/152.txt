A murder investigation has been launched after a student was stabbed in broad daylight and left to die in the street after what may have been a bungled mugging.Kieran Crump-Raiswell, 18, was killed by a lone knifeman as he walked along a street in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, and is understood to have been a completely innocent victim who was not known to police.Detectives are baffled over any motive for the attack, which happened at 2.20pm on Wednesday in Upper Chorlton Road, but have ruled out any links to gangs.Nothing was apparently stolen. Police said the attacker was believed to be a white teenager, aged between 16 and 18.Kieran was given first aid at the scene by a fire and rescue crew from Moss Side who were returning from a job, but he died later in hospital.The talented sportsman, who successfully completed A-levels in politics, history and physical education, was taking a gap year before going to Sheffield Hallam university to read history. He had recently returned from the US where he had been coaching football for three months.He lived with his father Roland Crump, 54, an interpreter and former languages teacher, and his mother Christine Raiswell, 45, a local authority programme manager, and his younger sister and brother in Chorlton, Manchester.The family paid tribute in a statement to the "caring brother", and "loving grandson, nephew, cousin, friend who was loved by all who knew him"."Kieran was a quiet, easy-going boy who loved to be at home spending time with us," it said.The Manchester City season ticket holder played for FC Bluestar between the ages of 11 and 18. He also played cricket for Sale Cricket Club. He helped coach at his younger brother's football club.Aidan Bruce, assistant principal at Loreto College, which he left last year, described the former pupil as "a most gentle and friendly young man, who was liked and admired by everyone who met him". His teachers and friends were "devastated by this news", he said.Appealing to the community for help, chief superintendent Jim Liggett said: "We are still very much in the early stages of this investigation and all we know for certain is that this young man has been attacked in broad daylight as he walked along the street."At this time we are looking for one offender, but the area would have been extremely busy so I would ask anyone who witnessed this to come forward".Friends paid tribute, with one, Clara Kerr, 18, tweeting: "Just thinking things over and over and it doesn't make sense." Another, Rhys Bailey, said: "I can't get my head round it, the guy wouldn't hurt a fly." Rizwan Anjum said: "RIP Kieran, he was such a quiet kid and kept himself to himself."
