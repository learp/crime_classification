Fear of crime has drastically increased since Labour came to power according to new research that shows people have lost faith in the government's ability to protect them.When it comes to cracking down on crime and violence public confidence has halved in the past decade, according to a new poll carried out by Ipsos Mori.Despite Labour's promise to be 'tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime', two out three people do not trust the government when it comes to law and order while just three in 10 do.That is almost the reverse of the situation in 1997, at the start of Labour's tenure, when 68 per cent of the population were not fearful of crime and 24 per cent were.The massive drop in confidence comes despite the fact that actual crime levels have fallen by 32 per cent over the same period with a particularly large decline in domestic break-ins and car theft.'There has been a significant and sustained decline in crime levels and it has been that way for a few years but people do not believe it,' said Bobby Duffy, co-author of the report and deputy managing director of the Ipsos Mori Social Research Institute. 'There are issues with crime statistics but even straightforward things such as the large increase in the number of police officers are not believed by people.'It is bad news for the Labour party because the report also concluded that crime was top of the list when it came to factors influencing how people were planning to vote. It was important, the report concluded, for the government to focus its energy on reducing the climate of fear, not just crimes themselves.
