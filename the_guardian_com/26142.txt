The former wife of a choirmaster accused of raping a pupil has admitted she knew about his relationship with another student – and was "happy" he had found love.Hilary Kay Brewer – known as Kay – said she knew her then husband, Michael, had "fallen in love" with a sixth-form student at Chetham's School of Music, where he was director of music.Her husband, who was awarded an OBE for services to music, left the school in Manchester almost 20 years ago under mutual agreement after his relationship with the 17-year-old girl was discovered.The former couple, both 68, are on trial at Manchester crown court.Michael Brewer is accused of committing a series of indecent assaults against a different, underage girl at Chetham's more than 30 years ago and is also said to have raped her when she was 18 in the presence of his then wife. The Brewers deny the charges.Kay Brewer, a former primary school teacher, said she found out about her then husband's affair shortly before he left the school in 1994."I was happy that he had found someone that he was fond of," she told the jury on Wednesday, later adding: "I didn't say, which I probably should have done, 'For goodness sake, what are you doing? This is silly and dangerous.'"She said "the spark had gone" in their marriage by that point and that her husband was aware she was already in a relationship with another man. The Brewers, who have four daughters, divorced in 1998 but have remained on good terms since, she said.The then 17-year-old, whom the media have decided not to name, had already told the court that Kay Brewer gave her the Winnie the Pooh book House at Pooh Corner after finding out about the relationship with her husband.The witness told the jury: "He gave me a book from Kay with an inscription. It said something like 'Don't worry about things, he is just a normal human being with all the same insecurities and doubts as you, love Kay.'"Kay Brewer said she did not remember the gift, but conceded: "It is the sort of thing I might have done." She denied she hoped to sexually abuse the young woman, along with her husband – as the prosecution allege she already had done 13 years previously with the complainant in the case.Robyn Koh, a professional harpsichordist who went to Chetham's at the same time as the complainant, said the alleged victim was known at school for being "prone to exaggeration".Koh said the victim became a good friend in later life, acting as her birthing partner and godparent to her sons. But the complainant never told her she had been abused at the Brewers, said Koh, talking instead of how much she liked the food at their house and how the four Brewer daughters would sing grace in four-part harmonies.In 1981, the complainant, a violinist, was having trouble boarding at Chetham's and came to stay with the Brewers at their home in Chorlton, south Manchester, for the summer term.Kay Brewer said the girl became part of the family and seemed happy, barring the odd "tantrum", usually about her violin playing.She recalled how the girl came back to stay overnight with the family on one occasion when she was 18, the night the alleged victim said she was raped by Michael Brewer, with his wife's help.No rape or abuse ever took place, Kay Brewer insisted.Anastasia Micklethwaite, a conductor and music teacher, also gave evidence on Wednesday. She described Michael Brewer as "a wonderful man" who had been an "inspiration to thousands of musicians across the world".After leaving Chetham's, Brewer went on to become the artistic director of the National Youth Choirs of Britain and has also directed the World Youth Choir.He also served as an adjudicator in international competitions and in 2008 led BBC workshops for the programme Last Choir Standing.The trial continues.
