Police numbers in England and Wales have reached a new all time high of 138,155 - and are rising at the rate of 6,000 every year.The latest Home Office figures for December 2003 published today show that the number of police officers reached its highest level since records began in 1921. Police numbers in England and Wales fell for the first two years of the Labour government dipping to 132,000 in 1999 but have steadily increased every year since then after ministers introduced a ringfenced "crime fighting fund" to ensure that chief constables did not use the money for other purposes. Police strengths have also been supplemented by the recruitment of 3,243 community support officers by the end of last month working in 38 police forces. They are paid less than uniformed constables but have limited powers to stop and detain and issue fixed penalty notices. The home secretary, David Blunkett, said: "Police numbers continue to rise and it is vital that we make the best use of them to make a real difference to the quality of life in our communities. I want to build on the progress we have already made by redefining the relationship of the police with the people they serve, making them locally accountable and more responsive to local needs."Some senior police officers have recently criticised the flow of government funding for extra officers, arguing that simply providing more bodies was distorting police priorities. It is expected that the annual increase in police numbers will now begin to slow down with only 650 extra being recruited in this financial year.Commenting on the growing number of CSOs, a Home Office spokeswoman said: "This is not policing on the cheap, but an additional resource over and above record police numbers. They perform a separate but complementary role to police officers in patrolling streets and tackling anti-social behaviour."
