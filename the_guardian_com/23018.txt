Police warned that the public would be put at serious risk from violence if a gathering of 20,000 bikers goes ahead, as seven men were today sentenced to a total of 42 years for a "terrifying" riot in Birmingham airport last January between the Hells Angels and the Outlaws.Warwickshire's assistant chief constable, Bill Holland, said the force was renewing its attempts to revoke a licence granted by councillors in Stratford-upon-Avon for the Bulldog Bash in August, an annual music and motorcycle festival run by Hells Angels but open to the public.Holland said the shooting of a Hells Angel as he rode his bike down the M40 in 2007 after that year's bash "opened their eyes" to the nature of bike gangs. In 2008 seven members of the Outlaws were each sentenced to life for the murder.Holland acknowledged that the overwhelming majority of those at the bash were law-abiding. But "Hells Angels are an organised crime group, as are the Outlaws. They have a violent feud going back for many years, now on a global basis. They are not just people passionately interested in motorbikes; there's something more sinister to do with organised crime."This year's festival has veteran heavy metal band Motorhead top of the bill. Echo, a spokesman for Bulldog Bash, said: "This is a proper, commercially-run event; it doesn't make much money and all the profits are ploughed back into the next one. We haven't had any trouble in the 22 years we have been going."The seven who were each given six-year sentences were: Outlaws Mark Moseley, 46, of Sheldon,Neale Harrison, 46, of Coventry, Mark Price, 50, of Nuneaton, and Jeremy Ball, 46, of Cheadle;Hells Angels Paul Arlett, 35, Sean Timmins 38, Mark Larner, 47, all of Wolverhampton, and Leonard Hawthorne, 52, of Dudley. Another Angel, Mark Larner, failed to turn up to Birmingham crown court for sentencing, and is believed to have fled to South Africa.
