Tougher sentencing for rapists may be needed to tackle the "moral collapse" demonstrated by the belief of young men that it is sometimes acceptable to force a woman to have sex, David Cameron will warn today.The Tory leader will highlight the growing "justice gap" which sees only 5.7% of prosecutions result in a conviction. Experts agree that the extent of the problem is even greater because only 25% of sexually assaulted women report cases to the police and many of those incidents which are reported do not reach court, according to the British crime survey.Cameron will say that the party will review sentencing for rape, arguing: "We have a situation where rapists think they can get away with it, while victims fear not being believed and wonder what's the point of pursuing the criminal process."In a speech to the Conservative Women's Organisation conference in London, Cameron will warn that England and Wales have the lowest rape conviction rate of any leading EU country, adding: "Just 15 in every thousand women who get raped in the UK see justice done. How can any civilised country ... accept these facts?"The review, led by the shadow justice secretary, Nick Herbert, will look at ensuring that sentences for convicted attackers - which have fallen slightly in the past three years - are proportionate to the crime. Cameron will also promise to give rape crisis centres greater stability by funding them on a three-year basis.Ministers have already introduced a string of measures, from changes to the conduct of trials to advertising campaigns aimed at young men, to tackle a "justice gap" which has refused to close. While recorded reports of rape are up 40% in four years, to 13,721 in 2004-05, the number of convictions has risen only slightly.Explanations range from the prejudices of juries to the failure of police and prosecutors to follow Home Office guidelines. A report published this year by the independent watchdogs for the services found they were regularly failing victims by wrongly recording cases as "no crime" and dropping others prematurely without following possible lines of investigation.Cameron will say today: "Studies have shown that as many as one in two young men believe there are some circumstances when it's OK to force a woman to have sex. This is an example of moral collapse."Labour ministers, including the leader of the House, Harriet Harman, solicitor general Vera Baird, and the former Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart, have fought to improve the way rape is handled by police, prosecutors and the courts, and to offer more support for victims.
