The coroner in the inquest into the death of Mark Duggan – whose killing sparked widespread riots in England in the summer of 2011 – has told the jury he will accept a majority conclusion.Duggan, a father of four, was shot by police marksmen who stopped the taxi in which he was travelling in Tottenham, north London, in August 2011.The inquest into his death began 13 weeks ago at the high court in London, and before the panel of 10 retired last week, the coroner, Keith Cutler, told them to reach their decisions "calmly and coolly on the evidence" as he began summing up the case.He has since directed the jury that they may reach conclusions and findings on which at least eight of them are agreed.He is still encouraging the panel to reach a unanimous decision if one can be achieved.The lowest decision he can accept is 8-2 for any conclusion or determination.Cutler has also outlined a proposed timetable in case the jury has not reached a decision by the end of proceedings on Thursday.He suggests that the inquest adjourns for the Christmas period and sits again on 2 January.Cutler told the jury last week it could reach one of three possible conclusions: that the 29-year-old was killed unlawfully, or killed lawfully, or an open conclusion. He also reminded jurors that they should reach their decisions "on the evidence and the evidence alone".
