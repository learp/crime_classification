A senior police officer will today call for a reduction in the number of antisocial behaviour orders issued after his survey of 21 Asbo offenders raised doubts about their effectiveness.Detective Chief Superintendent Neil Wain, head of the Stockport division of Greater Manchester police, said the orders were breached on a regular basis and did not seem to control behaviour. In his book on the issue - The Asbo: Wrong Turning, Dead End - Mr Wain claims that Asbos might even encourage crime: "One of my concerns is the possibility that Asbos may lead to a longer criminal career," he says.Mr Wain is one of the most senior police figures to criticise Asbos since they were introduced in 2003. He said he was preparing himself for, "accusations of being weak-kneed and liberal and not representing the police force".Do you think Asbos work, or do they encourage antisocial behaviour?
