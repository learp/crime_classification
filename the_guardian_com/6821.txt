David Cameron visited riot-hit Tottenham, in north London, on Tuesday morning to talk to people affected by the disturbances, which sparked violence around the country.The prime minister toured a leisure centre being used to provide food and clothing for up to 200 people made homeless by the fires that swept the area.He visited the fire station to discuss the challenges the emergency services had faced and any lessons that could be learned, and also also held private talks with people whose homes had been destroyed.Cameron told local emergency services chiefs at the fire station: "I wanted to hear first hand about some of the things you experienced, and some of the things we need to learn from it."It was an incredibly challenging situation, perhaps particularly here in Tottenham."I've been all over the country hearing about what happened, but this is where things started. It was complicated and made difficult by the tragic killing of Mark Duggan â€“ it's been a difficult situation."He added: "There is a major effort at rebuilding going on. I've been to the leisure centre, and seen the community come together with great co-ordination. We can rebuild all over again."There was no access for the press to his talks with some of the 50 families made homeless by the riots when flats were burned during attacks on shops.
