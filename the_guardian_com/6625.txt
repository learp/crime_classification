Britain's most senior judge has called for punitive sentences – including indeterminate prison terms with no fixed release date – for gun traffickers. Issuing new sentencing guidelines, Lord Judge, the lord chief justice, said that the "gravity of gun crime cannot be exaggerated".The new guidelines come as part of an appeal court ruling dismissing a series of appeals by men involved in the gun trade.They included the case of Grant Wilkinson, aged 34, who was imprisoned at Reading crown court for converting replica guns into live weapons at a secret factory.Police linked his guns to 50 shootings and eight murders. One of his weapons was linked to a robbery that led to the killing of PC Sharon Beshenivsky in Bradford in 2005, although it was not the murder weapon. Wilkinson was jailed for life in 2008 and ordered to serve at least 11 years.Four of the other cases involved a huge gun-running operation based in northern England which imported Russian weapons and sold them on to criminals.The appeal court ruling said the prosecution in the case had been wholly justified in describing the imported weapons as "an assassins' armoury".Judge said: "The gravity of gun crime cannot be exaggerated. Guns kill and maim, terrorise and intimidate. That is why criminals want them, that is why they use them and that is why they organise their importation and manufacture, supply and distribution."Sentencing courts must address the fact that too many lethal weapons are too readily available. Too many are carried, too many are used, always with devastating effect on individual victims and with insidious, corrosive impact on the wellbeing of the local community."Issuing the new sentencing guidelines, Judge, sitting with Mr Justice Butterfield and Mr Justice Flaux, said the possession of firearms was a serious enough offence to justify a lengthy sentence, even if the defendant had argued at trial that there were no aggravating factors.Wilkinson had argued that his sentence was excessive because he could not be blamed for any subsequent crimes carried out with the weapons.But Judge said: "In our judgment the judge [at Wilkinson's trial] was not merely entitled, but fully justified, in treating this offence as one of the utmost gravity."Those involved in the manufacture of these guns, including the appellant himself, simply cannot wash their hands of the consequences and the sentence on him should reflect those consequences."The lord chief justice made clear that in his view, importing firearms or being in possession of firearms with intent to supply them, whether manufactured by someone else or not, was no less criminally reprehensible than importing drugs or possessing drugs with intent to supply.The new sentencing guideline on gun crime also makes clear that the indeterminate sentence for public protection – which has no fixed release date – should be available to the courts in such cases.It suggests the current threshold, which involves having to prove that the guns were being imported for use in violent crime, should be lowered given the seriousness of crimes involving firearms.
