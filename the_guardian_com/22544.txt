There will be no inquest into the death of Baby P, a coroner ruled today.Peter Connelly's father had wanted a full hearing to find out exactly what happened to his son, who died aged 17 months at the hands of his mother Tracey, her boyfriend Steven Barker and Barker's brother Jason Owen in 2007. The boy had suffered more than 50 injuries despite receiving 60 visits from social workers, doctors and police in Tottenham, north London, over eight months. Connelly, Barker and Owen were jailed for causing or allowing his death.But today North London coroner Andrew Walker said he believed questions about the circumstances of the toddler's death had already been answered in previous investigations by the authorities and new evidence was unlikely to come to light, leaving insufficient cause for an inquest."When I look at the reports I ask myself whether the circumstances are those where, despite a number proceedings, there are potential witnesses who are yet to give evidence," he told North London Coroner's Court in High Barnet."On the material I have seen it seems to me that the evidence taken as part of the investigations has gone right to the heart of the circumstances of how Peter Connelly died and has led to significant criticism, changes in practices and procedures and many lessons have been learned. In my judgment the question of in what circumstances Baby Peter Connelly died has been answered."Walker added: "It is not my belief, having regard to the material before me, that a resumed inquest is likely to unearth new and significant facts."The coroner, who was previously responsible for military inquests in Oxfordshire, heard earlier this month from lawyers representing Baby P's father, the Metropolitan Police and Barker, who might have been compelled to give evidence had an inquest been held.But Walker concluded the legal criteria for holding an inquest had already been fulfilled."I have carefully considered all the submissions placed before me but I do not have sufficient cause to resume the inquest touching the death of Peter Connelly," he told the court."Even if I am wrong and the criteria have not been met, I feel that the coroner's inquest is not the best forum for such an inquiry."Peter's father did not attend today's hearing but his lawyer, Julien Foster, asked the coroner to delay formally ending proceedings by issuing the death certificate for 28 days, to allow his client to consider the judgment.
