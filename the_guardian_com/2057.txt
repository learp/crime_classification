A high court judge was punched repeatedly in the face yesterday by a man whose application for leave to appeal had been turned down.The assailant lunged towards the judge, Sir Christopher Pitchford, 55, after the application was refused, landing several punches and hitting his nose, eye and forehead. The man smashed a glass lamp against the judge's bench and hurled a cup of water at him, but neither hit the judge. A male usher tried to grab the attacker, suffering a cut finger in the process, and a female clerk sitting next to the judge suffered a bruised arm. The panic alarm was activated and security guards dashed into the courtroom to intervene. The attacker was restrained and arrested by the tipstaff, the court official responsible for security. The judge, who suffered severe bruising, received first aid. A spokeswoman for the lord chancellor's department said a review of security had been launched at the high court in London, where the incident took place. Sir Christopher was appointed to the high court bench two years ago after working as a QC on the Wales and Chester circuit. He was described by court staff yesterday as a popular and humane judge.
