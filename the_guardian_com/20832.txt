Police searching for a man suspected of killing two people in their own homes have said they believe he may be trying to change his appearance.James Allen is being urgently sought by police following the separate murders of Julie Davison, 50, in Whitby, North Yorkshire, and 81-year-old Colin Dunford in Middlesbrough.Allen, 35, has previous convictions for violence and has served a custodial sentence, Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Lang told a press conference in Middlesbrough on Saturday. He revealed images showing that Allen appeared to be growing his hair to change his appearance.Lang said: "The photographs will show James Allen throughout the course of the week, caught on camera and show signs of hair growing through at both sides of his head."He was described as bald but there's now clear signs of hair growing."The images show Allen in a number of locations, including a sports shop, in Scarborough on Wednesday and Thursday.Lang confirmed Allen stayed in a bed and breakfast, thought to be the Allerton Croft Hotel, in the seaside town on Wednesday night.He said the guesthouse had been treated as a crime scene.Lang said there were also unconfirmed sightings of Allen in the Harehills area of Leeds on Thursday evening and Friday and these were being followed up by West Yorkshire police.The detective said it was possible that someone was sheltering Allen and urged that person to contact police."This is not a time for loyalty. There can be no loyalty at a time like this. This is the time to help the police," he said. "Now is the time to be public-spirited."Lang issued a further message to Allen to hand himself in."Give yourself up. Give yourself up now. You need to be in police custody, you know you need to be in police custody, you know what you've done," he said."I think purely and simply by the tragic events that have unfolded, this is a man who cannot be at large, who needs to be arrested and that needs to happen as quickly as possible."
