The conclusion of the Drax train ambush trial was delayed again today when a defendant failed to appear in court because she was in Spain on an environmental project. Judge James Spencer QC, who presided over the trial of 29 people who took over a power station train in June last year and emptied out Â£37,000 worth of coal, accused Louise Hemmerman, 32, of "taking the Mickey out of the court". She had been due to appear with Oliver Rodker, 40, of Manchester, and Caroline Williams, 25, of Hackney. Williams also failed to appear, and sentencing was postponed to 18 December.
