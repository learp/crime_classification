Police investigating the disappearance of the chef Claudia Lawrence are carrying out searches in an area close to York University after receiving a tip-off.Lawrence, 35, disappeared after leaving her job at the university's Goodricke college on 18 March last year. She has not been seen since but there has been much speculation about her complex private life involving some men who were married or with partners. Many were reluctant to come forward with information despite repeated police appeals. Officers have said previously it is suspected she was murdered.In a statement, North Yorkshire police said: "Police investigating the disappearance of Claudia Lawrence are conducting searches in an area of York known as "the Outgang", which is in the Heslington area."The searches, which began on Tuesday, are expected to take up to three days."We are unable to provide any further information but can advise that they are as a result of information received in the last few days."The statement said the information had not been connected to their appeal last week regarding the night of 16-17 March 2009.Last week detectives said they had received new information from a witness who said Lawrence may have spent the night with an unknown man on that night and that a work colleague said she appeared tired.Lawrence was last seen leaving her workplace on 18 March 2009.Lawrence's father, Peter, has made numerous appeals for information in the last year and the hunt for her has taken detectives to Cyprus and the Irish Republic.She was reported missing after failing to turn up for work on 19 March last year.The hunt for her is one of the largest investigations ever carried out by North Yorkshire police and has so far cost more than Â£600,000.
