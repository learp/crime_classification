The man accused of murdering five prostitutes may not be the only person involved but the truth may never be known, a court heard today.Steve Wright, a former publican and QE2 steward who denies murdering the women, is the one "common denominator" linking their deaths, a jury was told.Peter Wright, QC, prosecuting, said police had first arrested Tom Stephens, who admitted sleeping with all of the victims and who told detectives he did not want to be thought of as another "Ian Huntley".Ipswich sex workers Gemma Adams, 25, Tania Nicol, 19, Anneli Alderton, 24, Paula Clennell, 24 and Annette Nicholls, 29, were all found naked at remote locations in Suffolk between December 2 and December 12 2006. The prosecutor said: "We, on behalf of the Crown, cannot eliminate [Stephens] from possible involvement."He added: "There is no evidence that provides him with an independent verifiable alibi that would conclusively rule him out." Stephens was questioned but later freed after detectives found no evidence to charge him. In contrast to Wright, Stephens' DNA wasnot found on any of the victims' bodies. "The offences may be the work of one man but we cannot exclude the possibility that another or others may have had a hand in each of these deaths," the prosecutor said.The barristers are summing up the evidence and jurors are expected to start considering their verdict next week.
