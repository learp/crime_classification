Jimmy Savile was left free to sexually attack nearly 70 victims, including one five-year-old, over half a century in his home city of Leeds despite rumours among local police officers that he was a "pervert".An investigation by West Yorkshire police into Savile's offending described the disgraced Jim'll Fix It star as a "predatory paedophile and manipulative liar" who assaulted 68 women and men in the area between 1950 and the 2000s. It also revealed that the TV star had offered his services as an "intermediary" in the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper in the late 1970s.In a 59-page report published on Friday, the force revealed that eight of its officers attended Savile's notorious "Friday Morning Club" to socialise with the former DJ at his home in Leeds, including four who attended regularly over a number of years.The inquiry, dubbed Operation Newgreen, found no evidence he was shielded from arrest but admitted an "over-reliance on personal friendships" between Savile and officers and pledged to review how it deals with "high-profile individuals" in light of the investigation.The report added: "When taken in context, Savile lived for over 80 years as an individual who has duped millions into believing that he was a genuine celebrity, a charity fundraiser and a harmless eccentric who did nothing but good in our communities."However, evidence now suggests that he was a predatory paedophile and manipulative liar who caused harm to so many."Intelligence about Savile's offending was mishandled a number of times, the report found, including in 1998 when West Yorkshire police failed to properly record an anonymous letter that made sexual abuse allegations about the late Top of the Pops host.The letter was forwarded by a Metropolitan police officer from its clubs and vice unit, who told Operation Newgreen that it was "common knowledge within the team in the late 1980s and early 1990s that Savile was a paedophile". The letter is being separately investigated by the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).Assistant Chief Constable Ingrid Lee, the author of the report, told the Today programme: "That information [the 1998 anonymous letter] is the subject of an IPCC referral so it would be wrong of me to discuss that in further detail to allow them to conduct their inquiries."She said there had been improvements to police systems since then. "The information was forwarded to the police but actually we've got to look at where we were then. We didn't have robust electronic systems, we've moved forward significantly in how we handle intelligence, how we deal with victims, how we tie information together to ensure we have a complete picture."Another retired police officer and a member of the public told the inquiry there were rumours in the early 1960s that Savile "took young girls to his barge in Leeds for parties".A former detective from the Leeds vice squad said he believed there had been an investigation into allegations of indecent assault by Savile on two girls in the early 1980s, but this was uncorroborated by other retired officers.In its report, West Yorkshire police said: "Despite numerous interviews, system searches and inquiries with other agencies, the review team found no evidence of any previous allegations being made to WYP against Savile, or of any investigations being conducted."It added that mistakes in how officers handled intelligence could be down to its "archaic paper-based system, a lack of personal responsibility by officers, convoluted policing structures and subjective assessments of what was relevant".A trawl of police records also found that Savile had offered his services as an "intermediary" to detectives in the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper in the late 1970s. Savile's name was mentioned on four index cards, according to the report, but there was no indication that he was of interest to the inquiry team.West Yorkshire police said the vast majority of Savile's crimes were committed on victims aged between 14 and 17 in the 1960s and 70s, when the disgraced entertainer was at the peak of his TV and radio fame.
