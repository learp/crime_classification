A judge has criticised laws which allow novice drivers "unconditional" rights after he jailed two teenagers over the death of a talented young rugby player.Sean Goodfellow and Murray McAllan, both 19, were both jailed for four and a half years after an "indescribably stupid and dangerous" race in the Scottish Borders in which they reached speeds of 90mph.The car driven by Goodfellow failed to negotiate a bend near the market town of Kelso, overturned and ended up in a nearby field.His passenger, Richard Wilkinson, 17 and a rising star in Hawick Wanderers rugby club, died after suffering head injuries when some fencing pierced the windscreen.The race, along a busy four-mile stretch of the A698, so alarmed other drivers that one swerved off the road to avoid the cars and another called the police.Both Goodfellow and McAllan had previously admitted causing Wilkinson's death by dangerous driving, while their defence lawyers described the case as tragic and awful.However, temporary judge Kenneth McIver said novice drivers should face stricter rules soon after they pass their tests. "As in many of these tragic driving deaths, issues are here raised as to the wisdom of allowing new drivers immediate, unrestricted and unconditional driving opportunity," he said at the high court in EdinburghAfter jailing the pair and banning them from driving for 12 years, he added: "To drive at speeds in excess of 90mph on such a road is complete folly. To do so while engaging in a contest of speed, effectively a road race with another vehicle, is indescribably stupid and dangerous."In a statement read out on the family's behalf by PC Rory Campbell of Lothian and Borders police, the Wilkinson's said: "If there could be one possible thing to come from losing Richard, we can only wish that young drivers learn from the devastating consequences of speeding and driving dangerously and the resultant loss of young lives."
