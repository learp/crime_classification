The Conservatives are embroiled in a political row after the UK's head of statistics accused the party of misleading the public over violent crime.Sir Michael Scholar, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, wrote to the shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling, after Tory activists were sent leaflets suggesting violent crime had vastly increased over the past decade under the Labour government.The Tories failed to make clear that the definition of violent crime was changed in 2002, making direct comparisons between the late 1990s and 2008-2009 unreliable."I must take issue with what you said yesterday about violent crime statistics, which seems to me likely to damage public trust in official statistics," Scholar wrote in his letter to Grayling [pdf].Police-recorded crime statistics were affected by the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in 2002-2003, the authority said. A change of definitions caused increased recording of crimes involving violence against the person."The authority appreciates that political debate involves the selection and interpretation of statistics and other evidence to support an argument," Scholar said. "It would not be appropriate for the authority to seek to intervene in political debate directly."However, where we see that official statistics have been presented or quoted in a way that seems likely to mislead the public, we will publicly draw this to the attention of those involved."Jacqui Smith, the former home secretary, said the Tories had been caught "bang to rights" after sending out statistics to activists from the British Crime Survey without mentioning a Home Office warning that the methodology had changed.Smith is not unfamiliar with the dangers of selective crime statistics. In 2008, as home secretary, she was forced to apologise after Scholar criticised the government's use of "premature, irregular and selective" knife crime figures.The row began when Tories sent out leaflets in constituencies giving what police called an "extremely misleading" impression. The leaflet produced by the office of Mark Lancaster, MP for Milton Keynes North East, claimed that violent attacks had increased in the constituency by 236%, from 1,790 to 6,015 a year, since 1999.Nikki Ross, the local police commander, told the Milton Keynes Citizen that the claim was "extremely misleading" because ­"everything from public order offences to harassment to allowing a dog to be out of control in a public place" was classed as violent crime. "The actual number of people who were victims of serious violence was 81," Ross said.Alan Johnson, the home secretary, said the British Crime Survey indicated that violent crime had fallen by 41% since 1997. "It's one thing to make a slip-up on your figures – it's quite another to deliberately mislead."
