Boris Johnson said today that he would introduce New York-style "crime mapping", and publish neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood crime figures, if elected London's mayor.Launching his crime manifesto, Johnson said that all the evidence from New York and elsewhere showed "that if you tackle petty crime and deal with the so-called quality of life offences, then the serious crimes begin to diminish".He also announced plans to pay for 440 community support officers to patrol buses, and for the funding of four new rape crisis centres."We have seen an undisputed rise in robbery, violence against the person, and other violent crime. And we all know that we are suffering from an epidemic of unreported crime," Johnson said at a news conference in Westminster.In New York in the 1990s mayor Rudy Giuliani and police commissioner William Bratton introduced a system called compstat (short for "computer comparison statistics") to identify where crimes were being committed.Publishing the information on a regular basis forced the police to crack down on crime hotspots as soon as problems became apparent.Johnson said that these figures were already available to the police in London, but that they were not easily accessible to the public.He wanted the public to have "a real sense of the true level of crime in our neighbourhoods … so that we can bring pressure on the police, and even on me as mayor, to tackle the problem."Johnson said he was particularly concerned about disorder on public transport. As mayor he would pilot a system of live CCTV on 20 of the most dangerous bus routes so that the police could respond to events as soon as they happened.By cutting Transport for London's advertising budget, he would pay for another 440 community support officers. And by cutting the Metropolitan Police Authority's non-recruiting advertising budget, he would release funds to allow British Transport Police to hire another 50 warranted officers.Brian Paddick, the Liberal Democrat mayoral candidate and a former Met police commander, claimed that Johnson's crime manifesto showed he was "clueless on crime and how policing works".Paddick said that publishing crime statistics for every neighbourhood would "further isolate the most disadvantaged in London who already suffer disproportionate levels of crime".He added that Johnson should realise that the mayor has no control over the budget of British Transport Police.And he questioned the value of CCTV on buses."Live CCTV operates in all our town centres and does little to deter anti-social behaviour or speed-up a police response – how will it make any difference on the buses?"Ken Livingstone said Conservative cuts in police numbers in the 1990s were to blame for a crimewave in London, which Livingstone's policies had now reversed."Crime has now fallen for five years in a row, with murder, for example, down 28%, while the Tories voted against every budget which increased police numbers," the mayor said. "For Boris Johnson and the Tories to now present themselves as in favour of increased police numbers is therefore breathtaking hypocrisy."
