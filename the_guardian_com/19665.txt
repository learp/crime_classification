The pace and nature of children's development is subject to so many variables that it is pointless to seek to identify a definitive age at which all children are aware of the consequences of their actions and to tie this to an age of criminal responsibility. No one is arguing that the very small number of children who perpetrate extreme violence should be exempt from the consequences of such actions. What is more important about the debate sparked by Dr Maggie Atkinson (James Bulger mother criticises children's advocate, 15 March) is whether the risks posed by violent children are best served by criminalising them from the age of 10 (in England) or eight (in Scotland). The UN committee on the rights of the child in 2007 suggested an age of criminal responsibility below 12 was "not internationally acceptable". Furthermore, Europe's Ombudsmen for Children (2003) said states should seek to raise ages of criminal responsibility to 18, developing innovative systems for responding to offenders below that age that focus on their education, reintegration and rehabilitation.Professor Simon HackettDurham University• Kevin Howells (Response, 17 March) incorrectly states that "no ready-made treatments were available" for severe personality disorders. But the approach Mark Johnson advocates (Children who offend need our help – not our hatred, Society, 17 March) had already been successfully implemented in the early 1990s in Parkhurst prison. By exploring childhood traumas, all violence was eliminated among the most dangerous prisoners in the UK system. Sadly this success continues to succumb to our prevailing dogmas.Dr Bob JohnsonVentnor, Isle of Wight
