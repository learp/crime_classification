A man whose evidence saw a police chief jailed for corruption has himself been charged with fraud. The Metropolitan police said that Waad al-Baghdadi was charged with two counts of fraud by false representation over allegations he claimed Â£21,000 of benefits. He testified at the trial last year of former Scotland Yard commander Ali Dizaei, and Baghdadi's testimony helped convict the officer. Dizaei's conviction was overturned on appeal in May. Baghdadi, 26, will appear before City of Westminister magistrates on Friday. Dizaei faces a retrial over claims he framed Baghdadi.
