"We are here today in the most difficult of circumstances."For five weeks we have held on to the hope that Jane may be alive somewhere, but last Saturday we received the terrible news that her body had been found. "No one can prepare you for something so terrible - to lose a loved one in such a way cannot ever be imagined and we would not wish what we are going through on anyone. "As Jane's family, we are now living this nightmare. We have lost someone who was so special, and who brought so much pleasure to the people who knew her. "There were many times in the weeks that Jane was missing when we believed the worst, but there was always a shred of hope she would return home safe and well. "That hope has now been taken away from us and we know we will never see Jane again. "The only thing we can ask for now is for Jane's killer to be found."
