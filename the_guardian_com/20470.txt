Police are treating the death of a man close to a tourist hotspot in central London as murder. Officers were called to Hyde Park at around 5.50am on Friday after a member of the public found a man with injuries. The man had died by the time officers arrived at the scene, and detectives from the homicide and major crime command investigating the death are now treating it as murder, Scotland Yard said. Officers set up a cordon spanning an area the size of two football pitches in the park near the mosaic to commemorate the Reformers’ Tree in Hyde Park. At least 30 officers were at the scene at one point as part of the investigation. A postmortem examination held on Saturday at Westminster mortuary did not ascertain a cause of death, but showed that the man had been the victim of an assault. Scotland Yard said no arrests have been made and inquiries are ongoing to establish the man’s identity and inform his next of kin. Anyone who witnessed anything suspicious or has information that may assist the investigation is asked to call police via 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
