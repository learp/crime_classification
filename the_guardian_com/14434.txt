There has been a huge drop in prosecutions for illegal exploitation of workers by gangmasters, with the number having fallen to a four-year low, according to official figures.The Home Office said the number of prosecutions initiated by the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA) were down by 84% from 19 in 2010 to only three so far this year.The number of investigations into illegal activities of gangmasters, including employers who break the law by undercutting the minimum wage, has also fallen, from a peak of 134 in 2011 to 68 so far this year.The GLA was set up in the wake of the Morecambe bay tragedy in which at least 21 Chinese cockle pickers were drowned by an incoming tide. The authority has a limited remit to ensure that businesses in specified industries, such as agriculture, shellfish collection and horticulture, treat their staff fairly by respecting employment law, paying the minimum wage and avoiding exploitation of workers.Three GLA cases which have led to convictions so far this year are:• 17 March: Martyn Slender deliberately destroyed payslips to enable him to underpay his workers. He received a suspended prison sentence. Peterborough magistrates’ court was told that, in one instance, a Latvian worker got just £151 for five 10-hour days, which worked out at less than half the national minimum wage. In another example cited a worker was employed by Slender Contracting, of March, Cambridgeshire, for 20 hours over two days, but after deductions from his pay packet he was shown to be in debt.• 29 May: Rimantas Sulcas illegally supplied workers to a number of Scottish vegetable farms and paid them wages below the legal minimum. He was ordered to do 180 hours unpaid community work. Sulcas had no GLA licence and paid his employees at a rate below the legal minimum wage.• October: A Romanian migrant, Gheorge Ionas, was fined £500 for forcing Armagh apple pickers to endure “extreme exploitation”, in inhumane conditions, in Northern Ireland while operating illegally. He kept Romanian migrants in an unheated outbuilding and forced them to scavenge for out-of-date food from supermarket bins.The Home Office figures were obtained by the shadow immigration spokesman, David Hanson, who said that the home secretary, Theresa May, who took over responsibility for the GLA in April, had taken her eye off the ball.“The GLA has done important work in the past 10 years but there are still too many people being exploited by unscrupulous employers, yet Theresa May has taken her eye off the ball with fewer people investigated and fewer people caught,” said Hanson. “The home secretary should be far more proactive in tackling poor working conditions run by gangmasters.”The former Home Office minister for Labour also claimed that the drastic reductions in investigations and prosecutions of illegal gangmasters showed how little the government cared about ending workplace exploitation.The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, also demanded to know why May was “allowing the situation to get worse”. She said: “She is letting gangs get away with shocking exploitation - treating human beings like animals, undercutting local wages and jobs, and undermining both the local economy and the credibility of the immigration system.”The Home Office minister Karen Bradley has acknowledged that the GLA has reduced its number of investigations, but says they have become more complex and focused more effectively on serious and organised crime. “That reflects a targeted and risk-based enforcement approach,” she said.The reduction in GLA investigations and prosecutions also reflects the diminishing resources of the authority, which only has 35 inspectors to carry out its work across Britain.However many of the GLA’s operations are carried out jointly with other agencies, and prosecutions can be brought under other legislation and not captured by these figures.Ministers say they will consider how to introduce more effective and targeted enforcement action by the GLA and will consider changes to support its greater role in addressing exploitation. But Labour moves to extend the remit to other industries, including care homes and construction, by amending the modern slavery bill have been rejected.The Home Office on Monday named Kevin Hyland, a former head of the Metropolitan police’s human trafficking unit, as Britain’s first anti-slavery commissioner. His role includes improving enforcement of anti-slavery law.
