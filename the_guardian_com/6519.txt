The trauma suffered by families of murder victims is often aggravated by their insensitive treatment at the hands of the criminal justice system and the health service, according to a report published today.The report, by the charity Victim Support, said families bereaved after murder needed more practical support, better information and less bureaucratic treatment from the police, probation officers, doctors and the courts.The claim comes on the day that the widow of the murdered headteacher Philip Lawrence spoke of her shock that his killer had been allowed out of jail to prepare for his release.Learco Chindamo, now 25, was allowed to leave Ford open prison, West Sussex, last Saturday as part of a resettlement programme. Frances Lawrence told the Radio 4 Today programme she was "totally traumatised" about the day release, which she only became aware of through reading a story in the Sun.She said: "I should say that the probation officer with whom I have been dealing has been very kind, but I get the sense that his hands are tied."Speaking about the support she received at the time of the murder, she said: "Our family liaison officer was wonderful, but I know of cases where it has not worked."The Victim Support publication was based on interviews with 41 bereaved people and focus groups with police, probation staff and the charity's own staff and volunteers.It found that families were sometimes physically restrained from touching the dead bodies of their relatives because they were still regarded as "evidence".Peter Dunn, head of research at the charity, said: "It is horrible to hear your loved ones described as 'evidence'. People's grief is made worse by their contact with the criminal justice system."He said families often had to wait months to hold funerals because coroners delayed the release of bodies.Victim Support plans to retrain its own support staff after some families complained of their treatment by the charity.Mrs Lawrence: "It seems to me all the people involved ought to get together for a real debate on the best way forward on this because there is so much unhappiness and dissatisfaction."When something awful happens you get, as well as the grieving, this great sense of powerlessness. The state takes over, it becomes the persecutor, it punishes. You can be very powerless at that point, when you need to know that justice is working in the interests of the victim."A Home Office spokesman said: "We will want to work closely with Victim Support to see how support services can be improved."He said a code of practice for dealing with victims of crime would be introduced in April and the government was planning to introduce a victims' advocate for murder and manslaughter cases.
