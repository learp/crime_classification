Ciaran Lamon, 17, a friend of one of the people who was with Shakilus Townsend after he was stabbed in Thornton Heath, south London, said that he and his friends were constantly aware of the possibility of an attack."It's only when people are killed that people take notice," said Lamon, a student. "It's a real possibility that if you walk home something's going to happen. I'm not in a gang and I've been confronted loads of times. If they stop a couple of people carrying knives then that's a good thing but it won't solve the problem."Ammiel Thomas, 18, also of Thornton Heath, agreed. "I used to have a knife when there were a lot of gangs around here. A lot of them are now in prison. There are still some but it's a little more low key. I got caught with the knife by my parents and I'm not doing it again. It's just common sense not to be involved in that crazy thing. Some friends still carry knives but a lot of people living that life, they die young. I'm not going to throw my life away."Mark, 17, and Raja, 16, from an estate in Longsight, Manchester, said they were willing to talk about the issue as nobody listens to them. "Gang banging [gang fights] used to be about drugs," said Mark. "Now it is about bodies. There's no loyalty among gang members now. There are lots of bad individuals around. We used to run off respect but now we run off intimidation."You pick up your knife like you pick up your phone and your keys. We learnt from television how to kill.""Our life is like Grand Theft Auto," said Raja. "You can get a proper army combat knife for Â£15." He showed knife scars on his left hand and said he did not go to hospital: "My dad stitched them."
