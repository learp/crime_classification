The Naked Rambler has been arrested three days after he was released from prison.Stephen Gough, who hikes across Britain unclothed, was arrested in Townhill, Dunfermline on Friday afternoon by officers from Fife constabulary.The 53-year-old was released from Perth prison on Tuesday. A spokesman for Fife constabulary said he was arrested following complaints from members of the public and has been charged with breach of the peace.Gough is in police custody and is expected to appear at Dunfermline sheriff court on Monday.Gough, a former marine from Eastleigh in Hampshire, earned his nickname by walking naked from Land's End to John O'Groats in 2003. He repeated the journey two years later, completing the trip in February 2006.However, when returning to Scotland later that year to answer breach of the peace charges he had picked up during his naked walk, Gough took his clothes off on the flight from Southampton to Edinburgh. He was jailed for four months but his refusal to wear clothes in court, in prison or in the street led to him returning to prison immediately after each release over a six-year period.Upon his latest release from prison earlier this week, Gough told waiting reporters "this is my vocation", before striding south, naked.Tayside police said then they had decided to take a more relaxed stance.Chief Inspector Andy McCann said: "We have been working closely with our partners in law enforcement and the individual concerned in an effort to resolve this impasse."We hope that by exercising some discretion we can find a more satisfactory conclusion for all concerned."
