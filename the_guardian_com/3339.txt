Police in Manchester have stepped up the hunt for a suspected serial sex attacker after a string of assaults in the south of the city.The attacks on women have all taken place since 19 July in the Moss Side and Hulme areas.In the latest incident a woman in her 20s was attacked as she made her way home at about 4am on Sunday morning. A man had followed her before grabbing and sexually assaulting her.The latest incident follows five similar occurrences. In all cases the victims described the attacker as black, in his late teens or early 20s, with a slim to medium build.Superintendent Serena Kennedy of Greater Manchester police said: "I want to reassure the public that we are putting a significant amount of resources into this investigation, both in terms of extra officers deployed in the area and the criminal investigation that has a dedicated team of detectives working on it."All victims are understandably upset and I know this will cause concern in the community and that is why it is vitally important that anyone with information about the offender calls us."The offender wears fairly distinctive clothing: on Sunday morning he wore a grey hooded top with red stripes along the arm and on another occasion he wore a blue shirt and tie. Hooded jumpers of similar descriptions have also been worn previously."These items of clothing as well as the consistent description from victims makes us believe they are linked and more importantly that someone knows who he is. I would urge anyone with information about the offender, regardless of how insignificant you think it might be, to contact the police."The most recent assault follows an attack just a day earlier. Two 18-year-old girls were set upon in the early hours of Saturday. Before that, a 24-year-old woman was attacked at about 11am on 1 August as she entered a house. On 31 July, a 17-year-old girl was targeted and, on 19 July, a 45-year-old woman was attacked at 8am in Moss Side.Police say the incidents appear to be increasing in seriousness and have boosted patrols in and around Moss Side.Police have released images of a man they would like to question.
