A blackmailer who drove a Roman Catholic cleric to quit the priesthood in a bogus child pornography photo scam was jailed for five years yesterday. The judge at Swansea crown court told Michael Costello, 38, from Reading, that he had inflicted "colossal damage" on the priest. Father Michael Manning was so marked by his experience he quit his vocation. Manning had given Costello Â£100 when he claimed to be destitute, the court heard. But Costello stole the priest's BlackBerry phone and alleged it contained indecent images of children. He threatened "to go to the tabloids" with the groundless claims. PA
