An eight-year-old girl told her mother she had been raped by two boys aged 10, the Old Bailey heard today.The girl had been playing with her younger sister but said she was taken to a block of flats and a field by the boys in October last year, it was alleged.When the younger girl went home without her sister, her mother went looking for her and found her with the boys, said Rosina Cottage, prosecuting.The boys, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, deny two charges each of rape and two charges each of attempted rape of a child under 13.The offences allegedly happened in Hayes, west London, near the homes of all the children, who knew each other.The boys are among the youngest people charged with rape in Britain..The judge, Mr Justice Saunders, told the jury that sitting hours had been shortened and other steps taken to account for the age of the defendants. Saunders and the lawyers in the case dispensed with their robes and wigs.Wearing a dark grey suit, the judge sat in the court clerk's seaT so he was on the same level as the boys.Cottage told the jury of six men and six women: "This case concerns rape by two boys still at primary school of a girl even younger than them."Together they took her to different locations near where they lived in order to find a sufficiently secluded spot to assault her."When they did, they pulled down her pants and helped each other to penetrate her."The events leading to the alleged rapes all took place in and around a block of flats and they ended in a field."The trial continues.
