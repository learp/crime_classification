A Manchester United player was released on bail today after being arrested in connection with an alleged rape at a hotel where the club was holding its Christmas party.Jonny Evans, a 19-year-old defender, presented himself for questioning last night and was held overnight at a police station in Manchester.Evans, who joined United in July 2004, was being questioned again today and was believed to have fully cooperated with police.The arrest came after a 26-year-old woman alleged she had been raped at the Great John Street hotel in Manchester in the early hours of Tuesday.A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester police said: "A 19-year-old man has been bailed until 23 February. Further inquiries will take place."United had booked the entire 30-room hotel for the party, which was attended by 150 guests. The hotel, a converted Victorian schoolhouse, has a rooftop hot tub and suites which cost as much as £395 a night.The party began at 2pm on Monday when the players travelled by coach from their Carrington training complex to the 235 casino in the city centre. The entertainment then continued at the hotel, with lunch and a show by drag queens and burlesque dancers.During the evening the party moved on to the Old Grapes pub, part-owned by the Coronation Street actress Liz Dawn, and the players were heard chanting football songs before leaving at 9.30pm.Some of the players also briefly went to a strip club in town while the rest of the party continued drinking at the hotel.The party is understood to have gone ahead with the reluctant approval of the United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, who had warned the players to be on their best behaviour after problems in recent years.Last year, the club's Christmas party was held at the same hotel, where glasses were smashed and the floor damaged at a cost of £41,000.Evans, who was born in Belfast but went to school in Sale, has made three appearances for United, most recently during last week's Champions League game against Roma.He made his international debut for Northern Ireland in the 3-2 victory over Spain in September last year.
