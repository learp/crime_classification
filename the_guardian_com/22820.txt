The family of a pregnant schoolgirl found murdered in a church yard after a Boxing Day family party yesterday told of their devastation.The body of Amy Williams, 14, was found partially clothed and strangled in the grounds of a church in Telford, Shropshire on the morning of December 27. Yesterday her family appealed to the public for help in catching her killer. Her father Mark Williams said: "Somebody has taken her away from us ... They have got to be caught. If you know anything, please call the police. "We cannot believe she is gone and we will never see her again. "There are no words to describe what that means to us." Amy, who was six months pregnant, was last seen at 9pm on Boxing Day, 12 hours before her body was discovered. Detectives yesterday renewed their appeals to the public for details of any sightings of the teenager in her final hours after she left a family party where she was described as being in good spirits. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Morgan, leading the murder hunt, said: "Those 12 hours are currently a mystery. "She cannot simply have disappeared. We believe someone, several people perhaps, know where Amy was during those 12 hours." A post-mortem examination established that Amy had been strangled but there were no obvious signs of a struggle. Detectives are keeping an open mind as to whether she knew her killer or not. Police also said they were checking to see if there were any links between the murder and the rape of a 17-year-old girl in a cemetery at 11pm on Boxing Day in Wednesbury, over 15 miles away.
