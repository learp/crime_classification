A new investigation will open into the deaths of 62 patients of serial killer GP Harold Shipman, police announced today.An incident room has been set up in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, and detectives are starting the task of contacting relatives.The dead are among the 297 patients highlighted in a government report last week, who are thought to be victims of the killer doctor.The report, a clinical audit commissioned by the department of health, discovered that Shipman issued a total of 499 death certificates while at his practice in Hyde, Greater Manchester.A comparison between Shipman and other GPs in the town showed that 297 of these were "excess" certificates - deaths which were statistically unlikely to occur among his patients. Of these, 236 patients died at home - the vast majority women over 65-years-old.The 62 deaths are cases not covered by the original police inquiry into Shipman, who is serving life after being convicted a year ago of murdering 15 elderly women patients by injecting them with diamorphine.AudioPolice quiz Harold Shipman over Winifred Mellor's deathPhoto galleryThe story in picturesRelated stories 6 January: Death in the afternoon - the chilling routine of a serial killerFebruary 1 2000: Profile of Harold ShipmanExtracts from the clinical auditUseful linksGovernment audit of Harold Shipman's practiceGeneral medical council: Shipman struck offDepartment of HealthUniversity of LeicesterElaine Quigley: analysis of Shipman's wife's handwritingCrown prosecution serviceTimelineHow the Shipman trial unfolded
