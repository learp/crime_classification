Three former Labour MPs and a Conservative peer are set to stand trial over expenses fraud allegations after a judge ruled today that parliamentary privilege did not protect them from prosecution.Mr Justice Saunders said he could see "no logical, practical or moral justification for a claim for expenses being covered by privilege" and "no legal justification for it either".Rejecting arguments by the four men that they should be dealt with by parliament, he said: "In my judgment, the conduct alleged against these defendants is not covered by parliamentary privilege and is triable in the crown court."Saunders granted the defendants – David Chaytor, 60, Elliot Morley, 57, and Jim Devine, 57, all former Labour MPs, and Tory peer Lord Hanningfield, 69 – leave to appeal. "Unless this decision is reversed on appeal, it clears the way for what most people accused of criminal behaviour would wish for: a fair trial before an impartial jury," said the judge at Southwark crown court in London."The decision that I have had to make has not been easy," he said, adding that privilege was that of parliament, not any individual member. "Therefore, even if the defendants had wished to waive privilege they could not have done so."Saunders said parliament did not have an effective procedure of investigating and deciding criminal guilt, and the range of penalties available to it was "considerably smaller" than in the criminal courts.He added that "neither House has sought to assert that these proceedings come within the jurisdiction of parliament. This is of particular significance as the privilege, if it exists, belongs to parliament and not the individual members". Parliament had co-operated with both the police inquiry and the court, he said.He accepted that the processing of the expenses forms was part of the workings of parliament, but added: "I see no reason to extend that privilege to cover the submission of the form.""There has to be a line drawn and it has to be drawn somewhere."All four men deny charges of theft by false accounting. Chaytor, of Todmorden, Lancashire, the former MP for Bury North, is accused of falsely claiming rent on a London flat he owned, falsely filing invoices for IT work and renting a property from his mother, against regulations.Morley, of Winterton, North Lincolnshire, the former MP for Scunthorpe, is charged with falsely claiming £30,428 in interest payments between 2004 and 2007 towards a mortgage that he had already paid off. Devine, the former Livingston MP, of Bathgate, West Lothian, is accused of wrongly submitting two invoices worth a total of £5,505 for printing services and dishonestly claiming cleaning and maintenance costs of £3,240 by submitting false invoices . Lord Hanningfield, former Essex county council leader of West Hanningfield, near Chelmsford, faces six charges of making dishonest claims for travelling allowances. The court lifted reporting restrictions on application by the media to allow reporting of the judgment.
