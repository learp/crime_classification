The parents of Madeleine McCann released an artist's impression of the man they believe abducted their daughter yesterday.The images, drawn by an FBI-trained forensic artist, show a dark-haired man walking with a child cradled in his arms and are understood to be based on the testimony of Jane Tanner, one of a group of friends who dined with Gerry and Kate McCann on the evening their daughter disappeared.Ms Tanner told investigators she saw a man walking away from the area of the McCanns' apartment in Praia da Luz but did not realise the significance of what she had seen until Madeleine was reported missing an hour later.The images, which come almost six months after Madeleine went missing, depict a slim man with lank hair dressed in a brown jacket and beige trousers. The child, with her legs dangling, is wearing pink and white pyjamas similar to those worn by Madeleine on the evening of May 3. The man's face is blank.The artist has not been named, but she was described by the McCanns' spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, as an FBI-trained specialist. Mr Mitchell said the artist left the picture incomplete where Jane Tanner could not be certain of details to ensure accuracy."[The picture] gives an idea of the man's general appearance, his size, his shape and his bearing. We believe that this is potentially the last definitive sighting of Madeleine," he said. The release of the images, commissioned by private detectives working for the McCanns, was given the "tacit approval" of Portuguese police, Mr Mitchell said.It came a day after the McCanns announced the launch of a 24-hour confidential telephone line in a fresh attempt to gather information about their daughter."We believe that this was Madeleine being carried away by a man from the apartment, so we place great importance on having these pictures produced," Mr Mitchell said."Anyone who knows this man should contact our confidential phone line immediately."In an emotional interview broadcast in Spain and the UK on Wednesday, Kate McCann said she believed Madeleine could still be alive.
