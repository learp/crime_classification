A hotel fire which killed three people last August is being treated as murder, police said today.The blaze at the Penhallow Hotel in Newquay, Cornwall, killed Joan Harper, 80, Peter Hughes, 43, and his mother, Monica, 86.Peter Hughes, from Cheslyn Hay, Staffordshire, jumped from the third floor of the hotel after trying to save his mother. It is thought he died from inhaling smoke and toxic gas and not from the fall.At a press conference today, Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Boarland, of Devon and Cornwall police, said the force was treating the fire as arson and the deaths were part of a murder investigation."As a result of five months of inquiries, and being involved with a number of very experienced experts, this force can come to no other conclusion than the fact that this fire was started deliberately. The fire is now officially classified as a murder investigation," he said.Boarland told reporters in Newquay that someone may be harbouring the culprit or culprits."Somebody else may have knowledge of this, even if they were not involved," he said. "We need them to come forward."More than 80 people escaped when the fire ripped through the building in the early hours of August 18.Boarland said the investigation was particularly complex because so much evidence had been destroyed.He could not give details about whether accelerants were used to start the fire but did say it began on the ground floor and spread through the building quickly."Whether it was one person or some people, I think that it is unlikely that someone has not spoken about this at some point," he said."As far as a motive, I have no idea - that can only be in the mind of the person responsible."Inquests have been opened and adjourned.About 90 people escaped the fire and Boarland said it was a "miracle" that more were not killed.Pat Albutt, the sister of Peter Hughes and daughter of Monica Hughes, said tomorrow would have been her mother's birthday."We are a very close family and we feel like we have lost so much," she said."My mum and Peter had a great quality of life. Peter was a well-respected teacher who is greatly missed."It says all that you need to know about Peter that he died trying to save our mum from the fire."Losing my mum and Peter feels like the heart has been ripped out of our family."Albutt pleaded for anyone with information to speak to Devon and Cornwall police.Hughes lived with his mother in Cheslyn Hay, near Cannock.Harper, from Stoke-on-Trent, was described by her sister, Marjorie Brys, as her "best friend".Brys escaped from the hotel and said it was "dreadful" trying to come to terms with losing her sister in a fire she had survived."I saw her every day and was with her during good times and bad," she said."To lose her so tragically has been a terrible blow. I have simply lost my other half."To now learn that someone must now answer a murder charge has added to an already heavy burden."I hope the police will now bring to justice whoever is responsible for such a terrible act and that my sister will now be able to rest in peace."
