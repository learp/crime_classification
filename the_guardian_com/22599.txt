A man who used MP3 players to bug cash machines and steal the personal details of unsuspecting bank customers has been jailed for 32 months. The sophisticated technical scam secured data that enabled Maxwell Parsons's accomplices to use cloned credit cards to buy £200,000 of goods in high-street shops, Minshull Street crown court in Manchester heard.The scheme, put into action before chip and pin cards were introduced, is thought to have been the first of its kind to be used in the UK. Parsons, 41, from Gorton, Manchester, and his team attached MP3 players to the backs of free-standing cash machines in bars, bingo halls and bowling alleys. The players then recorded customers' data as it was read on their cash cards and transmitted via a telephone line to banks.Technology imported from Ukraine was used to decode the tones from the transactions and turn them into information which could be used to clone new credit cards.Police said Parsons, who was arrested in March and is thought to have made only £14,000 from the scam, had developed his computing skills with the help of a friend studying at Cambridge. He at first denied fraud but later admitted possessing equipment to make a false instrument, deception and unlawful interception of a public telecommunication transmission. Two other men arrested with him were not charged over the fraud, although police suspect he worked with others.Police said they uncovered the operation by chance after Parsons was held when a car in which he was travelling made an illegal U-turn in the City of London. Officers found a counterfeit bank card and searched his home in Manchester.
