One possible cause of some of the reduction in crime figures and the perception of antisocial behaviour (Report, 22 January) may be the increasing preference of young people to congregate virtually rather than physically. Teenagers talk or text incessantly on their mobiles and get together on MSN rather than the street corner. The evening gatherings of youths outside the village phone box, which were often accompanied by outbreaks of mild antisocial behaviour, have largely ceased. The technology's ubiquity also means young people always have someone to talk to; in the past isolation could lead to behavioural problems. The best way to get the figures down further may be to supply all young people with free mobile phones and broadband access.Owen MclaughlinEarith, Cambridgeshire
