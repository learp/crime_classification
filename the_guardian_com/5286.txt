Businesses in the UK lost more than £40bn last year - equivalent to about £100m a day - because of economic crime, a report said today.The study, by accountants and advisers RSM Robson Rhodes, identified embezzlement, cheque fraud and money laundering as the main areas of concern, as well as employee-related crimes such as bribery and corruption. Most companies believed economic crime affected their share price and brand image, the report added. It revealed that businesses had lost £32bn last year because of economic or corporate crime and spent £8bn trying to combat the problem. Bill Cleghorn, a partner at RSM, said: "The £40bn cost to businesses is staggering and could be just the tip of the iceberg." RSM said the Enron scandal had highlighted the impact of economic crime, with the collapse of the US energy group following "dubious accounting practices" helping to drive a global stock market slump. A hundred companies with a combined market value of £500bn were polled in the survey. They agreed that, in the light of Enron and similar instances, economic crime was now a board-level issue. One in three admitted to discussing the issue once a year or less, indicating executives are not doing enough to tackle the "business killer". Mr Cleghorn said: "Businesses need to take the risks posed more seriously. They need to put in place effective systems and controls to prevent it, identify material losses and take action to recover those losses. "Economic crime is not just a concern for businesses - ultimately it costs us all."
