No other public service would survive such a report. It would be ruthlessly restructured in accordance with the ministerial modernising mantra that has been applied to education, health and social services. But the appointments system for judges and QCs has a special place in New Labour's heart. This is a service run by ministers themselves. Or, to be more precise, by one minister, the lord chancellor. The system was once described by one of his Conservative predecessors, Lord Hailsham, as "almost as foolproof as it could be".In opposition, Lord Irvine disagreed. Ten years ago, in a Guardian article, he criticised the outdated, secretive and elitist appointments system and called for an independent appointments commission. Once inside government, he changed his mind. Now, 10 years on from his Guardian piece, the independent commission for judicial appointments which, contrary to its title, does not make appointments but instead monitors the lord chancellor's 180-strong team that does, has come out with a damning report. It finds his appointments system slow, opaque, unsystematic and unprofessional. All manner of inappropriate comments ("anecdote, gossip, hearsay, irrelevant self-indulgent comment") were found in the files drawn up from 4,700 responses of 300 consultees on 456 candidates. It found a number of consultees - senior judges and leaders of the legal profession - did not comply with the requirement to provide detailed reasons for their assessments. It suggests the current lack of transparency could be one reason why the system is still perpetuating a white male dominated judiciary drawn from a narrow social group. Of all public services, the judicial system, which on occasions is asked to rule on racial and sexual discrimination cases, should be seen to be free from bias. The current system was devised for a small legal profession. It now numbers more than 100,000. Time for a change.
