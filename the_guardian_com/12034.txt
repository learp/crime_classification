4.29pm GMT16:29Closing summaryAfter a long and packed first day of the inquiry, here’s the main points:The QC for the Litvinenko family, has accused the “mafia state” of Vladimir Putin’s Russia of being directly responsible for his death in London by radiation poisoning. Ben Emmerson says the evidence will lead “directly to the door of Vladimir Putin’s office” and will show Putin himself as “a common criminal dressed up as a head of state”.Earlier, the inquiry heard Litvinenko told British police on his deathbed in London in 2006 that he was certain his fatal radiation poisoning was carried out by the Russian secret service on the orders of Putin.Outlining what the ten-week inquiry will be told, inquiry counsel Robin Tam QC said there was evidence Litvinenko was subjected to two attempts to poison him with polonium-210, not one. The first – which has not been previously detailed – allegedly took place on 16 October at an office, but only made Litvinenko ill.Tam said witnesses would allege one of the Russian men accused of poisoning Litvinenko, Andrei Lugovoi, asked a friend in Germany two days before whether he knew of a cook in London as he needed someone to put “very expensive poison” into the food or drink of Litvinenko.The inquiry heard that both Lugovoi and the other man allegedly involved, Dmitry Kovtun, had been invited to give video evidence from London, but were unlikely to appear. In earlier statements the men had denied any involvement, Tam explained.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.24pm GMT16:24Now we have David Evans QC for the Atomic Weapons Establishment who promises to take “less than a minute” and, true to his word, says only that the AWE has no case to make, just to assist the inquiry as they can.Then Richard Horwell QC, for the Met police, says he has no opening statement.It’s adjourned until 10am tomorrow. That was quite an opening day.

I’m still confirming his name, but his comments so far, as you’d expect, are far more administrative and less dramatic than those of Emmerson.The counsel for May is Neil Garnham QC, I’ve just confirmed. He’s currently talking about the need for secrecy, which is possibly to be expected.Updatedat 4.17pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.05pm GMT16:05Litvinenko family QC call Putin " a common criminal dressed up as a head of state"Emmerson is reaching quite a rhetorical flourish now as he concludes. He reiterate the point, yet again, that the family blames not just Russia but Putin personally: We say that when all the open and closed evidence is considered together Mr. Litvinenko’s dying declaration will be borne out as true – that the trail of polonium traces leads not just from London to Moscow but directly to the door of Vladimir Putin’s office – and that Mr Putin should be unmasked by this inquiry as nothing more than a common criminal dressed up as a head of state.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.02pm GMT16:02Emmerson gets to the nub of what the Litvinenko family want from the inquiry. he tells Owen: If, in due course, you find that Kremlin officials ordered Litvinenko’s assassination, then we will invite you to go further and to conclude that an officially-sanctioned murder of this kind cannot have been carried out on foreign territory, with all the political implications that that would have, without the personal knowledge and permission of Vladimir Putin.

He tells Sir Robert Owen that the evidence should “lead you to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Lugovoy and Kovtun murdered Alexander Litvinenko and that they did so on the orders of senior officials of the Russian state”.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.53pm GMT15:53Emmerson takes a brief detour to dismiss the polygraph test taken by Lugovoi as a “ludicrous media stunt”. Polygraphs are “a pseudo-science” and those who carry them out are “charlatans and snake-oil salesmen”, he argues.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.47pm GMT15:47In seeking further to tie Litvinenko’s death directly to the Russian state, Emmerson argues that the amount of polonium-210 used in the case would have cost tens of millions of dollars, and that there is no evidence anyway it is ever sold on the black market. It is, we say moreover, unlikely in the extreme that any private individual or purely criminal enterprise – a pure bunch of hoodlums involved in a crime gang – would choose such a costly method of assassination when they could simply put a bullet in his head. For the Russian State, however, which produces Polonium 210 itself so it’s readily available, the costs of the assassination would by no means prohibitive.The apparent hope, he adds, is that no hospital would discover what had klled Litvinenko. It was only discovered after an “inspired hunch” by police saw atomic experts called in just before the death.Updatedat 3.48pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.42pm GMT15:42Emmerson now turns to the polonium-210, which he argues came with Lugovoi and Kovtun and must have come with them from Russia: The scientific evidence will show that the polonium was present in multiple locations, or traces were, such as hotel rooms the two men stayed at, and many of the other places…. The important point is that one or both of the men spent time in each of the places where, according to the forensic evidence, traces of the polonium were found...Once it is recognised that Lugovoy and Kovtun used polonium to murder Mr Litvinenko, the only plausible explanation is that they must have brought it with them from Russia.On each of the three occasions on which they can be proved by forensic evidence to have been carrying polonium-210 with them in London, they had arrived shortly beforehand from Moscow. If further proof of the source were needed, the evidence shows that radioactive contamination was found on the plane that Lugovoy took from Moscow to London on 25 October, and in the room that he first checked into when he arrived at the Sheraton Hotel. So we know, in effect, that the Polonium came to London from Moscow. We know, too, that the polonium used to kill Mr Litvinenko can only be produced in an industrial setting involving a nuclear reactor.The only producer of polonium in Russia is the federal atomic agency, Rosatom. We know that polonium 210 is produced at Avangard, a nuclear laboratory that is owned by Rosatom. And we know that Avangard is the only facility in Russia that produces polonium-210.

He was also performing a similar role with Spain’s security services. Emmerson says. Before his death Spanish prosecutors were investigating the Putin-linked the Tambov-Malyshev gang, and Litvinenko could have been a credible witness about these links in any trial.Emmerson says: All this of course came together to make Mr Litvinenko a prime enemy of the people whose activities he was exposing, inncluding not only the leaders of organised criminal syndicates originating from Russia and operating in Spain, but also those within the higher echelons of the Russian government who were collaborating with and controlling them.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.27pm GMT15:27Emmerson then turns to Russian political reaction to Litvinenko’s murder. He quotes Sergei Abeltsev, a member of the LPDR – which Lugovoi now represents – during a Duma debate the day after Litvinenko’s death: The traitor received the punishment he deserved. I am confident that this terrible death will be a serious warning to traitors of all colours, wherever they are located. In Russia, they do not pardon treachery.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.25pm GMT15:25Litvinenko then wrote a second book, Emmerson tells the hearing, one which named Putin as having personal links with a major St Petersberg organised crime gang. Emmerson adds:  We now know that in revealing Mr Putin’s links to organised crime Mr Litvinenko was hovering near the flame like a proverbial moth.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.21pm GMT15:21Emmerson is now describing the Litvinenko family’s flight to the UK where, he says, they took the name Carter for protection. However, Litvinenko published books under his own name, detailing allegations of FSB wrongdoing connected with Chechnya and elsewhere.Of Litvinenko’s first book, Blowing Up Russia, Emmerson says: These revelations did in fact do very considerable damage to Mr Putin’s reputation at home. Even in a country governed by fear, the book achieved significant political traction... He may or may not have known it at that time, but in publishing this book Mr Litvinenko was taking a step closer to his eventual murder. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.16pm GMT15:16Emmerson is now detailing what he calls “the Kremlin’s institutional grudge againt Mr Litvinenko”, one based, he says, on Litvinenko’s whistleblowing about FSB crimes from 1998.In doing so Litvinenko had “broken the culture of silence” in the FSB - then led by Putin. From then on, Emmerson says, Litvinenko was “a marked man”. FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.13pm GMT15:13As to motive, Emmerson says, Litvinenko was killed “partly as an act of political revenge for speaking out, partly as a message of lethal deterrence to others, and partly in order to prevent him from giving evidence as a witness in a criminal prosecution in Spain – a prosecution that could have exposed President Putin’s link to an organised crime syndicate.”Overall, he says, the death “has all the hallmarks of a state-sponsored assassination”.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
