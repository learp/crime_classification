Cherie Booth QC today called for mothers convicted of petty and non-violent crimes to be spared jail in order to improve the welfare and wellbeing of their children.The prime minister's wife, a senior human rights lawyer, said mothers and pregnant women who offend should receive community-based penalties, such as electronic tagging, to prevent the break up of their families.She said that maintaining families ties was shown to reduce the rate of women re-offending by up to six times, and was also likely to prevent their children from committing crime in the future.Speaking at a Prison Reform Trust (PRT) conference on young mothers in custody in London, Ms Booth said: "We are not helping society, victims, offenders or their children by holding so many women in prison. We need to do more to avoid the tragedy of wasted lives and this means finding ways of jailing fewer women."The PRT estimates that up to 18,000 children in England and Wales each year face "an unhappy and uncertain future" after their mothers are sent to prison. Ms Booth called for urgent action to improve support and resettlement services for the thousands of mothers in prisons and their families. "Once you consider that women in prison are nearly always the primary carer and often single parents, it can be seen just how devastating a custodial sentence can be on the whole family," she said. Half of all women prisoners at the end of last year were held more than 50 miles from their home town, and a quarter were held more than 100 miles away, according to the PRT.Just 5% of women prisoners' children remain in their own home once their mother has been sentenced, according to the Home Office, with 12% taken into council care, placed with foster parents or adopted.Ms Booth said: "When you consider that over a quarter of prisoners themselves have been in care as children and many more lack a stable family life, it is very concerning what problems we may be storing up for the future. We need to make sure that today's sons and daughters don't end up tomorrow's offenders."The government does not collect figures on the number of mothers in prison. But according to the Home Office about two-thirds of the 12,650 women sent to prison each year are mothers who on average have two children. From this research the PRT estimates that at least 17,700 children per year are adversely affected by their mother being imprisoned.The charity's director Juliet Lyon called for mothers who offend to be placed in local supervision centres rather than being sent to jail.Ms Lyon said: "Why do we persist in locking up young mothers, who have mostly not committed serious or violent offences, holding them miles from home and damaging another generation of small dependent children when, given the comparatively small numbers involved, it would be possible to establish local support and supervision centres for women who offend?"Joanne Sherlock, manager of PRT's young parents in prison project, added: "Wherever possible, courts should avoid custody and look to use community sentences which can allow offenders to put something back into society, whilst also ensuring that families stay together."The PRT wants improved support for young mothers in prison, and to ensure that they and their families have better help with parenting, employment and housing after their release.A Home Office spokesman said: "It is a matter for judges who does and doesn't receive a custodial sentence. We have repeatedly said that prison should be used mainly for dangerous, sexual and violent offenders and other serious offenders. "Offenders who continue to commit crime, despite being given every opportunity to get away from crime, should also expect to go to prison. In other cases, public protection can be achieved, and just as effectively, through tough community based sentences."
