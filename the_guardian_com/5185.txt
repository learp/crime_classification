Probation chiefs last night warned that Home Office plans to set up a network of "super-hostels" to house ex-prisoners could make the supervision of dangerous offenders more difficult.The Home Office confirmed yesterday that it is considering a series of 75- to 100-bed hostels for ex-prisoners released on licence, including those on the new violent offenders order. It was also announced that the attorney general is to be given a new power to look again at "unduly lenient" sentences in sex cases and refer them to the court of appeal.The Home Office is looking at super-hostels to cope with a beds shortage and because many small probation hostels have poor security or are in inappropriate locations such as near schools.A leaked Home Office document spelling out the plan made clear yesterday that officials expect a hostile local public reaction and expect to use existing crown property in the criminal justice system to avoid lengthy local planning battles.Martin Wargeant, the chief executive of the Probation Boards Association, said it was a bad idea from beginning to end. Hostels needed to be small and local, he said. Harry Fletcher, of Napo, the probation union, said the hostels would make it more difficult to supervise residents.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, also said the hostels were ill-thought-out: "The government needs to start facing up to the shocking consequences of their policy of allowing dangerous criminals out of prison early and start addressing the fundamental problem, which is a lack of adequate prison capacity." A Home Office spokesman said the plan was still in the early stages.
