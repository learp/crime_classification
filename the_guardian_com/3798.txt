Eight men were today sentenced to a total of more than 66 years in prison for taking part in a multi-million pound robbery at Heathrow airport.Jailing the gang at Kingston crown court today, Judge Edward Southwell told them they had been playing for "high stakes" and were motivated by greed.The judge said he accepted that most of the group had been "foot soldiers", but added: "It is worth observing, nonetheless, that this offence could not have been committed without foot soldiers. They were motivated by greed and they played their part willingly."The raid on the Swissport cargo warehouse, which took place in May last year, was foiled by police.Had it succeeded, prosecutors believe it could have netted the gang £33m in gold, cash and diamonds, making it one of Britain's biggest-ever robberies and putting the company's future under threat.But despite the gang receiving tip-offs from an "insider" to help time the robbery to coincide with the arrival of a consignment of Peruvian gold, police were waiting and detained six men.A seventh man, 30-year-old Martin Nolan, of Horton, near Heathrow - whom prosecutors say was one of the main plotters - had been keeping watch outside and got away. He was eventually arrested last July.His brother Steven, 24, of Wraysbury, also near Heathrow, commandeered a nearby lorry, which he eventually crashed into a wall outside his home, where he was later arrested. A ninth man escaped on foot and has never been caught.The men struck just after a consignment of more than 200 boxes of gold bullion, worth £15m, had been unloaded from a Brinks Mat lorry.Another £18m of foreign currency and diamonds was in a nearby strongroom, which two gang members were trying to enter when Metropolitan police flying squad officers confronted them.Simon Denison, prosecuting, yesterday told the judge yesterday that had the plan succeeded it could have led to one of Swissport's major clients pulling out, causing the collapse of the business."While these defendants were living the high life, 284 decent, hard-working people would have lost their jobs," he said.In mitigation, defence barristers painted a picture of a group of amateur criminals with convictions for less serious offences raiding the warehouse armed with nothing more dangerous than hockey sticks and batons rather than guns.Michael Birnbaum QC, barrister for James Fox, 31, of Ascot, Berkshire, told the court that equipment in the gang's van amounted to little more than "glorified house-breaking implements" - amongst it an axe and a crowbar.Mr Denison told the court that the would-be robbers arrived at Swissport in a stolen Mercedes van driven by Anthony Charles, 36, previously of Shepherd's Bush, west London, at 9.40am on May 17 last year.He showed false documentation and was allowed through a barrier into the compound, where he parked outside the warehouse while the gold was delivered.Shortly after the haul had been placed on the floor of a loading bay, the van smashed through the shutters and the eight men, wearing black clothing, gloves and balaclavas, jumped out and ordered staff to the floor.While some gang members began loading the gold into the van, Christopher Smith, 29, of Eton Wick, Berkshire, and Alan Larmont, 31, of Slough, headed for the back of the warehouse demanding to know where black bags used for transporting cash were kept, the court was told.As the keyholder stood outside the strongroom with the keys, police emerged, shot out the tyres of the van and began rounding up the gang.As well as Smith, Larmont, Charles and Fox, they arrested John Davis, 22, of Datchet, Berkshire, and Derek Sheehan, 33, of Hammersmith, west London.The court heard how the raid had been planned in advance, with the vehicles stolen and cloned by having their registration plates swapped with those of identical models.The gang also acquired "dirty phones" to contact each other and gathered information from an inside man at the warehouse.Just under two weeks before the raid, members of the gang carried out what may have been a dry run, driving a van into the compound as they were to do on the day of the raid.The judge told the court that he accepted Martin Nolan had been "one of those who played a central role, and the sophistication of the conspiracy is well illustrated, in my view, by the fact that it was executed with the help of an inside man at Swissport, who has not been convicted."Police have yet to track down the inside man who gave the gang vital information on the day of the raid.Martin Nolan denied conspiracy to rob Swissport, but was found guilty of the charge by a jury at Kingston crown court earlier this year.Steven Nolan, Larmont, Charles, Sheehan, Smith, Fox and Davis all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob, and Steven Nolan also admitted aggravated vehicle-taking.Today, Martin Nolan was jailed for 13 years. His brother Steven was jailed for eight years for his part in the conspiracy and a consecutive six months for the aggravated vehicle-taking.Fox and Smith were both jailed for eight years. Davis, Sheehan and Larmont were each jailed for seven and a half years, while Charles was jailed for six years and nine months because he had entered a guilty plea earlier than the others.Speaking after the hearing, Detective Superintendent Barry Phillips, of Scotland Yard's Flying Squad, praised the "bravery and professionalism of the operational team" and the "co-operation and support" of Heathrow's business community in thwarting the robbers."More than 100 officers were involved in safely bringing to justice the perpetrators of this audacious and sophisticated crime," he said.Mr Phillips said the gang had spent a lot of time planning the robbery, but the Flying Squad proved they were "able to stay one step ahead of them". "It was a classic intelligence-led operation," he added.
