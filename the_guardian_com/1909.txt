The American student held on suspicion of murdering Meredith Kercher has changed her version of events for the second time, telling her mother she was not present when Kercher was killed.Amanda Knox, 20, an exchange student from Seattle, first told police in the Italian city of Perugia she had spent the whole evening with Raffaele Sollecito, her Italian boyfriend. Later she said she had been at the house she shared with Kercher, a Leeds University exchange student. Knox has now reverted to her first version of events, said Edda Mellas, her mother, after visiting Knox at the Perugia jail in which she is being held.Yesterday Kercher's body was flown to Heathrow airport from Rome, despite a last-minute attempt by lawyers to hold the body in Italy for a new postmortem.Giuseppe Sereni, representing Congo-born Diya Lumumba, who is also held on suspicion of sexually assaulting and murdering Kercher, had challenged an assertion made in the report on the killing by Judge Claudia Matteini that Kercher could have been killed as early as 9pm, when she returned from visiting friends.Police suspect Lumumba could have made it back after the murder to the bar he owned nearby, where the first receipt he printed out is timed at 10.29pm.With the request for a second postmortem refused, Lumbumba's legal team was putting its faith in a new witness, a Swiss professor they said was in Le Chic bar from around 8pm onwards, and who was returning from Zurich to speak to investigators, said prosecutor Giuliano Mignini.A police source said that despite Knox withdrawing her claim that she had seen Lumumba enter Kercher's room on the night of the murder, investigators are not about to release him.La Stampa reported yesterday that traces made of Lumumba's mobile phone placed him at 8.38pm in an area that does not cover his bar, but does include Kercher's house. Lumumba, Knox and Sollecito are all being held on suspicion of killing Kercher but deny being involved.The Italian press also suggested yesterday that DNA traces of a fourth person involved in the killing had been found in the bathroom of the house. But two police sources played down the hunt for "the fourth man", reportedly placed at the scene by a bloody fingerprint in Kercher's room, and the sighting of a North African man hurriedly washing clothes in a nearby laundrette after the murder.One source in the investigating team said that the only mark found in the blood in Kercher's room was a footprint thought to be Sollecito's. The man who used the laundrette was being sought, he added, but in connection with another case.A full examination starts in Rome today of the blood and fluid traces taken from the crime scene, and knives found in Sollecito's possession.
