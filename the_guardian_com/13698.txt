The home secretary, Charles Clarke, gave written notice yesterday of his intention to order 16 police forces to merge into a series of regional "super-forces", despite opposition from some local police authorities. The controversial mergers are expected to see the number of police forces in England and Wales cut from 43 to 24.Mr Clarke said the changes would come into force in April 2008 if they got parliamentary approval this autumn and promised that they will not lead to an increase in council tax bills.The new superforces are to be created in East Anglia, the Midlands, the south-east, and Yorkshire and Humberside. The home secretary has already said he intends to merge all the police forces in Wales, despite protests.Three forces - Hampshire, Kent and Thames Valley - were told yesterday that they were considered large enough to continue as "stand-alone" forces capable of tackling organised crime and terrorism.Mr Clarke said the local authorities, chief constables and police authorities would have until August 11 to raise any objections to the proposed mergers. The decision to push ahead follows a report from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary which argued that small forces of less than 4,000 officers were ill-equipped to tackle serious crime.The home secretary said he was satisfied that it was in the "interests of efficiency and effectiveness of policing" for the following forces to merge:· Humberside, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire· Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire· Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk· Bedfordshire, Essex and Hertfordshire· Surrey and SussexThe announcement formed the second tranche of mergers that Mr Clarke has said he will ask parliament to endorse after failing to get voluntary agreements among all the forces involved. "The majority of these police areas have indicated support for change, and a wish to maintain close dialogue with my department about managing this process in the interests of policing in their areas," he said.The first tranche involved the merger of the four West Midlands forces; the Welsh forces; Cleveland, Durham and Northumbria, Cumbria and Lancashire; and Cheshire with Merseyside. Greater Manchester is to continue as a stand-alone police force.A further announcement has yet to be made on the future of the police forces in the south-west of England. The Metropolitan police is not part of the merger programme.The announcement drew anger from the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. The Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said the decision had been driven by cost-cutting and centralisation: "Local police forces are best placed to provide policing. These reforms will mean communities will have less influence over the way their local police operate."The Tory police spokesman, Nick Herbert, said the changes were being forced through and called for local referendums to allow the public to have their say. He said that although the Home Office had said it would foot the estimated £500m cost, it would come from police budgets.Their fears are shared by a cross-party alliance of 35 local government leaders in England and Wales, who warn today of increased police alienation from the public.Mr Clarke wrote to chief constables last week saying he would pay 100% of the "net start-up costs" and "reasonable revenue/resource and capital costs" whether or not forces had volunteered to merge. The Association of Police Authorities had accused him of offering bribes to forces that agreed to volunteer.
