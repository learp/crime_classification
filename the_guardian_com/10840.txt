Burglary victims should be able to expect police to visit them at home, Britain’s most senior officer has said.Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe insisted his force will continue to investigate and attend break-ins, and questioned how much impact a watered-down approach to the crime could have.His comments come amid controversy over suggestions that police may have to downgrade burglary inquiries to cope with budget cuts.It emerged on Wednesday that Leicestershire police piloted an approach in which attempted burglaries at even-numbered houses would be fully investigated, with forensic teams sent – but this would not happen if the victim lived in an odd-numbered house.Last month Sara Thornton, head of the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), suggested people may not always be visited at home after break-ins as police prioritise other crimes.Hogan-Howe declined to comment on the Leicestershire experiment, but said: “I will say in the Met, certainly while I’m here, we will visit burglaries and investigate them.“I think it is a serious crime. If somebody comes into your home, then I think you should reasonably expect the police to come and investigate it.”He said there were an average of 130 burglaries a day in London – a rate of around four a day in each borough.“Even if we have to change some things in the future, there aren’t that many burglaries that this will make so much difference,” he said.“It’s a serious enough issue and there’s relatively few of them to mean that officers should attend. For me it’s an important thing we should investigate.”The commissioner did say there would have to be “a compromise somewhere” as the Met, like other forces, faces further austerity measures.He said: “We are going to have to look around Christmas about what all this lack of money means. We just don’t know yet.“It’s clearly going to be significant on top of what we’ve already lost. Then we are going to have to look seriously at our priorities. “In some areas we are going to have to articulate where we are going to struggle to do everything we used to do.”He said he would not speculate on what areas of policing in the capital could be affected.However, he said: “I’ve made clear patrolling, responding to emergencies, we’ve got to do, neighbourhood policing we’ve got to do, and we’ve got to investigate serious crime.”Leicestershire police said its three-month pilot, which saw police officers attending all scenes of attempted burglary, but only sending forensic teams to half of all potential crime scenes, had “no noticeable impact on victim satisfaction”.
