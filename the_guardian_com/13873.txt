A senior crown prosecutor told the Stephen Lawrence inquiry yesterday that he had begged the murdered teenager's family not to undertake a private prosecution in case it failed and stopped the suspects being tried again.The comments of Howard Youngerwood, who before the private prosecution had decided to discontinue a crown prosecution of the five young men, produced an angry reaction from the Lawrence family, who accused him of ducking his responsibility.Mr Youngerwood told the public inquiry he had felt physically sick in 1995 after learning of the private prosecution. He had rung Mr and Mrs Lawrence's solicitor, Imran Khan, to plead with him to wait until more evidence had been gathered and then let the Crown Prosecution Service deal with the matter.Referring to his own European Jewish roots, Mr Youngerwood said: "I was trying to speak to him as a human being who himself had suffered from racism." Mr Khan had been polite but non-commital.The private prosecution against Neil Acourt, aged 22, Gary Dobson, aged 23, and Luke Knight, aged 20, collapsed at the Old Bailey in 1996 for lack of evidence.The Crown's charges against the others, Jamie Acourt, aged 21, and David Norris, aged 21, were dropped before their cases came to trial. The five remain the prime suspects in the stabbing of Stephen Lawrence in Eltham, south London, in April 1993.After yesterday's hearing his parents, Neville and Doreen, said in a statement: "Like the police the CPS appear to be blaming everyone else rather than themselves for the failure to convict the five suspects."The fact that three of the suspects stood trial at all is a testament to the action taken by us. We still believe that if the matter had been left to the jury, as we wished, the suspects would now be behind bars. Despite the obstacles that the police investigation created, we had the courage to seek justice for our son. It's all too easy for the CPS to now say that they thought it was wrong to prosecute. If that is right, why didn't they use their powers to stop the prosecution?"Mr Youngerwood told the inquiry he decided to discontinue the crown prosecution using his mind rather than his heart: no competent criminal lawyer would have proceeded with the case in July 1993 because of the lack of evidence with which to convict.He described his disappointment when he read the police file on the case, saying: "It made very unhappy reading, in both a professional and human being sense. The evidence was, in my view, even worse than I had been led to believe."Mr Youngerwood said identification evidence given by Stephen's friend, Dwayne Brooks, a witness to the stabbing, was not good enough to secure a conviction against the two he picked out, Neil Acourt and Luke Knight.Mr Youngerwood clashed with Michael Mansfield QC, for the family, who accused him of taking the role of a judge. He suggested Mr Youngerwood should have asked for an adjournment in the court proceedings while police attempted to gather more evidence, rather than the less reversible step of discontinuing the prosecution.Mr Youngerwood replied: "However much I was filled with revulsion about this crime - and the view, which I think everyone has taken, of the suspects - as lawyers we could not allow suspects to remain in custody when really there was no basis of evidence, as of July 1993, and just the possibility of forensic evidence emerging [in time for the trial] two months later."Today the inquiry hears more evidence from the CPS and a last police witness.
