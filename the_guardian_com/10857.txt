A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as a wound to the neck caused by debris.A 17-year-old girl living at the house that had been targeted had earlier called the police to complain about the behaviour of two teenage girls outside. She was later pulled from the rubble of her house by neighbours.Scotland Yard said yesterday that the substance had been poured through the letter box of a social housing flat next door to the dead man's home about 10 hours before the explosion.Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton, who is leading the investigation, said the 17-year-old may have known the two girls who had been causing the disturbance and that they might have gone to the same school or college. At least 40 people remain in temporary hotel accommodation as recovery work continues.
