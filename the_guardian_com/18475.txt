David Cameron said today that companies which make music videos, films and computer games have a responsibility not to promote violence, as he unveiled a raft of measures to combat crime in Britain.The Tory leader set out a long-term strategy to change behaviour, starting in the home and at school.Warning that it could take a generation to bring crime under control, he strongly condemned Labour's "knee-jerk" law and order reforms.Speaking as he revealed a "mini-manifesto" on law and order this afternoon, Mr Cameron said a Conservative government would introduce what he called a "social covenant" to make communities feel safer."Today's document sets out our view on popular culture - that the companies which make music videos, films and computer games have a social responsibility not to promote casual violence, the gang culture and the degradation of women," Mr Cameron said.Under a Tory government, police would be given more freedom and families strengthened through tax and benefit policies as well as better flexible working options, Mr Cameron said.The Tory leader said Labour's record on crime had been its "biggest broken promise" and that Britain had to "fight back against the gangs, the guns and the graffiti ... the drugs, the danger and the disorder".Earlier he insisted short-term measures were also necessary to end the early release of prisoners from overcrowded jails - threatening to put criminals two to a cell."We are never going to deal with crime unless we look at the broader context and say, 'Yes, tough laws, strong action on the police, but also action to strengthen our society'."And that includes, I think, video games and things like that where we do need to think of the context in which people are growing up."Mr Cameron said his previously-published plans to incentivise couples to stick together through the tax system would also assist the law and order agenda."This is long-term generational change," he told BBC1's Breakfast programme. "I think instead of the knee-jerk reactions we are seeing from the government, what we are producing today is a comprehensive substantial report about the things we need to change, whether it's frankly in the home, in the police station, on our streets or in the schools."The Tories also want to give teachers the final say on expelling unruly pupils and end the controversial early release of prisoners.With jails close to capacity as a result of the UK's growing prison population, he added: "You may have to ask the prison estate to double up more prisoners in cells."Other options included prison ships and putting disused army camps to use as jails.Mr Cameron's comments came as he sought to reclaim the political agenda after a difficult summer for his leadership, with growing disgruntlement among Tory traditionalists and criticism of his trip to Rwanda while his constituency in Witney, Oxfordshire, was flooded. The Tories also ran into trouble with a campaign focusing on hospital closures, billed as a post-holiday fight-back, when some NHS trusts questioned the accuracy of the party's research.
