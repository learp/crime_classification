There are no hard figures about the number of bogus marriages performed to allow people to circumvent immigration rules. The Home Office only started keeping statistics in 2001 about the number of weddings registrars suspected were bogus.In 2001, 756 suspicious weddings were reported in England and Wales, rising to 1,205 the next year, 2,712 in 2003 and 3,578 last year. But only a fraction ended in convictions. Around 250,000 weddings take place a year. Mark Rimmer, the director of registrars in the London borough of Brent, was a critic of the previous system: "Up to 20% of all weddings in London were potentially bogus, that's between 8,000 to 10,000 a year. Immigration Service estimates were 10,000 to 15,000 a year across the UK." Mr Rimmer is now part of an official bogus marriage taskforce - one of a number of measures to tackle the problem. Since February, people in the UK on a short-term visa, such as a tourist one, need to leave the UK and apply for a marriage entry clearance visa if they meet the love of their life. For those on student or work visas the home secretary has to give a certificate of approval to marry. The Home Office says there has been increased enforcement by the Immigration Service plus, since March, immigration officers can refuse entry to people coming into the UK for marriage if they suspect their plans. The measures apply to people from outside the European Economic Area. "The most blatant racketeers are a thing of the past," said Mr Rimmer.
