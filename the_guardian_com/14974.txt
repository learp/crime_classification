The number of reported homophobic crimes in London has increased by nearly a fifth over the past year, figures from Scotland Yard reveal.The news comes as police hunting the killers of a gay man who died after being attacked in London made three arrests.According to the statistics, 1,192 homophobic offences were recorded in the 12 months to September this year, compared with 1,008 in the same period last year. That shows a rise of 18.3%.In July this year, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, expressed his concern at the rising number of homophobic crimes in the capital, but said the police "have improved what we do dramatically".Scotland Yard said it saw the increase as "a positive sign" that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people were far more comfortable about reporting abuse to the police."The Metropolitan police service is committed to tackling all types of hate crime, including homophobic offences," a spokesman said."We are working in partnership with victims, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-focused organisations, and other partners to ensure we provide an effective service to victims and witnesses as well as pursuing perpetrators."He added: "We remain concerned that there is under-reporting of homophobic and transphobic offences, but the rise shows we are moving in the right direction."A survey commissioned last year by the gay rights organisation Stonewall revealed that 20% of lesbian and gay people had experienced homophobic aggression over the previous three years, while almost 90% had been subjected to homophobic insults and harassment.Ben Summerskill, Stonewall's chief executive, said: "We've got no evidence that that has changed. The easy answer from the police and other agencies they work with is 'Reporting has gone up. Isn't this wonderful? Gay people now feel happy about reporting crimes.' But I'm genuinely not sure it's as easy as that."He said that, while gay people now felt much more comfortable in public about such things as holding their partners' hands, their increased visibility had made them an easy target for homophobes.He said many gay people reporting homophobic crimes were not taken seriously by police. He called on the police to monitor levels of homophobic violence just as they monitor racist violence.Ian Baynham, a 62-year-old civil servant who suffered severe head injuries in a homophobic attack in Trafalgar Square nearly three weeks ago, died on Tuesday.Baynham, from Beckenham, south-east London, was punched and kicked to the ground. His attackers also shouted homophobic abuse.Detectives have arrested two teenage girls and an 18-year-old man in connection with his murder.
