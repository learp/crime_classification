Doctors have warned the government that the system for evidence-gathering in rape and sexual assault cases is in crisis and could drive the record low conviction rate for rape even lower.The solicitor general, Mike O'Brien, was bombarded with the medics' concerns at a conference on forensic gynaecology last week. The warnings follow a report just published in the Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine, which surveyed almost all the facilities carrying out examinations on sexual assault victims in the UK.The study found a large gap in standards between the 14 NHS-based specialist sexual assault referral centres (Sarcs) in London and other cities, and services in most of the country, where complainants are seen in victim examination suites attached to police stations.Only 6% of reported rapes result in a conviction, an attrition rate the government has pledged to redress. Yet doctors say flawed medical investigations are one of the main factors behind the low conviction rate.The report says that the gap between the good and bad services is widening and "doctors performing forensic examinations in the less well provided areas have become increasingly uncomfortable with the level of service".Many doctors surveyed, particularly those operating outside Sarcs, expressed fears about the risk of contamination of DNA samples, for instance where complainants could pick up fibres in waiting rooms before being examined.Doctors in Sarcs estimated that the likelihood of DNA contamination was low, apart from one centre where the risk was put at medium. But among the 53 non-Sarcs answering the question, 11 felt the contamination risk in their facility was high and 20 put it at medium.Many parts of the country, particularly rural areas, had too few doctors to provide a round-the-clock service, leading to delays in examining complainants.The report reveals an acute shortage countrywide of doctors to carry out immediate examinations of child sex assault victims, who may have to wait days, although research has shown that more than 90% of positive forensic evidence findings in children are found in those seen within 24 hours of the assault.Doctors fear the picture will worsen further as many areas outsource the work traditionally done by forensic medical examiners, mainly GPs with long experience of the job, to healthcare companies. They say that companies may employ foreign doctors with little experience of the work who might have left the country by the time the case comes to court.Last year a prosecution lawyer, Simon di Rollo QC, complained about the lack of experience and communication skills of a Croatian doctor from the healthcare company Medacs in an Inverness rape case. Medacs later said the doctor, who could not be contacted by the crown because he had returned overseas, had been sacked.In Swindon, where GP forensic examiners have pulled out of the work and the Sarc has been moved from a health centre to the grounds of the police station, a healthcare company, Veritas, will take over forensic services from May 15.In the interim period over Easter an orthopaedic locum registrar from Leeds was called to examine sex assault victims in Swindon, the solicitor general was told.Julie Dowson, managing director of Veritas, said the majority of doctors recruited by the company to do forensic examination had been in the UK for less than five years. They came from a variety of specialties but would receive training in forensic gynaecology and paediatrics.John Yates, deputy assistant commissioner at the Met, who leads on sexual offences for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: "We now have 14 Sarcs across the country which offer first class professional forensic medical support to victims. There are however some parts of the country where this comprehensive service does not exist and we are working closely with government to amend this."SarcsThe first Sarc was set up in 1986 at St Mary's hospital in Manchester. There are now three in London and a total of 14 around the country. The idea of locating them in healthcare facilities rather than police stations is to encourage more victims of rape and sexual assault to come forward, with no obligation to report the case to police. They can have their health needs addressed and forensic samples taken under one roof. The samples can be deep-frozen, pending a decision on whether to make a complaint to police. Sarc services are generally better staffed than police examination suites, with more doctors available on a rota.
