A "mean, wicked and heartless" conman who set up an investment scam and then feigned cancer to extract thousands of pounds from friends and relatives was jailed for four years yesterday.Glenn Rycroft, a former British Airways steward, of Salford, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to 25 counts of deception at Minshull Street crown court in Manchester. The court heard he had persuaded unsuspecting investors to put their money into a phoney BA bond, promising returns of up to 15%. He also claimed he had a brain tumour and forged a letter from a hospital specialist to help him extract cash from sympathisers to pay for life-saving treatment in the US and Australia. He read up on his supposed cancer in medical textbooks and shaved his head to suggest he had had chemotherapy treatment. Rycroft, 27, is estimated to have made Â£200,000 by his deception, which he spent on trips abroad and doomed business ventures. "You embarked on this most extraordinary campaign of deceit that had as its object the theft of thousands of pounds," said Judge John Burke. "Your victims, who parted with, in some cases, their life savings entrusted you with their money and included members of your own family and close friends. "If that were not mean enough, you later pretended you were suffering from cancer and went to ingenious lengths to substantiate those claims." Maurice Greene, prosecuting, said that in nine months Rycroft had visited the US, Nassau, Amsterdam, the Algarve, Canada and Australia and had stayed in five-star hotels. On many of the trips he took friends with him who never suspected his illness was a pretence. Toby Hedworth QC, defending, said Rycroft was now bankrupt and a "broken man".
