Frontline police officer posts are being axed as Britain's 43 forces face a forecast Â£1bn funding shortfall. The move comes as street crime is on the rise and police forces warn they are already struggling to cope with the increasing demands made on manpower.'It's only now as councils are setting their budgets that we're starting to see the true picture,' said Jan Berry, chair of the Police Federation, which represents 140,000 officers in England and Wales.Rural forces look set to be particularly hard hit. Kevan Allcock, secretary of Leicestershire Police Federation, said his force could lose 100 officers.'We have already reduced police officer numbers by 30 through natural wastage, ' he added. 'Recruitment targets are not being met and 45 police officers being promoted to sergeants are not likely to be replaced.'Greater Manchester police have not replaced about 200 staff who have retired over the past year, and Nigel Crowe, chairman of Bedfordshire Police Federation, said intakes of new recruits had been cancelled: 'We were maintaining numbers, but our records show we are below that level now and we expect it to decline. It's difficult because we are already stretched.'
