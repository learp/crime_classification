The Crown Prosecution Service is to decide whether to bring charges after a police employee was shot and wounded during a firearms awareness class, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said today.The IPCC said it had handed over a file to the CPS about the incident, in which a man who worked for Thames Valley police was shot in the torso with a Magnum revolver.The incident took place in a classroom at police offices in the Oxford Spires business park in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, on May 30.The man, believed to be in his 50s, was one of 11 control room operators who attended the course. He has since been released from hospital.An IPCC spokesman said: "The matter was referred by Thames Valley police to the IPCC, which deployed investigators to the scene to gather evidence for the independent investigation."Following the report's completion, the IPCC has now submitted the findings to the CPS to consider whether there are any criminal matters found by the investigation."At the time of the incident, the IPCC commissioner, Deborah Glass, said: "The investigation will examine how live ammunition came to be present in a firearm during an awareness session and consider whether any criminal or disciplinary offences have been committed."
