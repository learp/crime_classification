Police are appealing for help to track down two robbers who targeted a man in his own home after contacting him using a gay dating app.The 26-year-old victim arranged to meet a man at his flat in Westminster, central London, last month via the app.When the visitor, who spent much of his time at the flat texting, said he was leaving, the victim showed him to the door where a second man was waiting holding a cattle prod. The robbers forced the man back inside his flat, then stole cash and a laptop computer.Police fear that other members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities may have been targeted by the pair and said anyone who came forward would be treated with sensitivity. They released CCTV images of the suspects, who are wanted for aggravated burglary.DC April Smart, from Westminster CID, said: “The victim thankfully did not suffer serious physical injuries but has been left very shaken by this incident.“I am keen to identify the two suspects as soon as possible and I am appealing to anyone who may know who they are to contact the police.“While we have not connected this incident to any other ... the suspects could have committed this type of offence previously, and I would appeal to anyone who may have been a victim of this type of offence to contact the police, where they will be treated with the utmost sensitivity.”The burglary took place around 5.20pm on 28 September. One suspect is white, of slim build with short fair/blond hair and in his mid 20s. The other is white, bald and of medium build, in his late 20s. After taking the cash and laptop they ran out of the flat.Smart offered reassurance that police were doing everything they could to arrest the robbers and urged people to take steps to stay safe when meeting strangers. The Lesbian and Gay Foundation advises in such situations to meet in a public place and stay where there are other people around.Police are asking anyone with information to contact them on 020 7321 7513, or to remain anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
