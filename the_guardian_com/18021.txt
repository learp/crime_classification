Two hitmen who stabbed an innocent schoolboy to death by mistake in a "callous and cruel" attack have lost appeals against their 40-year minimum jail terms.Jason Richards, 39, and Ben Hope, 40, were both told they would serve at least 40 years in prison for the murder of 17-year-old Aamir Siddiqi before being considered for parole.Richards had appealed against his conviction and sentence while Hope had argued that the length of the minimum term should be reduced. But three appeal court judges including the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas, dismissed their appeals. Thomas said Richards's conviction was "entirely safe".Dismissing the sentence challenges by the pair, he said: "In our judgment the length of the minimum term rightly reflected the entire criminality of the appellants' conduct."This was an appalling series of crimes for which the minimum term of 40 years was just punishment, reflecting not only the premeditated and brutal nature of the murder and attempted murders but also a deterrent element in respect of contract killings which have no place in any civilised society."Sentencing Hope and Roberts last year, Mr Justice Royce said few people would shed a tear if the pair died in jail for the murder of the talented teenager, who was stabbed on the doorstep of his parents' home in Cardiff.Hope and Richards, from Cardiff, had each been paid Â£1,000 in "blood money" to murder a middle-aged family man who had fallen out with a local businessman over a property deal.But the balaclava-clad killers, who had taken heroin before the attack, went to the wrong address in the Welsh capital and murdered Aamir in front of his helpless parents.The sentencing judge said Aamir was a "bright, gentle and courteous boy who was much loved by his family", who had a future "brimming with promise" as a law student.He told Hope and Richards at the time: "You two came in, wearing balaclavas and making a terrible wailing sound. Your attack on him was brutal, savage, callous and cruel. You hacked him to death in front of his parents, who fought in vain to save Aamir. If you die in jail, few will shed a tear and many will say it will be more than deserved."The judge listed aggravating features that made the case's seriousness "exceptionally high", including the murder of a child, the murder of a child in front of his parents, the fact that a great deal of premeditation had gone into the killing, and both defendants' previous long list of convictions for violence.Royce read brief excerpts of a victim impact statement from Aamir's parents. It said every inch of his mother's body ached with grief and she and her husband were now afraid to answer to the front door because of what happened in April 2010.
