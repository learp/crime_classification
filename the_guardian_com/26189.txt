The designer of a huge inflatable maze which broke loose from its moorings and killed two women this summer was arrested yesterday on suspicion of manslaughter.The artist Maurice Agis, 74, from east London, who earned an international reputation with his vividly-coloured labyrinth of pods and tunnels, Dreamscape, was formally held for questioning at Charing Cross police station in London, and later released on bail.Detectives from County Durham, where the tragedy happened in a park at Chester-le-Street in July, met Mr Agis by appointment for initial questioning. They are said to have arranged further sessions.Detective Superintendent Neil Malkin, of Durham police, said inquiries were "ongoing" in an investigation which has looked at the fabric, the weather and the mooring arrangements for the structure, which covered an area half the size of a football pitch. Hundreds of witness statements have been taken about the disaster, which saw the Dreamscape rear up and flip over in front of large summer weekend crowds.Mr Malkin said: "We are awaiting reports from the Health and Safety Executive laboratory and it is likely to be summer next year before we are in a position to put a file before the Crown Prosecution Service."The alleged failure of security arrangements saw a grandmother, Elizabeth Collings, 68, and a mother of two, 38-year-old Claire Furmedge, die after tumbling from the labyrinth as it soared upwards.A three-year-old girl from Chester-le-Street, Rosie Wright, is recovering from serious injuries after she fell from the structure and was hit by part of an industrial fan which pumped air continuously into the five-metre-high maze.
