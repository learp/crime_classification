A painting by Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci was today stolen from a private collection, police have announced.The work, known as Madonna with the Yarnwinder, was owned by the Duke of Buccleuch and on display at Drumlanrig Castle, in southern Scotland.Police said they were looking for four men seen driving near the castle in a white Volkswagen Golf Gti today. The five-door saloon car, registration H596 VRP, was last seen on the Thornhill to Durisdeer Road at about 11.15am. Police also released descriptions of two men seen near the castle, which is about 17 miles north of Dumfries, at the time of the theft. One was in his early 40s, 5ft 10in, clean shaven and of slim build. He was wearing brown shoes, cream trousers with a black belt, a cream T-shirt, a brown Nubuck leather jacket, a brown baseball cap and round-framed glasses. The other was in his late 40s, 5ft 10in to 11in, of slim build and clean shaven. He was wearing black trousers, black shoes, a cream long-sleeved shirt, a sleeveless taupe safari-type jacket and a light cream wide-brimmed hat.The painting was executed towards the end of Leonardo's life, between 1500 and 1510. It was intended for Florimand Robertet, Louis XII of France's secretary of state. A contemporary eyewitness account survives today describing the composition of the painting, that symbolises the Passion of Christ with the infant Jesus in his mother's arms, clinging to the cross-shaped yarnwinder.The duke's art collection is one of the finest privately held in the UK and includes works by Rembrandt, Holbein and Gainsborough. Drumlanrig castle and its grounds is open to the public between May and August every year.
