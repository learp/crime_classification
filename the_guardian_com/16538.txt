A woman has told the Metropolitan police that she was assaulted as a teenager by Tony King, the serial sex attacker accused of murdering two young Spanish women.Scotland Yard has set up a taskforce and hotline to try to identify any other alleged victims of Mr King, recently confirmed to be Tony Bromwich, the "Holloway strangler" who was convicted of a string of attacks on women in north London in 1986. It also emerged that the Spanish police knew of his background as long ago as 1998, and had been warned that he was a danger to women. Mr King, 38, a barman, is in jail in Alhaurin de la Torre in southern Spain. He is reported to have confessed to murdering Rocio Wanninkhof, 19, in 1999 and Sonia Carabantes, 17, in August after DNA samples linked him to the crimes. The Spanish police say he has also confessed to raping at least three other women.Scotland Yard said a 32-year-old woman had come forward to say she was attacked by Mr King in the 1980s when she was in her early teens. Four other police forces have given the Met information about possible offences. Mr King's DNA will be placed on a UK database allowing it to be compared with DNA in any outstanding murder and rape cases. Yesterday Interpol confirmed that the Spanish police had been warned about Mr King. They were given his address in Spain and his fingerprints and were told that he posed a serious threat to women after Surrey police, investigating an alleged rape in 1997, tried to trace him and found he had gone to Spain. Mr King was released from prison in 1991 after serving half of his 10-year sentence. Â· The hotline number for alleged victims is 020 8247 4642.
