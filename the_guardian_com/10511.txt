The judge in the trial of eight men accused of murdering three people who were hit by a car during last summer's riots has instructed jurors to put emotion to one side when they retire to consider their verdicts later this week.At the beginning of his summing up at Birmingham crown court after almost three months of evidence, Mr Justice Flaux said the deaths of Haroon Jahan, 21, and brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, had happened at a time of "unparalleled" civil disorder on the streets of the city.The judge, who is expected to ask the jury to retire to consider its verdicts later this week, urged the jurors to keep a clear head during their deliberations.On the first day of his summing up on Monday, the judge told them: "What happened to those three young men on Dudley Road on that night was a shocking and tragic waste of life."However, you must put all emotions and sympathy to one side and you must not let them cloud the judgment you have to make. It's for you to decide what evidence you accept, what evidence you reject and what evidence you are not certain about. What you mustn't do is speculate about what other evidence there might have been."The prosecution case is that all eight defendants were involved in a plan to drive a vehicle at a crowd of people in Dudley Road in the Winson Green area of Birmingham in the early hours of 10 August.It is alleged that a Ford Fiesta and an Audi car were used to lure pedestrians into the road, where they were hit by a Mazda. All the defendants deny the existence of any plan to harm pedestrians and the driver of the Mazda, 30-year-old Ian Beckford, denies deliberately driving into the victims.Beckford, of Quinton, Birmingham, told the trial he was good friends with two of the victims and had not intended to knock down, kill or seriously harm any member of the crowd.Ryan Goodwin, 21, Shaun Flynn, 26, Juan Ruiz-Gaviria, 31, Joshua Donald, 27, Everton Graham, 30, Adam King, 24, Ian Beckford, 30, and Aaron Parkins, 18, all from the Birmingham area, each deny three counts of murder.The prosecution told the court the Audi was driven by King. Goodwin, Flynn and Ruiz-Gaviria were passengers in the car. The prosecution says the Fiesta was driven by Donald with Parkins as a passenger, and the Mazda driven by Beckford, with Graham in the front passenger seat.Thousands of people attended the funerals of the three men in August and their families praised the community for its fortitude in remaining calm following their deaths. In the hours leading up to the deaths, gangs had apparently rushed down the road and stolen a digger parked near a police station with the intention of stealing a cash machine. The previous evening there had been widespread looting in Birmingham city centre.
