A schoolgirl was at the heart of a fatal attack on a 15-year-old boy stabbed to death at Victoria station in London, the Old Bailey has been told.The teenager, Victoria Osoteku, is accused of buying a set of knives to give to other pupils, and of being one of the gang responsible for setting up the fatal confrontation.Osoteku, then aged 18 and an A-level pupil, sent messages arranging the clash between pupils from rival schools, it was alleged.The victim, Sofyen Belamouadden, from Acton, west London, died after being chased into the underground station and attacked at about 5.20pm, at the height of the rush hour, on 25 March last year.Osoteku, now 19, from Deptford, south-east London, denies murder, conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and violent disorder.Mark Heywood QC, prosecuting, said: "She was one of those who set up and organised the confrontation that led to the death."Her responsibility for the death is very great indeed, even though it was others that delivered the final fatal blows that led to Sofyen Belamouadden's death."He said the girl and another pupil were "at the heart" of all the communication and "were in effect the focal point".He added: "In that way their responsibility for what followed was greater."Osoteku's friends were armed with knives including a set of kitchen knives bought by two of the pupils in their lunchbreak."One of those two that went on that purchasing expedition was this defendant, Victoria Osoteku," said Heywood.The court was told that about 20 hooded and masked pupils, in school uniform, charged a smaller group of pupils near the station.Most of them fled but Sofyen was cornered at Victoria tube station and attacked before he fell down a flight of stairs into the ticket hall.He was then attacked again and kicked as he lay helplessly on the ground and as horrified passengers watched.The trial continues.
