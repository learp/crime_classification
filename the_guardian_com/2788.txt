The government is expected to announce an inquiry into the Shipman case when the health secretary, Alan Milburn, makes a statement to the House of Commons today.Such an inquiry would consider a dossier of recommendations for change, the result of an internal investigation by the health authority that controls the area in which Shipman practised. While there is no system that could stop a determined killer in a doctor's surgery, the West Pennine health authority argues, there are a substantial number of obstacles that could be put in his or her way. Every GP practice and primary care group should publish annual death rates, it says. While mortality rates will vary in different areas, and two or three extra deaths will not be noticeable, cases of multiple murder should show up. The health authority, like the British Medical Association, wants changes to death certification, particularly to ensure that a second doctor's signature on approval for cremation is not a formality, occurring without examination of either the body or the case notes. The authority had not been told of Shipman's drugs conviction by the General Medical Council, which is under no obligation to reveal previous convictions. The authority says this should change. Such information might have prevented Shipman from working in a single-handed practice.
