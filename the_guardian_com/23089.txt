A British conservationist was gunned down in an apparently motiveless attack while studying monkeys in Ecuador, an inquest heard today.Benjamin Samphire was shot in the back while completing a research project so he could apply for a master's degree in primate conservation.A prime suspect in the murder was identified by police in Ecuador but has "gone underground", the coroner's court in Newport, south Wales, was told.Samphire, 31, had been in Ecuador for only a month before he died near the village of El Palmar.Detective Sergeant Wendy Keepin of Gwent police investigated the death on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. She told the inquest: "All we really heard was that the police in Ecuador now believe they know who the alleged offender was and they were not prepared to release the name. They were actively trying to trace the individual."She added: "They believe the person has gone underground and they are struggling to locate him." She said there was no apparent motive for the killing.Samphire's mother, Elizabeth, 65, of Abergavenny, south Wales, told the court her son had a passion for primate conservation and was a leader in his field.She said her son, who lived in Bristol, had kept in touch with her via email, telephone and postcards while he was away and had never expressed any fear for his safety.Recording a verdict of unlawful killing caused by a shotgun wound to the back, deputy coroner Wendy James said: "Ben was carrying out a scientific project on monkey species and had been in the area six days. At about 1pm there were firearms noises and one of the researchers, who we now know to be Ben, was shot."She added: "From the evidence before me, it is clear Ben was a very bright young man with a glowing future ahead of him, with a passion for primate conservation."He had been in Ecuador a matter of weeks when he was shot in the back sustaining fatal injuries. What the motive for this attack was has not been communicated by Ecuadorian police."I sincerely hope they persevere with their inquiries and detain the perpetrator as soon as possible."After the inquest, Detective Chief Inspector Russ Tiley, of Gwent police, said the family were satisfied with the verdict.He added: "The circumstances of Ben's death were tragic and still we don't know why he was killed. Police will continue their inquiries in conjunction with the FCO to establish why Ben was killed and who was responsible."The family would like to thank everybody for their support and be given time on their own now to come to terms with this conclusion."Samphire's brother, Patrick, is a children's writer who is married to the American fantasy author Stephanie Burgis.
