Computerised speech capable of mimicking any human voice is in danger of unleashing a form of "vocal terrorism", where disinformation is spread by hacking into telephone networks, British scientists warned today.The researchers believe that advances in synthetic voices, made by recreating digital versions of people's vocal tracts, will make them indistinguishable from real human speech within 15 years. David Howard, who leads a team of voice synthesis experts at York University, produced 3D computer models of a man's larynx using medical scans of the throat supplied by Brad Story, a voice specialist at Arizona University. The models allow the scientists to generate more natural sounding speech by simulating air flowing through a real vocal tract. By stretching and contricting the virtual larynx, the researchers are able to recreate the movements of throat muscles that are used to produce different vowels and other sounds.But speaking at the British Association festival of science today, Dr Howard will warn that while convincing synthetic voices are likely to improve computerised public announcements and call centre messages, they could also trigger new forms of crime and disruption."We'll be able to synthesize the voice of anybody saying anything, based on hearing just a sentence or two of them speaking," he said. "This gives rise to a notion of what I call vocal terrorism as a possible scenario in the future and we should be thinking about that now.""It could be that you're fooled into thinking your bank manager is ringing you, and gets you to divulge details of your account, or it could be that I've taken over a communications network for a country and I broadcast the sound of a leader to the people," he added.
