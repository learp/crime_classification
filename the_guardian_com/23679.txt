The boyfriend of the murdered teenager Jodi Jones was barred from returning to school yesterday out of concern for his safety.Luke Mitchell, 15, who has been questioned twice by police hunting Jodi's killer, was told by education officials that he could not start the new term at St David's RC high school in Dalkeith, Midlothian, with his classmates and would not be allowed back until tomorrow.Officials say the exclusion was prompted by concern for Luke's wellbeing, and discipline at the school, but his family have said they may take legal action.Luke was in a search party which found the body of 14-year-old Jodi on a secluded path near her home in the Easthouses area of Dalkeith on June 30, days before the summer holidays began. She had suffered a frenzied knife attack, described by the police as one of the most violent they had encountered.Luke has been questioned twice by officers investigating the murder. Last week he was detained for questioning for six hours and released without charge.The police have spoken to 3,000 people in their hunt for Jodi's killer but no murder weapon has been found.Nigel Beaumont, the Edinburgh solicitor representing Luke's family, said he was being excluded for no good reason. "He is very unhappy about it," Mr Beaumont said."Luke and his mother were asked to see the education authorities and were given this letter saying Luke was excluded for the first few days of term. The reason they gave is the maintenance of good order and to ensure Luke's own safety."I don't know what sort of problems they anticipate. Even if there is a risk, I don't know what effective action is going to happen which in some sense will change the atmosphere. There has been some talk of having some discussion with pupils about Luke's predicament."Donald MacKay, the education chief for Midlothian council, has defended the decision to keep Luke away."I am looking at the wider picture and I am concerned about everybody's safety, as well as Luke's safety, as part of efforts to return pupils to school," he said."It was my judgment that it was better to get the school settled down over the next couple of days, and then to get Luke back in on Friday probably, and get things back to normal for everybody."Police were on duty outside the school yesterday as the 950 pupils returned. They are to be given lessons in personal safety and the police will maintain a presence in the area.St David's headteacher, Marion Docherty, said the staff were still deeply upset by Jodi's killing but determined to bring some sense of normality to school life .
