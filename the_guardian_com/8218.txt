Alan Johnson is to criticise the police for not doing more to help a mother who killed herself and her disabled daughter following a decade of abuse by out-of-control neighbours.The deaths of Fiona Pilkington and 18-year-old Francecca Hardwick "should never have happened", the home secretary is due to tell delegates to the Labour conference in Brighton on Tuesday.Police and local authorities already have the power to stop antisocial behaviour and must use it to protect vulnerable families from incessant bullying, he will say.Details of the abuse suffered by Pilkington and her two children – 18-year-old Francecca and her severely dyslexic brother Anthony, now 19 – emerged during a seven-day inquest at Loughborough town hall earlier this moth.A jury heard that the gang pelted the family home in Barwell, Leicestershire, with eggs and stones, set fires in the front garden and locked Anthony in a shed at knifepoint.The panel – expected to retire tomorrow to consider its verdict – was told the family called police up to 10 times a year between 2000 and 2007, with many more reports made by neighbours and Pilkington's mother, Pam Cassell.After suffering such sustained abuse by the 16-srong gang, in 2007 Pilkington drove to a secluded lay-by with her daughter and set her car alight as they both sat inside.The coroner said their deaths could have been prevented if the authorities had taken complaints from the family seriously.In the speech tomorrow, Johnson will tell delegates: "This is about core policing values, which is also core Labour business of looking after communities. It is about responding to people's needs at a time when they most need the police to be there."The Pilkingtons' is an exceptional case, but one that should never have happened."Johnson is expected to call for closer cooperation between local authorities, agencies and police in problem areas.After the deaths of Ms Pilkington and her daughter, Leicestershire county council launched a serious case review into the way the authorities had handled the family's care.The review found there were a number of failings including a failure by the county council, Hinckley and Bosworth borough council and Leicestershire police to share information about the family, their disabilities and the abuse they were receiving from the gang – some as young as 10.Last week, at the pair's inquest, coroner Olivia Davison asked why social workers had never sat down with a family "over a cup of tea" and discussed their problems.Pilkington's blue Austin Maestro was found burnt out at the side of the A47 near the family home on 23 October 23 2007.
