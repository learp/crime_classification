A taxi driver who ran over and killed a kidnap victim as she fell, jumped or was pushed from a speeding car was banned from driving yesterday and ordered to do 200 hours of community service.Mohammed Ashiq, 53, had denied failing to stop after hitting Stephanie Hammill, a 20-year-old travel agent who had been out clubbing in Wakefield, Yorkshire, with her fiance. Dewsbury magistrates heard that Ms Hammill got into a black Mercedes after flagging it down, thinking that it was a taxi. It sped off with its door open, leaving her fiance James Garland, 22, on the pavement. He flagged down a police van and Ms Hammill's body was found minutes later. She had tumbled from the car and then been hit immediately by Mr Ashiq's taxi. The chair of the bench, Joan Obbard, said Ashiq had no connection with the kidnap but must have known that he had hit someone.
