The first integrated domestic violence court in the UK, modelled on the one Cherie Booth visited in Washington DC, will be launched soon in Croydon, south London.The Croydon pilot, set up with the help of the New York-based centre for court innovation, will deal with overlapping criminal and family cases. The project, which will be assessed by external evaluators, aims to test improvements in court efficiency through integrating criminal and civil cases. An information and resource co-ordinator will liaise between police, Crown Prosecution Service and courts, and track data. Victims will be supported by lay helpers from the voluntary sector to try to improve their safety and facilitate their involvement in cases through the courts. The project also aims to test ways of increasing offenders' accountability, improving evidence gathering and prosecuting based on evidence apart from the victim's account, where she is unwilling to testify. The local authority will provide counselling for women and children, and housing and socialservices staff will be on hand at court to provide practical help.
