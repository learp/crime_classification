An unrepentant motorist who killed six people in a car crash after drinking 13 pints was yesterday handed the longest sentence in British legal history for causing death by dangerous driving.Peter Noble, 39, who denied the offence, was jailed for 15 years, a sentence welcomed by road safety groups. But relatives of the victims said the sentence should have been longer. Jamie Holmes, 21, whose mother, Diane, and grandparents, Roy and Audrey, were killed when Noble's Land Cruiser hit their Daewoo on their way home from a birthday party, said: "We have all got life sentences." Noble, a former demolition foreman, lied repeatedly throughout the inquiry after the crash near Sheffield. He even tried to shift the blame for the crash on one of the three passengers who died in his Land Cruiser: John Hayward, 42. The other two victims were David Wood, 35, and Dennis Royston, 36. Judge Alan Goldsack QC said as he jailed Noble at Sheffield crown court that he had shown "breathtaking arrogance in the witness box and failing to show the slightest signs of remorse". Noble, of Thorpe Salvin near Rotherham, had told the jury: "If I hadn't had any drink at all I could not have done any more. I did not feel out of control or drunk. I felt sure of myself and safe." He also admitted that the accident had happened while he was banned for four years over a previous drink driving offence. The court heard that he had run away after being cut from his car by firefighters at Kiveton Park, South Yorkshire, and then snared his teenage son and ex-girlfriend into plotting a cover story. Rachel Renshaw, 30, whom he contacted by mobile after the crash, was sentenced to 180 hours' community service. Carl Noble, 19, who took him a change of clothing at his hideout at his sister's house, was given a conditional discharge.
