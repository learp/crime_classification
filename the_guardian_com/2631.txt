Police investigating the Hatton Garden jewellery raid have charged a ninth man with conspiracy to burgle.John Harbinson, 42, of Benfleet, Essex, will appear at Westminster magistrates’ court on Friday afternoon, Scotland Yard said.Eight other men have been charged in connection with the burglary at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company in London’s jewellery quarter during the Easter weekend.The eight, aged between 48 and 76, arrived at court on Thursday escorted by armed officers, and spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth.They were remanded in custody, and will next appear at Southwark crown court on 4 June. Prosecutor Edmund Hall said on Thursday the total value of the goods stolen from 73 safety deposit boxes ran “in excess of £10m”.The thieves are believed to have entered the building and disabled the lift, allowing them to climb down the shaft into the basement. It is believed they forced open shutter doors and drilled a hole 20 inches deep, 10 inches high and 18 inches wide into the vault wall.The Metropolitan police have since apologised for not following the proper procedures when they received information about an intruder alert at the Hatton Garden address at midnight on Good Friday.
