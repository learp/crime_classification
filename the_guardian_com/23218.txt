Rank and file police officers warned yesterday that holding disciplinary hearings in public could lead to "pseudo-show trials". The Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents ordinary officers, said the suggestion that tribunals should be open to victims, relatives and the media in "exceptional circumstances" would put officers at risk.The Independent Police Complaints Commission, which has the power to order public hearings but has yet to do so, has been consulting the police and other organisations to decide what these circumstances might be. "This is not going to be a routine thing, only the most serious cases," a spokeswoman said.But Glen Smyth, the federation's chairman, said that public hearings for police officers would not provide any recompense to families in cases where they had lost a loved one. "In very emotional cases, they will be turned - as the coroner's court system has at times - into pseudo-show trials which have no bearing on the actual crime or incident the officers were investigating," he said.The IPCC said yesterday that a public hearing would be held only if the commission "considers that because of the gravity or other exceptional circumstances it would be in the public interest to do so".If relevant issues had already been aired in another public forum, for example in a criminal trial or inquest, that was likely to count against holding a public disciplinary hearing.A spokeswoman said the hearings were about "public confidence in policing". She cited the case of the showjumper Tania Moore, who was shot dead by her former boyfriend, Mark Dyche, in 2004, as one where a public hearing could have been necessary. Moore, 26, had told Derbyshire police about threats made to her by Dyche. In October 2006, a number of officers faced a private misconduct hearing. Six officers were disciplined and an IPCC report found there was "no meaningful investigation" into Moore's allegations that Dyche planned to kill her.
