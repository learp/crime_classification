She has a forlorn expression and a demure nature. We have become familiar with the way she desperately clings to the small cuddly toy that has become the symbol of her lost child.Kate McCann has always seemed the most tragic figure in the saga that commenced when her daughter, Madeleine, vanished in May.In the first of those difficult days, her husband, Gerry, gritted his teeth, took deep breaths and then spoke with confidence and increasing authority to journalists. Kate stood by, looking as though all her energy was going into simply trying not to break down and weep.When she did speak, it was often with a cracked voice and without the evident self-confidence of Gerry.Thin, and getting thinner, this part-time GP looked distraught, drained and lost. As the McCanns appealed to the world for help, she wore green and yellow ribbons to signify the Portuguese and Irish colours of hope. Little of that hope has ever shown on her face.Her twin comforts at those moments were Madeleine's cuddly cat toy and, as often as not, her husband's hand. Only on the daily walks to the nursery with her two-year-old twins, Amelie and Sean, did she show any sign of liveliness.It seemed to be the twins who kept her together, along with the close support of her Irish-Liverpudlian family and the occasional jog with Gerry.Then as the McCanns, who live in Rothley, Leicestershire, began to travel around Europe to maintain the publicity of their story - which included an audience with the Pope - her composure grew and she spoke in a stronger voice at press conferences.Her message has always been the same: Madeleine is alive and somewhere out there someone knows key information that would allow her to come home.She has said that she hates speaking in public and always looks relieved when a press conference or interview is over.Over the past few days she has had to walk through ranks of journalists waiting outside the police station in Portimao, amid speculation about whether she was going to become a formal suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine.Yesterday, she faced 11 hours of questioning by police. This morning, her fears that she may become an arguida, or "formal suspect" by Portuguese police were realised at the police station.
