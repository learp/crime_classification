Unfortunately the injustice done to Robert Brown, who spent 25 years in prison for a murder that he did not commit, is not unique (Pain is all I know, G2, March 10). Raymond Gilbert, convicted of murder in 1981, is another victim of the system. Given a 15-year tariff, he has now been in prison for 22 years and is likely to spend the rest of his life there.The parole machinery does not in practice begin to start working until there is an admission of guilt. Today Gilbert, a mixed race youth with a speech impediment, would never even have been prosecuted. There was not one shred of evidence of any sort to connect him to the crime. But he spent 48 hours alone in police custody and, at the end of that time, he signed a confession which implicated another man who was also convicted. That conviction was deemed by the court of appeal to be unsafe and he, John Kamara, is now free. At his trial Gilbert suddenly changed his plea to guilty. His explanation since has been that he was being intimidated by other prisoners who were friends of John Kamara. It was an admission he retracted within a few months, but too late. He had already signed his life away. The criminal cases review commission, accepting police evidence without question and failing to notice the clear inconsistencies in the written confession, have denied him so far access to the court of appeal. Robert Brown was lucky to find a journalist like Eamonn O'Neill willing to take an interest in him. Gilbert has not been so fortunate.
