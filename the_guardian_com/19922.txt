A 13-year-old girl was questioned by police after a suspected machine gun was found in her bedroom during a raid on her home in Croydon, south London, yesterday. Forensic experts have begun examining the replica assault rifle to see if it had been successfully converted to fire bullets. The gun was hidden under clothing and one line of inquiry is that the girl did not know it was there. A police spokesman said the girl had been bailed, adding: "We have subsequently arrested a 19-year-old man on suspicion of possession of a firearm. He is currently in custody at a south London police station."
