The trial of an alleged criminal gang said to use guns and grenades to intimidate its rivals has collapsed after two defendants escaped from a prison van. Kirk Bradley and Tony Downes were being taken to Liverpool crown court when the security van transporting them was targeted in a daring raid on Monday. Today Judge Henry Globe QC discharged the jury after a 10-week trial. He had asked jurors if they could consider the case only on the evidence but said that an "insufficient number" had said they would be able to ignore the escape. The public has been warned not to approach the pair.
