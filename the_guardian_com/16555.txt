A damning verdict on the way the police handle 67m calls each year from the public, including 999 calls, is delivered today in a report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary.The report reveals that centralised call centres have in some cases led to delays of 24 or even 48 hours in sending officers to the scene of a crime.It says that there is no area of policing where the direct comparison with the commercial sector is "more valid but unfortunately more damning" than in the handling of calls from the public. The report, First Contact, says the police service is struggling to match the quality, speed of response and professionalism of private sector call centres. It says that many forces have invested in technology and staff and moved towards central control-room call centres, but the service still falls short of what the public deserve.A police communications operator with 20 years' service said that when he worked in a police station he knew how long it would be before an officer was sent to an address. "I now work in a call centre environment where the aim is for the switchboard to answer within so many seconds. Then the incident goes to a queue till an officer is free to go."Jobs are prioritised so it is not uncommon for a caller to be waiting 24 or 48 hours (or longer) for an officer to attend. Ringing a caller back for the sixth or seventh time to apologise that no one has attended while trying to deal with an active queue of 40-plus incidents leads to stress."The latest figures show that only 13 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales improved their performance in handling calls in the last year, and six slipped a grade: "This represents very modest progress indeed," said the report.One of its authors, Kate Flannery, added: "Many calls, especially on the 999 emergency line, are made by people in need of help or assistance, sometimes in traumatic circumstances."A Home Office spokesman said it hoped to relieve the pressure on the police by introducing a single number for non-emergency calls, which made up 70% of 999 calls. By 2008 every household would know the names, phone number and email address of its neighbourhood or community police officers.
