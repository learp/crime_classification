A pensioner helped to get her mugger jailed by wrestling his trainers from his feet as she lay sprawled on the pavement and handing them to the police after he escaped. The mugger, David Newman, initially claimed he had taken Patricia Bourne's handbag from a windowsill, but once the shoes were produced had to admit that he had attacked her in the street. He was jailed for four years. Bourne, 64, a retired nurse from Bournemouth, Dorset, said yesterday she thought it was her duty to stop the thief. She said: "All the time I was on all fours on the ground and struggling for breath I was filled with anger and determination."I saw his ankles and thought to myself that I had to stop him somehow and grabbed his trouser legs. As I pulled at him his shoes just slipped off in my hands."He got on his bike and cycled off and I was left holding these shoes. I didn't want to let them go because I thought it could be useful for evidence."Detective Sergeant Alistair Rogers, of Bournemouth CID, said: "The fact that she had his shoes indicated that some force had been used. The trainers were used in evidence which resulted in Newman pleading guilty to robbery."Bournemouth crown court heard the attack happened in Southbourne in August last year. Newman, 31, rode past Bourne in the street and grabbed her handbag. Bourne said: "I had it wrapped around my wrist and I ended up on the ground. I was clinging on to it and shouting and screaming for help."The court heard Newman had 27 previous convictions for offences including theft and robbery. Rogers added: "It was great bravery and determination on her part. There was no way she was going to let him go without a struggle."
