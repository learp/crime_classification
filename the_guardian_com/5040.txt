Mark Dixie's friends and colleagues in the pub trade were shocked when he was arrested for Sally Anne Bowman's murder in 2006.They knew the 37-year-old chef as an ordinary guy, a long-term recreational drug user who became the "life and soul of the party" when he was high and moody when he was down. His last girlfriend, and mother of one of his three sons, said the pair enjoyed a "normal" sex life, which occasionally got "a bit rough" but nothing more.It might have been less of a shock had he not hidden from them his 20-year history of sexually motivated crime, which began when he was just 16 when he robbed a woman at knifepoint before fondling her breasts.By the time he killed Bowman in 2005 the morning after celebrating his 35th birthday, Dixie had 16 convictions in the UK and at least one in Australia, including five sexual offences.But Detective Superintendent Stuart Cundy, who led the murder hunt, said Dixie kept his previous convictions from everyone. "There is a lot we do not know about Mark Dixie," he said. "All of his life he has hidden who he is."Many of his friends knew him under different names: Mark Down, Mark McDonald, Steven McDonald and Shane Turner were aliases he used.Dixie's secrets were easier to keep because of his peripatetic lifestyle. A trained chef, he worked in pubs and restaurants in England, Australia, Holland, and Spain.He was sometimes known as "Aussie" because he acquired an Australian accent when living there between 1993 and 1999. The Old Bailey was told he travelled there with a girlfriend with whom he had two sons before coming back to the UK in 1999. He has not had any contact with them for years.Dixie was born in south London. His parents separated when he was a baby and he gained two step-brothers when his mother remarried. He is estranged from his family.
