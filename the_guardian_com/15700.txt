Police investigating the brutal double murder of two Chinese students in Newcastle say the victims may have been involved in a fraudulent internet betting scheme.Chinese graduates Zhen Xing Yang and his girlfriend, Xi Zhou, both 25, were found dead with extensive head injuries in their flat in Newcastle on Saturday.It has emerged they were involved in betting fraud and the trading of forged documents, such as travelling visas and professional qualifications.Detective Superintendent Steve Wade, who is leading the inquiry, said: "A possible motive for the killing is beginning to emerge concerning the lifestyle of Xi Zhou and Zhen Xing Yang."Community intelligence supported by the examination of computer equipment and mobile call data has shown that both of the victims have been involved in fraudulent activity which has angered and upset a number of people. We are currently investigating this as a possible motive for the killings."Officers are examining a computer and three mobile phones from the murder scene. It was revealed yesterday that Yang placed adverts on UK-based Mandarin-language websites recruiting people to watch football matches around the world. In one, he wrote "It is a very simple job, any student who is interested, please contact Zhen Xing Yang" and listed an email address. It is believed betting syndicates in China, where matches are televised a minute behind, could take advantage of live information on the games.Police had earlier ruled out the possibility that either were involved in organised crime, and described them as "a hard-working, respectable couple".There is evidence Yang, known as Kevin, was tortured for up to an hour before he died from a combination of wounds. The couple's cat was also drowned by their killers, police have said.Detectives have not been able to find any occupation for Yang since he completed his MA from Newcastle University in September 2006, and have asked the Metropolitan police for a Mandarin-speaking officer to help with the case.Zhouo, known as Cici, finished her MA at the same time and worked as a waitress in a noodle bar in the city centre.CCTV footage released by police captured the last time Zhou was seen alive, shortly after 4pm last Thursday as she turned on to Croydon Road, where she shared a flat with Yang. She failed to turn up for her lunchtime shift the next day. Friends found her body on Saturday afternoon and police later found Yang's body in another bedroom.
