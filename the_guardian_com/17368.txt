A man who put his hand on a woman's bottom in the street was locked up for nine months yesterday.Ross Davies, 21, of Pontycymer, Bridgend, south Wales, told the woman: "I can give you the best orgasm you have ever had. Serious," Cardiff crown court was told. Andrew Jones, prosecuting, said Davies assaulted the woman in Pontycymer last September. Said to be drunk, he continued to follow her, making lewd suggestions and offering to walk her home. She phoned the police and Davies fled. Police caught him a month later when the woman spotted him again. Daniel Williams, defending, said Davies was "exceptionally drunk" and "shamefaced". Davies admitted indecent assault and was sentenced to nine months in a young offenders' institution. Judge Christopher Llewellyn-Jones told Davies he had assaulted a woman "who was really almost old enough to be your mother". The judge said he had a duty to protect the public from behaviour of this type. Press Association
