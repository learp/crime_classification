A traffic warden was in a critical condition in hospital yesterday after he was attacked while issuing tickets outside the wake for a British soldier killed in Iraq.An altercation began when the warden indicated he was going to give a ticket to a car outside the Gardens Arms pub in Clapham, south-west London, where the wake for 21-year-old Lance Corporal James Cartwright was taking place at around 3pm yesterday.Two men left the pub and the warden, who is in his late 30s, had a glass of beer thrown into his face and was kicked and hit on the head with a crash helmet. The man, who worked for Wandsworth council, was airlifted to hospital with serious head injuries after being assaulted, the Metropolitan police said.A man in his early 20s handed himself into police yesterday and was arrested.A Scotland Yard spokesman said officers were investigating a link between the wake and the attack."It is believed that possibly two men remonstrated with the parking attendant, who had been issuing tickets in the street," he said.L/Cpl Cartwright, who was serving with the 2nd Tank Regiment was killed in Iraq on June 16.
