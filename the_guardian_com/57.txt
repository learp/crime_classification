Labour has called for the creation of a champion of victims' rights in a bid to force the Scottish government to give greater weight to the needs and wishes of those affected by crime.Scottish Labour chief David Stewart is to launch a consultation on a Victims' Commissioner (Scotland) Bill, which has received the backing of various charities involved in dealing with victims and their families in the aftermath of a crime."The idea of having a Victims' Commissioner was proposed by Labour last year but received no support from the SNP," said Stewart, MSP for the Highlands and Islands. "If victims of crime are to get the support and attention they deserve they need a dedicated commissioner to look after their needs."He said he intended to launch his consultation on the bill in the next few days in the hope of winning support across Scotland: "There's a Prison Complaints Commissioner. It's time that victims of crime had their own champion."The Scottish Prison Complaints Commission was set up in 1994 to provide an independent review for prisoner grievances which are not resolved through the Scottish prison's internal system. It has the power to file formal recommendations to the Chief Executive of the Prison Service for corrective action to be taken if the system fails to resolve a prisoner's legitimate complaint.Labour wants a commissioner with similar authority to investigate complaints from anyone who feels let down by the justice system.
