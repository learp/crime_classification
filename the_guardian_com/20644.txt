The number of women and children who found protection in domestic violence refuges rose by 8% last year, according to a report published today.Last year 18,569 women and 23,084 children stayed in domestic violence refuges in England, compared to 17,094 women and 21,465 children who sought refuge in 2002-03, said the charity Women's Aid.Of those given refuge last year, 18,043 women and 22,366 children were housed in emergency accommodation compared to 16,588 women and 20,795 children in the previous year.A total of 142,526 women and 106,118 children received support from domestic violence services last year, compared to 122,570 women and 87,796 children in 2002-03.The number of women given shelter who had no recourse to public funds also rose sharply from 301 in 2002-03 to 368 last year.The director of Women's Aid, Nicola Harwin said: "It is shocking that domestic violence services are still desperately needed by so many women and children fleeing from violent men. "One in four women are still experiencing domestic violence during their lives and women are most at risk abuse when they leave their partners."There is a growing need to provide and develop a range of services to respond to the needs of women and children, and we urgently need more resources for children's services, advocacy projects and specialist services for disabled women and children - but these are still severely under-funded."
