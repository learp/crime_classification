A three-year-old girl died in a house fire started by her aunt's former boyfriend in an apparent revenge attack, a court heard today.Francesca Bimpson suffered 85% burns when she was unable to escape the smoke and flames that engulfed her home in Liverpool last December. Petrol had been poured through the letterbox and ignited.Francesca died from complications as a result of her burns in Alder Hey Children's Hospital three weeks later.Liverpool crown court heard that Graham Heaps, a 44-year-old labourer who used to go out with her mother's sister, Linda Skelhorne, deliberately started the fire in a revenge attack.Prosecutor Brian Cummings QC told the court that Francesca's parents, Kieron Bimpson and Eleanor Skelhorne, and three siblings were in the house. The couple had been asleep and were woken by smoke alarms.Mr Bimpson jumped from a first-floor window and left his panic-stricken partner holding their 17-month-old baby Anne-Marie.Although he injured his legs and ankle in the fall, Bimpson was able to reach the front of the property and climb onto a porch canopy to try and rescue his daughter Christina, eight, who shared a bedroom with Francesca.The children's uncle Frankie Skelhorne, who lives nearby, heard about the fire and kicked the front door in and found his sister in the main bedroom holding her baby "in a state of panic".Cummings said: "The baby was taken from her and dropped to a next-door neighbour who caught her. Frankie assisted his sister before he was able to jump down."The prosecutor told the jurors that Christina was not strong enough to lift Francesca to safety from the front bedroom and her father couldn't reach her. As Mr Bimpson carried out the rescue, the guttering gave way beneath him.Another sibling, 14-year-old Kieron Bimpson, jumped from a bedroom window but was unable to help his sister.Heaps, who used to live nearby with his mother, denies murder.The court heard that Heaps was an onlooker at the scene and had briefly entered the house in an apparent rescue attempt, setting his trousers alight. But the prosecution claim he was attempting to destroy petrol on his clothing and there was no good reason for him to be there.A fire crew reached the house four minutes after receiving the emergency call. Francesca was removed from the house and was found to be breathing faintly, but had suffered severe injuries.She was given oxygen and taken to hospital and later transferred for specialist treatment at Alder Hey.Heaps was found laying face down on the lawn outside the house. Nearby was an empty plastic fuel container that was on fire. He had suffered burns and was semi-conscious.He was later cautioned and arrested while in hospital.It later emerged that he had been in a relationship with Linda Skelhorne, which ended acrimoniously. He had stolen a SIM card from her mobile phone and according to the prosecution, 'bombarded' her sister Eleanor Skelhorne with obscene text messages and phone calls.He told police he had visited a takeaway on the night of the attack, yet CCTV footage disproved this version of events, the court heard.Cummings said there was no doubt that whoever set fire to the house committed an unlawful act and consequently that resulted in the unlawful killing of Francesca Bimpson.He told the jurors that if they agreed with the prosecution – that the defendant started the fire with the intention of killing – then he was guilty of murder. The manslaughter charge was an alternative charge."We say he intended to kill one or another member of the household or cause them serious injury," Cummings added. "He knew everybody in the house was asleep in bed and he knew three of them were young children.He was at the scene of the fire, he had no good reason to be there."Heaps, now of Crumlin, Newport, south Wales, denies murder and manslaughter.
