Organisations looking after two privately funded war memorials in central London that were attacked by vandals have condemned the action.The word "Islam" was quickly covered up after the graffiti was discovered early on Monday at the £6m RAF Bomber Command memorial in Green Park and the £2m Animals in War memorial in nearby Hyde Park. Both are made of Portland stone.The Met police and Royal Parks officers are treating the incidents as criminal damage and no arrests have been made.The Bomber Command memorial, which has a 3 metre-high (9ft) bronze structure of seven airmen returning from a bombing raid, commemorates 55,573 air crew who died in action during the second world war.It was opened by the Queen last year after a long campaign to honour their memory. Private sponsors, such as Lord Ashcroft, John Caudwell and Richard Desmond, and donations from members of the public funded the memorial, which also has an inscription commemorating civilian lives lost because of the raids.Dame Judi Dench last week described herself as very proud to be the first patron of a new campaign by the RAF Benevolent Association for its upkeep.Dean Benton, director of marketing and communications at the fund, said: "This mindless act of vandalism re-emphasises the fact that we must still raise £1.5m towards the ongoing maintenance costs. We ask the great British public to once more get behind the memorial and help us raise this sum."The animal memorial includes two bronze mules, a horse and dog and the silhouettes of other animals that served in British, Commonwealth and Allied armed services carved into the stone wall of the edifice, which is 17.7 metres wide and 16.8 metres deep. It was unveiled by the Princess Royal in November 2004, the 90th anniversary of the start of the first world war.The £2m needed to build the monument came from a national appeal and individual donors, charities and companies, including the estate of the American philanthropist Paul Mellon. The memorial is the responsibility of Westminster council.Ed Argar, council cabinet member for city management, said: "We deplore any act of vandalism or graffiti that desecrates memorials put in place to honour those who fought for our country's freedom. We will clean and restore the memorial as swiftly as possible."
