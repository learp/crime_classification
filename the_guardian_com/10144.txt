Police searching for a missing six-month-old baby boy said last night they had found a child's body on waste ground near his home. West Midlands police sealed off an area of rough ground in the Smethwick area of Birmingham, 300 metres from the home of Troy Simpson, who was reported missing by his family on Tuesday.A police spokesman said: "Police officers searching for missing baby Troy Simpson can confirm that they have recovered the body of a young child from a culvert off Stanhope Road. The identity is not yet known and the death is being treated as suspicious."He added that a postmortem examination would be carried out in due course.Two men and two women, some of whom are said to be related to the baby, were arrested in connection with the boy's disappearance after he was reported missing from his home in The Uplands.The baby was wearing blue Tigger and Winnie the Pooh pyjamas when he was taken from his cot. Officers spent part of yesterday combing wasteland and cemeteries within a half-mile radius of Troy's house.The area of wasteland off Church Road, which is at the junction of several streets, was last night being guarded by five uniformed officers.Forensic experts were also at the scene and plastic sheeting was used to screen off an area beside the brook which runs through the ground.Yesterday afternoon a spokesman for West Midlands police said officers had discovered "something of concern" at an area of scrubland 300 metres from the house where Troy lived with his mother, who neighbours said was a teenager, possibly as young as 14, named Danielle Simpson. They were said to be living with Danielle's mother, Teresa, and it is not thought that Danielle stayed at the house the night her son disappeared.At a press conference yesterday morning, Superintendent Andy Bebbington said that Troy disappeared after being put to bed on Monday night and was reported missing after his grandmother had noticed he was not in his bed on Tuesday morning.Mr Bebbington told the news conference: "There are circumstances around this matter that lead me to believe that his death is a possibility."He added: "The house was in a situation where an intruder would have been very unlikely to be able to enter and to remove the child without intimate knowledge of the premises."
