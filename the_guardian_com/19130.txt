Murdered teenager Hannah Foster might have struggled and scratched at the hands of her attacker while being strangled to death, a Home Office pathologist told Winchester crown court today.Dr Hugh White told the jury the 17-year-old student died of manual strangulation - the "pinpoint haemorrhages" to her face and eyes were "classic symptoms of a neck being compressed". He estimated from the markings that pressure was maintained for 15 to 30 seconds. White said the A-level student had bruising to the neck and windpipe, and there was a 6cm (2.5-inch) scratch to her neck caused by a fingernail. "The marks were caused by the movement of hands on Hannah's neck and the implication is that she has been struggling while this process is going on," he said. "The fingernail scratch could have been the assailant or Hannah herself scratching the hands of her assailant." The pathologist told the jury that when he examined the body of the 17-year-old, her tights were inside out, her underpants were twisted and her bra was only partially clasped, with one cup folded in. She had scratches, probably caused by brambles, to the front and back of her body, her hands and top of her legs, White said.He said some of the bramble scratches appeared to have been caused while Hannah was alive and others after she died. The holes in her tights did not match the injuries on her body, suggesting they were made after the clothes were removed.White said Hannah was found wearing a pair of boots but the soles of her feet were dirty and the scratches to her legs stopped at the level of the boots.There was no evidence of drugs or alcohol in her system. Hannah's body was found in a bramble-filled ditch in Southampton on March 16 2003, two days after she disappeared near her home. Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, 40, a sandwich delivery van driver, is accused of her murder, rape, kidnapping and false imprisonment. He denies all charges.
