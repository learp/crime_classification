We naturally applaud the successes of the Forensic Science Service in resolving closed crime cases through new DNA technology (Case closed, G2, January 16). This will help many victims, like the ones you quote, to reconcile themselves with what has happened by seeing "their" perpetrator brought to justice. However, a word of caution: this experience will not be the same for everyone. We need to be sensitive to those who have moved on and for whom reopening past events will bring up new and painful trauma. It is absolutely essential, therefore, that the potentially damaging effects on victims and their families are considered when reopening cold cases.This is not an argument that closed crime cases should not be resolved. But we must not allow the lure of hi-tech detection to revictimise those already hurt by the crimes of the past. Tact and sensitivity are needed just as much as forensic samples and new techniques.
