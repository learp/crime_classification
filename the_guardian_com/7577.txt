Organisers of a climate protest camp to be set up at Heathrow airport this week are recruiting and training observers to monitor arrests and collect evidence for court cases.The move follows an announcement by police that they are prepared to use controversial anti-terror laws, including powers to stop and search without 'reasonable grounds', and to bring in up to 1,800 officers from four forces to patrol the Camp for Climate Action, a week-long protest against the proposed expansion of Heathrow, and aviation in general.BAA, Heathrow's owner, has also promised to bring in extra security staff as well as dozens of outside specialists to help deal with the 1,500 protesters expected to gather at the airport this week.The observers recruited by the protesters are to be trained to make sure police arrests are carried out using the correct procedures and without 'undue force'. 'We will try to find out who's arrested and document what has happened,' said a spokesman for the protesters. 'That will be fed back to our teams so we can make sure people get the necessary support if they are arrested.'Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair has warned there may be disruption to passengers using Heathrow this week, but yesterday BAA said it did not expect trouble and was not giving travellers special advice.
