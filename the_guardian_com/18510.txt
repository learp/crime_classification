A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of a teenager believed to have been attacked by a gang wielding swords and knives.Hani Abou El Kheir, 16, died from multiple stab wounds after he was set upon on in Pimlico, central London, on Sunday evening in a suspected drugs-related attack in which police believe 10 people were involved.The suspect was arrested in north London during an early morning raid, Scotland Yard said on Thursday.Hani, who lived on the nearby Churchill Gardens estate, was taken to hospital but died later. Detectives said a number of witnesses had already come forward.Detective Chief Inspector Neil Attewell, of the Met's homicide and serious crime command, said the teenager died after being subjected to a "horrific … sustained [and] vicious attack", adding: "The tragic events of last Sunday have left Hani's mother and wider family completely devastated."I am directly appealing to the parents and carers of those believed to be involved – if you have the slightest indication that your child may have been involved in this incident I encourage you to get them to hand themselves in to the police. Failing to do so will result in my officers pursuing them until we have caught all those responsible."A note from Hani's mother, Pauline Hickey, left with flowers at the scene of the attack read: "My baby. My heart is broken. I love you so much, the pain is unbearable. Your loving mother."Another tribute attached to a nearby bus stop was a copy of a note he had written to her alongside a picture of him as a young boy.It said: "Thank you for being the best mum. Love to mummy, thank you for everything. Love from Hani."The tribute was signed by relatives including the teenager's grandparents, and cousins in Ireland.
