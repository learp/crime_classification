A police force has paid a six-figure out-of-court settlement to a man after officers allegedly held guns to the heads of his two eldest children during an armed raid at his home.Steven Genovese, 39, was detained after 23 officers burst into his home in Prestwich, north Manchester, during an investigation into allegations of assault five years ago. Guns were allegedly put to the heads of his two eldest children Toni, who was 12 at the time, and 11-year-old Lee as they were frogmarched into the living room by officers. His wife, Tracey, cowered in a corner with their three-year-old son Steven. Mr Genovese and another man, Anthony Evitt, were charged with a string of offences and kept in custody for 70 days. But all charges against them were dropped. A judge later said police had been "trawling the barrel" to prosecute the men. They sued Greater Manchester police alleging fabrication of evidence, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Yesterday Greater Manchester police agreed an out-of-court settlement, five months before the civil trial was due. Mr Genovese said yesterday: "To this day, I believe the police thought they could get rid of me and Anthony by setting us up for a long stretch in prison. "We simply knew too much and they thought they could get away with it. Both Anthony and I had to spend 70 hard days in prison as a result of the false and malicious allegations made against us, and although we cleared our names in court, the true horror of what might have happened if we had been sent down still lives with us. "I hope this sends a message to all police officers that no one is above the law." Greater Manchester police had denied liability. A spokeswoman said no officers would face disciplinary action. "The arrest and charges have been made the subject of a full police inquiry," she added.
