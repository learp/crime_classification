Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, is expected this week to call on the government to end prison overcrowding, arguing that it is time the jail population was reduced to "an unavoidable minimum". This week sees the 10th anniversary of the publication of Lord Woolf's report into prison conditions in the wake of the Strangeways riot and he is expected to use the annual Prison Reform Trust lecture on Wednesday to argue that its reform agenda is as relevant today as it was a decade ago.The prison population stood at only 45,600 when Lord Woolf first called for prison numbers to be reduced to the "unavoidable minimum" but it now stands at more than 62,000 and is projected to rise to 70,800 in the next two years. Lord Woolf is expected to revive his recommendations that prisoners should be held nearer their homes. Some 26,000 in mates are still held more than 50 miles from home, and 11,000 more than 100 miles.The former Conservative home secretary, Lord Hurd of Westwell, in an interview with the Guardian, also warns of the corrosive impact of overcrowding. He says that it is time for inmates to be given the vote and for a prime minister to visit a prison."If prisoners had the vote then MPs would take a good deal more interest in conditions in prison," he said. Lord Hurd also says no serving prime minister has ever visited a prison and discloses that a plan for Tony Blair to do so was shelved because of public relations fears."It is one of our public services and prisons are important institutions. Prisons are not a series of wastepaper baskets into which you can simply toss somebody and not hear from them again."
