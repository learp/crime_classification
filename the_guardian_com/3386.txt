A 20-year-old man has been arrested yesterday in connection with the murder of an elderly widow. Joan Charlton, 85, died from head injuries as a result of what police described as a "sustained and brutal attack" following a break-in at her home in Hull. Humberside police said the local man was being held in custody following the murder, which was discovered on Thursday. Detective Superintendent Dena Fleming, leading the inquiry, said: "Forensic examinations are taking place at the property. This is a particularly horrendous attack on a defenceless old lady in her own home." PA
