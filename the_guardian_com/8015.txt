More than 300 schoolchildren in prison are not receiving the education they need, according to a report out today by the country's oldest penal reform charity.Young offenders face a lottery when it comes to training, a survey by the Howard League found, with classes frequently cancelled in some prisons, and teachers often lacking teaching qualifications. The findings suggest prison is less likely to prevent future crime, says the charity.The Howard League visited all 13 of the prisons holding boys and spoke to a third of all 15-year-olds. It found a quarter had been studying for GCSE exams before being sent to prison. A fifth had special educational needs and over a third found reading and writing difficult.But the survey revealed dramatic differences in the quality of education offered in prison. In some, classes were often cancelled, and teachers lacked the qualifications and experience to teach schoolchildren.Prisons were not offereing special help to boys who could barely read or write, while offenders who had been studying GCSEs at school were often unable to continue with their work in prison. Boys with special educational needs received no extra support.In some prison education departments, however, offenders were being offered one-to-one sessions with a teacher, tailored to their needs, the report added.Frances Crook, director of the Howard League, said: "Too little attention is being paid to the educational needs of children in prison, yet educational achievement is a crucial factor in successful rehabilitation. Education in prison should be focused on the individual and be able to engage the young person. It should be a priority within the prison regime." Missing the Grade: Education for children in prison is available from the Howard League priced £10.
