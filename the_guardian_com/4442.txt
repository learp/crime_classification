A man has been arrested tonight after a siege at a bank in west London.The suspected gunman took a number of hostages in the incident at Barclays bank in Church Road, Ashford.Some three hours after the incident began, a man in his 30s was arrested, Surrey police said.It was understood that the raider forced some of the hostages to put on white boiler suits and also that he asked them to spraypaint to blacken the windows on the inside, so people could not see in.Superintendent Duncan Greenhalgh said shortly before 4pm, Surrey police received reports that a man with a firearm had entered the bank.He said a number of people were inside the bank at the time and being prevented from leaving. "This was a fast-moving incident and police were on the scene within minutes," he said."Trained hostage negotiators made contact with an individual inside the bank and just after 7pm a man came out of the bank and was contained by armed police."A man in his 30s has been arrested and is currently in police custody. All the people involved are being assessed by medical teams but there have been no serious injuries.Local businessman Neil Wood, owner of Ashford Glass, about 150 yards from the bank, said he understood that up to 16 hostages had been released."There are thought to be about three staff members who have been let go, identifiable by their shirts," he said.Witnesses said one man who came out of the bank had a gun put in his face by police and there was speculation that this was the man who was arrested.Tim Kiy, Barclays corporate affairs director, said: "We are immensely relieved and happy that all those involved are now safe and able to be reunited with their families.
