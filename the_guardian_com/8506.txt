Supergrasses who help bring organised criminals to justice will be offered immunity from prosecution under the terms of a bill published today to set up a "British FBI".The serious organised crime agency (Soca), announced yesterday in the Queen's speech, will target crimes such as credit card fraud, drug trafficking and human trafficking.Its 5,000 investigators, drawn from existing law enforcement agencies, will be given full police powers even if they have never been a police officer before.The bill also includes a new law to stop trespassing on specified royal and government property - a response to the "comedy terrorist" who managed to get into Prince William's birthday party at Windsor Castle last year - and creates a new offence of incitement to religious hatred."This bill represents the fulfilment of a lot of hard work," said the home secretary, David Blunkett. "The new agency will add value to the work of the existing agencies and link intelligence, investigation and intervention in new ways."The bill sets out a witness protection scheme that would be provided for people such as supergrasses. Ministers hope formalising the practice will increase the number of people who testify against former accomplices. Earlier this year, the Home Office said that, in drug trafficking crimes, less than 1% of cases brought by Customs and Excise last year saw defendants turn Queen's evidence, compared with 26% doing the equivalent in the US.Soca's director general, Bill Hughes, said the arrangement put "the fear back where it should be - within the organised crime enterprises - because they are then at threat from within.""The system of supergrasses before did not work properly for many reasons. This is a different approach," he added.The bill also introduces extra police powers including the right to take fingerprints undercover and on the street, and extends the scope of search warrants so they apply to any premises occupied or accessed by a named person. In another radical move, the bill is expected to include powers to force crime ringleaders to hand over their bank statements for up to a decade after release from jail to prove that they are no longer earning money from crime.A white paper published in April said the new organisation would be "lawfully audacious" in cracking down on organised crime.A former head of MI5 has been appointed to a key position in the new agency - the first time a former spymaster has taken such a major role in British policing - and he will today give his first press conference in the post.Sir Stephen Lander, who was named as Soca's chairman earlier this year, had a 25-year career in the security service. He has indicated that he is keen to see analysts who have been trained by the security services - MI5, MI6 and GCHQ - working alongside the police to target major criminals."This is one of the biggest changes in UK law enforcement since the 1960s," he said. "[It] presents a real opportunity to make a difference and tackle crimes that affect every man, woman and child in this country."Soca is due to begin work in April 2006, replacing the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and investigation teams at HM Customs and Excise and the Immigration Service.
