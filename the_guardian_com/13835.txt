A south Manchester coroner ruled today that 81-year-old Hilda Hibbert was a victim of former GP Harold Shipman.Hibbert's family returned home in January 1996 and discovered her dead body. Relatives testified that Hibbert was playing hide and seek with her great-granddaughter an hour before Shipman's visit to her home in Hyde. She had called the doctor after complaining that she was feeling queasy, but just before Shipman's visit, Hibbert told her granddaughter she was feeling better. The coroner, John Pollard, said at the hearing in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, that it "beggared belief" to reach any other conclusion on how Hibbert had died. The inquest on Hibbert was the first of a series of hearings on 24 of Shipman's suspected victims. The so-called "B list" was drawn up by police who feel there is enough evidence to link Shipman with the deaths. But the cases did not proceed to trial because of the 15 other murder charges on which the doctor was convicted and sentenced to life at Preston Crown Court a year ago. A report commissioned by Department of Health last week suggested that Shipman could have been responsible for the deaths of up to 300 of his patients over a 24-year period.AudioJanuary 5: Helen Carter in HydePolice quiz Harold Shipman over Winifred Mellor's deathPhoto galleryThe story in picturesRelated articles7 January: New powers unveiled to track down deadly GPs6 January: Death in the afternoon - the chilling routine of a serial killerFebruary 1 2000: Profile of Harold ShipmanUseful linksGovernment audit of Harold Shipman's practiceGeneral medical council: Shipman struck offDepartment of HealthUniversity of LeicesterElaine Quigley: analysis of Shipman's wife's handwritingCrown prosecution serviceTimeline How the Shipman trial unfolded
