A former policeman is to be tried in Scotland for a second time for the murder of a young woman. Alexander Hall, aged 43, was jailed for life in February 1988 after a jury found him guilty of the murder of Lorna Porter, 18. She was found on waste ground with her throat slit in Bellshill, Lanarkshire, in 1984. Hall served almost 11 years for her murder, but his conviction was quashed at an appeal hearing in December. Three judges ruled that he had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice after it was alleged a key prosecution witness had lied at his trial. They ruled that the Crown Office could not be held responsible for the alleged perjury, and left the door open for a retrial. Hall was detained in custody until the Crown Office decided whether to bring a new prosecution against him. The case is the first in Scotland where a convicted criminal has faced a retrial since legislation was introduced allowing evidence available at the time of the trial, but not produced, to be used as grounds of appeal. Hall is due to appear at the High Court in Edinburgh on March 22.
