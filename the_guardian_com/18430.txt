A man who was filmed punching a 97-year-old war veteran in an attack on a tram has walked free from court, despite leaving his victim blinded in one eye.Stephen Gordon, 44, burst into a fit of rage when he was unable to push past Shah Chaudhury, a great-grandfather, as he stood in the aisle of the busy tram in Croydon, south London.Mr Chaudhury, who walks with the aid of two sticks, struggled to move out of the way but Gordon turned and punched him in the face, calling him a "bastard".The attack was caught on CCTV and witnessed by dozens of passengers. Croydon crown court was told that Gordon claimed the pensioner had punched him and the footage had been faked.Since the attack Mr Chaudhury's health has deteriorated and he has moved to a residential home.Yesterday Gordon, from Croydon, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, but was spared a jail term despite Judge Kenneth Macrae admitting that a "significant prison sentence would well be justified".Instead he sentenced Gordon to a three-year community order which requires him to receive psychiatric treatment. The judge said jailing him would "do nothing to protect the public".Detective Sergeant Sam Blackburn, of the British Transport police, said he was disappointed with the sentence."This was a particularly nasty attack on an elderly man who was obviously very frail and was physically not able to defend himself."
