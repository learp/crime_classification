A crackdown on dangerous doctors, to be unveiled this week in the wake of the Harold Shipman case, will introduce stringent new measures on GPs who work alone.Single-handed family doctors will be forced through their contracts to undergo regular audits, to identify warning signs of incompetence or more sinister traits, amid fears that Shipman's solo practice enabled him to cover his tracks at the peak of his killing spree. Meanwhile, health authorities will get new powers to suspend family doctors at any time if patients appear to be at risk. Complaints over clinical skills or professional behaviour will be fast-tracked to a new expert body to sidestep the existing disciplinary body, the General Medical Council. Shipman went solo for the last six years of his career. He may have killed as many as 345 people. His killing rate soared once he was alone in his surgery. In an interview today, Tony Blair is expected to highlight the package to be unveiled by Health Minister John Denham.'We are determined to do our utmost to protect patients with a system of checks which will be faster and more effective for patients and fairer to doctors,' said a Downing Street source. Tomorrow, Denham will outline the plans to root out 'dangerous doctors' at all levels. Health Secretary Alan Milburn has already announced that all doctors will face annual 'MOTs'. GPs will be obliged to report deaths in surgeries. And the banding together of GPs into several practices co-operating to provide services should also provide safeguards. Ministers have been angry with the GMC over its slowness in responding to cases. Shipman provoked two complaints in 10 years, but he was only struck off after he had been convicted.
