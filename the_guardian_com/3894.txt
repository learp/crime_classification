A rogue trader at Morgan Stanley who tried to hide his losses from the investment bank was today fined £105,000 by the Financial Services Authority and banned from working in the City.Morgan Stanley was itself fined £1.4m for failing to prevent the trader – Matthew Piper – from causing a $120m (£79m) loss for the Wall Street firm.The fine is the 10th-largest ever levied by the FSA and follows an investigation in June last year.Piper worked on the investment-grade trade desk at Morgan Stanley and used the bank's money to take bets on complex financial instruments. He was an expert in default swap indices and credit default swap indices, which are used to gauge the likelihood of companies going bust.Piper's actions took place during growing anxiety in financial markets last summer. Morgan Stanley admitted on 18 June last year that a rogue trader had forced it to take a loss; at the time, the bank's figures included a reference to "$120m negative adjustment to marks previously taken in a trader's books that did not comply with firm policies".Margaret Cole, the FSA's director of enforcement, said the regulator was concerned about market confidence."Piper has been banned because his misconduct was deliberate, frequent and repeated over a six-month period. He was a senior and experienced trader who held a position of trust at the firm. This was clearly a serious breach of the standards of behaviour we expect of approved persons," Cole said.The FSA said Piper mis-marked position on its trading books and hid losses by deliberately altering the way he reported his trades.Morgan Stanley was found not to have used the controls it had in place to measure trades in such illiquid financial products and failed to respond quickly enough to changing conditions in the credit markets, which at the time were experiencing an increase in volatility and suffering a reduction in liquidity.Piper would have been fined £150,000 if he had not agreed to co-operate with the FSA. His reduced £105,000 penalty will be paid in instalments after the regulator was told it would cause him "serious financial hardship or difficulties" if he had to pay the sum in one go.Morgan Stanley would have been fined £2m had it not co-operated with the FSA.The bank said: "We are pleased to have agreed an early settlement with the FSA and now consider this matter to be behind us. As the FSA notes in its decision, our response has been prompt, transparent and comprehensive."
