A man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery after a pensioner was knocked over by an attacker for just £5.Stanley Evans was dragged to the ground as a mugger lunged for his wallet after he followed him into the communal entrance to a block of flats in Soho, central London, where he lives alone.Police had described the crime, which was captured on CCTV, as an “unprovoked, callous and sickening assault on a defenceless pensioner”.On Monday night a 29-year-old man was arrested in Camberwell in south London and remains in custody.Evans, who is now aged 93 but was 92 at the time of the robbery last month, said he felt he had been regarded as an “easy touch”.He told ITV: “I wasn’t scared, no. If I was fitter I would have gone out after him.“I know he was desperate for money, to get drugs or something, or he might have thought, ‘Oh, it’s an easy touch here, he can’t touch me even if he wants to’.”Evans, who remained on the ground for five minutes before managing to get to his feet and take the lift to his flat to call 999, suffered a shoulder injury during the incident, which took place at about 8pm on 31 January, but did not require hospital treatment.
