A man with an "insatiable thirst" for money was facing life in prison on Wednesday for the cold-blooded "execution" of his parents for his £230,000 inheritance.Convicted fraudster Stephen Seddon, 46, had once before tried to murder his father, Robert Seddon, 68, and mother, Patricia, 65, by driving into a canal with them strapped in the back seats in a faked road accident.Seddon then "played the hero" in the aftermath, after aborting the murder plan when bystanders went to their aid in the submerged car.But after that plan failed, four months later, he shot the couple to death with a sawn-off shotgun at their suburban home in Sale, greater Manchester. His parents had made him sole beneficiary of their £230,000 estate in their will.The father of three, from Seaham, County Durham, was convicted of two counts of attempted murder on 20 March and two counts of murder on 4 July, after a five-week trial at Manchester crown court.Seddon shook his head in resignation as he stood in the dock as the jury delivered their four guilty verdicts.Seddon was found guilty by a majority of 11 to one on each count, following 18 hours and 11 minutes of deliberations by the jury.The victims' family shouted "Yes!" and burst into tears, while hugging each other in the public gallery.The defendant faces four life sentences, but Alan Hedworth QC, defending, asked the judge to consider not giving a "whole life" tariff so that Seddon would spend the rest of his days behind bars.Mr Justice Hamblen said he would like to reflect on the matter and told the court he will pass sentence tomorrow morning.He thanked the jury and told them they would be welcome to return to court on Thursday morning to see sentence passed.
