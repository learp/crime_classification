A forensic scientist warned twice that exhibits in the Stephen Lawrence case could become contaminated in paper evidence bags, a court heard on Thursday.Adrian Wain, the lead scientist in the case for 13 years, raised concerns in 1999 that that the sacks and sticky tape used to seal the evidence in 1993 could degrade, a jury at the Old Bailey was told.Two years later, in correspondence with officers, Wain stated he was "reluctant" to do further work on Lawrence's jumper and body warmer because of "possibility of contamination in this case".Wain told the jury: "I was aware that items had been in and out of the laboratory. I didn't have control of them outside the laboratory."I knew that the packaging was deteriorating, I knew that the seals were deteriorating. I had concerns about contamination."Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris, 35, deny taking part in the attack that killed Lawrence in Eltham, south-east London, in 1993.The prosecution alleges microscopic fibres, hair and blood found on clothes seized from the defendants' houses prove they took part in the murder.Timothy Roberts QC, for Dobson, read part of a report written in 1999, which said: "The original tape seals used when the items were seized in 1993 have become so inefficient that in Adrian Wain's view in the event of alien blood cells being found on the suspects' clothing in any subsequent examination he would be unable to rule out the possibility of contamination."The trial continues.
