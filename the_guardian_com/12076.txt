A shopkeeper has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a man trying to rob his shop was stabbed to death.Police were called to the shop, in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, at about 9.40pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had been injured. It is understood a number of men had attempted to rob the shopkeeper.The injured man was taken to hospital with a stab wound, and died a short time later.Police sources said a 72-year-old man, understood to be the shopkeeper, was arrested. He has not been identified.A spokesman for Greater Manchester police said: "A 30-year-old man with serious injuries was taken to hospital, but he died a short time later. A 72-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder."Chief Superintendent Mark Roberts added: "The investigation is in its early stages, and we are still trying to establish the circumstances of what has happened."I would like to reassure residents that we do not believe there is any danger to the community, and would urge anyone who may have seen something to contact us."In a similar case in Pendleton, Salford, last month, John Bennell, a 27-year-old burglar, was stabbed to death by homeowner Peter Flanagan, who was confronted by a group of masked men, one of whom had a machete.Last week, the Crown Prosecution Service said Flanagan, 59, would not face charges because he had used reasonable force and had acted in self-defence.
