A retired family doctor cleared of murdering three patients with heavy overdoses of morphine is to be investigated over his role in the deaths of another 12 people, police said today.Howard Martin, 71, was cleared by a jury at Teesside crown court yesterday of killing Stanley Weldon and Harry Gittins, both 74 years old, and Frank Moss, aged 59.Durham police announced today that coroner Andrew Tweddle is to investigate the deaths of a further 12 patients who were treated by Dr Martin.Detective Superintendent Harry Stephenson, who led the investigation of Dr Martin, said: "Ultimately, it will be for [the coroner] to decide what action to take and what parameters he intends to set for any public hearing."The 12 files to be examined consist of three "in-depth" inquiries into the deaths of women aged 61, 54 and 78, and "mini files" on seven men aged between 58 and 86 and two women in their sixties.Mr Stephenson said the 12 files were all studied by the Crown Prosecution Service but resulted in no criminal charges because of insufficient evidence.Police revealed today that they were first called to examine Dr Martin's medical practice in December 2000 following the death of a 61-year-old woman who died at her home in a village in the south of County Durham. Concerns were raised by Macmillan cancer nurses, who had questioned Dr Martin's management of the woman's care.Following an investigation, the police and a Home Office pathologist concluded on the evidence available at the time that the treatment she received had been "acceptable".Mr Stephenson said a total of 28 complaints had been referred to the police, either directly by relatives or from the local primary care trust, which conducted its own review of Dr Martin's patients' medical records.
