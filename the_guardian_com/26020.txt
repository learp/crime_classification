A 72-year-old woman who attacked a neighbour with a spade over a boundary dispute will be spending Christmas in jail after being sentenced to 24 weeks in prison today.June Iddon broke Jeffrey Grundy's right arm, leaving him in plaster and off work for 12 weeks, Preston crown court heard.Calling Iddon "the neighbour from hell," Grundy said he had little sympathy for the 72-year-old spinster. "I think the sentence is immaterial. The only thing is, I will have a pleasant Christmas without her," he said outside court. Grundy said he could have been in a wheelchair had he not protected himself with his arm. "She's shown no remorse, she doesn't admit she is wrongâ€¦ You might class her as an actress. She has one of those dual personalities," he added. During the trial, a witness, David Broadley, described how Iddon had been "like an axeman" when she wielded the spade above her head and brought it down on Grundy.Her 62-year-old victim raised his right arm in self-defence and suffered the injury to his forearm.Iddon, of Tarleton, Lancashire, denied inflicting grievous bodily harm on Grundy on November 14 last year.Her barrister, Louise Whaites, told the court she suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and was "built like a sparrow".The jury heard that a four-year dispute over land boundaries had been settled in Grundy's favour at the high court in Manchester 13 months ago. On the day of the incident, he had invited Broadley to give him a quotation for the repositioning of a fence in accordance with the judge's ruling.The pair were outside the property looking at plans approved by the judge and Iddon was weeding her front garden when she began acting in an "aggressive and abusive manner" and assaulted Grundy.The jury, of three men and eight women, found her not guilty of causing grievous bodily harm but guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, which was offered by the prosecution as an alternative charge.
