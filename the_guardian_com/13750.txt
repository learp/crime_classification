"Martin used a firearm which he knew he was not entitled to have in a manner which was wholly unjustified. There can be no excuse for this, though we treat his responsibility as being reduced."Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice"[Tony Martin] said he was relieved that he could now see an end to his ordeal. He is relieved to be no longer branded a murderer ... He feels that 99% of the people in this country, had they been faced with the same circumstances - alone in the pitch black at night confronted by burglars - would have done exactly the same as him." James Saunders, Martin's solicitor"I know they shouldn't have been at the farm but to only serve five years for killing a young lad is too little. The lad's family will take it very badly ... He'll be out in only a couple of years, and it doesn't seem right. He should have got about 10 years for taking the young lad's life." Joe Fearon, father of convicted burglar Brendan Fearon, who was shot in the leg by Martin"I think he should be let out. Fearon is already out of prison. How can that be right? Here is a career criminal who took a 16-year-old boy out with him and got him killed ... It's ludicrous." Malcolm Starr, organiser of the Free Tony Martin campaign "It just seems such a tragedy that two lives have to be destroyed in order that policing is improved in the Fens. And policing has improved. The three forces, Norfolk, Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire have launched the Fenland Project, where they cooperate much more and they do seem to be getting results. We just have to hope that is maintained." Tony Bone, organiser of the Norfolk Farmwatch scheme "Tony Martin should not be in jail. The reason he is in this position is because the police are so inadequate ... And I don't think the policing here is getting better. It is getting worse, if anything." David Barnard, Martin's neighbour and a member of King's Lynn and West Norfolk borough council
