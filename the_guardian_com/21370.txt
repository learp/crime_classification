The mother of Stephen Lawrence, who was stabbed to death in London in April 1993, told a conference that nothing had changed since the Government pledged to root out prejudice three years ago. Doreen Lawrence told an audience of 200 that she had received racist hate mail.She was accompanied by a police protection officer at the conference, organised by the National Assembly Against Racism to mark the third anniversary of the Macpherson report on the failed police investigation into her son's death. She said: 'We as black people are still on the outside looking in. That has not changed since the report came out. I am bringing somebody here to protect my safety because of the racist hate mail that is being sent to this conference.'
