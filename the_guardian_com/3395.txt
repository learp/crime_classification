Detectives hunting the killer of the Finnish student battered to death during a sex attack in east London were questioning a 33-year-old man last night.The suspect was arrested on Sunday, two days after the body of Suvi Aronen, 23, was found hidden in undergrowth in Wanstead. She went missing as she walked home on Thursday afternoon, unaware that a man had already attacked three other women in the area, and threatened to kill one of them. When Ms Aronen's mother rang her mobile phone from Finland at 5.45 she heard Suvi screaming, in a mixture of English and Finnish: "Get off, don't hurt me". Minutes later Ms Aronen's landlady called the number and heard muffled cries. The police said Ms Aronen had been the victim of "an extremely ferocious" sexual assault and had been given a number of blows to the head and body, possibly with a brick. Detectives are working on the "strong presumption" that the three other attacks in Wanstead were carried out by the man who killed Ms Aronen. They took place at 4.40pm, 5pm, and 5.15pm. In the first a man dragged his 44-year-old victim along by her handbag until the bag split and he ran away. In the second he pushed his fingers down the throat of an 80-year-old woman, but she bit his hand, and he fled. In the third he punched a 56-year-old woman in the face and fled with her bag. Ms Aronen was a third year student at the University of East London studying film, media and cultural studies. Her lecturer David Butler described her as an excellent student. "It's a terrible blow. In these sort of circumstances as a teacher you are in a relationship of care and control. It's a very deep loss." The police are seeking witnesses to the attacks and hope to recover Ms Aronen's phone. Anyone with information should call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
