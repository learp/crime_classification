Police hope to get a clearer idea of what the victim of the so-called body parts murder looked like by the end of the week.Experts are trying to create a clay facial reconstruction in an effort to establish the identity of the man whose dismembered remains were found at five different locations in Hertfordshire and Leicestershire over three weeks.Officers have already eliminated about 60 men on the national missing persons database in their investigation. The victim died from a wound to the back caused by a large knife, and tests to establish more details about the murder weapon and how the body was dismembered are continuing.Detective Chief Inspector Michael Hanlon told a press conference yesterday that "quite lengthy steps" had been taken by the man's killers to prevent police from identifying him â€“ including, possibly, the removal of his hands. He said it was strange that more effort had not been made to conceal the body parts, which were found between 22 March and last weekend.Hanlon said the case was one of the most horrific he had ever dealt with. The description of the man so far suggests he was white, Asian or of mixed heritage, between his mid-40s and early 60s and of large build, weighing about 16 or 17 stone. He had suffered a fracture to his lower left leg in his youth, was 5ft 6ins to 5ft 10ins tall, and had a shoe size of between seven and nine.He was missing his two top front teeth, and had probably been that way "for a couple of years". In addition, he had a skin condition that caused discoloration around his ankle, as well as eczema. He probably also had a fungal infection on his toenails.
