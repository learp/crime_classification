The home secretary, David Blunkett, said today that the government may introduce trial without jury for gun crimes.During a visit to a Nottingham police station Mr Blunkett promised new legislation to crack down on guns and gang culture, and urged community leaders to provide better role models for young people.He said 8,000 guns, including 563 handguns, and even a rocket launcher had been handed to police forces across the country since the launch of a month-long amnesty on March 31.Mr Blunkett added, however, that more action is needed to tackle crimes involving firearms and to encourage people to come forward and give evidence."We are in the process of seeing how witnesses give evidence by video or with protection and also allowing there to be judge-only trials," he said."Where there is very strong evidence of intimidation of witnesses or intimidation of the jury, we will propose that a judge sits alone."He accepted that the plans would be controversial but urged people to support the idea to help the victims of gun crime."There is a degree of naivety about the evil that we are having to tackle and I urge everyone to support us," he explained.Mr Blunkett also hoped a new mandatory five-year minimum sentence for possessing illegal firearms would provide a stark warning to those who carry weapons."We are giving a clear message and providing a clear deterrent with the five-year minimum sentence and we hope that this gets the right response."Mr Blunkett also said that in the first week of the national gun amnesty 71,000 rounds of ammunition were turned over to police."Around 8,000 guns which could otherwise have been used in crime, have been taken off our streets," he continued. "This includes hundreds of handguns, along with potentially lethal air weapons and imitation guns that can cause fear and distress.""Uniquely, a rocket launcher was handed in to police in the West Midlands."
