Government crimefighting initiatives were dealt a blow yesterday by figures showing an increase in the use of weapons in violent assaults.The British Crime Survey, based on thousands of interviews about experiences of crime, shows that knives, clubs, guns, stones, glasses or bottles were used in 24% of all violent incidents in 2004-05, compared with 21% the year before.Weapons were used in 26% of common assaults, up from 20%; robberies saw a two-point rise to 24%; domestic attacks with weapons rose by three points to 11%; and muggings by two points to 18%.
