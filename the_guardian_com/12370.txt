The delayed report into Mark Kennedy and the work of undercover police officers in protest groups is due to be published next Thursday (October 20).It was due to be published in the summer, but it was pushed back.The review has been led by Bernard Hogan-Howe, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, in his previous incarnation as one of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Constabulary.Any advanced word about the contents of the report before next week would of course be gratefully received.The review was set up in the wake of the revelations earlier this year about Kennedy, who spent seven years infiltrating green campaigns.Officially, Hogan-Howe has been reviewingthe operational accountability and legality of undercover work conducted by the National Public Order Intelligence Unit. Alongside that work, the Serious Organised Crime Agency has been looking at the conduct of Kennedy himself. Protest groups which were infiltrated have been boycotting the review.
