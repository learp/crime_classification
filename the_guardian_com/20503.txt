The trial of a man charged with murdering a pregnant 22-year-old woman on her doorstep began at the Old Bailey in London today.Thomas Hughes, 40, is accused of shooting Krystal Hart twice in the head after a dispute with a "neighbour from hell" escalated out of control on Good Friday in April last year.The court heard that Hart's neighbour Angie Brewer had complained to her boyfriend, Hughes, about an incident earlier that day. Brewer and Hart, who was three months pregnant when she was killed, lived in separate flats in the same building in Battersea, south London, and had been involved in a long-running dispute. In CCTV footage played to the court, Hughes is seen calling for Hart's boyfriend, David Siveter, who had taken down Hughes's car numberplate earlier, and then Hart, to come out of the building. Two shots are then fired, while Brewer is heard screaming hysterically.Brewer later told police: "Finally Krystal opened the door. He [Hughes] held the gun to her head and she looked at me pleading. He shot her." Aftab Jafferjee, prosecuting, said Brewer had been cleared of criminal involvement in the murder but "moral responsibility is another matter". Brewer was due to be served with an antisocial behaviour order six days before Hart's murder. "You may conclude as others in turn have described Angela Brewer â€¦ the proverbial neighbour from hell," said Jafferjee.Hart's mother, Deborah Penfold, previously described her daughter as "a most precious and beautiful young woman" lost in a "senseless and tragic murder".Hughes, from Stonells Road, Battersea, denies murder and having a firearm with intent to endanger life. The trial continues.
