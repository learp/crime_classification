I am particularly interested in hearing from anyone who was in the area of New Lane or Raikes Lane at the time or saw anything suspicious."This is a rural and quiet area of Bradford and people may have noticed any unusual activity, especially at this time of night."At this stage we have not recovered any weapons; however, forensic officers are currently examining the scene."The detective said officers from the local neighbourhood policing team would be patrolling the area to offer reassurance and speak to residents about any concerns. The area where the bodies were found is open countryside – green meadows with pockets of woodland – just a mile or two from the suburbs of south Bradford.Locals speculated that the bodies may have been dumped.Alice Avery said: "It's a quiet area. You just don't know what goes on at night time around here, do you?"A woman who lives near where Raikes Lane was closed at its junction with Holme Lane said: "It's a nice area down there."We don't know the circumstances but it makes you scared, not knowing what's happened. I'm scared for my children."
