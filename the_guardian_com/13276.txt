UK police hoping to identify a sexual predator who assaulted five British girls aged seven to 10 in Portugal's Algarve before Madeleine McCann disappeared said they had received 250 calls and emails in response to the latest appeal on Wednesday."We are reviewing this information and following up lines of inquiry. This is still very early stages," said Scotland Yard on Thursday.The assaults, one involving two girls, were among 12 incidents over six years to 2010 being examined by officers. All involved a man entering holiday accommodation, mainly being used by British families.Of the offences, four were in Carvoeiro, six in the Vale da Parra, Praia da Gale district and two in Praia da Luz. The most serious preceded Madeleine's May 2007 disappearance in Praia da Luz, when she was three.The appeals included a description of the attacker and an impression of a distinctive burgundy long-sleeved top he was said to have worn on two occasions. Police said he had an "unhealthy interest in young white girls".Witnesses described him as having dark skin with short, dark unkempt hair. He spoke in English with a foreign accent, and a slow or possibly slurred voice. The man was sometimes bare chested, some described him as having a pot belly, and three victims made reference to his distinctive smell.The new appeal for help from the public included a spot on BBC's Crimewatch on Wednesday although this was far shorter than an appeal last October, which drew more than 1,000 calls and emails in the hours immediately afterwards.Scotland Yard has expressed frustration at the slow legal process before being allowed to work on the ground in Portugal. But authorities in Lisbon have denied the information, newly released by the Met, was initially discounted by them.A source in Lisbon has insisted the investigation was proceeding steadily "but with the discretion that has characterised it from the beginning".
