The troubled merger of the prison and probation services was last night plunged into fresh doubt after the surprise resignation of its architect, Martin Narey, to become chief executive of the children's charity Barnardo's.Mr Narey denied he had been forced out or was jumping ship from the project to create the £4.5bn National Offender Management Service. He insisted the opportunity to lead Barnardo's was too good to turn down.But there was widespread astonishment that the man identified so closely with delivery of the merger should walk away with it still only partly complete.Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers, said: "I am very surprised he has resigned 18 months into the project. It has been fraught with difficulties and controversy from the off and we hope the opportunity will be taken to review the whole structure."Cheryl Gillan, who speaks for the Conservatives on prison policy, wrote to Home Office ministers to demand an urgent meeting on "the crisis" in the prison and probation services.Mr Narey, 49, became chief executive of Noms last year, having been director general of the Prison Service since 1998.In an interview with the Guardian last November, he dismissed rumours that he was seeking an exit from a difficult brief. "I want to do this and I have no intention of going anywhere until it is well on the way," he said.Mr Narey said yesterday that the Barnardo's post, which was advertised in April at a salary of £120,000, had proved too tempting: it was the only job he had applied for outside the Prison Service in 23 years.Creation of Noms was well advanced, Mr Narey insisted. Critics of the merger say there has been little consultation, that it has been rushed in advance of legislation, without a clear plan, and that it is a vehicle for backdoor privatisation.The home secretary, Charles Clarke, paid tribute to Mr Narey's "vision and leadership".
