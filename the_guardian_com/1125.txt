The number of UK-born children identified as being trafficked for sexual abuse showed a sharp increase last year, according to figures published on Tuesday by the National Crime Agency (NCA).The NCA said 56 children from the UK were identified as potential victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation in 2013, an increase of 155% on the previous year. The number of foreign children at risk also rose by 11%, to 88.The NCA's national referral mechanism (NRM) – which is used to flag up potential trafficking cases to the authorities – also saw an overall increase, with 1,746 people from 112 different countries highlighted as potential victims, up 47% on the previous year.The increase could be a result of greater awareness of the NRM and the issue of trafficking after a series of high-profile cases, particularly of young vulnerable girls being trafficked around the UK by exploitative gangs, said Liam Vernon, head of the NCA's UK human trafficking centre."We know that this is a crime which affects some of society's most vulnerable people, and some victims will remain undetected. Equally, some of those referred to the NRM may not ultimately be classified as victims of human trafficking," he said. "The NCA is committed to relentlessly disrupting what is a criminal trade in human misery."The number of cases involving UK nationals rose 173% to 90. Around two thirds of potential victims were female (1,122) and around a quarter (450) were children.Of the children flagged as potential victims of trafficking, as well as the 144 trafficked for sexual abuse, 45 were identified as being at risk of being used as servants (up 2% on 2012), 123 for labour exploitation (up 24%) and 138 were unknown (up 9%). Among adults, the largest increase was seen in labour exploitation. The NRM identified 511 potential victims of labour exploitation – an 89% rise – while 581 people were at risk from sexual exploitation (53% rise); 141 people from being exploited as servants (up 18%) and 62 unknown (up 44%).Albania was the most common nationality or country of origin for all referrals, followed by Nigeria and Vietnam.The modern slavery and organised crime minister, Karen Bradley, said the cases were unlikely to show the full picture of modern slavery, and welcomed the progression of the modern slavery bill through parliament."The Bill will send the strongest possible message to criminals that if you are involved in this disgusting trade in human beings, you will be arrested, you will be prosecuted and you will be locked up," she said.
