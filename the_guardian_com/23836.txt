Knife amnesties have no discernible long-term effect in reducing knife crime, a Metropolitan police report revealed today.The report - obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act - examined the effect of an eight-week Met knife amnesty during May, June and July this year. The London-wide initiative saw special bins provided for people to dump knives in, with metal detectors and stop and search operations also used. Before the amnesty began, there were, on average, 34.9 knife offences in the capital each day, with that number dropping to 31 during the amnesty. However, six weeks after the initiative ended, the number had risen to 34.2, the report said."In late August 2006, six weeks after the operation ends, offence levels tend to return to pre-operation values," it concluded. A Met spokeswoman said the force also undertook other measures to combat knife crime, including education. "We have always recognised that a knife amnesty on its own is limited in its effectiveness in tackling knife crime," she added. "An amnesty is only one tactic, and should be used in conjunction with other prevention and enforcement initiatives." A separate nationwide knife amnesty, organised by the Home Office during May and June, saw almost 90,000 knives and an M72 rocket launcher handed in to police in England, Scotland and Wales.Officers and ministers hailed the operation as a success.The junior home office minister, Tony McNulty, today said the nationwide amnesty was "just one strand in our programme to tackle knife crime, which includes tightening legislation and tough enforcement and prevention." It took place amid a series of fatal stabbings that brought the issue of knife crime to the forefront of debate.Experts said the issue was wider, with one former home office criminologist telling the BBC that the reasons why young people want to carry knives should be addressed.
