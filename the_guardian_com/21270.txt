The DNA of the murdered British student Meredith Kercher and her flatmate Amanda Knox have been found on a knife, the Italian media reported today.Police examining a knife belonging to Knox's boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, found matches for both women, the Italian news agency Ansa reported.Knox, Sollecito, and Diya Lumumba, a Congolese bar owner, have been arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting and then killing Kercher, a 21-year-old exchange student from Coulsdon, Surrey.The kitchen knife, found in Sollecito's house, had Knox's DNA near the handle and Miss Kercher's on the blade, the reports said.The blade was not the same one he had on him when he was arrested.Police are unsure whether the knife is from his kitchen or from the Perugia house where Kercher and Knox, an American, lived.The forensic test took place on November 5, three days after Kercher was found with her throat cut. Italian prosecutors believe she had died at around 10pm the previous evening.The three suspects can be held for up to a year while the case against them is prepared, a judge ruled last week. Knox, Lumumba and Sollecito all deny any involvement in her death.
