Brian Paddick, Britain's most outspoken police officer, is planning to retire and take on a new role promoting 'honest debate' on such issues as crime, drugs and social deprivation.Paddick, 47, whose former boyfriend claimed the officer let him smoke cannabis in their flat, intends to quit the Metropolitan Police late next year when he becomes eligible for a pension after 30 years' service.The deputy assistant commissioner, who once admitted he found the idea of anarchism attractive, is keen to pursue a new career in politics, TV or working with a non-governmental body such as the new Commission for Equality and Human Rights.After 29 years in a controversial policing career which has seen the openly gay officer dubbed 'Commander Crackpot' by some newspapers, Paddick wants a fresh challenge that would let him tackle what friends say are 'politically dangerous' issues.Paddick confirmed to The Observer last night that he was considering retiring to enter politics or campaigning.'I can retire in November 2006 on a pension after 30 years' service with the Met. I'm looking at all the options, including what I might usefully do if I retired from the police at that time.'What I want to do is continue to make a positive difference in terms of talking about the way the world really is and seeking realistic solutions to social problems.'Friends say he is interested in becoming a working peer, and has informal links with the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, but he would find being an MP too restrictive. One friend said: 'Brian is concerned that while people at the moment listen to what he has to say because he's a senior police officer who says things that top officers don't normally say, when he retires he will be simply a member of the public and people might not want to listen to him.'So he wants to find a platform outside the police where his experience and different perspective can help stimulate honest debate. Is there something he could do after leaving the Met where he can carry on saying things that nobody else is prepared to say because it's all too politically dangerous?'Paddick's role at the Met covers 'territorial policing' issues, such as burglary, street crime and sexual offences. But he is disenchanted with his progress. He admitted in a Guardian interview last year that his role is 'a bit of a non-job' in which he is 'bored and frustrated'.Colleagues are aware that Paddick plans to leave. 'Some of us know that he can't wait to get out. He's already spoken to the human resources people about that,' said one.Paddick joined the Met as an 18-year-old in November 1976. He was already one of the most high-profile officers in Britain when, in 2002, former lover James Renolleau told a newspaper that Paddick had allowed him to smoke cannabis in their home; had broken Met rules by not disclosing that his boyfriend was on police bail facing criminal charges; and that he himself had also smoked the drug. Paddick denied the cannabis claims and did not face any criminal or disciplinary proceedings.One colleague suggested that the only event that would prevent Paddick quitting would be a promotion to assistant commissioner, where he would have day-to-day charge of an area such as anti-terrorism or specialist police operations.
