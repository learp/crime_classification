A senior police officer's allegation that the government was forming policy on the hoof as a result of pressure from tabloid newspapers was vigorously denied by ministers yesterday.Terry Grange, the chief constable of Dyfed and Powys, said fawning to tabloid agendas went across policy making in the Home Office. He reeled off a list of areas where he believes No 10 and ministers are responding to the campaigns and opinions of the press to make statements and form policy.Violent offender orders, the treatment of foreign criminals and home-grown offenders and paedophiles are all subjects he believes have been hijacked by tabloid newspapers which used their muscle to help form policy."The reality, as I perceive it, is that the only people with any real strategic intent and understanding on where they want to go and the will to be ruthless in getting there is the News of the World," he said."The government is attending meetings at the behest of a newspaper and then altering its approach overnight."But is there evidence that this is true?The latest furore about "policy on the hoof" dates back to last Monday when the Sun announced a campaign to pressurise the government to sack 10 judges who it claimed were guilty of being soft on "killers, child sex beasts and rapists".On the same day Judge John Griffiths Williams sentenced Craig Sweeney, 24, to life for the kidnap and sexual assault of a three-year-old girl. But the judge said because he pleaded guilty he could be considered for parole after five years, adding that it was "unlikely" he would get early release. Within hours of the sentence the home secretary, John Reid, demanded that it be reviewed, writing to the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, voicing his concern.It was clear from the response from his office that the attorney general was irritated by the intervention and the political pressure being exerted. The following day the Sun trumpeted Mr Reid's intervention as a success in its campaign to put judges on trial.Other examples include the recent assault on the Human Rights Act by No 10 and the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, who said the act could be amended because of concerns over the way it was working.His comments came a day after the Sun launched a "proud" campaign to scrap the Human Rights Act after a probation service report on Anthony Rice, a rapist who killed a woman while he was on parole.The report into Rice's murder of Naomi Bryant in Winchester last year said officials had considered his human rights above their duties to the public, arguably something a government minister giving an interview the next day had to address.Mr Grange was most exercised by Mr Reid's decision to send a minister to the US to research "Megan's law" - in which parents have the legal right to know the whereabouts of all paedophiles in their area - with a view to introducing it in the UK. This came after a six-year campaign by the News of the World to introduce a similar law in Britain following the rape and murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne. Pressure by the News of the World has so far been resisted by all previous home secretaries. But the issue has come to a head again with the News of the World's threat to publish the addresses of all bail hostels where paedophiles are housed.Legal sources close to the Home Office endorsed Mr Grange's view on Megan's law, saying it had in effect been tested in Britain in 2000, predominantly around the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth, as a result of the newspaper's campaign.The hysteria was such that a paediatrician in south Wales was wrongly targeted as a paedophile and probation officers claimed sex offenders were driven underground as a result of the protests.The issue of violent offender orders - which were floated by the previous home secretary, Charles Clarke - is another where critics say the government is making policy on the back of newspaper pressure. Mr Clarke proposed the orders, which would put violent criminals under tougher supervision, after the probation service report into the murder of John Monckton highlighted a "collective failure" in the handling of Damien Hanson and Elliot White, his killers. Hanson was on early release from prison for attempted murder and White was on bail on drugs charges.But some lawyers believe the proposed orders are impractical. They point out that a huge number of criminals are violent and question how the orders will be policed by overstretched police forces.Mr Grange said these examples were evidence of tabloid pressure to form policy. Others say the issue is more complex.Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said: "There is a very important but complicated relationship between the government and the mass readership newspapers. People spend a few pence on those newspapers but their votes are rather more expensive. It is right that the government listens to a range of views but ultimately when they come to making policy, it must be done in a more rational way."
