An NHS doctor who injected an intensive care patient with adrenaline against the advice of three colleagues was today convicted of manslaughter.Priya Ramnath, 40, was given a six-month suspended jail sentence at Birmingham crown court for her involvement in the death of Patricia Leighton at Stafford District General hospital in July 1998.In addition to going against the wishes of three colleagues, she failed to speak to a consultant anaesthetist at the hospital before injecting the drug into Leighton.Ramnath, whose sentence was suspended for two years, came back from the US last February to face the charge after being threatened with extradition.The jury, which had been considering its verdict since Tuesday, found her guilty by a 10-2 majority. Ramnath, whose address cannot be published, denied manslaughter by gross negligence.Leighton, 51, of Burntwood, near Cannock, Staffordshire, died from heart failure shortly after she was injected with the drug. The prosecutor, Michael Burrows QC, told the trial that she was being treated in an intensive therapy unit in the early hours of the morning.He said that within moments of the injection Leighton jerked forward in her bed and exclaimed: "What's happening to me? I am going to die." She lost consciousness shortly afterwards.Leighton had arthritis and had been admitted to hospital in Cannock on 20 July after a wound on a bunion on her left foot became infected.One expert in intensive care medicine called by the defence, Dr John Coakley of Homerton hospital, London, said he believed Leighton had died of septic shock rather than because of the adrenaline injection.Members of Leighton's family were present in court throughout the trial, including her daughters Debbie Leighton-Newton and Nicky Fellows.In a joint statement issued after the verdict, they said: "Mum was a very loyal and family-orientated person with a lovely, gentle nature."We have overcome many hurdles to get this case to trial. It doesn't matter how long ago a crime happened, you have to fight for justice. And that's what we have done over the last 10 years."We are happy that the jury have returned a guilty verdict and that justice has at last been served, and hope that she will never be able to wreck another family's life."Mrs Justice Rafferty ruled that the interests of justice did not require her to take away Ramnath's liberty. She said Ramnath, who has two children and lives in the US, panicked in the "pressure cooker" of the hospital's intensive therapy unit."The jury has found that Mrs Leighton would have lived longer, perhaps days, but for your gross negligence."She added that Ramnath's defining error was that she had chosen not to listen to a senior nurse working alongside her."Arrogance has cost you your reputation," the judge said.Ramnath's conviction comes a decade after the initial inquest into the patient's death, which found that she died of natural causes.A second inquest, held in August 2004, resulted in a verdict of unlawful killing and the Crown Prosecution Service sought Ramnath's extradition.The doctor's counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, told the court before sentence was passed that Ramnath had acted in the best interests of Leighton as she had perceived them to be.Speaking after the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Phil Bladen, of Staffordshire police, described the inquiry as complicated and highly unusual. "This was an extreme case whereby a doctor refused to acknowledge and act on advice given by other senior medical staff that caused someone's unnecessary death."Adrenaline is a naturally occurring hormone. It is used for a variety of medical purposes, one of which is treating septic infections. It is more commonly given to combat cardiac arrest.
