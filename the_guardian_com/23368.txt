A helpline for victims of revenge porn has been launched as part of a concerted push to tackle the growing problem of explicit photographs being shared online without the victim’s consent.The specialist service, run by the South West Grid for Learning charity, will offer support to victims who are affected by the crime, which can affect people as young as 11.Perpetrators of revenge porn in the UK will face prison sentences of up to two years under a new measure in the criminal justice and courts bill that bans the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intent to cause distress.But critics argue that the internet respects no legal jurisdiction and victims face lengthy battles with porn sites around the world to have pictures removed. Nude pictures are shared sometimes for revenge, sometimes for blackmail purposes.The revenge porn helpline will work with police and websites to try and get non-consensual explicit photos removed and provide victims with help about how to get free legal advice. It will work with other services, such as Women’s Aid, the Stalking Helpline or Relate, so that victims know where they can turn if they need more help.There are hundreds of sites dedicated to non-consensual porn throughout the world, with around 30 sites “specialised” in revenge porn content used in the UK alone.Folami Prehaye, founder of the revenge porn support website voic.org.uk, said that as a victim she had been embarrassed to let other people know what had happened to her.“If there was a helpline around at the time of my crime at least I could have talked to someone in confidence about how I was feeling, and how coming forward has affected my confidence,” she said. “I set up my website to offer support to victims who made contact with me, and to encourage other women to come forward to raise their concerns and speak up about this crime. Now this helpline will help everyone that needs support and advice.”Launching the helpline, which also has a website, the equalities minister, Nicky Morgan, said: “This helpline will provide essential free legal advice on how to have pictures removed from the internet. Circulating intimate photos of someone without their consent is never acceptable, and we need to educate people to the dangers of sending intimate images, and to the hurt that sharing them causes.”The justice secretary, Chris Grayling, said: “We have changed the law to make it clear that people who maliciously distribute intimate pictures of their former partners without their consent face a prison sentence. It is crucial that victims have the confidence to report this kind of disgusting behaviour and the new offence will make sure perpetrators are properly punished.”Last week a man who ran a “revenge porn” site was convicted of identity theft and extortion in California. He faces up to 20 years in prison after being convicted on 27 charges, although not under specific revenge porn laws that were introduced in the state after he was charged.About 10,000 pictures were posted on the site, alongside contact details, links to Facebook and Twitter profiles and details about victims’ places of work.In September last year, 43 UK police forces were asked for details of reported incidents of revenge pornography between 1 January 2012 and 1 July 2014, but only eight police forces in England and Wales were able to provide figures. Those forces alone revealed that they had received 149 allegations of revenge porn, of which six resulted in a police caution or charge.The majority of victims were women and girls – some as young as 11 – while the majority of perpetrators were men. According to an NSPCC/ChildLine poll, six out of 10 teenagers say they have been asked for sexual images or videos.One victim of revenge porn – a Danish journalist who took the step of posing for nude photographs of herself which she had consented to, having failed to have leaked photographs of herself repressed – told the Guardian that after her personal account was hacked and the photographs stolen, she was contacted by men who threatened to send the pictures to her boss unless she sent them further images.The phone number for the helpline is 0845 6000 459.
