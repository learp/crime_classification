The back-from-the-dead canoeist could face charges of wasting police time if there is evidence that he staged his disappearance.The cost of the 200 square mile sea search for John Darwin, which lasted several days, has been estimated at £50,000 or more.Police aircraft, an RAF helicopter, the coastguard and the RNLI were involved in the fruitless search of the Tees estuary for the prison officer.Darwin's wife reported him missing at 10.30pm on March 21 2002 and, after his canoe could not be found at their home, a sea search was launched in calm conditions.Six RNLI lifeboats spent 85 hours at sea from the early hours of March 22, with several more launches after reported sightings in the following days.Volunteer RNLI crews from Hartlepool, Redcar, Teesmouth and Staithes and Runswick were called in. Two crews from Hartlepool spent 15 hours at sea on March 22.The charity's costs were estimated at around £30,000.An RNLI spokeswoman: "Of course, as the majority of RNLI crews are volunteers, the real cost is the time they have to give up both when they are on a service and in training - and that's something which is impossible to quantify."An RAF Sea King helicopter, which costs £15,250 per hour to send out, also joined the operation. It was not clear for how long. A police plane and helicopter were also called out.Cleveland Police Authority said the search cost the force £2,000, taking into account the resources in the air and mounted officers searching the dunes around Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool.Up to 40 coastguard personnel were also involved. Even the Royal Navy training ship HMS Explorer was called up to join the hunt.Only a paddle was found until the kayak turned up six weeks later, damaged, on mud close to the mouth of the river Tees.The next confirmed sighting of Darwin by any of the authorities was on Saturday last week, when he walked into a London police station.A Cleveland police spokeswoman said it was too early to say whether a charge of wasting police time would follow. Any decision to bring such a charge would depend on the outcome of questioning, she said.Darwin was arrested early yesterday on suspicion of fraud.
