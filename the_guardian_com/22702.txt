Police arrested 17 people overnight after protest drinking parties at London mayor Boris Johnson's alcohol ban on the London Underground network, descended into chaos.Four train drivers and three other London Underground staff were assaulted, the tyres of a police vehicle were slashed and two officers assaulted and another injured.Bob Crow, leader of the RMT rail union, said he had warned Johnson the decision to ban alcohol could lead to violence against staff."Johnson should apologise personally to all those who were assaulted and abused last night thanks to a half-baked gimmick designed solely as a publicity stunt and without a moment's thought for the people told to implement it," Crow said."We warned that it could put our members at greater risk of assault, but there is no comfort in being proved right when tube workers have been injured and abused."Witnesses said the stench of alcohol on the network was overpowering and that people were "being sick all over the place". The parties, attended by an estimated 2,000 people, began as light-hearted demonstrations against the new Conservative London mayor's alcohol ban.Revellers, many in fancy dress, chanted anti-Johnson slogans. As the midnight ban drew nearer some began fighting and others vomited.After fears of overcrowding and violent scuffles police closed stations at Liverpool Street Baker Street stations. Several trains were also cancelled due to damage.A spokesman for British Transport police said people were arrested for offences such as assault, drunk and disorderly, assault on police, public order-related offences and drug offences.He added: "This was an unfortunate end to what should have been a fun event."Parties were organised by groups on social networking sites, with titles including "One final tube booze party" and "Let's get hammered on the tube day".The drinking sessions mainly took place on the orbital Circle line.Photographer Desmond Fitzgerald, 48, from Croydon, said the noise at Gloucester Road station at 11pm yesterday was "like a rowdy football crowd".He said: "When I got on the train it was worse than rush hour, and with every station it went through more and more heavily-drunk people seemed to be getting on."Then a fight broke out between about five people, but because we were so tightly packed in, it soon spread throughout the carriage and I had to struggle to escape to the next one."The atmosphere had really changed by this point. People were ripping off adverts and maps and being sick all over the place."At the start of the evening, partygoers of all ages, many in fancy dress, drank and sang in a boisterous, but friendly atmosphere.Frankie Abbott, 21, a student from east London, said: "It's going to get a bit messy. There are guys drinking from funnels already."Superintendent Ellie Bird said the "festive atmosphere" was spoilt by a "very small minority".She said: "The arrests were made following sporadic outbreaks of disorder which is very disappointing given the intention of the organisers was that this should not be a disorderly or disruptive event."We view this as a one-off organised event and not an indication of the alcohol fuelled disorder that we will experience now that the ban is in place."The mayor said: "I'm determined to improve the safety and security of public transport in London and create a better environment for the millions of Londoners who rely on it. The ban has the full support of the Metropolitan police and British Transport police."
