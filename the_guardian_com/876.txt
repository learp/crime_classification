A police officer has been injured and a patrol car destroyed by fire after a police station in Wearside was attacked by youths.Northumbria police said the officer was hit by flying glass when an object, believed to have been a brick, was hurled through a window at 3am on Wednesday morning.Six people were seen running away from the scene of the incident at the Washington police station on Wearside.Two young men aged 17 and 19 were later arrested by local neighbourhood officers. They are currently helping police with their inquiries.The officer was taken to hospital for treatment for a minor injury and later released.A spokesman said: "At around 3am this morning a police vehicle was set alight outside Washington police station."At the station a missile was thrown which caused damage to a window. A group of around six people were seen to run from the scene."A police officer working in the station was injured by flying glass."The officer was taken to hospital as a precaution and was released following treatment to a minor injury."This appears to be an isolated incident and at present we have not received any further reports of disorder."We are however prepared for all eventualities and will respond quickly and firmly to any incidents of disorder or criminal damage."The spokesman said there was no evidence so far to link the attack to the riots. Reports late on Tuesday night on Twitter of disturbances in Byker, Newcastle, proved to be false.A Durham police spokesman said a team of officers was helping combat the violence in the south.She said: "A team of officers is now working with colleagues in the Metropolitan police, but this is having no impact on the everyday policing of County Durham and Darlington."Durham Chief Constable Jon Stoddart said: "I must reassure our communities and local businesses that while we have a commitment to respond to any requests for mutual aid from other forces, we will continue to be able to deal effectively with any calls on our service at a local level."At present, there's nothing to suggest that any outbreaks of disorder are likely to happen in our area, but we are keeping the situation under constant review."
