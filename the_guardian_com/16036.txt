Merseyside police are investigating a racist attack on the home of an Asian family in Huyton, where black student Anthony Walker was murdered this year.A nurse, who does not wish to give her name, says her family has been targeted since moving to the area in the summer with other Asian health workers to help relieve staff shortages in local hospitals. "They have thrown bricks at our car and our house," she said. "Once they threw a brick through the upstairs bedroom window when my daughter was asleep. She was terrified."Police have apologised for initially treating the incident as criminal damage.
