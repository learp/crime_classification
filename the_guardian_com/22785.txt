Fewer than a fifth of those arrested in the UK under anti-terrorism laws since September 11 2001 have been charged with terrorism-connected offences, according to Home Office figures released today.The statistics show that of almost 1,200 arrests, 40 have led to convictions under anti-terror legislation, and more than half the suspects held have been released without any charge at all.According to the new statistics, updated for the first time in 18 months, 1,126 arrests were made under the Terrorism Act of 2000 in the UK - excluding Northern Ireland - between September 11 2001 and December 31 last year. There were a further 40 arrests under legislation other than the Terrorism Act, where police were conducting a terrorist investigation.Of the total of 1,166 people, 117 were charged with terrorism offences only, while another 104 were charged with terrorism and other criminal offences. A further 186 were charged with other offences including murder, grievous bodily harm, firearms, explosives offences and fraud, while 74 were handed over to the immigration authorities. Of the others, three are on police bail awaiting charging decisions, 12 were cautioned, 10 were dealt with under mental health legislation and two are in custody awaiting extradition proceedings. More than half - 652 - were released without charge. Of those charged, there have been 40 Terrorism Act convictions, with a further 180 people convicted under other legislation. A total of 98 are on, or still awaiting, trial. There were no figures for arrests under the new anti-terrorism legislation, the Terrorism Act 2006, which introduced a range of new offences last year.
