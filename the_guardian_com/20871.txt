Motorists who use mobile phones or smoke while at the wheel could face up to two years in jail under new guidelines to be published today.Drivers in England and Wales who cause death on the roads could also be jailed for life under new measures drafted by the Crown Prosecution Service.The new guidance means the worst cases of death by dangerous driving could be prosecuted as manslaughter, which carries a maximum life sentence.Using a mobile phone, satnav or an MP3 player while at the wheel will be treated as dangerous driving instead of careless driving, carrying a maximum sentence of two years in prison. The penalty for careless driving is a community service order or a fine.Current guidelines say manslaughter is "very rarely appropriate" in road death cases but the change will mean alternative charges could be brought.For example, someone who has killed on the roads could be charged with manslaughter as well as causing death by dangerous driving, leaving a jury open to return the lower charge if they find manslaughter has not been proved.The director of public prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald QC, said: "I think it is right that prosecutors are given new guidance so that where the individual cases warrant it, then a manslaughter charge is selected."Under the new guidance other aspects of bad driving likely to be regarded as dangerous and carry a jail term include racing, lighting a cigarette, reading a map or newspaper, making sudden lane changes, and driving too close to the vehicle in front. Sheila Ranger, head of campaigns at the RAC, said: "This is for people who are doing the most outrageous acts on their phone. We still see terrible crashes where people have been texting, driving into the back of stationary queues because they haven't seen them."It's entirely appropriate to have this charge available for the most extreme circumstances."Rob Gifford, executive director of the parliamentary advisory council on transport safety, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "It's not every single driver using a mobile phone while driving who faces jail, it's those few drivers whose behaviour leads them to have a crash when they are using a mobile at the same time."What people are being reminded is that driving is a complicated activity and it is better to concentrate on driving than talking."
