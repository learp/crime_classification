The NHS launched a serious incident inquiry last night after a psychiatric patient released from a London mental hospital was found hours later in a flat in which a man had been brutally killed. Managers at East London and City mental health trust were investigating how the patient came to be discharged from one of its hospitals. The patient was in police custody last night having been arrested on Tuesday evening in north London. That morning he left a mental ward where he had been a voluntary patient.The victim, a man in his 40s also believed to be a former psychiatric patient, had been hacked to death. A police spokeswoman said he had suffered "multiple injuries, including some dismemberment".One leg had been severed from his body and his head cracked open with a blunt instrument. There was also the possibility that some of the body had been cooked - parts of what is believed to be human tissue were found by police frying in a pan.Forensic experts are testing items, including possible weapons, recovered from the scene. Detectives from Scotland Yard's serious crime directorate are investigating.Mental health campaigners have expressed doubts about the adequacy of discharge procedures. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said there were about 50 homicides a year by people in contact with mental health services because they had a mental illness or disorder or both.Police were called to the north London flat at 7.40pm on Tuesday. A post mortem examination was being carried out last night.Under NHS guidelines, patients with a severe mental illness should have a care plan agreed on discharge from hospital, setting out the care and rehabilitation to be provided, identifying the NHS or social services worker coordinating that care, and specifying what action should be taken in a crisis.The guidelines are less rigorous for voluntary patients than those sectioned under the Mental Health Act.Ms Wallace said the charity was aware of many cases where patients were allowed to walk off psychiatric wards after threatening suicide or harm to others without aftercare arrangements being put in place.In a study of 65 homicides involving psychiatric patients over two years, the charity found 90% involved a breakdown of communication between the key agencies responsible for the patient's care.In 88% there was a breakdown of the care plan or absence of one. In 83% there was poor record keeping and/or incomplete case histories. In 75% there was lack of an adequate risk assessment and in 75% the victim was known to the perpetrator.Ms Wallace said: "We have come across far too many cases of people allowed to walk off psychiatric wards despite the fact that they threatened suicide or harm to others. In our experience very little effort is made to detain them or make sure they are going back to a home where they will not be alone and unsupervised."Too many leave without commonsense safeguards. The most dangerous time for suicide and homicide is the first 10 days," she said.The East London and City mental health trust said: "We can confirm a patient known to our services has been arrested by the police but we are unable to provide any further information at the moment."Â• A 34-year-old man is expected to appear at Waltham Forest magistrates court this morning charged with the murder of a 45-year-old man.
