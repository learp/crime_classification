Giving Victims a Voice is the report by the Metropolitan police and the children's charity NSPCC into sexual abuse carried out by the late BBC DJ Jimmy Savile. While the police investigation, Operation Yewtree, is looking into the activities of other people, this report is focused only on allegations against Savile, whether acting alone or with others.• Since Operation Yewtree began on 5 October around 600 people have come forward with information. About 450 of these are expected to be linked to Savile, mainly alleging sexual abuse.• Most victims have been interviewed. So far 214 criminal offences have been recorded across 28 police force areas.• The allegations span 54 years. The earliest reported incident was in 1955 in Manchester. The last took place in 2009. The bulk of offending took place in Leeds, Savile's home town, and London, his main place of work.• The peak rate of offending was between 1966 and 1976, when Savile was between 40 and 50 years old.• Of offences recorded against Savile, 126 are indecent acts with 34 involving rape or penetration. The reported victims ranged in age from eight to 47 at the time of abuse, with 73% aged under 18. The bulk were aged 13 to 16, with 82% being female.• Offences were mainly described as "opportunistic sexual assaults" but there were others which involved planning or grooming.• Victims have complained of abuse connected to Savile's work at the BBC between 1965 and 2006, up to the final recording of Top of the Pops. Abuse was reported at Leeds general infirmary, where Savile had close links and worked as a voluntary porter, between 1965 and 1995. At Stoke Mandeville hospital, for which he was a major fundraiser and often stayed overnight, reported offending happened from 1965 to 1988. At Duncroft school, which he also visited regularly, there are allegations from between 1970 and 1978.• The accounts of the victims, who are mainly not known to each other, "paint a compelling picture of widespread sexual abuse by a predatory sex offender". There is no clear evidence of him being part of a paedophile ring, though investigations are continuing.• The majority of victims had never reported their experiences to authorities before, saying they feared they would not be believed or did not trust the judicial system.
