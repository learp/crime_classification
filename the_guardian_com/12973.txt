A father who jumped with his two children from a hotel balcony in Crete has escaped prosecution for murder in the UK.John Hogan was acquitted in a Greek court of killing his son Liam, six, from Bristol, during a make or break holiday with his wife, Natasha, in August 2006. Hogan's daughter, Mia, two, was seriously injured. The Crown Prosecution Service began considering charges against Hogan in March after a British coroner ruled Liam was unlawfully killed. But yesterday the CPS said Hogan would not face charges. The decision means he will walk free when he returns from a psychiatric hospital in Athens where is being held for treatment for depression and suicidal tendencies. Stephen O'Doherty, the CPS lawyer who reviewed the Greek case files, said there was no new evidence which would provide a different view of Hogan's state of mind, which was the crux of the case. "Any new and compelling evidence would have to relate to Mr Hogan's mental state as it was in August 2006," he said.
