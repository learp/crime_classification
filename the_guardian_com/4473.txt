The Ministry of Justice is to review how Jon Venables, one of the young killers of James Bulger, was supervised after his release from custody in 2001.The review follows revelations that Venables, who was yesterday jailed for two years for downloading and distributing child pornography, had been arrested twice for fighting and drug possession before he was recalled to prison earlier this year.Former Home Office permanent secretary Sir David Omand will carry out the inquiry, which will examine the arrangements for the supervision of Venables, now 27, by probation, police and other agencies.The review will evaluate whether appropriate action was taken or if he should have been sent back to prison for breaching the terms of his licence.A curfew was imposed on Venables after he was arrested for a drunken fight in 2008. He was also found in possession of cocaine and was cautioned later that year.It has also emerged that those who took the decision not to return Venables to custody for the offences may not have been aware of his real identity."The decision that was made at that time as to whether or not to charge him was made by people who didn't know his identity and indeed the same happened at his subsequent possession of cocaine," Diana Fulbrook, head of public protection for the Probation Chiefs' Association told Radio 4's Today programme."There was a decision made not to charge him because the evidence at the time wasn't clear who was actually involved in it," she added.The ministry admitted that Jack Straw, then justice secretary, knew Venables had been arrested on both occasions in 2008 for cocaine possession and affray, but agreed with probation and police officials that he should not be recalled to prison.The revelation enraged Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus. "We are surprised and concerned that he was not recalled under the terms of his parole licence" when he was accused of offences in 2008, she said through her solicitor .Venables was arrested in February and recalled over child pornography allegations after images were found on his computer at his Cheshire home.Forensic experts today questioned the rehabilitation programme that Venables received while in custody, as well as the effectiveness of his supervision after his release.David Holmes, senior forensic psychologist at Manchester Metropolitan University, cast doubt as to whether Venables was fit to be released from custody in 2001, eight years after the Bulger murder."He has committed minor offences in different areas – drug offences and assault, etc – these added together put a very clear picture of someone who should probably not have been released in the first place," Holmes told the BBC Today programme.Last night, the justice ministry defended the decision not to recall Venables after the incidents in 2008. A spokeswoman said that following the affray, "an additional licence condition of a curfew was added as a precaution". She said that after being caught with cocaine, he was randomly tested for class-A drugs. The tests produced negative results.She added: "At one point, there were some concerns about JV's level of drinking. This was addressed through focused sessions."Fergus was at the Old Bailey to hear Venables plead guilty to three charges of downloading and distributing indecent images and videos showing children as young as two being raped by adults. Ninety-nine pieces of child pornography were found on his computer, though there was evidence he had deleted at least 1,200 more, the court heard.Venables appeared in court via videolink from prison, but in a unique decision, the judge decided that only he could be trusted to see the accused's face.Mr Justice Bean ruled that allowing anyone else in the room – including Bulger's mother – to see him would pose a "considerable risk to Mr Venables' life". Instead, Venables' disembodied voice rang through the courtroom as he said just four words – "guilty" three times, when the charges were read to him, and a "yes" to confirm his name.The last time he was in court was 17 years ago, in 1993. He was charged, along with his primary school friend Robert Thompson with murdering Bulger, who was two, after abducting him in Bootle shopping centre.The pair were remanded to secure children's homes in the north-west, and were released on licence in 2001 under new identities after being deemed suitably rehabilitated.The Daily Telegraph reported that Venables will be issued with a new birth certificate, national insurance number and other identity documents at a cost of £250,000 when he is released.A justice ministry spokeswoman said: "Such a change of identity is extremely rare and granted only when the police assess that there is clear and credible evidence of a sustained threat to the offender's life on release into the community."
