The Home Office and youth minister John Denham today accused social workers and teachers of passing the buck when it comes to tackling youth crime.The minister condemned schools and local authorities for abstaining from efforts to combat badly behaved youngsters and passing too much responsibility to the police.In a speech to the Association of Chief Police Officers' youth justice conference, Mr Denham said "inward-looking professional attitudes" must be swept aside if progress was to be made in tackling crime and antisocial behaviour.He told the conference in Bristol that every agency that deals with young people must tackle gangs that cause misery in local communities. He said: "We have to sweep aside the inward-looking professional attitudes that stand in the way of progress. Too many agencies abstain when it comes to tackling youth nuisance."In the months ahead, one of my priorities must be to ensure that it is not just the police who are expected to respond to youth nuisance or antisocial behaviour but all the other agencies too."Mr Denham, whose remit includes young people and the police, said local crime and disorder partnerships, which bring together police, doctors, probation, schools and councils, were being undermined by a lack of commitment from local authority staff."The extent to which they are supported by real commitment from across their own local authority, never mind other agencies, varies enormously," he said.A Home Office spokeswoman said the criticism was directed at "social services that regard themselves as protecting children at risk but don't accept the consequences of allowing antisocial behaviour by young people to go unchallenged." She said Mr Denham was also referring to schools "that do not make the connection between the difficulties some young people cause them in school and the things faced by the wider community from the same people. "Then there are local housing offices which tell tenants there's nothing the council can do and that they will have to call the police."The spokeswoman added: "He is calling for people to pull together to address these problems."
