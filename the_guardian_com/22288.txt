A senior detective whose car was caught in a speed trap will not be prosecuted because of insufficient evidence, it was announced yesterday.Detective Superintendent Adrian Roberts, head of Middlesbrough CID, caused controversy when he told traffic police that he could not remember who was driving his car when it was photographed in a built-up 30mph area. A review of the case by an assistant chief constable, prompted after public criticism coinciding with the government's crackdown on speeding, has now upheld the decision not to prosecute. A spokesman for Cleveland police said that the camera in Yarm Road, Stockton on Tees, had not clearly identified the driver of Mr Roberts's white Citroen AX. But he added that similar prosecution decisions involving senior officers would in future be made by the chief constable or an assistant chief. Mr Roberts was sent a fixed penalty order by post following the incident in April, but the ticket was withdrawn after he said he could not remember if he was in the car at the time. Cleveland's assistant chief constable, Della Cannings, was called in to review the case. Cleveland police said that the review had recognised the public concern but Mr Roberts would face no further action. Ms Cannings said: "The key people involved each acted with ... high degrees of integrity and no intent to improperly influence the outcome."
