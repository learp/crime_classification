A hit squad of senior police officers is expected to deliver a damning report this week on the performance of one of the country's worst-performing forces.The verdict by the team, made up of two chief constables and senior figures from local government and the private sector, could lead to Nottinghamshire police becoming the only force in the country to be "named and shamed" for failing to protect the public.The intervention of the team, which was sent in to Nottinghamshire on the orders of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, was seen as the last attempt to avoid intervention by the Home Office. Ultimately the home secretary Alan Johnson has the power to replace a chief constable and senior management team of a force if all measures by the inspectorate do not lead to a force improving its standards.In advance of the expected criticism in the report, due out this week, the long standing chairman of the police authority John Clarke, stepped down 10 days ago.After 11 years in the post, Clarke was left with little choice but to leave in the face of the continued failures of the force.Nottingham city council's leader, Jon Collins, acknowledged that there had been a failing in oversight by the police authority."There is a need for the police authority to change to more effectively undertake its responsibilities and John [Clarke] has honourably decided to stand aside to support that process," he said.The inspecting team have spent four weeks probing the running of Nottinghamshire police, which has consistently failed to provide the public with an acceptable service for more than eight years.Nottinghamshire police was told to create an improvement plan by HMIC – which inspects all forces – by the end of last month. The inspectorate had rejected an earlier plan as "not conveying the necessary sense of urgency."As a result of HMIC's request the hit squad was sent in at the beginning of February. Nottinghamshire police will be releasing their report this week, with one insider saying it was highly critical and held little or no good news for the force.As part of the support and intervention measures for forces the HMIC is likely to respond to a very critical verdict by issuing a "public interest letter", effectively naming and shaming the force, and setting out the concerns over its performance.
