A former dentist who admitted killing two people has started to give evidence at the trial of his ex-lover in a Northern Ireland court.Colin Howell was in Coleraine crown court at the trial of Hazel Stewart, who denies any part in the death of her husband and Howell's wife in 1991.Howell, 51, has already pleaded guilty to killing his wife, Lesley, and policeman Trevor Buchanan, Stewart's husband. He originally staged the crimes to look like a suicide pact.The former dentist, who is serving a 21-year sentence at Maghaberry prison, poisoned the pair as they slept.In the hours before killing his wife, Howell divided his time between building a birthday present for his son and manufacturing a murder weapon, he told the trial of Stewart on Monday.He and his wife then held a party for Daniel, then two, with Howell making sure all four of his children were up late so they would be asleep when he later poisoned their mother, before setting off to do the same to Buchanan.Howell had already revealed to police how his wife called out their eldest boy Matthew's name while he poisoned her with carbon monoxide fumes in the living room.On Monday he recounted the events again to the jury in Stewart's double murder trial. At his own trial the former dentist explained what led him to confess to the murders. "I just knew that the time had come that the truth had to be told," Howell said."I was overwhelmed by my conscience from hiding those crimes for such a long time."I believed there still were scars that needed to be put right and I wanted to tell the truth, that was my only motive."The bodies of Lesley Howell, 31, and Buchanan, 32, were found in a fume-filled garage in the seaside town of Castlerock.Stewart, from Coleraine, denies entering into a joint-enterprise with Howell to murder their respective partners. She told police it was his plan and that she wanted nothing to do with it.Last week she claimed Howell even forced her to have sex while she was unconscious due to a drug he gave her. The sex act was a test of the drug that he would use to knock out his then wife, Stewart said.The trial continues.
