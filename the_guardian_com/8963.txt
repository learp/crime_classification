A man who killed his childminder partner in front of two children when she asked him to move out of their home has been sentenced to life in prison.Mark Odeyemi stabbed Mandy Skedd repeatedly at home in Nottingham last November, cutting the telephone cable when she tried to fight him off and then leaving the two children she was caring for with her body. Odeyemi pleaded guilty earlier this week and will serve a minimum of 21 years and five months for murdering Skedd, who had been his partner for nine years.Judge John Milmo, sentencing, said: "The presence of those two young children in the house did not give you pause for thought. You made no attempt to conceal from them what you did."One of the children present was a nine-month-old boy, who was found with blood on his face and clothes. Ms Skedd's two-year-old niece was also in the house at the time, but the couple's six-year-old daughter was at school.Paul Mann QC, prosecuting, said: "It is the crown's case that the defendant could not come to terms with the break-up. He became possessive of her. He came to believe, rightly, that Amanda Skedd was seeing someone else." He was also jealous of her new life as a registered childminder and told a number of people he planned to kill her before he carried out the attack.Following the murder, Odeyemi wrote a note to Ms Skedd's new boyfriend, which he left on her stomach, stating: "Tell Eddie thank you." He then went with a friend to the pub, where he boasted of what he had done.
