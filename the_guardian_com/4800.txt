The state is failing to protect some of the most vulnerable people held in detention and an expert taskforce needs to be set up to tackle the growing number of deaths in custody, according to an all-party group of MPs and peers.The report of the year-long inquiry into deaths in custody by parliament's joint committee on human rights, published today, says that the rising toll of those who die while in prisons, police cells and immigration centres is a significant national problem. "Highly vulnerable people are being inappropriately held in prison, often in overcrowded conditions, and many of these people have mental health or substance abuse problems, and are at risk of taking their own lives," says the report. The inquiry did find that there was an increased focus in the prison service on preventing deaths in custody, with much dedicated work by staff. The latest figures show there were 94 self-inflicted deaths in prisons in England and Wales during 2003. The MPs say that in too many institutions staff are working under great pressure and are required to deal with violent and volatile situations involving people with complex healthcare and mental health needs, too often without specialist training or support. Jean Corston, the Labour chair of the human rights committee, said: "Crime levels are falling but we are holding more people in custody than ever before. The misplaced reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems we have encountered."
