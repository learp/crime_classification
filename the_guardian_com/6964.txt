When the crown prosecution service was created in 1986, the director of public prosecutions became a more public figure than before. Sir Ken Macdonald QC, who has held the post since 2003, discharges this role with a surer touch than his predecessors. Sir Ken rightly regards himself as a publicly accountable figure, with a duty to explain why those in charge of criminal justice do things in the way that they do.It would be easy for him to hide away and leave such issues to ministers. But this DPP is right to judge that in an era of terrorist threat and of intense public interest in criminal justice, it is even more important for his independent voice at the heart of the system to make itself clearly heard. Sir Ken may well be denounced for Tuesday's speech to the Criminal Bar Association, warning of the threat to due process from "war on terror" rhetoric.But Sir Ken is no armchair liberal opposed to every change in legal process. He supports modernisations to address terrorist challenges - such as 28-day detention, the admissibility of intercept evidence and some of the recent broadenings of anti-terrorist law. But he also stands for preserving fair trials and the exclusion of evidence obtained by torture.If ministers better understood the importance of the system of which they are merely the custodians, Sir Ken might be able to remain quiet. But as yet another headline-chasing anti-terror law heads down the slipway, this country is fortunate to have a DPP who speaks for the rule of law with such clarity and confidence.
