The number of police officers in England and Wales has fallen by more than 2,500 in the past year due to a recruitment freeze across all forces.The drop of 2,503 to 142,363 officers in September 2010 is the first significant fall in police numbers after a decade when the size of the police force reached a record high.The politically sensitive fall comes before chief constables cope with a 20% reduction in Whitehall funding over the next four years. The reduction in numbers coincided with a 5% fall in the crime rate.The Home Office figures published today also reveal a similar fall in the number of civilian staff employed by the police: a drop of 2,193 to 78,120. The number of police community support officers also fell, by 438 to 16,378.The only growth has been in the number of volunteer special constables. A 15% increase in their numbers has brought the total number of specials to 16,772.The policing and criminal justice minister, Nick Herbert, said: "It's not surprising that many forces have suspended recruitment after the economic downturn, and some had stopped recruiting officers before the last government left office."Having reached record numbers in the police workforce, forces can and must make savings in their back and middle offices, prioritising the frontline and prioritising visible policing."Both the home secretary, Theresa May, and Herbert have been arguing that there is not necessarily a direct link between the number of police officers and crime levels. Ministers argue that in many forces around Britain and in other countries there have been significant reductions in crime alongside stable or even falling police numbers.The latest British Crime Survey, published last week, showed that crime levels fell by 5% in the 12 months to September â€“ the same period that saw police numbers fall. Nevertheless, Labour politicians have warned that a fall in police numbers will inexorably lead to a rise in crime.The largest percentage falls in officers were in the smallest forces of West Mercia (-5.8%), Wiltshire (-5.4%) and Durham (-5.3%). The largest numerical fall was in the Metropolitan Police, which lost 474 officers.Chief Constable Peter Fahy, the lead for workforce development at the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: "With recruitment frozen across most police forces and officers continuing to retire or leave the service, it is inevitable that police officer numbers will decline over the coming four years. The challenge is to maintain those parts of the service which are most valued by the public while reducing bureaucracy and unproductive activity."This has to be a debate not about officer numbers but about what officers spend their time doing and the overall impact of funding reductions on public confidence in policing. The way policing is organised and delivered will have to change significantly as this reduction in officers takes hold."
