Inquests into the deaths of the 52 innocent people killed in the 7/7 bombings will begin today.More than five years after the attacks in London, families will finally have the chance to ask officials questions about whether loved ones could have been saved.The inquests have a wide-ranging remit to examine whether the emergency services' response was adequate and whether MI5 and the police could have prevented the 2005 atrocities.But, ahead of the opening, relatives expressed concerns about MI5's apparent reluctance to assist the coroner's investigation.Graham Foulkes, whose 22-year-old son, David, was killed in the Edgware Road bombing, said the Security Service's attempts to keep details of its alleged failings secret were "really distressing" to the families.MI5 last week angered families by proposing that the coroner, Lady Justice Hallett, should sit in closed session to hear highly classified evidence.Foulkes said: "Here they are, drawing a salary to do a job which they clearly have not done. And they're employing every legal twist they possibly can not to be accountable."It really adds to the anguish that we're all feeling. It's very clear that they just waved two fingers at the coroner. They're deliberately frustrating the process."Foulkes, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, said he planned to come to London for the opening of the inquests and will attend as many days of evidence as he can.Ros Morley, whose husband Colin, 52, from Finchley, north London, also died in the Edgware Road attack, said: "I want the inquests to look at whether any mistakes were made or flawed systems were in place. Innocent citizens in the UK and worldwide need to know that they are protected now and in the future."I hope it is possible to gain something positive out of a deeply tragic event in which 52 innocent people lost their lives."Although more than 700 people were injured in the blasts, the coroner has ruled that they cannot be legally represented or ask witnesses questions.On 7 July 2005, four suicide bombers launched co-ordinated attacks on three Tube trains and a bus, in Britain's worst terrorist atrocity since the 1988 Lockerbie bombing.The inquests have taken more than five years to open because they could not start until after the trial of three men accused of helping the attackers choose their targets.The trio were cleared of the charge at Kingston crown court last year, although two of them were convicted of conspiracy to attend a terrorist training camp.The inquests, which are being held at the Royal Courts of Justice in London and are expected to last up to five months, will begin with a two-day opening statement.This will be accompanied by never-before-seen video of the wrecked tube carriages and bus and extracts from emergency calls to London Underground's control centre.Hallett, who is sitting without a jury, will then hear details of how the bombers travelled to London.After this, evidence will be called relating to the scenes of the four attacks, first Aldgate, followed by Edgware Road, King's Cross and Tavistock Square.Inquests will then cover the backgrounds of the bombers; general issues such as forensics and the command of the emergency services; and whether security agencies could have prevented the attacks.Inquests for the four bombers – Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, Hasib Hussain, 18, and Jermaine Lindsay, 19 – have been adjourned and will not be held alongside those of their victims.
