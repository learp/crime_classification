Detectives investigating the 2010 murder of Pakistani politician Imran Farooq in London have named two men they want to trace in connection with the killing.Farooq, 50, a founding member of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, was stabbed multiple times and hit on the head with a brick outside his home in Edgware, London, as he returned home from work on 16 September 2010. His death sparked rioting in Karachi.The two men wanted, Moshin Ali Syed, 29, and Muhammed Kashif Khan Kamran, 34, are both Pakistani nationals who left the UK immediately after the murder. Both are now believed to be in Pakistan.The Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command, SO15, which is investigating the killing, said Syed was in the UK from February 2010 and Kamran from early September 2010."The investigation team knows that the two men resided in the Stanmore area prior to the murder and left the UK on the evening of the murder. The men are known to have registered to study at a college in east London, having entered the UK on student visas."Having built up a significant picture of the men's movements, both in Pakistan and London, officers would like more information to complete the picture," said the force, in a statement."Dr Farooq's murder would have required careful planning and help from other people, some of whom may have provided assistance or information unwittingly."We are appealing to anyone who has not yet come forward but knew either man in Pakistan or during their time in the UK to contact the investigation team."Detectives are particularly interested in piecing together the men's movements in the days prior to the murder and in their travel out of the UK.Anyone with information can contact the incident room on +44 (0)20 7230 2717 or anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
