Domestic violence will increase as the recession takes hold, the attorney general, Lady Scotland, predicts today."When families go through difficulties, if someone loses their job, or they have financial problems, it can escalate stress, and lead to alcohol or drug abuse, which are disinhibitors ... quite often violence can flow from that," she said in an interview with the Guardian.Refuge, the charity supporting victims of violence, agreed: "Women may be more reluctant to leave because they worry about their financial situation. The effect of the economy on financial pressures that may make that worse." One woman is killed every two to three days on average in the UK, according to figures from the attorney general's office."As well as a human rights issue, which domestic violence clearly is, we have got to acknowledge [it] is a disabler of talent, disadvantaging a significant proportion of our population to achieve their potential," Scotland said. She also spoke of children: in more than half of known cases of domestic violence, children were directly abused, according to the NSPCC charity."In all areas of dysfunction there is an overrepresentation of children who have grown up in domestic violence situations," said Scotland.
