The immigration service has been attempting to deport prisoners who turn out to be British, according to a report by the chief inspector of prisons today. The errors have occurred because the Home Office has failed to get to grips with the foreign prisoner "scandal", says Anne Owers.She claims that since the exposure of the scandal in April, which cost Charles Clarke his job as home secretary, prisons have got better at identifying foreign nationals coming to the end of their prison sentences. But serious problems remain.The report was published as the home secretary, John Reid, was forced to announce that a Â£4m plan for "weekend jails" is to be abandoned after it was disclosed that only 284 offenders had been placed on the scheme in 18 months.The study of the position of foreign national prisoners by the chief inspector of prisons reveals the true depth of the chaos that existed in relations between the Prison Service and the immigration service at the height of the crisis this year."Both staff and prisoners expressed extreme frustration at the lack of support and contact from the immigration authorities," said Ms Owers. "In all 10 of our fieldwork prisons, staff complained that the formal channels of communication with IND's [the Immigration and Nationality Directorate] criminal casework team were ineffective. "Messages went unanswered, faxes disappeared, and there were no clear lines of accountability and responsibility."She said a national strategy was needed for the management of the 10,000 foreign prisoners in jails in England and Wales.The lack of support for staff dealing with foreign prisoners is starkly illustrated by the case of a young Chinese woman who cried inconsolably for the first two days of her sentence. It took that time before staff could find an interpreter, who found she was expecting to be shot.Ms Owers says a national strategy must also cover the speedy removal of prisoners who wanted and needed to return home.The fieldwork for the study was undertaken earlier this year before Mr Clarke resigned as home secretary, but the chief inspector says that problems remain.Prison inspectors had recently come across cases where the Home Office was trying to deport people who turned out to be British nationals or had been in the country for more than 30 years with well established families.
