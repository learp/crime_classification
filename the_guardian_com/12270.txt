Four Luton-based police officers have resigned after they were found to have given remand prisoners special favours in exchange for giving false confessions, their force said yesterday. A 12-month internal investigation by Bedfordshire police found that some prisoners were allowed to have sex with their girlfriends and take home visits, and were also given cigarettes and extra meals. So keen were some criminals to get their rewards that they admitted to carrying out crimes committed while they were in custody. As a result of the inducements, the crime detection rate improved in Luton.
