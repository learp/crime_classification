The two women who were found murdered in a flat in Birmingham on Monday were sisters, police said today.The bodies of Yasmine and Sabrina Larbi-Cherif, aged 22 and 19, were discovered in the Jupiter apartments complex, in the Ladywood area of the city, just after 5.30pm.A postmortem examination revealed that they died of stab wounds.Detectives are questioning a 28-year-old man who was arrested as he apparently attempted to leave the country on Tuesday.In a statement, the women's family, who moved to England from Algeria 10 years ago, said they were devastated by the deaths of their "angels" and were extremely proud of them."Due to their Islamic faith and open-minded upbringing, they were always humble, compassionate, generous and helpful to anyone who knew them," the statement said."Yasmine and Sabrina will be remembered as a genuine example of a fruitful combination of two different cultures benefiting their native and adoptive country."Yasmine, who had studied biochemistry at Birmingham University, was hoping to work in medical research. She was a keen belly dancer and also gave classes.On a Facebook tribute page to the sisters, Alison Shaw, a fellow dance teacher, said Yasmine was "always smiling and laughing ... a very beautiful person both inside and out".Sabrina had been due to start a French degree at Birmingham University."It was the happiest day of Sabrina's life when she achieved her grades to be able to go to Birmingham and join her sister," the family's statement said.The sisters had moved into the flat several weeks ago, and their mother and a brother stayed with them for two weeks to help furnish it. They telephoned their family every day.Sabrina was described as a football fan who had played in goal for her school's boys' team. She also enjoyed music, playing the piano and guitar.Their family, who live in London, said the sisters "excelled at everything they were involved with, socially and educationally".They had three brothers, one of whom was Yasmine's twin. Members of the family are being supported by two family liaison officers.More than 80 officers from West Midlands police are working on the murder investigation.They believe the arrested man, detained as he attempted to board a ferry in Kent, may have been known to at least one of the sisters.
