A man has been jailed for trying to steal a metal plaque that formed part of a memorial to the victims of an IRA bomb.Spartakas Grachauskas, 25, tried to remove the plaque from the River of Life memorial in Bridge Street, Warrington, which remembers victims of the 1993 attack.Three-year-old Johnathan Ball and 12-year-old Tim Parry were killed by two bombs in litter bins in the Cheshire town; 54 others were injured.Grachauskas was jailed for 18 weeks at Manchester City magistrates court on Wednesday, police said.The sentencing comes weeks after it emerged a thief had stolen a second plaque from the memorial, which bore the names of the two children who were killed. That thief remains at large.Grachauskas was arrested in the early hours of Saturday 21 April following a report by Warrington Borough Council CCTV operators.Chief Superintendent Richard Strachan said: "Metal theft comes in many forms and affects everyone. It is not a victimless crime."This is an important memorial for the community in Warrington and is part of the town's heritage."We hope that this case will serve as a warning to others that those involved in this type of crime will be punished for their actions."
