A police officer is being questioned on suspicion of murder after the death of his partner, an officer with a neighbouring force.Traffic investigators initially treated the incident early yesterday morning in which PC Claire Howarth, 31, died from severe head injuries as a road traffic accident. It is believed that officers from Greater Manchester police are now investigating whether her injuries were caused by the road accident.Howarth, who worked at Rochdale police station after completing her probationary period with the force, was with her 26-year-old fianc√© Martin Forshaw, who is a serving constable with the neighbouring Cheshire constabulary. He was arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to a local police station for questioning.Last night the dead officer's colleagues praised her as a future star of the force. "Claire had only recently joined, but from everything we'd seen of her she was destined for a bright future," one said.The couple lived in a modern house in Tottington, near Bury, a short distance from the crash scene on Tottingham Road in Harwood.A spokesman for Greater Manchester police said today: "We can confirm that the woman who died in Bolton this morning was a serving GMP officer. At 2.25am [on Thursday] police were informed by the ambulance service that a silver BMW had left the road on Tottington Road, Harwood. The driver, a 31-year-old woman, was taken to the Royal Bolton hospital with a serious head injury and later died. She was still alive when she was pulled from the driver's seat but was suffering from massive head injuries and doctors were unable to save her.Colleagues said Howarth was well respected and popular, nicknamed "the people's policewoman".They released a letter written by the mother of a 12-year-old girl who had been the victim of bullies thanking Howarth for helping her and describing her as "a credit to the force".Howarth's boss, Chief Superintendent John O'Hare, said: "Claire was a really positive officer. She was highly-regarded by all her colleagues and myself and had just finished her two-year probationary period."The couple were due to marry on the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia later this month.A spokesman for Cheshire Constabulary declined to comment on the investigation.
