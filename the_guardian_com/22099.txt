The home secretary, Charles Clarke, today pushed ahead with police merger plans despite criticism from opposition MPs and police.The decision, which affects four regions - the west Midlands, the north east, north west and Wales - was announced less than two weeks after prime minister Tony Blair insisted that restructuring would not be "pushed through" regardless of local opinion.Yet one of the mergers includes at least one force, West Mercia, which is publicly opposed to amalgamation of any sort, a fact seized on by the Conservatives earlier today.The government believes merging forces will improve police capacity in tackling serious crime and major incidents.It commissioned a report, published last year by HM Inspector of Constabulary (HMIC), which said the 43-force structure needed to change in the interest of effectiveness and efficiency.Mr Clarke said HMIC had looked over the different options submitted by local forces and concluded that the selected options would be of the "greatest benefit" from a police perspective.This would see four police forces merge into one West Midlands force. Other mergers include three police forces in the north east to make one regional force, three forces in the north west instead of the existing five, and one force for the whole of Wales.West Mercia police authority has opposed merger proposals, insisting that the local force should simply be "enhanced" to meet the concerns raised by HMIC about effectiveness in responding to major incidents.The local police authority has already made provisions for extra resources to beef up policing services to meet concerns raised by last year's report.Mr Clarke was set to meet with representatives from forces and police authorities in the four regions areas to invite them to "engage closely" on taking forward the option for policing", he said."Final decisions on how we proceed in these areas will of course be based on the full consideration of the implications for organisational resilience, affordability, precepting and the impact on the wider criminal justice system."A statement issued jointly by West Mercia Police Authority and West Mercia police said the four police authorities will now need to meet and "determine their respective positions".But the Conservatives, who strongly oppose the mergers as unnecessary and costly, seized on the decision to forge ahead despite local feeling.The shadow police reform minister, Nick Herbert, said: "Just the other week the prime minister said this was 'not a question of forcing [amalgamations] through', yet this is exactly what the home secretary is planning to do, without proper local consultation and to an unnecessarily tight timetable."Regional forces covering up to 6,000 square miles will erode local accountability, and most of the £175m cost will be met by local people, adding up to £33 to council tax bills."Mr Herbert also criticised the home secretary for dismissing "out of hand" an alternative proposal put forward by the Association of Police Authorities, many of whom are opposed to full-scale mergers.The alternative proposes "federal" model would see regional forces pool certain personnel - such as murder squad detectives - but would allow them to keep their own identity, name and control of local police officers.The APA said its proposal would also cut the costs associated with mergers, which are likely to be borne by the taxpayer. Lynne Featherstone, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman, criticised the move to merge forces at a police grants debate earlier today."The government are increasingly adding to the workload of the police but failing to provide extra money from Whitehall. This leaves local council tax payers to pick up the bill," she said. "Coupled with the cost of the Home Office's plans to merge police forces in England and Wales, people will be expected to fork out even more council tax while having less of a say in how their local police force is run. This is completely unsustainable situation."
