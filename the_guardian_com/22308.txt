Tagged prisoners risk being sent back to jail if they surf the internet or watch pay-per-view TV. Probation officers last night warned that either activity could lead prisoners released early to be accused of breaking curfews, after technicians discovered that logging on to the internet or viewing premium channels could block signals transmitted from the ankle bracelets to private monitoring centres via telephone lines. A teenager in north-west England was returned to prison because his stepfather was using the net at night, leaving control staff unable to confirm the young man was at home. The glitch is the latest uncovered in a system the home secretary, David Blunkett, is expanding to relieve pressure on overcrowded jails. Disturbances were reported in three jails last week and the Home Office is searching for a second prison ship. Signals have also been disrupted by answering machines, mobile phone masts, tin baths and blocks of flats. A separate Home Office memo leaked to the Guardian discloses that problems with paperwork are hindering plans to increase the use of home detention curfews. Prisoners are being moved from jail to jail without the files needed to assess which should be allowed out on a curfew order, delaying decisions. A spokeswoman for the Home Office said prisoners subject to tagged curfews were warned to report anything that interfered with a signal and would not be locked up automatically if there was a problem. "There is acknowledged to be a very small problem in some areas," she said, but she knew of no difficulties caused by the net and pay-per-view. The number of prisoners on curfew, including burglars, has gone up to about 2,100 from 1,650 last October. More than 44,000 have been released wearing tags in the past three years and less than 2% reoffended, according to Home Office figures. Prisoners convicted of violent, sexual or serious drugs crimes are not eligible for tagging.
