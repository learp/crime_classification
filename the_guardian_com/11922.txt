A prison officer who suffered mental trauma through working on a treatment programme for paedophiles was awarded Â£150,000 agreed damages at the high court yesterday.Ronald Johnson, 53, was based at Albany prison on the Isle of Wight between 1992 and 1997 and became a tutor on the sex offender programme in August 1995. His group consisted of seven inmates with life sentences. The court heard that from 1996 Mr Johnson began to suffer sleep disturbance, loss of concentration and irritability. He found that contact with children reminded him of his involvement with the programme. Despite transferring to another prison, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and a depressive illness and is now unable to work. Mr Johnson, of Leyland, Lancashire, claimed he was not appropriately prepared or supervised. His lawyer told the court that the claim against the Home Office, which did not admit liability, had been settled.
