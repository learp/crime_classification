What does 24 hours of emergency calls and police response look like? Well in Camden it looks just like the below video. Leto Peel, Post-Doc Research Associate at UCL, has created a visualisation showing how police vehicles responded to 999 calls using data from the Metropolitan police service.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest It shows the positions of police stations, emergency calls by location and maps the response of the police vehicles, all for 24 hours on the 1st March 2010. The video is part of the UCL Crime, Policing and Citizenship, a project from the newly launched SpaceTimeLab. The project, in collaboration with the Met, aims to explore the relationship between detailed patterns of police activities and the space-time pattern of recorded incidents. It will also investigate public perceptions of crime.Who made this video? Leto PeelWere can I find the original?
