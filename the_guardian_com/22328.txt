Alleged victims of Harold Shipman, the GP accused of murdering patients, had taken or were administered substantial amounts of morphine, a forensic scientist told his trial yesterday.Toxicologist Julie Evans told Preston crown court that tests revealed levels of the drug consistent with samples from people who died of a morphine overdose. Earlier, a pain relief expert, Prof Henry McQuay, from Oxford university, had told the court that an injection of the drug dissolved in water would make a person sleepy. Within minutes their breathing would slow until it stopped, their lips would go blue and, as no oxygen could reach the brain, they would die. Mrs Evans said that varying amounts of the drug were found in samples taken from the thigh and liver of wealthy widow Kathleen Grundy. When asked by Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, whether Mrs Grundy "had taken or been administered a substantial amount of morphine or diamorphine", Mrs Evans replied: "Yes, I would agree with that." The jury heard that samples taken from alleged victims Bianka Pomfret, Winifred Mellor, Joan Melia, Ivy Lomas, Marie Quinn, Irene Turner, Jean Lilley and Muriel Grimshaw also revealed morphine. Shipman, 53, of Mottram, Greater Manchester, denies killing 15 female patients and forging Mrs Grundy's will. The case continues.
