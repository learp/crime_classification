My father-in-law, David Bowen, who has died aged 87, had a lifelong commitment to unravelling the mysteries of illness and death. He was head of forensic pathology at Charing Cross hospital in London from 1973 to 1989 and professor of forensic medicine at the University of London from 1977 to 1989. He was involved in the investigations into the serial killer Dennis Nilsen, the murder of PC Keith Blakelock and the death of the financier Roberto Calvi. He published aÂ professional memoir, Body of Evidence, in 2003.Born in south Wales, David was the son of a GP and the grandson of a Congregationalist minister. He and his brother Arthur, like several generations of Bowen men before them, went to Caterham school in Surrey. David studied medicine at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he was notable less for his academic prowess than as a bon vivant and a lover of practical jokes.He was a keen sportsman and a particularly enthusiastic hockey player, representing West Hertfordshire into his 60s. He was still running and cycling long distances, and competing in triathlons, well into his 70s. His last marathon was in Malta, where his daughter, Diana, lives.David loved travel and was especially fond of Barbados and Formentera. He and his second wife, Helen, whom he married in 1975, several years after the death of his first wife, Rosemary, travelled widely and happily to these islands as he approached and entered retirement. Never content to accept the prospect of old age, he took up skiing and horseriding in his 70s. He had a lifelong interest in motorcars and was also a regular at the Newmarket races.David was a private and reflective man and an affectionate father who cared deeply for his children, Mark, Diana and Rod, and his granddaughters, Charlotte, Caroline, Abby and Stella, who all survive him and who loved him dearly, especially the marvellous ponytail he grew at 85.
