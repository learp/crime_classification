Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, who murdered 13 women and attempted to murder seven more, today began a legal challenge against a high court ruling that he can never be released.The former lorry driver from Bradford, West Yorkshire, now known as Peter Coonan, argues that a severe mental disorder he was suffering at the time of the killings should justify a "finite" number of years, the court of appeal heard.Seeking leave to appeal against a "whole-life tariff" imposed at the high court in July, Edward Fitzgerald QC, acting for Sutcliffe – who is being held in Broadmoor top security psychiatric hospital – said he had been consistently diagnosed as suffering from "encapsulated paranoid schizophrenia"."We accept that the applicant was convicted of the brutal murder of 13 women and the attempted murder of seven others and, on the face of it, we accept that the number and nature of the murders is such that would call for a whole tariff," Fitzgerald told the court."The sole submission in this case is that the disorder suffered, and still suffered, by the applicant is a sufficient mitigating circumstance to justify a long finite term of years instead of a whole-life tariff."He told the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, Mr Justice Calvert-Smith and Mr Justice Griffith Williams: "Of course, the tariff only means the minimum term he must serve before he can apply for parole and it does not have any implication as to release."Sutcliffe received 20 life terms for the murders and attempted murders carried out in Yorkshire and Greater Manchester between 1975 and 1981.At his 1981 trial Sutcliffe claimed that in 1967 he heard what he took to be a divine voice while working as a gravedigger. Later that voice told him he was on a "mission from God" to kill prostitutes, although not all of his victims were prostitutes. He was called the Yorkshire Ripper because he mutilated their bodies, using a hammer, a sharpened screwdriver and a knife.The jury rejected his case that his responsibility was diminished because of his mental disorder, the judges were told. Yet, said Fitzgerald, Sutcliffe had been transferred from prison to Broadmoor in 1984 on the basis that he was suffering a severe mental disorder.Fitzgerald said the court of appeal had the authority to "go behind" the jury's verdict and conclude that such a disorder could lead to diminished responsibility and, thus, a "finite" term."The proper approach is that any mitigating factor that cannot be reasonably excluded should at least be taken into account," said the QC. "There has been a massive amount of development in the last 29 years, all of which, in our submission, confirm that he was suffering from mental disorder."Sutcliffe had been transferred to Broadmoor suffering from clinical schizophrenia and certificates accepted that he had done so since 1967. He had been compulsorily medicated because of his schizophrenia, added Fitzgerald.He had carried out the killings while in a "psychotic fury". But he had not disclosed his hearing of voices to police at the time of arrest because, due to his condition, it was his "private raison d'etre".Answering suggestions Sutcliffe could have been faking his symptoms, Fitzgerald said: "Look at the longevity. After 30 years we say he couldn't be faking it all along."He added: "He has been treated on the basis that he was not faking schizophrenia."Mr Justice Mitting, imposing the life tariff on 16 July, said the proposition that Sutcliffe's responsibility was substantially diminished had been "unquestionably rejected" by the trial jury."It is not, in my opinion, open to a judge setting a minimum term to go behind the verdict of the jury by concluding that, although the defendant's responsibility was not proved to have been substantially diminished, he should be given the benefit of the doubt for the purpose of setting the minimum term, by concluding it might have been," he said in his ruling.The hearing continues.
