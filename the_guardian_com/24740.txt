Gerry McCann has made a surprise return to the Algarve town where his three-year-old daughter, Madeleine, went missing almost two years ago, as part of a reconstruction of the events. Family spokesman Clarence Mitchell said yesterday the reconstruction, which will be part of a Channel 4 documentary, would be available on the internet and to other broadcasters. Mr McCann hopes the venture may prompt fresh information as to his daughter's whereabouts.
