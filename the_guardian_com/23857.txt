Graham Coutts, the man accused of murdering Jane Longhurst, appeared in court yesterday. The 35-year-old musician was charged with murdering the special needs teacher between March 14 and April 19 this year.The burnt body of Ms Longhurst, 31, also a musician, was found on Wiggonholt common, near Pulborough, West Sussex, on April 19. A postmortem examination showed she was strangled. Mr Coutts, from Hove, said little at the hearing at Brighton magistrates court. He gave his name, address and date of birth, and answered "yes" when asked if he understood the charge. He did not react as Alison Saunders, prosecuting, outlinedthe case. He was first arrested last Thursday, and released on bail the following day. He was then arrested again, on Monday, and charged with murder on Tuesday evening. Ms Longhurst, 31, a music teacher at Uplands special needs school in Hollingdean, Brighton, was last seen on March 14 by her partner, Malcolm Sentance. No application was made for bail and the district judge, Ann Arnold, committed the case to Lewes crown court for a hearing on May 12. Ms Longhurst's family were not in court. Over the weekend, police had searched a unit at a Brighton storage firm as part of the investigation. They were said to be no longer looking for items of Ms Longhurst's, including her wallet, denim jacket, mobile phone and keys. Mr Coutts, a guitarist, worked part-time as a musician and as a sales rep for a cleaning products company.
