Clacton shootingA white tent stood on the spot where Dibell was shot and more than 13 police vehicles were parked nearby, including a van full of armed officers.Jim Barker-McCardle, the chief constable of Essex police, described Dibell as a "brave, respected and experienced neighbourhood officer" and said it appeared that he was killed after deliberately intervening in an "extremely deadly situation".Although Barker-McCardle did not reveal further details of the dispute, reports suggested the off-duty officer had challenged the gunman who was chasing a man and woman along Redbridge Road.Speaking about Dibell at the force's Chelmsford headquarters on Monday, the chief constable said: "This officer is a highly regarded and much-loved colleague who has been a important part of Essex police for 10 years."Policing is a family and we are all hurting. This dreadful event reminds us all that policing is a mission that ultimately some die for."We will not rest until we have Peter Reeve in custody; the investigation will continue round the clock."
