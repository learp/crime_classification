A conman who posed as a police officer for many years was jailed for 20 months today.Stuart Howatson, 31, of Bewdley, Worcestershire, duped his wife, family and friends into believing he was a Scotland Yard officer.During his wedding reception in 2006, he laid a place for the former commissioner Sir John Stevens and boasted that he would be attending. When Stevens failed to show up, Howatson told guests the former commissioner had been kept away because of security concerns.Over several years, Howatson detailed his "career" to friends. He claimed that he was an armed officer, a dog handler, a senior officer on sabbatical and a protection officer for the Queen.In 2007, he gave an educational talk, in uniform, at a nursery school where a family friend worked. He talked about his police work and showed children examples of police batons.A year before, while on holiday in Spain, he convinced a friend that he could buy their property for Â£720,000 without a mortgage. He said he had come into an inheritance and supplied false bank statements and monthly deposits from the Metropolitan police and MPA (Metropolitan Police Authority) to prove his finances were sound, Worcester crown court heard.Howatson pleaded guilty to possession of articles of police uniform, possession of an offensive weapon, false accounting, fraud by false representation and possession of and making indecent images of children.Sentencing him to 20 months in jail, the judge said he was a "common trickster and a conman".Howatson's con was uncovered after a tip-off to the department of professional standards at Scotland Yard, who began an investigation.Detective Inspector Claire Moxon, of DPS said: "He went to great lengths to maintain a long-running deceit, taking advantage of the trust placed in him by the people around him."
