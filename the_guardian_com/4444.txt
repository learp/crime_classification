A 14-year-old girl stabbed 30 times in a Lancashire park won a "David and Goliath" battle for her life, her father said today.Jessica Knight was attacked on January 21 as she walked through the park in Astley Village, near Chorley. At a press conference today, her father Richard, 41, revealed that his daughter had had a stroke and has a chest infection, but had started to communicate in the past two days. "She was knocking at the pearly gates and she came back from the brink of death and beat it hands down," he said."It was a real David and Goliath battle and she won it and we're going to use that to help with the psychological effects."He described his daughter as having gone from "a lively, bubbly 14-year-old, very carefree, to not being able to talk".But Wright said both he and Jessica's mother, Jill Walmsley, 37, were confident that their daughter would make a full recovery.Jessica was discovered bleeding after passers-by heard her screams. "The guy who stopped the bleeding saved her life, end of story," said Wright. In the space of 10 minutes his daughter had "gone from seeing the worst that mankind has to offer to the best", he addedJessica was taken to Chorley General Hospital in a critical condition before she was transferred to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. The teenager - known as Jess to friends and family - has since been moved out of intensive care and is now being treated on a high dependency unit where her father said she was making "incredible progress".Jessica was unable to open her eyes until very recently and now communicates using slurred speech or by hand writing.She moved her legs and arms when Spice Girl Geri Halliwell paid her a surprise visit but was unable to open her eyes. "We've nicknamed her Brave Spice, she's an honorary member of the Spice Girls," said Walmsley.Frenchman Kristofer Beddar, 21, has been charged with attempted murder over the stabbing.
