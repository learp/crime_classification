The conman Peter Foster, who was at the centre of the Cherie Blair property-buying scandal, has been jailed for four and a half years in Australia after another of his financial schemes went awry.The 45-year-old admitted fraudulently obtaining loans from a bank, ostensibly to help develop a resort on a Fijian island.The supreme court in Brisbane was told Foster took out a A$580,000 (£252,000) loan with the Bank of Federated States of Micronesia, saying he wanted to develop the remote island as an upmarket holiday destination. Over a two-month period in 2006, he made nine transfers totalling A$306,772, telling bank officials the money was for development purposes.But prosecutor Liz Wilson said he used the money to pay outstanding rent on a girlfriend's house in Australia and to repay his own credit card debt and family debts. He fooled the bank, which had asked for proof of the ongoing work, by using false documents and false photographs of a work site, claiming it as his own."Mr Foster went to some lengths to perpetrate the fraud," she addedFoster's defence lawyer, Brad Farr, said his client envisaged a top-class resort on the island, 80 nautical miles from Suva, Fiji's capital, but had been "ill-equipped" to carry out the project. "He had no experience in property development or travel development. He nevertheless was a person with big ideas that he at least believed would work," Farr said.The court heard Foster originally applied for an A$8m loan but the bank rejected it and, knowing his background, lent him the smaller sum on higher than normal interest rates. Farr said Foster had hoped to repay the loan by selling residential blocks on the island but that scheme had backfired. He had managed, however, to repay A$80,000.Australia's most high-profile conman, with convictions on three continents, Foster had told Australian newspapers that he would build homes for Bill Gates and Tom Cruise on the island.After the fraud was uncovered, Foster led South Pacific police on an island-hopping chase early this year, fleeing Fiji by jumping off a bridge dressed only in his underpants, catching a lift on an old Australian naval minesweeper and wading ashore on a remote Vanuatu beach.Captured by Vanuatu police, he was convicted of illegally entering the country but, according to Foster, won an early release from prison after a long lunch with his jailers.He was arrested by Australian police in February as he arrived in Brisbane on a flight from Vanuatu.In 2002 Foster caused embarrassment to the Blair government when, as the lover of Cherie Blair's "lifestyle guru" Carole Caplin, he helped the prime minister's wife purchase two flats in Bristol.The scandal revolved around revelations that the conman negotiated nearly £70,000 off the price of the flats and that Mrs Blair had offered advice on how to fight his pending deportation.
