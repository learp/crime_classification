Racist incidents reported to the police rose by 107% last year, the Home Office disclosed today.The total number of race crimes spiralled from 23,049 in 1998/99 to nearly 48,000 the following year in England and Wales, a new report shows.In some police forces, the increases were huge - up 459% in West Mercia and 364% in Devon and Cornwall - and none of the 43 forces showed a reduction.A separate report on how police are dealing with race and homophobic crime, and with recruiting ethnic minority staff, found most forces were doing well.However, more effort was needed to end "complacency regarding this proportionality in the use of stop-and-search tactics" and in retaining and promoting ethnic minority staff.North Yorkshire was found to be failing in six of the 10 areas examined in the study and City of London police was failing in five.Gwent Police were failing in eight areas, but were rated good in two and satisfactory in one.Meanwhile, the race statistics showed more than 818,000 stop and searches were recorded by police, down from more than 1m the previous year.Police use of stop-and-search tactics - criticised in the Macpherson report into the racist murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence for targeting ethnic minorities more frequently than whites - fell by 40% in the Metropolitan police area and 14% in the rest of England and Wales.Black people were five times more likely to be stopped and searched than whites and four times more likely to be arrested.Nearly 60% of the people arrested by the Met for robbery were black, said the report.Home secretary Jack Straw said that the figures "reflected the different breakdown of who is committing robbery on the streets of London".Figures show black people accounted for 57.2% of arrests for robbery in the Met's area compared to an average of 28.2% in the whole of England and Wales."In London, there's bound to be a higher proportion of black people stopped for street crime because a higher proportion of black people commit street crime - that is not because they are black but because of their social background, age group and educational attainment," said Mr Straw.Commenting on the large rise in recorded race incidents, Home Office statistician Professor Paul Wiles said: "This increase most probably reflects better reporting and recording of incidents rather than an absolute increase in the numbers."The new simplified definition of a racist incident - any incident is racist if perceived to be so by the victim or any other person - may have assisted officers in better identifying such incidents."Evidence from the British Crime Survey indicated that racist incidents were falling, he added. Mr Straw said that the sharp rise in the reporting of racial incidents was "good news" because it showed an increasing confidence on the part of minorities that their concerns would be dealt with by the police.He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: "We know from the British Crime Survey that the total amount of racial crime seems to have gone down a bit."Why has the recording doubled? Because it shows an increased confidence by the black and Asian population to report these incidents and then have something done about them."He dismissed as "utter nonsense" suggestions that the recent rise in violent offences was directly linked to a drop in the use of stop-and-search by police wary of being branded racist in the wake of the Macpherson Report.Claims that police were being required to conform to the strictures of "political correctness" were a "smokescreen" put up by right-wingers who wanted to allege that the police had "gone soft on the black community", but did not have the guts to say so openly, he said.He added: "Robbery has gone up in areas where there are no black people at all."It happens that the police division with the highest rate per thousand for robberies is Newcastle upon Tyne Central, where there are virtually no black people."There is a problem with robbery and it has got to be dealt with, and where the people committing the robberies happen to be black, the police have got to be able to deal with that as effectively and forcefully as if these people were white."Stopping and searching of people about whom police had a reasonable suspicion was backed both by the Home Office and by the Macpherson Report, said Mr Straw.The real change in the use of stop and search since Macpherson was that it was being targeted more accurately than before, he said."Although the numbers have come down, the arrest rate has gone up, and that's good news," said Mr Straw."For example, in respect of black people in London, (the police) success rate has improved by a quarter. In the previous year, just 13% of those stopped and searched were then arrested. That has now gone up to 17%."Mr Straw conceded that improvements in police recruitment of ethnic minorities "could be faster", but said he remained confident the targets for recruitment would be met.Related storiesPolice suspend high-ranking black officer17.1.2000: Embarrassed Met admits error leave just four ethnic recruits14.1.2000: Now Met's staff say force is racist11.1.2000: Racist firms keep black unemployment highRelated special reportRace in BritainUseful linksHome Office report in full (pdf)Home OfficeEuropean Commission against racism and intoleranceCampaign Against Racism and FascismCommission for Racial EqualitySearchlight
