   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The advertising watchdog has banned a Home Office campaign that backed a Labour policy pledge on policing after a complaint that it was misleading.In the TV campaign, by ad agency RKCR, the government's policing pledge that the public can "now expect your neighbourhood police to spend at least 80% of their time on the beat in your area" is highlighted. The Guardian revealed last week that the Advertising Standards Authority planned to ban the commercial.A single viewer complained to the ASA that the claim made in the ad was misleading and asked whether the Home Office could substantiate it.The Home Office provided a "detailed letter" to to Clearcast, the body responsible for vetting claims in ads before they are made, confirming that the claim was accurate."We considered the overall impression of the ad was such that it was likely to be interpreted as suggesting that police officers, rather than only neighbourhood policing teams, were now spending at least 80% of their time patrolling the streets," said the ASA. "We noted however that was not the case [and] we [therefore] concluded that the ad was misleading."• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
