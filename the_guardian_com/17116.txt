Barristers are to be allowed for the first time to offer their services directly to the public without the need to go through a solicitor.The reform abolishes a rule dating back to the mid-19th century and is controversial; it means the bar is no longer to be a referral-only profession, the chief remaining distinction between barristers and solicitors. It comes into force next month, having been approved this week by David Lammy, minister in the Department for Constitutional Affairs. The Bar Council gave its approval in 2002, but it has taken since then to work out the rules, set up the training for barristers working without a solicitor, and win the approval of the senior judges. It cuts the cost of simpler cases because litigants can avoid having to hire a solicitor and go straight to a barrister, who will be free to decide whether to take the case. Family and immigration work will be excluded, apart from child support appeals, and in criminal cases the scheme will be limited to advisory work and simpler appeals. All other civil work is included but the barrister will not be allowed to do the preparatory and administrative work done by solicitors. For a bigger case, clients will be advised to use a solicitor unless they are capable of handling it themselves.
