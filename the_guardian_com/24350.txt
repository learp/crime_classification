Two teenage boys were found guilty today of beating a Chinese takeaway owner to death outside his shop in Wigan earlier this year.Mi Gao Huang Chen, 41, was killed in front of his horrified girlfriend on Saturday April 23 after chasing a gang of teenagers away from his shop shortly after pub closing time.The jury at Liverpool crown court found the two boys, aged 16 and 17, guilty of murder. Two other 16-year-old boys pleaded guilty before the start of the two-week trial.A 17-year-old boy was found not guilty of murder or manslaughter, and the judge sent the jury back for further deliberations after they failed to reach a verdict on a 17-year-old girl accused of murder.None of the gang has been named for legal reasons forbidding the naming of minors involved in criminal trials.The court was told earlier in the trial how the gang had confronted Mr Chen, his chef and his girlfriend Ming Yan Jia with a spade, sticks and wooden stakes outside his Superb Hut takeaway.The three initially armed themselves with sticks and bottles and chased the gang onto a nearby housing estate, but they were driven back after being bombarded with flowerpots and sticks.The court was told that a member of the gang repeatedly stamped on Mr Chen's head after he was kicked to the ground.CCTV footage screened during the trial showed one of the gang raining blows on Mr Chen's head with a stake. He died of head injuries in hospital five days after the attack.
