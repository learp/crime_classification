Kent police today revealed they had so far recovered £11m of the £53m stolen in last month's raid on a Securitas depot in Tonbridge.An operation in Welling, south-east London, during which cash was found in a yard at the back of a vehicle repair business, had resulted in the recovery of £9m of the £11m, officers said.Michael Fuller, the Kent chief constable, said police investigating the raid had made a significant cash seizure in the past 24 hours, but did not say exactly how much had been found.The news came as it was announced that police who investigated the Northern Bank robbery in Belfast would review the inquiry into the Securitas raid.A team from the Police Service of Northern Ireland will arrive in Kent this week to help the inquiry into the £53m raid in Tonbridge last month.Mr Fuller said the review was intended to "ensure we have identified and exploited all reasonable lines of inquiry and that our investigation is professional and thorough".He said the PSNI would bring their "considerable experience" from dealing with the £26.5m Northern Bank robbery in 2004, adding: "This is recognised good practice in the police service, and we value the opportunity to learn from our colleagues."This review allows experienced investigators independent of our inquiry to look at what we have done and what we plan to do and to help us take stock."Mr Fuller said the scale of the inquiry was "massive", with more than 300 police officers and staff working on the hunt for the gang that carried out the raid.During the course of the robbery, the raiders kidnapped the depot manager, Colin Dixon, and held his wife, Lynn, and son Craig, then aged eight, hostage. "They are recovering well from their ordeal and they hope to get back to leading normal lives as soon as possible," he said. Since the raid, which happened in the early hours of February 22, more than 3,500 pieces of evidence have been seized, over 300 witness statements taken and more than 20 places searched.A number of vehicles believed to have been used in the robbery have been recovered, he said. Seventeen people have been arrested, with five having been charged and appeared in court. A 28-year-old man arrested in the Bexley area of south-east London on Saturday was released on police bail last night.Officers have received more than 2,100 calls from the public, which Mr Fuller said had been crucial to the investigation's successes so far.
