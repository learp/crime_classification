The Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs could be released from prison next year, his lawyer has claimed.Biggs was sentenced to 30 years for his part in the robbery of a Glasgow to London mail train on August 8 1963, when a 15-strong gang made off with Â£2.6m in used banknotes.He escaped from Wandsworth prison in a furniture van after serving just 15 months. Biggs spent more than three decades on the run in Spain, Australia and Brazil before returning to Britain voluntarily in 2001. On his return, Biggs was imprisoned in Belmarsh high security jail, in south-east London, and he was later transferred to a unit in Norwich.His lawyer, Giovanni Di Stefano, said the 78-year-old was entitled to be released on parole as he had served more than one-third of his sentence. Di Stefano said the Ministry of Justice had sent Biggs's case to the Parole Board for consideration of possible release in July 2009."They are not counting the time he spent in custody in Brazil and Barbados, and of course I will press them on this as it would make his release date on parole December 2008," he said. "Ronnie has spoken a few words to his son Michael and said that he can now see the end of this nightmare. Common sense has prevailed."Di Stefano said Biggs was convicted when no parole scheme was in operation, and the criterion at the time of his sentence was that parole be considered after serving a third of the tariff handed down. "Mr Biggs' co-defendants benefited by the scheme," said Di Stefano. "Case law demands that Mr Biggs be treated in accordance with the law at that time, namely parole consideration at the one-third stage."The Ministry of Justice and the Parole Board said they could not comment on individual cases.
