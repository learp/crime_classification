Conditions at the largest prison in the country have worsened since a critical report 16 months ago, according to an inspection report released today.Wandsworth, in south London, is holding inmates in ever more cramped conditions due to the rising prison population, the chief inspector of prisons' report said. Earlier this year, the prison was warned it would be contracted out to the private sector unless significant improvements were made. While there have been improvements - including the induction process and access to showers and telephones - on other indicators the prison had slipped back since its last inspection. There were more complaints of victimisation by staff among minority ethnic prisoners than white prisoners - 48% compared with 39%. Inspectors noticed racist language and action were commonplace and often went unchallenged. Anne Owers, the chief inspector, said the underlying culture at the jail, which has more than 1,400 prisoners, had not been addressed and some staff were actively disrespectful to prisoners. The report said control and restraint techniques were overused in response to minor incidents. Michael Spurr, the Prison Service director of operations, said: "Wandsworth has had to operate at maximum capacity during a period of significant population pressure. It has struggled to respond to the challenge and has underperformed _ The pace of change has increased and I am confident the concerns of the chief inspector are now being actively addressed."
