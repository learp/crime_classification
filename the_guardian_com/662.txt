Two 13-year-old boys have admitted desecrating graves at a Jewish cemetery in north Manchester.The boys, who cannot be named, pleaded guilty to criminal damage at Manchester and Salford youth court on Friday.They admitted knocking over and damaging three grave stones at the Rochdale Road cemetery in Higher Blackley on 21 June.The damage was estimated at £1,000. Afterwards, more than 100 members of the local Jewish, Muslim and Christian communities helped with the clear-up, according to Simon Yaffe, from the Jewish Telegraph.Initial media reports suggested the boys had daubed swastikas and racist graffiti on the graves, but the prosecutor told the court that the graffiti had in fact appeared on 16 June, five days earlier.As a result, locals were watching over the cemetery more vigilantly than usual and caught the boys "red-handed", according to Zahra Baqri, for the Crown Prosecution Service."A witness heard thudding noises and looked and saw two young boys. What was clear is that adjacent to where the boys were stood, a head stone had been pushed over and what they then saw the boys to be doing was rocking the head stone from side to side," said Baqri.The younger boy's lawyer, Elizabeth Dyson, told the bench that the teenagers were not motivated by racial hatred."It's not a racially aggravated offence. I know there was a flavour of it in the proceeding weeks, but this was simply criminal damage," she said.Both boys admitted the offence when questioned by police, with the younger lad "remorseful and extremely apologetic", she added.The prosecutor suggested the £1,000 estimate was "extremely conservative" given the high cost of grave stones. She suggested that the younger boy, who has not been in court before, should pay compensation to cover both the cost and the "distress" caused to the families whose graves had been desecrated at such a "sacred site".The other boy, who is in care, already has nine previous convictions.Both will be sentenced on 16 September.
