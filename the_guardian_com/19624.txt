Potential jurors in the trial of two Pakistani Test cricketers accused of spot-fixing have been asked whether they or their families work in the gambling industry, as the case began at Southwark crown court.The former Pakistan captain Salman Butt, 26, and the fast bowler Mohammad Asif, 28, are charged with conspiracy to cheat and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments during their country's tour of England last summer.The pair, who deny the charges, are accused of conspiring between 15-29 August last year to accept money in return for arranging for deliberate no-balls to be bowled during the Test match between the two sides at Lord's.The judge, Mr Justice Cooke, told a group of 30 men and women from whom the 12 jurors will be selected that the trial could last up to five weeks.
