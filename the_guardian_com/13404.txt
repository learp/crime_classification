A Conservative-run council has defended its decision to pursue legal action against a pet shop owner who was prosecuted for selling a goldfish to a child.Shop owner Joan Higgins, 66, and her son, Mark, 47, pleaded guilty at Trafford magistrates court on Tuesday to selling an animal to a person under the age of 16 unaccompanied by an adult and causing unnecessary suffering to a cockatiel.It later emerged that the shop, Majors Pets, had also, last May, sold a gerbil to a 14-year-old girl with learning difficulties who later that day put it in a cup of coffee, killing the animal, the council said.A complaint was made to Trafford council about the shop in Sale, Greater Manchester and the authority sent a 15-year-old boy to make a test purchase of a goldfish, which was sold without his age being questioned or providing any information about the care of the fish.An animal welfare officer present also noticed a cockatiel in the store that appeared to be in distress. A veterinary surgeon examined the bird and found it had a broken leg and eye problems. It later had to be put down.Mrs Higgins was fined £1,000 and ordered to abide by a curfew to stay in her house between 6pm and 7am for the next seven weeks because she was unfit for community work.Her son, who manages the shop, was fined £750 and ordered to carry out 120 hours of community work.Jonathan Coupe, executive councillor at Trafford council, defended the authority's actions. He said: "The main reason we took this prosecution was because the pet shop owner had caused unnecessary suffering to a cockatiel which was found on sale in the shop. The prosecution was for the poor condition and distress a cockatiel was found to be in at their store.Trafford council had, in November 2008, warned the store about not supplying care information to customers."Test purchasing is an approved and proportionate way of making sure the law and relevant licensing procedures are being followed, and is also used to ensure retailers are following rules in relation to other age restricted products such as alcohol and cigarettes."Animal rights group Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) also backed the council's stance.A spokeswoman said: "Like many other pet shop owners, Higgins demonstrates profit comes before animal welfare in the pet trade by selling an animal to someone who may not be able to care for it fully and properly and even permitting a cockatiel to suffer a broken leg and eye problems."Ensuring pet shop owners adhere to basic animal welfare standards is the bare minimal that must be expected by authorities, yet cruelty in the pet trade remains the norm, not the exception."
