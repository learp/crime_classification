A seven-year-old girl was deliberately starved to death while being kept a prisoner in her home by her mother and her partner, a court heard today.Khyra Ishaq died of an infection after being starved over weeks or possibly months, Birmingham crown court was told.Opening the case against Angela Gordon and Junaid Abuhamza, prosecutor Timothy Raggatt QC said Khyra had been starved to a point that was almost unique in the experience of British medical staff.Raggatt told jurors: "It's highly likely that you will find some of what you will hear distressing and disturbing. The actual means or process which resulted in [Khyra's death] was brought about by a series of actions that were in effect the deliberate and calculated starvation of that little girl over a period, certainly of weeks, and very possibly months."Abuhamza, 30, and Gordon, 34, both of Handsworth, Birmingham, deny murdering Khyra on 17 May last year.Raggatt said the jury would be shown a photograph of Khyra when she was developing in a normal way and another photograph of her taken shortly after her death."The purpose of that will not be to shock you," Raggatt said. "There is a clear and proper purpose to do that and it's this â€“ they show as clearly as we possibly can the reality of what happened here."Raggatt suggested the jury may have seen such photographs in the context of famine in Africa. "The cruelty and maltreatment of that little girl, you may well come to think, was both ultimately calculated and obviously deliberate," he added.Gordon and Abuhamza also maltreated five other children in their control, the prosecutor alleged."All of them, as well as being starved, were subjected to violence of differing degrees," Raggatt said.The jury was told that Abuhamza had pleaded guilty on Wednesday to child cruelty charges relating to the five other children.Gordon denies five charges of child cruelty between December 2007 and 17 May 2008.
