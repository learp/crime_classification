New plans to keep women out of jail by tackling the causes of female crime will be unveiled by the Home Secretary this week.Women given community sentences will be offered help to escape violent partners who may be triggering their offending, as well as advice on jobs, childcare and benefits, through one-stop centres which will aim to prevent them from continuing criminal careers. The move follows research suggesting that women offend for different reasons from men. Two-thirds of women in prison are there for crimes such as chequebook fraud or shoplifting, and they are disproportionately likely to have been victims of domestic violence. High rates of female suicide in jail have helped drive calls for schemes to keep women out of prison. Since the publication of a groundbreaking report on female criminals by think-tank the Fawcett Society a year ago, another 12 women inmates have killed themselves. Charles Clarke is expected to respond this week by pledging money for two new centres specifically targeting women offenders. 'We want to tackle the root causes of offending behaviour at an early stage, to prevent these people reoffending and the next time ending up in custody,' said a Home Office source.
