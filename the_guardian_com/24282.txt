Ian Johnston, Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, read out a formal statement apologising to the Lawrence family. After he told Mansfield there were "subtleties around corruption as there are around racism", he was cross-examined by Kamlish about race.Kamlish You are aware of a recent Met report which shows that black people were four times more likely to be stopped and searched in a street as white people?Johnston If we look at the people who are likely to be out on the streets, youngsters who are truanting and excluded from schools, who are over-represented in the statistics, it is young black children. If you look at who else is out on the streets, it is the unemployed. If you look at the differential rates of unemployment, black people, for a range of reasons - some of which are understandable, some of which are abhorrent - are unemployed. If you look at police, where police do their stop and search, it is in high crime areas. High crime areas tend to be areas of social deprivation. Who lives in areas of social deprivation? For a range of reasons, coloured people.
