Recorded crime fell by 12% in the last three months of 2007 - the largest drop in at least five years - according to Home Office figures published today.Police in England and Wales reported substantial falls in robbery (down 21%), car crime (down 19%), criminal damage (down 17%) and violence against the person (down 10%).The total number of offences recorded from October to December 2007 dropped to 5.05m - a fall of 12%. This is the biggest single quarterly drop in the crime figures for at least five years.Police recorded a 20% rise in drug offences due to greater use of cannabis warnings, and a 4% overall rise in gun crime from 9,594 incidents to 9,967.The number of people shot dead, however, fell from 56 in 2006 to 49 in 2007 and shootings involving serious injury dropped from 424 to 355.The overall rise in gun crime was due to an increase in incidents where slight injuries were sustained, or the weapon was used to threaten.The 12% fall in crime follows a 9% drop between July and September, a 7% fall between April and June, and a 3% fall from January to March, suggesting the drop in crime is now both sustained and accelerating.The British Crime Survey, which is based on a survey of 40,000 people's experience of crime, confirms this, with the risk of being a crime victim falling to 23% - the lowest since the survey began in 1981.Overall, the BCS puts the fall in crime at 6% during 2007, with violent crime also down 6%, and significant falls in car crime and vandalism. The fall in the crime rate was accompanied by a reduction in the fear of crime, with the number of those with a "high level of worry" about violent crime falling from 17% to 15%, and about car crime or burglary down from 13% to 12%.Concern about antisocial behaviour continued at about the same level, with 28% saying they were worried about vandalism, graffiti and criminal damage.Ian Johnstone, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, welcomed the 12% fall in the police crime rate and the "notable reductions in robbery and violent crime". He said he was pleased to see the fall in the number of gun-related deaths because driving out gun and gang culture remained a high police priority."The impact of increased enforcement activity are evident in today's figures on recorded drug crime, which shows an increase of 20%. Revised ACPO guidance to forces has resulted in an increase in cautions for cannabis possession, while tough enforcement to tackle class A drugs remains a priority for the police service."The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said the figures showed drug and gun crime had continued to rise unabated. He claimed violent crime had doubled under Labour because of its "lax approach to law enforcement and failure to address the causes of crime".The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Chris Huhne, called for tougher action on gun crime and claimed there were nine times as many customs officers looking for smuggled cigarettes as contraband guns.
