Three UK directors of the French engineering group Alstom have been arrested on suspicion of bribery and other offences after raids this morning by the Serious Fraud Office.The three men have been taken to police stations to be interviewed by the SFO. They are accused of bribery and corruption, conspiracy to pay bribes, money laundering and false accounting.The agency said search warrants were executed this morning at five Alstom premises and four homes.The SFO has been working closely with authorities in Switzerland, including Swiss federal police, and a number of police forces in the UK.This morning's raids took place at addresses in Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Cheshire, Shropshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire and London.The investigation centres on suspected bribes paid by companies within the Alstom group in the UK in order to win contracts overseas, and this has allegedly involved money laundering and other offences.SFO director Richard Alderman said: "The SFO is committed to tackling corruption. We are working closely with other criminal justice organisations across the world and are taking steps to encourage companies to report any suspicions of corruption, either within their own business or by other companies or individuals."Alstom employs 5,000 people in the UK where it is active in the energy and transport sectors.
