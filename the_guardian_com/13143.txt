The prime minister today condemned the violence caused by football fans in Manchester last night as "a disgrace" and said that a review of UK laws might be necessary to deal with future violent episodes.He also suggested that fans without tickets ought to stay at home rather than travel to the location of a match where trouble might be likely.Speaking at his regular press briefing, Gordon Brown said that last night's clash between Rangers fans and riot police was "unacceptable"."It was a disgrace to see people misbehaving … It was a minority and it was completely unacceptable," he said.The FA is making a £15m bid to bring the World Cup back to England for the first time since 1966 - a move strongly support by the prime minister himself.Brown told journalists: "I want to do everything to avoid us being put in a position where we might be at risk of an application for the 2018 World Cup not being acceptable because of this. "We've got to make sure we deal with problems and deal with them whenever they happen so we are looking at this as a matter of urgency." One person was stabbed and police arrested 42 others during and after the Uefa cup final between Rangers and Zenit St Petersburg. Police chiefs said they were "sickened and disappointed" by the violence, which broke out after a giant screen in Piccadilly Gardens failed to work. The match was taking place at Manchester City's Eastlands stadium.Brown added to this condemnation and said that the violence might be a sign that UK laws needed to be toughened up."We do have laws to control drinking in public places where there is a risk of disorder and we will have to look at these laws for the future," he said."Whatever the carnival atmosphere was at the beginning, the fact that it degenerated as a result of the minority being engaged in violence will lead us to have to look at this."Brown said that the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, would be speaking to the chief constable of Greater Manchester police about the incident.However, Brown insisted that his government was still tough on crime, pointing out that crime had fallen by 30% since 1997."We do have more people in prison, but that is a result of the fact we are far tougher in sentences for those people who have knives, in gangs or who commit violent offences."Our policy is to punish and prevent … It's important to recognise that where knives are involved and glass is involved, we are taking action," he told reporters.The prime minister said that people who did not have tickets to football games should not travel to those events, but he would not be drawn on any implications for the prospect of future games between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
