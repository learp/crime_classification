A man posing as a plain-clothes police officer may be embarked on targeting girls in West Yorkshire with growing confidence, after two successful abductions and assaults.Detectives on separate cases, one a 12-year-old, the other a 13-year-old, joined forces after finding so many similarities that the same man is thought "very likely" to be responsible. Advice on criminal profiling has been called in by West Yorkshire police, who appealed yesterday for information on the attacks and on other incidents which might be linked. Detective Superintendent Steve Fear, leading the investigation, said: "We had so many similarities we couldn't ignore it. "It's very likely we've got the start of something by the same person. I've no doubt there are other ones [attacks] out there we have to get hold of and get to know about." The attacks, in August 2003 and last new year in Wakefield, were carried out by a fat-faced white man in his 30s, driving a silver car the same size as a Ford Fiesta. He abducted both girls after saying he was a policeman, sexually assaulted them, and then dropped them nearby. Det Supt Fear said police were working very closely with both victims of the "nasty and despicable" attacks: "We are taking them extremely seriously. What we want to do is appeal for anyone else that may have been approached in a similar way to come forward. "People may think it's insignificant, but it may be the key that cracks our case." The suspect is also described as having short, brown hair with sideburns, and either a gap or a silver bottom tooth. He asked both girls for directions, and persuaded them into his car on the pretext they could show him the way.
