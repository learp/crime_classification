A teenager, mistakenly released from custody by a private security firm, turned himself in to police yesterday.Strathclyde police said they had arrested James McCormick, 17, from Glasgow who had gone missing from Hamilton sheriff court in Lanarkshire on April 8. The teenager was being escorted by the security firm Reliance when he was released. It is understood McCormick walked into Polmont young offenders' institution early yesterday. He is to appear at Hamilton sheriff court this morning. Last week a 16-year-old girl was arrested and charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice in connection with his disappearance. Reliance Custodial Services, the firm which won the contract to transfer Scottish prisoners, took over the role traditionally carried out by police and prison officers on April 1. Since then it has also released two other prisoners in error, provoking a political storm in Scotland.
