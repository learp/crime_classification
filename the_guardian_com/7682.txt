Life has sadly imitated art with the news that Spooks and Ashes To Ashes star Keeley Hawes was a victim of identity fraud while filming the new ITV drama Identity, which follows an elite police unit formed to combat the explosion of identity-related crime.The actor had her credit cards stolen by somebody working at her house who used them to run up a £7,000 bill. Credit agency Equifax says personal information is the new currency of the 21st century and definitely a more valuable asset than cash."It can only take three pieces of personal information for a fraudster to steal someone's identity, so it's vital that everyone takes care of the documents and online activity that could put this valuable asset in the hands of the fraudsters," explains Equifax's Neil Munroe.Today, ID fraud has even made its way onto social networking service Twitter, with users hacking into legitimate accounts and sending fake messages often containing links to websites that aren't reliable. This has happened to many celebrities and politicians, including Ed Miliband.In the television drama, Hawes plays DSI Martha Lawson, head of the identity unit which, according to ITV publicity, is there to, "tackle impostors who look, talk and sound just like us but would kill you in a heartbeat. Lawson works any case where making an identification is a significant part of solving the crime by outsmarting, hunting down and unmasking the modern day Jekyll and Hydes."Munroe says prevention is definitely better than cure, as it can take hundreds of hours to rectify an individual's records if they fall victim to ID fraud or theft. There are all sort of measures you can take to avoid identity theft:• Be wary when asked to give out your personal details online. If you doubt the request is genuine, contact the company directly.• Make sure you have the latest virus protection on your computer – ideally one that updates hourly – and that you have a firewall.• Keep your pin secure, do not use the same number for all of your cards and accounts and never write down your pin.• Don't include common verification such as your date of birth or your mother's maiden name.• When using online banking, ensure people can't view your details by looking over your shoulder. And log out of the site, rather than just closing the window.• If you are disposing of an old computer, make sure you destroy information on the hard drive using security software package – simply deleting it isn't enough.• Always check bank statements and credit card statements carefully against receipts.• Apply for a copy of your credit file to look out for any unauthorised activity.
