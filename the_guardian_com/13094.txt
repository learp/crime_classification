Scotland Yard has charged more than 1,000 suspects over the riots which swept through the capital.Metropolitan police acting commissioner Tim Godwin hailed a "significant milestone" as he said a total of 1,005 suspects had been charged after 1,733 arrests so far.Godwin, who said at the weekend that the force was aiming for 3,000 convictions, added that the investigation is "far from over".Operation Withern – the force's investigation into the violence and looting last week – includes 500 officers who have gathered 20,000 hours of CCTV footage.Forensic officers have made more than 300 submissions to labs from more than 1,100 crime scenes, the force added.Godwin hailed the work of his officers and Londoners over the response to the crisis."Our tireless investigations to find those responsible for last week's appalling violence continue," he said."Officers across the Met are carrying out great police work, day and night, to gather the kind of evidence which has led to these charges."The response from the public in coming forward with information has been fantastic. I want to thank all communities for their help over the last 10 days and ask for their continued support. If you know anyone involved in the disorder tell us – don't let them get away with it."London Mayor Boris Johnson said: "Thanks to the commitment and hard work of each and every police officer in London, those responsible for the sickening crimes we saw across the capital last week are swiftly being brought to justice."To have already charged 1,000 people is a testament not only to their dedication, but also to the outstanding support they have had from law-abiding Londoners who will not tolerate this behaviour in their communities."We have shone a torch on London's criminal fraternity, and this milestone sends out the clear message that offenders will be made to pay for their appalling actions."
