A pilot has admitted flying a passenger jet from Spain while three times over the alcohol limit.Ian Jennings, 47, from Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich airport last month after landing a chartered plane with about 10 people on board.On Thursday at Norwich magistrates court he admitted to the charge of flying while the alcohol in his breath was over the prescribed limit. The offence carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison.Prosecutor Lesla Small said: “The police had received information from a member of the public and attended Norwich airport.“The passengers were allowed to get off the aircraft and he was breathalysed.”Officers detected 31 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath, the court heard. The limit for pilots is 9 micrograms while for drivers it is 35.Marcus Crosskell, mitigating for Jennings, said: “He is a gentleman of unblemished character with a 20-year-plus career as a pilot.”Magistrates said the case was so serious it would have to be sentenced by a crown court judge at a later date.Jennings was released on bail on the condition he does not fly any aircraft.His licence has been suspended by the Civil Aviation Authority.The plane is believed to have been a Canadair CL601-3A Challenger.
