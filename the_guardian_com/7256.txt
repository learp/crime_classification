A teenager today admitted murdering 16-year-old Mary-Ann Leneghan who was stabbed to death in a Reading park after being tortured and raped.Michael Johnson, 19, of Southfields, south-west London, changed his plea four weeks into his trial and admitted killing Mary-Ann. He also admitted kidnap and the attempted murder of her friend, changing his plea moments before the defence case was due to begin.Johnson is one of six men accused of murdering Ms Leneghan and attempting to kill her friend, now 19, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Mary-Ann was found riddled with stab wounds in Reading's Prospect Park on May 7 last year after being kidnapped and raped by a gang of men, Reading crown court has heard.The teenager was abducted with her friend and taken to a hotel room where they were both allegedly abused before being taken out to die, the trial has heard.Today, after Johnson's change of plea, Mary-Ann's friend left the court weeping, but was then seen smiling outside the courtroom.Johnson continues to deny charges of rape and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Five other men are on trial. Joshua Morally, 23, and his brother, Jamaile, 22, both of Balham, south London; Indrit Krasniqui, 18, of Chiswick, west London; Llewellyn Adams, 24, of Balham and the alleged ringleader of the gang, Adrian Thomas, 20 of Battersea, south London, all deny murder, attempted murder, rape and causing grievous bodily harm to the two teenagers.All five deny kidnap, except Joshua Morally, who admits two counts of kidnap. Jamaile Morally denies a further charge of raping Mary-Ann's friend.Moments before Johnson's admission the judge, Mr Justice Penry-Davey, told the court that he would be instructing the jury in due course to acquit the man of causing grievous bodily harm on both girls and ask them to consider a separate charge of causing actual bodily harm on Mary-Ann's friend.The jury has heard how Mary-Ann's friend picked out Johnson as the man she recognised as wearing a bandana on the night of Mary-Ann's kidnap and murder.During five days in the witness box she recounted in graphic detail how she witnessed the man with the bandana repeatedly stabbing Mary-Ann before she was shot in the head herself.The court has heard that she "miraculously" survived after a bullet shattered before entering her skull, lodging fragments of shrapnel inside her head, some of which remain there today.But despite being left for dead, the teenager went on to become the prosecution's star witness in the trial. She said Johnson stabbed Mary-Ann all over her body as she lay curled up in a ball in the grass in Prospect Park.During her evidence, she recounted that Mary-Ann had slumped on to her with blood pouring over her leg as Johnson ordered her to stop pleading for her life.She told the court that Johnson and another man wanted to slit Mary-Ann's throat. She then had a gun pointed at her head after being told that her last memory would be witnessing her friend being "butchered".She was then shot in the head and blacked out. She woke to find that the men had gone and she raised the alarm.The trial has heard that the kidnap and murder were a revenge attack for a robbery on Mr Thomas in Reading the previous month. Mr Thomas, the court has heard, was stabbed and robbed of drugs in a flat on Reading's Oxford Road a short distance from where Mary-Ann lived.Richard Latham QC, prosecuting, told the jury in his opening of the case last month that Mr Thomas apparently believed that the two friends might have been responsible for "setting up" the attack.The court has heard evidence that both Mary-Ann and her friend knew Mr Thomas and had met him in Reading on a number of occasions.The jury has been told that on the night of May 6 last year, Mary-Ann and her friend were sitting in a car in the car park of the Wallingford Arms pub in Reading when they were abducted.Mr Latham told the court that the two girls were bundled into the boot of a red Nissan Almera and driven to the Abbey guesthouse in Reading where the men booked into room 19.The barrister said: "For the next few hours they were seriously assaulted, they were raped, both vaginally and orally, they were made to smoke heroin and crack cocaine and most seriously of all they were told throughout that they were going to die that night when the men had finished with them." Mr Latham said that after suffering hours of abuse the girls were taken to Prospect Park where a pillow was placed over Mary-Ann's head before she was repeatedly stabbed to death. He said that a pillow was also placed over her friend's head. "A loaded gun was placed against her forehead and it was discharged. She was instantly unconscious and she was left for dead," Mr Latham said."Miraculously the bullet did not kill her, it was she who raised the alarm asking for the assistance of a passerby."The trial continues.
