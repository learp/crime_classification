A robber who held up a bookmakers with his girlfriend's vibrator was jailed today.Nicki Jex concealed the Rampant Rabbit sex toy in a carrier bag and pretended it was a gun during the raid on the Ladbrokes shop in Leicester on December 27 last year.A member of staff at the branch handed over more than £600 in cash when he pointed the bag at her, Leicester crown court was told.Jex, 27, of Braunstone, pleaded guilty to the robbery, which was captured on a CCTV camera inside the shop.Sentencing him to five years behind bars, the judge, Philip Head, said: "It's right to record that you did not have a firearm but you pretended you had and intended that those you confronted believed that you did, and it must have been truly terrifying for them at the time."The surveillance camera recorded Jex striding into the shop brandishing the "firearm" minutes before staff were due to close for the day.Tim Palmer, prosecuting, told the court: "The defendant pointed the item in the carrier bag at the cashier. She immediately assumed it to be a firearm. In fact, what was contained within the carrier bag was the defendant's girlfriend's vibrator."The cashier retreated behind the counter and he turned the imitation weapon on the shop manager, demanding cash. She handed over £613 in till contents and other money, the court was told.As Jex made his escape, the shop's only remaining customer, Wayne Vakani, followed him outside."The defendant pointed the vibrator in the bag at Mr Vakani and warned him to back off," said Mr Palmer. "Mr Vakani then kept a discreet distance but kept an eye on the defendant and watched where he went."Jex visited a local pub "obviously flush with money" to buy friends a drink. Thanks to Mr Vakani, the defendant's hat worn in the robbery and containing his DNA was discovered nearby.Jex also tried in vain to sell the distinctive camel-coloured coat he had been wearing during the raid.When he was arrested he denied any involvement in the robbery, but he later owned up.The court was told that Jex, a drug addict, had a string of previous convictions dating back to February 2002, including shoplifting, failing to surrender and possession of heroin.In mitigation, Phil Gibbs, defending, said Jex, a qualified chef and engineer, had fought a battle against drug addiction and had a "fragile" state of mind.The judge awarded £500 to Mr Vakani for his "very considerable courage".
