A 17-year-old has spoken of his shame in stealing the bike of a Malaysian student during the London riots, although he denies breaking his jaw. Ashraf Rossli, 20, had been in Britain for just a month when he was attacked and had his bicycle stolen in Barking, east London, last August.After encountering a mob, he was hit in the face and left in a pool of blood. Seconds later, his bicycle was stolen.A teenager who admits stealing the bike told Wood Green crown court he had taken the bike because he was "tired", but insisted a witness was mistaken in saying the person who punched Rossli also stole the bike.He told the court: "When I watched the footage in interview I was very, very ashamed of myself."
