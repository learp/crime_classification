A man who burned himself to death after stabbing his pregnant partner had been freed by police hours earlier, it emerged yesterday.Neil Small was arrested on suspicion of a previous domestic assault on his girlfriend, Magdalena Stapleton, 27, on the morning of the frenzied knife attack. But when released from custody that afternoon, he came back and stabbed her, leaving her seriously injured. He drove to a car park and set his car alight, killing himself. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has launched an inquiry into Hampshire police's handling of the case. Officers arrived at the Basingstoke flat of Ms Stapleton - who is four and a half months pregnant with her fifth child - on the morning of September 18, after reports that Small had attacked her. He was taken away for questioning but later freed.That evening he returned and stabbed Ms Stapleton 10 times, leaving her in a pool of blood. Local people said one of her children fled the flat screaming: "I think my mum's going to die." Neighbours desperately tried to stem her wounds with paper towels as they waited for the ambulance. She was taken to hospital and underwent emergency stomach surgery. The baby was saved and her condition is said to be improving.Meanwhile, Small drove two miles to a warehouse car park, where he set himself alight inside his car. Shop workers ran to help but were unable to get near because of the intense heat. By the time firefighters arrived he was dead.
