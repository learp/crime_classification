An experiment to give a village a dedicated "bobby on the beat" has been abandoned after crime and people's fear of crime increased.The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust (JRHT), the housing arm of the social research charity, paid Â£25,000 a year for an extra 24 hours a week policing at New Earswick, near York, under an arrangement with North Yorkshire police.The aim of the three-year project was to increase people's sense of security through a visible police presence in the village of 1,000 homes.However, the experiment was scrapped a year early as an initial drop in crime by 5% in the first year led to it almost doubling in the second.Much of the increase related to less-serious offences and happened at a time when crime was rising in surrounding neighbourhoods.Researchers at the University of Leeds found a rise in the number of residents who said they felt unsafe outside after dark and a marked increase in dissatisfaction with local policing from 30% to 40%.The failure of the project exposes serious flaws in the government's plans for extra policing as a solution to rising crime and fear of crime, said researchersProfessor Adam Crawford, co-author of the report, said: "One of the key lessons to be learned from this well-intentioned attempt to make residents feel more secure is that trying to tackle local order problems through policing and security alone can have the opposite effect."The additional policing initiative was undermined from the start by a widening gap between what the police were able to deliver and the heightened expectations of local people."Jacquie Dale, of JRHT which manages all the homes in the village, said: "Residents' expectations were never met and fear of crime levels did not diminish as had been hoped."Geoff Bunce, chairman of New Earswick Residents' Forum, was one of a group who recommended the experiment be abandoned early.He said: "The residents' forum wholeheartedly supported the idea of community policing to combat nuisance crime and help alleviate the fear of crime. Unfortunately the reality did not live up to the expectation for a number of reasons."
