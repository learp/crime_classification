Two teenagers who killed a young traveller were given four-and-a-half years' detention in a young offenders' institution yesterday.Lewis McVeigh and Ricky Kearney, both 16, from Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, were found guilty last month of the manslaughter of Johnny Delaney, 15. Johnny, who lived on a travellers' site in Vauxhall, Liverpool, was beaten up during a row between his friends and a group of youths in May. A judge at Chester crown court yesterday lifted a ban on reporting the names of the teenagers. Mr Justice Richards said it was a serious case and Johnny Delaney had been a popular boy whose death was a great loss to his family, and to the wider travelling community. Johnny had tripped and fallen as he ran away from the youths. He was kicked several times as he lay on the ground and died shortly after he arrived at the Countess of Chester hospital. Mr Justice Richards said he did not believe the attacks were racially motivated. But Peter Fahy, the chief constable of Cheshire said afterwards that despite this "it seems clear that the incident was aggravated by underlying tensions that existed between members of the travelling community and local youngsters". Cheshire education authority has announced a scheme to try to educate the community about travellers.
