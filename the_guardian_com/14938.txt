Seven men appeared in a London magistrates court today to face charges in one of the significant insider dealing cases ever brought by the City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority.The men allegedly traded on confidential information gleaned from the London printers of Swiss bank UBS and the brokerage firm Cazenove. They are said to have traded in 12 firms listed on the London markets over a period of two years, including Premier Oil and the technology firm Misys, making themselves Â£2.5m.Mitesh Shah, Neten Shah, Paresh Shah, Bijal Shah, Truptesh Patel, Ali Mustafa and Pardip Saini were first arrested in July last year, following a series of raids conducted by 40 FSA staff and police at addresses in London and the south-east.The men, aged between 29 and 47 years old, spoke only to give their names, addresses and dates of birth before the case was committed to crown court for a preliminary hearing on 22 April. The men have been placed on bail and forced to surrender their passports. The FSA is seeking to extradite an eighth man from India.The defendents face up to seven years in prison if found guilty.The arrests were the result of an investigation lasting 21 months, and included the forensic examination of 75 electronic devices containing more than 200,000 files, 130 individual trading accounts, analysing more than 150,000 entries of publicly available information and taking more than 250 witness statements, the FSA said.The FSA pledged a crackdown on market abuse in early 2008, saying it needed to bring "genuine fear" back to the markets by pursuing criminal prosecutions. The watchdog charged a former Dresdner Kleinwort banker and his wife with insider dealing last month, and scored a significant victory when Macolm Calvert, a former Cazenove partner, was jailed in February for 21 months.Also last month, the FSA stunned the City with a series of dawn raids in what the watchdog described as its largest-ever operation against insider dealing. The authorities have not formally named any of the individuals arrested in those raids, but they include a trader from hedge fund Moore Capital, a managing director in the corporate broking arm of Deutsche Bank and a stockbroker at Novum Securities.The watchdog has doubled the amount of people working in its enforcement division to 450 since 2005.
