Phillip Webb has studied lots of CCTV pictures of young criminals committing offences as they wave brazenly at the cameras. "As far as they are concerned it's a joke," explains Webb, who was until recently chief executive of the Police Information Technology Organisation (Pito).Opinion polls have revealed strong support for surveillance of Britain's supposedly crime-ridden streets but public confidence appears misplaced. This week, Detective Chief Inspector Mick Neville of the Metropolitan police admitted that cameras have failed to cut crime.Even some inside the security industry admit the deterrent effect has diminished. There are probably 4.5 million of the devices - one for every 13 Britons - panning across pedestrian precincts and bus stations. However, big brother is frequently not watching. "A typical town centre system will have 200-plus cameras," says Chris Boyce of Camwatch, "and three or four staff on each shift. They probably look at one minute of live coverage from each camera every hour."There have been investigative successes, such as the back- tracking that helped Kent police solve the Â£50m Securitas depot robbery. But not all security cameras have made the switch from outdated videotape to more easily accessed digital formats. Only 20% of the UK's cameras keep watch on public spaces; 80% monitor private premises."Officers sitting watching tapes for hours and hours also find it extremely boring," Webb says. Yet a new generation of improvements, adopting sophisticated pattern-analysis techniques, is about to transform the industry. "We are working with car parks on a system that can differentiate between those returning to their vehicles and those 'car surfing' - repeatedly trying door handles and looking through car windows," says Boyce.
