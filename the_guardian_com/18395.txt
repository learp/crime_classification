The home secretary, David Blunkett, today told local authority leaders to work harder to tackle antisocial behaviour in their areas.The government had delivered on its promises for more police officers and needed councils to work with other agencies and fight crime and disorder problems, he told the annual conference of the Local Government Association."A great deal of progress has been made in community safety and it is vital that we build on these achievements by working with partner agencies and the public to provide a service that is fully responsive and accountable to local needs," he said.Local authorities were slow to use antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos) because of the involved process in taking individuals through the courts before an order is issued, and the government made efforts to streamline the system to persuade more councils to use the orders.There has been an improved take-up of the measure, but Mr Blunkett obviously believes there is still some reluctance to get tough on nuisance neighbours and poorly-behaved young people.He also "floated the idea" of asking firms for cash in 22 areas where "business improvement districts" were being piloted, to invest in regeneration, wardens and community safety orders.
