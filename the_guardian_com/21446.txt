A machete-wielding robber terrorised the Chelsea football star Juan Sebastian Veron, his girlfriend and their children during a £60,000 gem raid on their London home, it was claimed yesterday.The 28-year-old Argentinian international and his partner, Maria Vinaccia, were woken at 7.30am on Sunday by an intruder who had climbed in through a window. He was standing over their bed. When one of their two young children wandered into the room, the assailant was said to have threatened to harm them unless their parents handed over cash and jewellery, which they did. He allegedly forced the couple and two other women in the house into a bathroom at knifepoint. They raised the alarm when they heard a car being driven away. There were eight people staying at the house in the affluent Barnes area of south-west London. Officers later arrested a man after a car crashed into railings in nearby Castlenau Road. A 35-year-old man appeared at Richmond magistrates court yesterday charged with aggravated burglary. He was remanded in custody to appear later at Kingston crown court. Veron, who previously played for Lazio in Rome, moved to Chelsea from Manchester United for £15m last August, one of the first purchases by Roman Abramovich, the London club's Russian billionaire owner. The manager, Claudio Ranieri, hailed the £80,000-a-week player as the best midfielder in the world. The raid on his home comes just days after a court in Reading heard how Joe Hemani, Chelsea's millionaire vice-president, and his teenage daughter were attacked during a robbery at their home. Mr Hemani was beaten with crowbars and 13-year-old Francesca was thrown to the ground by a gang who burst into the family's £3m home in Wargrave, Berkshire, in September 2002.
