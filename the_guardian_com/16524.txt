A man has been charged with the murder of a husband and wife who were found dead in their Birmingham home by their son, a serving officer with the West Midlands police force.Avtar Kolar, 62, and his 58-year-old wife, Carole, had been married for 40 years. Their bodies were found at their home, in Handsworth Wood, by their son Jason on 11 January.Rimvydas Liorancas, a 37-year-old Lithuanian national, appeared before Birmingham magistrates court charged with two murders, and was remanded in custody.He spoke, via an interpreter, only to confirm his name and address in the Handsworth area of the city, and is due to appear before Birmingham crown court on 23 January.Police do not believe the killings were linked to the Kolars' son being a serving police officer or the theft of gold, as had previously been speculated.A lump hammer, believed to have been used in the attack, was recovered from the scene of the murders.Detective Chief Superintendent Steve Jupp, of West Midlands police, told a press conference that postmortem examinations had revealed the couple died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head.He said: "The devastating impact of such tragic and senseless death has been far-reaching. The family have been overwhelmed by messages of support from friends, from the local community and much further afield. The investigation into Carole and Avtar's death has been complex and very fast-moving."I would like to say thank you to those who have come forward and given us our information. It is the information given by local people to our officers that is vital, and in this case we have received a number of very important phone calls."A number of items stolen from the property had been recovered, he added."I can confirm that the motive of these murders was not due to the fact that Jason is a serving police officer," he said, also confirming that the crime had nothing to do with the work the West Midlands force undertakes in relation to gangs or the theft of gold.Two other people arrested over the weekend, a 24-year-old man and a man aged 41, have both been released without charge.
