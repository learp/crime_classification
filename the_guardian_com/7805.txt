A former refuse collector today admitted responsibility for killing the twin sisters Claire and Diane Sanderson and an elderly couple.The murders sparked a huge manhunt in Yorkshire after all four bodies were discovered on the same day last year. Lawyers for Mark Hobson, 34, made the admission at a hearing at Teesside crown court. Hobson, of Selby, is charged with killing his girlfriend, Claire Sanderson, 27, her sister, Diane, along with James Britton, 80, and his wife, Joan, 82. He has not yet entered formal pleas. Police arrested Hobson on July 25 after a week-long manhunt involving hundreds of officers, prompted by the discovery of the four bodies at two addresses on July 18. The sisters' bodies were found at Mr Hobson's flat in the village of Camblesforth, near Selby. The bodies of Mr Britton and Mrs Britton were found 25 miles away in Strensall, and police linked the inquiries. Mr Hobson was arrested after being spotted buying matches, water and cigarette papers by a garage owner, Derrick North. Mr North's garage, near the village of Shipton, is just a few miles from Strensall.
