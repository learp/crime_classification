A 39-year-old man was tonight charged with the kidnap and false imprisonment of Shannon Matthews.Michael Donovan will appear before Dewsbury Magistrates tomorrow, charged with snatching the nine-year-old schoolgirl off the street on February 19.The youngster was discovered less than one mile from her home in Dewsbury on Friday afternoon, 24 days after she went missing. Earlier today the chief constable of West Yorkshire police defended his force's investigation into the disappearance of Shannon Matthews after magistrates granted officers an extra 24 hours to question the man arrested on suspicion of abducting her.Norman Bettison paid tribute to the "extraordinary" officers who conducted the 24-day hunt, which saw 6,000 people interviewed at 3,000 houses – most within a mile of the nine-year-old's home in Dewsbury.He singled out detectives Paul Kettlewell and Nick Townsend, who had first gone to Donovan's house last Friday after the "jigsaw pieces came together on Thursday evening"."They knocked on the door and there was no answer," he said. "Given that this was the 700th action they had undertaken since the start of the investigation it's amazing – and a source of pride to me – that they then went to make inquiries of neighbours and they heard for the first time of the pitter patter of a young girl's footsteps."Bettison dismissed people quoted in the press saying they had given police vital evidence in the days running up to the breakthrough as "fantasists". He added that Shannon was now being cared for in the "safest" place for her, while trained interviewers used 10-15 minute slots to elicit evidence about her ordeal.Michael Donovan, the uncle of Shannon's stepfather, was detained when officers broke into his flat in Dewsbury Moor. Donovan and Shannon were found hiding in separate storage drawers under two divan beds in the top floor flat, just a mile from her home.The Times and Sky News said police had rejected claims that the schoolgirl ran away from home or was staying voluntarily in Donovan's flat. Officers also denied reports that anyone else in the community had been hiding knowledge of her whereabouts.The force described a claim by the Yorkshire Conservative MEP, Edward Macmillan-Scott, that immediate use of an "amber alert" to publicise Shannon's disappearance could have solved the case within hours as "totally inaccurate".A spokesman said such alerts applied to child abductions where vehicle details were known or partly known, which was not the case with Shannon. Her mother, 32-year-old Karen Matthews, yesterday appealed for privacy after asking police to issue a statement on her behalf. In it, she said: "I fully understand that the police need to keep speaking to Shannon to establish exactly what has happened during the time that she has been missing."
