Seven people – six men and one woman – have been questioned by police so far and two men, one British and one Polish, are receiving medical treatment after being found by officers.The investigation began after another man was discovered earlier this year 13 years after he went missing.Police have been searching the farm close to the coast between Newport and Cardiff where they believe a body may be buried and said on Wednesday that this part of the operation could continue into the weekend. The operation – codenamed Imperial – has involved more than 150 police officers and staff.Gwent police said the latest suspected victim found was a 60-year-old British man discovered at an address in Newport away from the farm.He was being cared for by Red Cross staff.The three charged men will appear at Cwmbran Magistrates' Court on Thursday.
