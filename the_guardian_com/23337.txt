Detectives are investigating the deaths of eight babies born to a woman in the 1960s and 1970s, it emerged yesterday.The children, all aged under 12 months when they died, were born at various places in Scotland and the north of England. Originally, they were thought to have died from natural causes, but Lothian and Borders police are now examining the deaths, which came to light more than two years ago when the woman told psychiatrists at a Scottish hospital that she had killed the children. It is understood that her doctors told the local health trust, which went to the police with her story. Detectives compiled a report for the procurator fiscal - Scotland's prosecuting body - but it was decided that no action should be taken at that time. However, fresh evidence has emerged and police have been instructed by the procurator fiscal to reopen the case. A small squad, led by a detective superintendent, has been set up to investigate. The woman, who is now 60, is receiving psychiatric treatment at St John's hospital, Livingston, West Lothian. A spokesman for Lothian and Borders police refused to comment on details of the case, but confirmed an investigation was under way. The spokesman said it might be some time, possibly several months, before any additional information could be released.
