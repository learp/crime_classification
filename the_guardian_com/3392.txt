Urgent action is needed to tackle the "huge social problem" of drug-related deaths in police custody, a senior researcher at the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) said today.The call came as the PCA published a new study, based on a survey of 43 such cases from 1997 to 2002. It shows that many of the deaths "may have been prevented" by better medical support and training to help officers identify signs that a suspect has taken drugs.Of the 43 cases looked at, 14 were still under investigation by the PCA. Of the remaining 29, 12 have resulted in disciplinary charges, mostly over "failures in duty", against 27 officers.Dr David Best, the authority's head of research, and senior lecturer on addiction at the Institute of Psychology, told Guardian Unlimited that he was "shocked" by the lack of national guidelines for police forces on dealing with suspected drug dealers and users."It's an issue that is only going to grow in importance," he said. "Drug use is becoming so widespread that up to two-thirds of people detained by police are likely to be on drugs."It is critical that national policies are drawn up to deal with such suspects. We suggest that the ACPO (the association of chief police officers) takes the lead in providing guidance to forces across the country."Dr Best also expressed frustration that previous research on deaths in custody was "not getting through" to rank and file officers, who were more likely to rely on anecdotal evidence or previous experience when dealing with drug-related arrests.He was particularly concerned over the five cases (12%) in which officers had delayed calling for medical support because they assumed the suspect was faking illness. Dr Best said: "The officers may well be right in 99 cases out of 100, but what if they get it wrong and the 100th person dies?"In 17 cases (40%), the report finds "clear evidence" that the victim had died after swallowing a package of drugs in an attempt to hide them. In six cases, evidence suggested that the drugs were taken to attempt "self-harm or suicide".However, Dr Best said that only five of 31 police forces contacted during the survey had a policy on how officers should respond to "drug swallowing".The study, written by Dr Best and his research assistant, Siobhan Havis, concludes: "Many of these deaths may have been prevented by earlier recognition of consumption or drug effects, by more rapid assessing of medical support and by the immediate provision of resuscitation. All of these areas can be improved."It recommends the introduction of new initiatives such as the use of nurses in custody suites, and suggests that suspected package swallowing be treated "as a medical emergency that requires urgent hospitalisation".Police should get more training to be able to identify these risks and to give first aid, including resuscitation, while waiting for emergency medics to arrive.
