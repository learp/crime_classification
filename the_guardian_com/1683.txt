A senior police officer said that the detective who carried out a flawed inquiry into the crimes of serial killer Harold Shipman was at risk of being demonised.Greater Manchester police's assistant chief constable, Vincent Sweeney, was giving evidence yesterday at the Shipman inquiry at Manchester town hall. He called for compassion towards Detective Inspector David Smith, who carried out the original police investigation in March 1998. Shipman went on to murder three more patients - Winifred Mellor and Joan Melia, both 73, and Kathleen Grundy, 81 - before he was arrested after a second police inquiry later the same year. Mr Sweeney said of DI Smith: "This is a man who has suffered an awful lot; who is acutely aware of his role in this and at the end of the day is going to have to live with the results of his actions for the rest of his life. "My concern is there is a danger of a perception from the outside world of an almost demonisation of this officer." He said despite all the detective's faults, he was "worthy of a bit of compassion from us all". The inquiry had previously heard criticism of the detective for his passive attitude when interviewing crucial wit nesses. He had kept scant notes and had failed to determine if Shipman had a criminal record. He admitted being at a loss as to how he should investigate the claims against the doctor. The initial police investigation lasted four weeks before concluding the family doctor had done nothing improper and the case was dropped. Shipman was eventually convicted of murdering 15 elderly women patients and is suspected of killing hundreds of others in Hyde, Greater Manchester. He is serving life at Frankland jail, Durham. The assistant chief constable also apologised to the families who had been affected by Shipman. "Our sympathy and heartfelt apologies go out to anyone who feels that we have let them down in any way." They "cannot undo things which have happened" but such an incident should not happen again.
