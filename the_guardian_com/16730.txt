The double jeopardy rule that for centuries protected those acquitted of an offence from retrial was removed six years ago.Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, those found not guilty of certain serious offences can be ordered to face a second trial if "new and compelling" evidence has emerged. Any retrial since 2005 has had to be approved by the director of public prosecutions, it must be in the public interest, and the appeal court must first quash the previous acquittal.The first time the law was used was in 2006, when William Dunlop, 43, admitted at the Old Bailey that he had strangled 22-year-old Julie Hogg in Teesside in 1989. He had been tried twice for her murder in 1991 but each time a jury failed to reach a verdict and he was formally acquitted under the convention that the prosecution does not ask for a third trial.Commenting on Dunlop's conviction at the time, the then attorney general Lord Goldsmith commented: "It is in the interests of justice, and of the public, for such retrials to take place."The first person to face a murder retrial following the discovery of new forensic evidence was convicted last year. Mark Weston, 35, was originally cleared of battering Vikki Thompson near her home in the Cotswolds village of Ascott-under-Wychwood, Oxfordshire, in 1995. But after the double jeopardy rule was removed in 2005, Weston was found guilty during a second trial at Reading crown court.Abolition of the double jeopardy law will now enable Gary Dobson, 35, who was acquitted of the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1996, to face trial again.
