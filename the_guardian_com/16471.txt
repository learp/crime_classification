A woman who sent and received more than 20 text messages on her mobile phone before she hit and killed another motorist was today jailed for 21 months.Phone records showed that Philippa Curtis, 21, of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was texting before she hit the back of a stationary car at 70mph, killing its driver.She was found guilty of causing the death by dangerous driving of Victoria McBryde, 24, of Horton, Northamptonshire following a trial at Oxford crown court in December.Curtis had been on her way to stay with her boyfriend in Oxford on 20 November 2007, when she collided with McBryde's Peugeot 106 on the A40 near Wheatley.McBryde, who had stopped after a tyre burst, was pronounced dead from a brain injury after her car was forced off the road and crashed into a block of concrete.The court heard that Curtis made the two-hour journey to Oxford after work on a dark evening when the roads were wet.Curtis, who worked in a restaurant, said she had been "hyper" as she set off at 9pm and made various calls as she was driving. She admitted sending more than 20 text messages to a number of friends using predictive text on her flip-top mobile phone.As she arrived in Oxford, she made a quick call to her boyfriend which, she said, did not go through. She then dialled a taxi firm so she could arrange an onward journey from a park-and-ride. But shortly after making the call she collided with McBryde, who was sitting in her car waiting for assistance.Curtis, who suffered an arm injury, veered into oncoming traffic, hitting two more vehicles, a white van and an Asda lorry, the court was told.In court she admitted sending text messages while driving but denied using her mobile at the time of the collision.Giving evidence, the 21-year-old said she had felt there were times when using a phone while driving was acceptable and said she could send and receive messages without taking her eyes off the road.Curtis, who denied the charge of causing death by dangerous driving, said she felt "awful" for causing the death of another young woman."I can't really describe in words how bad I actually feel," she told the court."I just feel awful that I was involved and I can't really imagine how the family must feel."She was disqualified from driving for three years.
