Police were called to deal with violence in schools more than 7,000 times in the last year, according to figures revealed by the Conservatives today.The Tories asked each police force in England how many times it had been called on to school premises for an attempted or actual violent crime.Answers to the Freedom of Information Act request from 25 of 39 forces in England showed 7,311 recorded incidents where officers had been called into schools. But the real number of incidents could be higher because they only relate to recorded crime and 14 police forces either refused to respond or did not do so fully.The number of incidents recorded ranged from 2,698 for the Metropolitan police, covering the biggest population of any force in the country, to the 69 recorded by Lincolnshire police.Michael Gove, the shadow schools secretary, said the number of violent incidents in schools that led to police being called was "very worrying". "Teachers, parents and children are all too aware of the threat of violence in schools and the corrosive effect it has on creating a safe learning environment," he said."There will always be the odd occasion when teachers need to call on the police for support with a serious incident but at the moment they do not have sufficient powers to nip discipline problems in the bud. We want to give teachers more authority to remove disruptive and violent children from the classroom and to tackle problems of bad behaviour before they spiral out of control."A survey this year found that 29% of teachers had been punched, kicked or bitten by pupils, while one in 10 said they had been injured by an aggressive or violent pupil.The Tories argue that headteachers are increasingly having their authority over discipline undermined. They would abolish exclusions appeals panels, which overrule headteachers on expulsions in a quarter of the cases they hear.But school leaders attacked the Tories for "scaremongering" and said abolishing appeals panels would not help. Dr John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: "This is scaremongering. In fact, schools are havens of calm, even when the communities they serve may be riven with conflict and violence. "Police are called to assist more readily than in the past because schools are now working more closely with the police and are more determined than ever to ensure that they are safe places for children."Dunford said abolishing exclusion appeals panels would result in more cases in court, serving the interests of neither the pupil nor the school.Christine Blower, acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said police and school liaison had improved tremendously since the problems with security experienced by schools a decade ago. A minority of pupils' behaviour had become much worse, but schools were still among the safest places for many children.The Department for Children, Schools and Families said: "We have seen no evidence that violent incidents have increased in schools. The overwhelming majority of schools are safe and behaviour is very good."
