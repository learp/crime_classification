Jurors in the trial of celebrity publicist Max Clifford have failed to reach verdicts after a seventh day of deliberations. A panel of six men and four women have been considering 11 counts of indecent assault for about 35 hours at Southwark crown court in London. They will return on Monday to resume deliberations.The jury, which was sent out on Tuesday last week, is down to 10 members after two jurors were discharged. They were given a majority direction on Wednesday, meaning that they can give a verdict if at least nine of them agree.During the seven-week trial, prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC said Clifford, 71, was a "master in the art of intimidation" and used his celebrity connections to "bully and manipulate" girls and young women into sexual acts over nearly 20 years. Clifford, a PR consultant, treated his office as his own "sexual fiefdom" and "playground", taking "what he wanted when he wanted", Cottage said.Clifford, of Hersham, Surrey, told the jury the allegations against him were lies as he accused the alleged victims of being "fantasists and opportunists".The court heard that the alleged offences were said to have taken place between 1966 and 1984 - before Clifford found widespread fame through publicity work that led to The Sun's front page story 'Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster'. 12 when she was assaulted by the publicist while in a jacuzzi in Spain. The alleged incident, said to have happened in 1983, could not be included in the charges as it took place abroad, the jury heard.The court has heard claims that Clifford has a "micro-penis" measuring two and a half inches when erect, while one woman told the court the publicist's penis was "enormous". A doctor measured Clifford's penis at an "average" five and a quarter inches long when flaccid, the jury has been told.
