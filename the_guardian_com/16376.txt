Charges of mistreating and neglecting patients with learning disabilities are to be laid against four health centre staff after a five-year inquiry during which two previous attempts to bring criminal proceedings have failed.Two men and two women will appear before magistrates in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, in August and September accused of the offences between 2005 and 2007 at the Solar Centre in St Catherine's hospital at Balby, Doncaster.They have been named as James Hinds and Susan Murphy, who will face the court on 28 August, and Julie Burge and Michael Barnard, who will appear on 10 September.Two members of staff at the NHS centre were sacked last year during the complex inquiry into claims of a threatening and harassing regime. None of those involved works there now. A blind patient in her 20s with cerebral palsy and epilepsy was said to have punched in the face among other alleged incidents.Compensation was paid to two former patients but two police inquiries failed to produce enough evidence to satisfy the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The original inquiry was reopened after an internal investigation by the Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber mental health NHS foundation trust, and its leader, then acting Detective Chief Inspector, Natalie Shaw, said in September last year: "I can understand how disappointing and frustrating the decision not to prosecute will be for the victims and family members who have been involved."South Yorkshire police have thoroughly completed both investigations into the allegations, and we have utilised all the information, legislation and powers we have available to build a strong case. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, there is still insufficient evidence to meet the requirements to progress to a prosecution."The CPS announced the move after a third review of evidence involving 18 patients. Richard Hebbert, a lawyer in the complex casework unit for CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, said: "I have today authorised South Yorkshire police to commence proceedings for a prosecution against four people relating to the ill-treatment and wilful neglect of patients receiving treatment for mental health disorders at the Solar Centre at St Catherine's hospital, Doncaster."They are James Hinds, with 14 charges, Susan Murphy with 13 charges, Julie Burge with three charges, and Michael Barnard with eight charges. All four were working at the Solar Centre at the time the offences are alleged to have occurred."A full review of all of the evidence in this case has been conducted and I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to prosecute."
