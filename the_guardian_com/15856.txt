The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, yesterday insisted that new powers for parents to check for criminal backgrounds of those who care for their children will not drive convicted sex offenders underground.She said the pilot schemes that are to go ahead in four police force areas will not amount to a community-wide notification of the addresses of convicted sex offenders.The move forms part of the government's violent crime action plan that Smith will detail today, which will see a new police drive against the most serious violent crime and high profile campaigns against knife crime and alcohol-fuelled violence.The drive will include extra cash for police to buy mobile scanning "wands" and "arches" for use outside pubs, clubs, schools and other places where youths are suspected of carrying knives. This will be supplemented by a £1m advertising campaign to persuade young people that carrying a knife does not make them safer, and a new legal presumption that those found with a knife are prosecuted, instead of just cautioned.The go-ahead for the four police pilot schemes giving wider controlled access to the sex offender register comes eight months after John Reid promised the move in response to the campaign by the News of the World for "Sarah's Law" - the public local disclosure of the names and addresses of convicted sex offenders.The first trials will take place in Cambridgeshire, Hampshire, Cleveland and Warwickshire. It is believed that Avon and Somerset police refused to take part in the scheme.Smith said yesterday that it would be done in a "sensible and measured way" and only those who could register a direct interest in the welfare of a child - including a single parent checking on a new boyfriend - would be given the details."If there were any sex offences recorded against the individual in whom they are declaring an interest, there would be a presumption that they would be disclosed to that person," Smith told the BBC's Politics Show yesterday."It is not a community-wide disclosure. It is not something that some have feared would drive sex offenders underground. It is a sensible way to ensure we have more information out there to protect children in the most effective way."She said that parents and carers would be told the details of any criminal background of those who had unsupervised access to their children only under tight conditions, with each request considered by the police and probation officers. It was being done as a contribution to reducing the 90% of sex offences against children which are committed by people known to them.The "controlled experiment" was backed yesterday by Paul Cavadino of the crime reduction charity Nacro, which works with ex-prisoners, who said the government had been right to resist a full system of disclosure: "General public disclosure would have caused offenders to go to ground, making it difficult or impossible for the police and probation service to keep track of them. This would have increased rather than reduced risk to children." The violent crime action plan to be published today will include setting a new target of reducing over the next five years the 19,000 most serious violent offences committed each year, including the number of murders, incidents involving grievous bodily harm and the most serious domestic violence attacks. It will also include a new police drive to reduce the number of deaths by dangerous driving.But the new target will specifically exclude a numerical target to reduce the annual toll of 40,400 attacks involving rape and child sex abuse recorded by the police. Officials believe that the problem of under-reporting of sex offences is so great that a target to reduce the level of police recorded sex offences could prove counter-productive.The action plan will also include further details of the government's campaign to bear down on alcohol-fuelled violent crime and the spread of knife culture in the inner cities.At a glanceThe violent crime reduction plan· New target to cut most serious violent crime· New funding for weapons scanners for pubs and schools· Prosecution instead of caution for those found in possession of a knife· Advertising campaign on dangers of carrying knives· Limited parental access to sex offenders' register· Action to tackle link between alcohol and violence· New moves against drivers who kill while driving dangerously
