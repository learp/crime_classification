The UK has the largest national DNA database of any country in the world. A report by the Lords Constitution Committee found that 7.39% of the British population has a profile on the national DNA database, compared to 1% of Austrians and 0.5% of Americans.What is perhaps more disturbing is that the records include over a million profiles taken when the donor was under 18 - and still kept. This data, published in Hansard, breaks it down by police force and gender:DATA: Under-18s DNA profiles stored on the national databaseâ€¢ Can you do something with this data?
