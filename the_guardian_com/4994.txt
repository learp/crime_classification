The family of Jean Charles de Menezes expressed outrage last night after the officer in command of the firearms team that shot the Brazilian dead last year was promoted to one of the highest ranks in the British police service.Cressida Dick was yesterday promoted from commander to deputy assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan police. On the day in July 2005 when De Menezes was shot dead at a south London underground station after being mistaken for a terrorist, Ms Dick was in charge of deciding whether a shoot-to-kill policy should be adopted by officers.Last night De Menezes's family criticised the promotion as "a travesty" as it comes before any final decision on whether Ms Dick should face disciplinary charges.Asad Rehman, from the Jean Charles de Menezes Family Campaign, condemned the promotion of Ms Dick: "It's wrong to promote her before the health and safety prosecution and before the inquest and before any decision over disciplinary action."All of the evidence about how she came to her decision that day is still being kept secret from us."Nothing surprises us any more in regards to this case. It's been a litany of travesties and injustices ... and the latest news means a bill of clean health has been given to a senior officer before the conclusion of any investigation."An independent investigation found the order that Ms Dick gave had been unclear and misinterpreted by officers who shot the innocent Brazilian in the head. But the Crown Prosecution Service decided neither she nor any other officers should face criminal prosecution over the death.The decision to promote her was made by the Metropolitan Police Authority after interviews before a board that included the Met commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, who supported Ms Dick's advancement.The Independent Police Complaints Commission found that firearms officers thought she had cleared them to shoot De Menezes dead. In fact, she told investigators, she had intended that he be arrested outside Stockwell tube station. The Met is still facing a health and safety prosecution over the killing of De Menezes.One of two reports into the case by the IPCC, which examines whether the force told the truth after the killing, is expected to be published at the end of October. During the year it took the IPCC to investigate, Ms Dick is said to have impressed her bosses with the way she coped with the pressure.Ms Dick and Sir Ian first worked together in the Thames Valley force, and the commissioner is a fan of her abilities. Both are graduates from Oxford University and believe in police modernisation.
