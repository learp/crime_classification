Magistrates will only be able to serve for a maximum of 10 years on the bench as part of a package of measures justice ministers are considering to boost diversity among the judiciary.The criminal justice minister, Damian Green, said he was attracted to the introduction of a 10-year "tenure" for magistrates as a way of broadening their social background beyond older, middle class people."I would like the magistracy to be younger and more diverse, particularly in terms of more varied experience," Green told a Policy Exchange thinktank seminar in London.Green said he was also keen to look at introducing weekend and evening working for magistrates and to sweep away the minimum sitting requirement of 26 half days a year. He said the changes could encourage more applicants who work or study full time or have childcare responsibilities to sit as magistrates.Green also wants to strengthen the selection criteria for new magistrates to emphasise the importance of candidates' ability to demonstrate "a well-rounded knowledge and understanding of the social issues affecting the area in which they are applying to serve".The government is to publish a white paper in the summer on the future of the 30,000-strong magistracy in England and Wales. In 2010 only 145 were under the age of 30 despite the fact that new magistrates can be appointed from the age of 18. About 1,500 new magistrates are appointed each year and face a retirement age of 70.Green said that half of all the serving magistrates will have retired within the next 10 years: "We know that crime is falling, and workloads in magistrates courts are falling as well. So we need to do some careful thinking about how we will manage the decline in numbers and how we ensure that, when we need to recruit more magistrates, we attract the right number of people from a diverse range of backgrounds with the right experience and skills to continue to serve local communities well."Ministers also want to see magistrates extend their role outside the courtroom by taking new responsibilities such as scrutinising on-the-spot penalties imposed by the police, serving on neighbourhood justice panels and supervising and reviewing the sentences handed out to adult offenders.Green also confirmed that the new Offender Rehabilitation Act 2014 will give magistrates new powers to impose a prison sentence of up to 14 days on offenders who fail to comply with their community supervision conditions.
