Twin brothers who admitted raising money in England to fund terrorism abroad have been jailed for three years.Mohammed Shabir Ali and Mohammed Shafiq Ali, a Transport for London employee, were part of a "network of support" for their brother while he was undergoing terrorist training in Somalia, the Old Bailey heard.The 25-year-old identical twins from Tower Hamlets, east London, were recorded speaking on the phone to their brother, Mohammed Shamim Ali, about collecting the money from members of the public by pretending it was for charity, said Timothy Cray, prosecuting.Sentencing the two men on Wednesday, Mr Justice Fulford said he recognised that their primary concern was providing financial help to their 29-year-old brother.But he added that this support was for someone involved in "terrorist activities in war-torn countries of Africa".The judge said: "The courts must reflect the seriousness of offences of this kind in the sentences that are handed down, given that they were intended to support terrorism."The twins plotted to con people into donating cash by saying it was for Muslim Aid and the "Palestinian cause", Cray said.While police say they will never know the exact amount of money they sent over, the twins admitted the charge on the basis it was £3,000, sent to Somalia between August 2008 and June last year.Fulford told the court: "The financial assistance took place at a time when both defendants suspected that their older brother was involved in terrorist training activities in Somalia."It is accepted by the prosecution that they sent funds primarily out of concern for their brother's physical and mental health, although it is important to note this was in the context of his planned involvement in terrorism."He added: "It is clear that they knew that their brother needed financial assistance and why."Shabir Ali, who has studied for an NVQ and wanted to work in education, was arrested at their home, and Shafiq Ali at a business address in west London, in April.They were originally charged with assisting another to commit acts of terrorism or in preparation for acts of terrorism, as well as having a document – 44 Ways To Support Jihad – that could be of use in terrorism.Their guilty plea to the charge of raising money to fund terrorism was accepted instead at the Old Bailey on Tuesday, with the original offences lying on file.Evidence showed that the men had read the pamphlet, which contained sections on how to raise money for terrorism abroad, Cray said.The judge told the court, where the men's wives watched from the public gallery, that he accepted that if their brother had not travelled to Somalia, they would not have committed any offence.He said: "They are not suggested to have held anything like the most extreme leanings or views. They nonetheless did have a degree of what I am going to describe as relevant ideological interest at the time of this offence."He said that in passing his sentence he took into account that the men were of previous good character and had shown a "strong element of responsibility" by giving evidence at a murder trial earlier this year. Their evidence had been a "significant" factor in the conviction of four men, he added.
