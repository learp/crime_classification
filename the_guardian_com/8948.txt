The Metropolitan police will be investigated over whether they could have thwarted trouble at a funeral in south London that led to the death of an innocent bystander.Azezur Khan, 21, died after shooting which was linked to tension between two gangs broke out at a funeral in East Dulwich last Thursday.It has emerged that the mother of the teenager whose funeral was scarred by the violence had contacted the police asking them to send officers because she feared trouble, but none were sent. The Met has voluntarily referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.The shooting happened at the funeral of Joel "Jozey" Morgan, 17, at Camberwell Old Cemetery, after he was killed in a car crash. Police said Morgan had "contact with gang members".Khan is described by police as having nothing to do with gangs, and died from a bullet that struck him in the abdomen. Another 17-year-old was shot in the ankle.Carlene Brooks, the mother of Morgan, said she had feared trouble at her son's funeral and had asked for police to attend.Speaking last week she said officers attended the church service and the wake, but not the funeral service where the trouble broke out.She told The Daily Mail: "Now I'm not only burying my son, but to hear another boy has died is devastating. I can't believe another family now has to go through what I'm going through."Detective Superintendent Gordon Allison of Trident last week indicated that police had some sort of warning that there could be trouble at the funeral.Speaking after the death of Khan, Allison said: "From our point of view we were obviously aware that the funeral was taking place and contingencies were in place to manage anything that might have come out of that," he said.In a statement, the IPCC commissioner, Sarah Green said: "Following the tragic death of Azezur (Ronnie) Khan, who was shot and killed while attending a funeral in Forest Hill Road, South London, on 3 November 2011, the Metropolitan police referred the matter to the IPCC."We have decided to conduct an independent investigation into the information held and actions taken by the police prior to the incident."Two 17-year-old girls and two 20-year-old men were arrested over the incident and were bailed to late November.Police say the funeral was attended by at least 50 people, including the two shooting victims. They have appealed for witnesses to come forward.Acting Detective Chief Inspector Brian Lucas said: "Ronnie died in the street as a result of his injuries and his family have suffered a devastating loss."There does not appear to be any reason as to why Ronnie would have been shot and it appears he was just an innocent bystander."These criminals shot at innocent people in the street."It is vital that we find out who they are and stop them from causing further harm to innocent people and to our communities."
