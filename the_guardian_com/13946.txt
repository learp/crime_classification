New guidance aimed at increasing the conviction rates of rapists and improving care for their victims was launched by the Home Office today.The advice for doctors and nurses sets out how forensic evidence of a sexual assault, such as urine samples and clothing, should be collected and stored when a victim is treated in casualty.This evidence is a vital component in the trial and conviction of rapists, but can be lost if those dealing with victims are unaware of its importance.The guidance, developed by King's College hospital in London and the Metropolitan police, is intended to iron out regional variations in the standard of care and collection of evidence of sexual assaults.Figures suggest that around one in 11 victims first seeks help in hospital accident and emergency departments, but many healthcare staff do not know how to preserve evidence of their ordeal.Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart said the guidance would help to ensure that sexual assault victims receive better care.She added: "It will also raise standards in forensic evidence, so that more cases can be prosecuted and more criminals brought to justice."Dr Jan Welch, clinical director at sexual assault support centre Haven, in Camberwell, south London, said current guidelines for healthcare professionals about sexual assault were "generally outdated and lack specific advice".She said: "If we can improve the service we offer, it could encourage complainants of sexual assault to seek help and provide forensic evidence more readily."
