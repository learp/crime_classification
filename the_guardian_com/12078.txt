Today's ruling from the House of Lords in the case of the "lottery rapist" will open the way for thousands of victims of sex abuse to claim compensation from their attackers or the schools or other institutions their assailants worked for at the time.In a rare move, the law lords overturned one of their own rulings, delivered in 1993, which barred victims of deliberate assaults from suing more than six years after the assault or, in the case of child victims, more than six years after reaching 18.Many rapists and abusers will not have the assets to make them worth suing but the courts ruled in 2002 that employers, such as local education authorities, could be vicariously liable for abuse inflicted by teachers and other employees in the course of their work.After that, Lord Hoffmann said in his judgment today, claims came "thick and fast", but those who delayed bringing their claims were barred.They could succeed only if they could surmount the difficult hurdle of proving that the school or local education authority was negligent. There is a three-year time limit for negligence claims, but the courts have discretion to extend it.The "illogical and surprising" result - as one judge put it - included a case of a woman who sued her father for abusing her 10 years before and her mother for failing to protect her. The claim against the father was struck out while the negligence action against her mother was allowed to go ahead.Now the law lords have ruled that the courts can extend the six-year limit in deliberate assault cases, a move the Law Commission recommended in 2001.As the law lord Baroness Hale said today in her judgment: "These perpetrators have many ways, some subtle and some not so subtle, of making their victims keep quiet about what they have suffered. The abuse itself is the reason why so many victims do not come forward until years after the event."Now the law has removed that protection from abusers.
