N-Dubz rapper Dappy broke down in tears and shouted "Yes" when he avoided a prison term on Friday.The singer was given a six-month sentence suspended for 18 months at Guildford crown court for assault and affray and ordered to do 150 hours of community service. He was also ordered to pay £4,500 compensation and £2,000 in costs.The 25-year-old had faced a maximum sentence of three years in jail after being convicted in connection with a brawl at a petrol station in Guildford.The court heard during a nine-day trial last month that the pop star became angry after two 19-year-old women refused to get into his car to go to a party at his recording studios, sparking a fight which led to three men being injured.The trial was told that Dappy, charged under his real name of Costadinos Contostavlos, was out with friends on 27 February last year celebrating the release of his single Rockstar.After spending the night in the VIP area of the Casino nightclub in Guildford drinking sambuca shots and Jack Daniels, the group headed back in three cars to the recording studios in Godalming, where Dappy was recording his debut solo album.The group stopped at the Shell garage in Woodbridge Road, Guildford, at about 3.30am on 28 February where the violence erupted.Brian Stork, prosecuting, said Dappy approached the two 19-year-olds, Grace Cochran and Serena Burton, sitting on the pavement outside the station shop and tried to persuade them to get into the car with him.When they refused his advances and began to ridicule him by calling him "boring", Dappy became angry and called them "sluts".He told the court: "They had shown me disrespect, a lot."Dappy denied swearing and spitting at them and was found not guilty of two charges of common assault in relation to spitting.Stork said a man called David Jenkins, who had been talking to the two women, stepped in to protect them but was spat at by Dappy. The spitting made up the assault charge which Dappy was convicted of.Jenkins put Dappy in a headlock, leading to several other people joining in the fight, including co-defendants Kieran Vassell and Alfred Miller.Jenkins suffered several broken teeth in the fight while another man, Oliver Billson, got a swollen eye and a third, Christopher Gibson, had his nose broken.Dappy denied attempting to pick up the two women and told the court that he only spoke to them to promote his single.He denied spitting at them and at Jenkins and said he simply acted in self-defence to get out of the headlock.Vassell, 25, of Hammersmith, west London, denied affray and said he only acted to protect Dappy. He was found guilty of affray and was jailed for 14 months, ordered to pay £1,500 compensation and £500 costs.Judge Stewart said his actions were so serious that they could only be punished by a prison sentence.Miller, 28, a songwriter, of Brentford, west London, pleaded guilty to affray and was sentenced to 19 months in jail and ordered to pay £4,500 compensation and £1,000 costs.Dappy's defence said Cochran and Burton were "unreliable witnesses" as they had sent Twitter and BlackBerry (BBM) messages saying they intended to sell their stories to the national newspapers.Burton also sent a message saying that she could not remember what happened and that she would "bullshit" when she gave evidence.The court was told that Dappy had previous convictions for assault and possessing a bladed weapon.In November 2005, he was given a community order for possessing a bladed weapon in a public place.In September 2007, he was given 40 hours of community service for battery when he pushed a taxi driver following an argument in Camden, north London.And in December 2008, he was given a four-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months and ordered to pay compensation for two battery offences which related to him spitting at two women.Paul Greaney, defending, said Dappy had shown remorse by intervening on Twitter when the two female witnesses received "extremely unpleasant" messages from some of his supporters.Judge Neil Stewart told Dappy that although the offences he committed were serious enough to attract a custodial sentence, he would suspend it because of his remorse at his actions.He said: "The report I have on you suggests you do not present overtly criminal attitudes and this offence has been a wake-up call for you."He added: "Your culpability in the affray was considerably less than that of your co-defendants."The sentence I have decided on is not affected by any consideration of whether a person is well-known to the public."
