A local authority has become the first to make a stand against nuisance Halloween trick or treaters by banning youngsters from buying eggs or flour in local supermarkets.The decision by Stockton-on-Tees council, taken on the grounds of clamping down on anti-social behaviour, comes 10-days after supermarket chain Asda announced none of its stores would sell eggs to under 18s in the run up to the October 31celebrations. The council announced today it has joined forces with six local supermarket chains, including Sainsbury's, Tesco and Safeway, who have all signed up to the voluntary ban not to sell flour or eggs to anybody under the age of 16 for 10 days starting tomorrow.The Teesside authority said it hoped the move would result in a reduction in anti-social behaviour, in particular youngsters who hurl missiles at houses during Halloween and bonfire night celebrations.The council's cabinet minister for housing and community safety, Martyn Ingram, said: "A minority of youngsters get amusement from hurling missiles at homes during the Halloween and bonfire night period, and this can cause misery and fear among many people, especially the elderly and those living alone. "By working together with local stores across the town we hope to deter those throwing missiles, often eggs and flour, and minimise the damage."Under 16s living in the district will also be unable to buy firelighters and matches until after November 6 in an attempt to improve safety in the run up to bonfire night. The Local Government Association and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health today said they were unaware of any other local authority which had introduced any kind of sales ban to young people during the Halloween and bonfire night period.The CIEH said: "A ban such as this isn't really an environmental health issue because it's nothing to do with health and safety or food safety. But there is a lot going on at the moment in local councils regarding anti-social behaviour."A spokesman for the Local Authorities Co-ordinator of Regulatory Services said: "Local authorities don't have any statutory power to ban these kind of sales, but they can take action against people who commit anti-social offences. That is as far as they can go."
