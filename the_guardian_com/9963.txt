A police constable caught on amateur video as he kicked and punched a young man in the street faces jail after a judge rejected his denials and convicted him of common assault.Keith Empsall, 42, was told that his claims of being calm and in control as he made the arrest did not stand up to the evidence of a neighbour's film. Empsall shook his head in denial as District Judge Christopher Darnton, sitting at Leeds magistrates court, passed the verdict. The officer, who has served for 24 years with West Yorkshire police, was given bail. He is expected to appeal against the conviction, which followed three days of evidence including the film and a witness account from its maker, student Mark Goodwin. Goodwin, 22, told the court he videoed the incident in a Wakefield street after his girlfriend heard shouting. The man being arrested was Christopher Wilson, 27. The judge, who will pass sentence in four weeks after studying reports, told Empsall: "I have to consider an immediate sentence in custody. You must be prepared to face that." He said he had reached his verdict after three careful viewings of the film, which showed no sign of tampering or editing. "I do not believe the force used was reasonable," he said. "There was definitely a kick-out, followed by three distinct blows to the face of a man moving backwards, clearly not demonstrating any signs of fighting back."
