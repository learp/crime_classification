The prime minister, Tony Blair, today promised fresh legislation to tackle antisocial behaviour if the rolling out of a series of new initiatives at the beginning of next year fails to bring an improvement.Shortly after the home secretary, David Blunkett, revealed plans to tackle begging, nuisance neighbours and abandoned cars, Mr Blair said that fixed penalty notices for drunkeness and motoring offences were to be extended nationwide."It's not acceptable for these powers to be used in some parts of the country and not others. Loutish behaviour is loutish behaviour wherever it is. And it should be dealt with in the same way wherever it happens," he told an anti-social behaviour symposium in London."So if, even after this legislation, more powers are needed, we will go further and get you them."The meeting had previously heard Mr Blunkett denounce "garbage from the 60s and 70s" as he outlined how neighbours who spoil the lives of other people in their communities could be relocated, sent to parenting classes or issued with fixed penalty notices."There is no point in this garbage from the '60s and '70s about being non-judgmental. You can't be non-judgmental when you are living next door to the family from hell," he told the meeting.Nuisance families will be targeted in four pilot areas - Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield and Sunderland - which will aim to draw up the best techniques for tackling them.Beggars in Brighton, Bristol, Leeds, Westminster and Camden, north London, will similarly be targeted, and the Home Office will set up "trailblazer" projects to tackle abandoned vehicles in London and Liverpool.A national database will be set up to identify graffiti writers by their tag - the nickname or pseudonym they use - and 12 areas in England and Wales will pilot new powers in the antisocial behaviour bill. Currently before parliament, it will force the owners of telephone boxes and other street furniture to clear up graffiti.Mr Blunkett said council workers and others who fail to take on antisocial behaviour should face the consequences. "I have got a message for those right across the country who think they are big enough to take on not me but the communities they serve."The prime minister's speech touched less on specific policy than individual responsibility and concepts of respect for all but set out a vision of strong communities empowered by criminal justice legislation.He said his experiences of living in "inner-city" London before he relocated to Downing Street had sharpened his awareness of the impact that antisocial behaviour had on communities and it had now got the to point where the government had to act."I have made many visits over the last year up and down the country, and on each occasion antisocial behaviour has been the issue raised by people."I listen to their stories. The same things come up time and again. A tiny number of people on an estate of hundreds making people's lives a misery: shouted insults in the street, graffiti daubed on the front door, fireworks used as weapons, abandoned cars left in the streets.""Only by rebuilding cohesive communities and reforming the system to bear down harder on antisocial behaviour can we achieve our vision of a strong and fair society. That is why reforms to restore civic responsibility are not a threat to social justice, but essential for its realisation in a modern society."Mr Blair urged police and local councils to make greater use of their powers to curb antisocial behaviour and, at one point, urged shopkeepers to voluntarily implement regulations yet to come into force on firework sales."I want to make one very simple point in this speech. To the police, housing officers, local authorities - we've listened, we've given you the powers, and it's time to use them."
