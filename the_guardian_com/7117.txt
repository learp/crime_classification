A pensioner who staged a bank robbery because he wanted to return to jail had his wish granted yesterday. Robert Newnham, 74, was sentenced to five years for robbing the Halifax bank in Dorchester of £940.He launched the raid on April 16, just 18 days after release from a five-year term for robbery. Nigel Mitchell, prosecuting, told Dorchester crown court that his hand strayed into his pocket and he said: "I have a gun and I need £1,000 urgently and I'm willing to do whatever it takes." Newnham, who did not actually have a weapon, had contemplated a more minor offence but that would probably not have put him back in jail. David Campbell, defending, said Newnham had struggled with alcoholism after release from jail, and had become institutionalised.He earlier pleaded guilty to robbery. Recorder Andrew Langdon QC told him: "This was far from being a well-planned robbery. You were, as so often, drunk. You were easily arrested because you tried to leave in a taxi."The court heard Newnham had been offending for 36 years.
