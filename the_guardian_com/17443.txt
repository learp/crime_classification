A man who murdered his malnourished baby daughter by placing her over his knee and snapping her spine in two following months of abuse was jailed for life yesterday with a minimum tariff of 22 years.James Howson, 25, had denied murdering his 16-month-old daughter Amy at the family home in Edlington, Doncaster, last December.He had admitted a charge of child cruelty by not seeking medical attention earlier, but was convicted of murder earlier this week at Leeds crown court.He said his partner Tina Hunt, 26, who was given a 12-month suspended sentence after she admitted child cruelty, may have been responsible for the baby's injuries.Sentencing Howson, Mrs Justice Cox said: "This was, in my view, a chilling and brutal attack. The bone was completely dislocated, resulting in spinal shock, rapid unconsciousness - mercifully - and to death." The judge said she had not seen the slightest evidence of remorse and Howson showed no emotion as he was led away from the dock.When arrested Howson told officers the child had fallen out of bed the previous night and banged her head. But the prosecution said the child's injuries indicated she must have been in extreme pain for weeks prior to death. The court was told how Howson had been violent towards women but had no previous convictions.Adrian Waterman QC, defending, told the court that when Howson was expelled from school a teacher noted in a report: "This boy will commit a murder before too long. I've never seen a such a disturbed young man." Outside court yesterday Detective Superintendent Carl Sturgess, who led the investigation, said: "The catalogue of horrific injuries have been some of the worst I have seen in 30 years of policing."
