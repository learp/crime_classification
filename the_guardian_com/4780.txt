A conman who built his career posing as a forensic expert to dupe victims out of thousands of pounds was jailed for five years yesterday, as police began the task of re-investigating 700 cases in which he was involved.Gene Morrison, 48, of Hyde, Cheshire, bluffed and lied his way through hundreds of trials, for almost three decades, fooling judges, barristers, solicitors and their clients into believing he was qualified.He left school with no qualifications but gave evidence in cases involving armed robbery, rape, death by dangerous driving, unexplained death, drugs offences and questioned paternity. His methods, relying heavily on using bone fide experts and then charging clients double, were unorthodox and unprofessional. He had told one grieving couple that the unexplained death of their son was suicide and charged them Â£16,500 for work they had never commissioned.Yesterday, the trial judge described Morrison as an "inveterate and compulsive liar" whose activities struck at the heart of the legal process.Sentencing him, Judge Jeffrey Lewis said: "You yourself had no expertise worth speaking of. Your business was built on a whole series of lies. You did not care about the truth, you were wholly dishonest, you did not care of the consequences of your actions to the administration of justice."Greater Manchester police based their evidence against him on nine of the most serious cases where he posed as a forensic investigator. Police are having to reasses 700 cases; identified miscarriages of justice will be sent to the attorney general.After a month-long trial at Minshull Street crown court, in Manchester, Morrison, who was born in Jamaica, was convicted of 22 offences between 2002 and 2005, including obtaining a money transfer by deception, obtaining property by deception, perverting the course of justice and perjury. He was cleared of one count of obtaining a money transfer by deception.Martin Bottomley, a detective superintendent, said Morrison was a "Walter Mitty character" whose entire working life was based on lies and deceit. "Morrison has shamelessly fleeced innocent victims, including a grieving family."Barry Power, 59, from Manchester, who used Morrison to try to find out how his son, also Barry, 29, died, said: "He has made a pressurised difficult time even worse for our family and I am pleased he is going to be made to pay for what he has done to us and others like us."
