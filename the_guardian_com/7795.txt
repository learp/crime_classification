The hidden truth of the failed attempt by "Slipper of the Yard" to bring the escaped great train robber Ronnie Biggs back from Brazil is revealed in Foreign Office files released by the National Archives today.The two files released after last month's death of Detective Chief Superintendent "Jack" Slipper show that, according to the Foreign Office, the 1974 attempt ended in disaster because the "flying squad's crime-fighting legend" got his wires crossed.Some of last month's obituaries said the failure of Slipper's attempt to arrest Biggs in Rio de Janeiro (after a tip-off from the Daily Express, which had tracked down the escaped Great Train Robber) was due to dithering by Brazilian officials.Slipper's encounter with Biggs in room 909 of the Hotel Tropicana, Copacabana, in February 1974 has been described as the criminal world's equivalent of Stanley meeting Dr Livingstone. Slipper was quick to take umbrage at anyone who suggested that he was to blame for returning to London without Biggs, and in 1990 he won £50,000 libel damages from the BBC in an action financed by Sir James Goldsmith.But the Foreign Office file makes plain that British diplomats in Brazil thought Slipper was at fault, with the ambassador insisting that only a "categorical assurance" that the Scotland Yard detective would not be involved in any further attempts would provide any hope of getting Biggs back to London.The Foreign Office files containing more than 200 pages of reports and telegrams between Rio, Brasilia and London show that:·Slipper did not tell the Home Office, the Foreign Office, or Brazilian authorities why he was going to Brazil, to stop the Daily Express scoop "leaking" out;· He only contacted the British authorities in Brazil four hours before his attempt to arrest Biggs because "he was having difficulty in being understood because no one at the [local Copacabana] police station spoke English";· Had he had gone through informal Interpol channels Biggs could have been handed over to Scotland Yard "within a short period without little or any publicity", avoiding complex extradition attempts;· Sir Robert Mark, the Metropolitan police commissioner, had to give the Brazilian authorities a personal apology which blamed the need to prevent any leak of the Daily Express's story for the extraordinary security precautions. Every effort was made to stop the news of the apology getting out to the press;· The Brazilians offered to hand over Biggs in exchange for Timothy Ross, who they said was a terrorist who had returned to Britain;· The Biggs affair was so embarrassing, coming in the middle of the knife-edge February 1974 general elections, that a summary of the case was prepared for the Queen.Biggs had been sentenced to 30 years for his part in the £2.5m Great Train Robbery in 1963 and had gone over the wall of Wandsworth prison two years later, before making his way to Brazil via Australia and Venezuela. Britain had no extradition treaty with Brazil.Scotland Yard's failure to capture Biggs had been extensively, and gleefully, reported in the press around the world and when the Daily Express tipped Slipper off that he was in Rio the arrangements for the journey were made "in a secrecy and in a great hurry."Scotland Yard's only contact with the Home Office at this stage was to ask for financial approval for the journey and to ask what the extradition arrangements were with Brazil," reported JS Dixon of the Foreign Office in London."They obtained financial approval although it was not clear whether the exact purpose of the journey was made plain. The other part of the Home Office replied that there were no extradition arrangements."They were not told for what purpose the information was required. Arrangements were made in great secrecy and a great hurry. They seem to have had no clear instructions or idea what to do when they reached Rio."Henry Neill, Britain's consul in Rio, said Slipper had first contacted his office at 8am on February 1 1974 - four hours before he knocked on Biggs's hotel door."He said he was there to collect a person he did not wish to name (as any publicity might warn the man and he might escape) and take him back to the UK. He said he was having difficulty in being understood as no one at the police station spoke English."Slipper hoped that a signed statement by Biggs saying he was willing to go back to Britain would be enough to satisfy the Brazilian authorities, but Neill pointed out that Biggs was in the country illegally:"I had to adamantly insist that any question of the repatriation of a British criminal from Brazil must be a matter for the federal police authorities of Brazil to decide."The British diplomats were told by Inspector Garcia of the federal force that it had seen the Interpol circular put out several weeks before by Scotland Yard: "It is, I am told, the drill that if the criminal Biggs had been arrested by the Interpol officers here he would have been automatically handed over to the Interpol officers of New Scotland Yard within a short period without little or any publicity," Neill told the Foreign Office in London."It would appear therefore that Scotland Yard got its wires crossed with disastrous results as the news is that Biggs is being held because the proper Interpol arrangements were broken by Scotland Yard."In London the Foreign Office Latin American department noted: "Scotland Yard now realise that they were wrong to take it upon themselves to send their officers to Rio de Janeiro without first informing and consulting the appropriate departments in Whitehall."Their reason for not doing so was that they had been given a lead on Biggs' whereabouts by the Daily Express and were under pressure from the latter to act quickly so that the story could be printed. They were reluctant to contact the Brazilian police before arriving in Rio because they feared they might get word of their approach and elude them."The Brazilians considered deporting Biggs and London contacted practically every surrounding Latin American country "to put a net around Biggs when and if he left Brazil" because he "is a slippery customer with many criminal friends".In the event Biggs, now a father of a Brazilian child, successfully fought the deportation attempt.Derek Dodson, the British ambassador to Brazil, even made clear that the only hope of getting the Brazilians to send Biggs back was to give them a categorical assurance of a secret deal and that "supt Slipper would not be" one of the arresting officers. Scotland Yard refused to accept this smear on the reputation of a man they regarded as a legendary crime fighter.BackstoryRonnie Biggs, 76, evaded Slipper and Scotland Yard for more than 30 years. Originally sentenced to 30 years for his part in the robbery of a Glasgow to London mail train on August 8 1963, he escaped from Wandsworth prison and eventually settled in Brazil. When Slipper caught up with him in 1974 he avoided extradition by saying he had fathered a son by his Brazilian girlfriend and was divorcing his wife
