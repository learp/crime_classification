A bed and breakfast owner who amassed a bizarre collection of women's underwear and sex aids during five years of petty thieving on the Isles of Scilly was exiled to the mainland yesterday for seven years.Andrew Stephan, who exploited the islanders' habit of leaving properties unlocked, will not be allowed to return, even for holidays or to visit his estranged wife and two young children, until August 2012.The ban, covering 140 islets as well as the five main inhabited islands, was imposed by Truro crown court as a more effective penalty than a fine or jail. Judge Paul Darlow told 42-year-old Stephan, who expressed "deep shame", that he had "badly shaken the islanders' trust".The court heard that the thefts of 160 pairs of knickers had gone undetected during the five years Stephan preyed on washing lines and bedrooms, mostly on the main island of St Mary's, where he also worked as a builder. He was caught after his marriage broke down in late 2003 and he had moved out of the five-bedroom bungalow that he and his wife, Sonia, ran as a B&amp;B.The hot water in the house failed shortly afterwards. When Mrs Stephan's new partner, James Vickers-Fletcher, unscrewed floorboards in the loft, he was startled to find three bags of knickers stuffed beside the plumbing. During the next few days he lifted other sections and found more underwear, sex toys and intimate photographs."Every time I went through a hatch, I seemed to find more stuff," he told the court, which heard how further caches were discovered in the garden shed, where one set of lingerie was entangled with diving equipment left behind by Stephan.News of the find spread rapidly in the small community of some 2,200 islanders, 1,670 of whom live on St Mary's, and women went to the police station to identify their clothes and other items.Stephan pleaded guilty last month to 10 counts of theft after earlier contesting the charges in proceedings which saw 11 women flown from Scilly to give evidence, at a cost of £5,000. He was also sentenced to 1,500 hours of community service, ordered to pay £1,000 in legal costs, and banned from entering any house in England and Wales without an invitation.Barrie van den Berg, prosecuting, said Stephan had told police he had gone thieving for sexual reasons."He told them that he was trying to get help for it and knew he needed help."Llewellyn Sellick, in mitigation, said Stephan had no previous convictions and the punishment was effectively "banishment from his home" on the islands where his 10-year-old daughter and four-year-old son live with their mother.Judge Darlow told Stephan the Isles of Scilly had a trusting atmosphere that allowed people to be relaxed about locks. "That is a trust that does not exist, unfortunately, here on the mainland, and one that must have been badly shaken by your activities."
