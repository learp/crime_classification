An inquiry by the Royal Ulster Constabulary into a sectarian murder was "appalling and unprofessional" and had "serious and unexplained failures", a report by the province's police ombudsman said yesterday.Detectives had made no real effort to track down the killers, the report added. The family of Sean Brown, 61, who was shot dead by the Loyalist Volunteer Force in May 1997, had asked the ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan, to investigate the case. Her report delivered a damning assessment of the inquiry. The renamed and reformed Police Service of Northern Ireland will now reopen the case with a new team of detectives.Brown was abducted by the LVF as he locked up his local Gaelic sports club at Bellaghy, Co Londonderry. He was shot six times, and his body was found near his burnt-out car. The report included a string of inadequacies: a failure to identify and deal with forensic evidence; no proper search for witnesses; no attempt to trace motorists; a failure by Special Branch to pass on intelligence reports; missing records; and the history of the murder weapon not being properly investigated. However, the report found there had been no collusion between the murderers and the security forces, as alleged in other killings. David Woods, formerly the executive director of investigations for the ombudsman, said: "This was a catalogue of incompetence and failures. There were very serious and inexplicable failures. It was very bad police work. This was an appalling investigation."
