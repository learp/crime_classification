The family doctor accused of murdering 15 patients killed one of his alleged victims while she was in bed suffering from a cold, Preston crown court heard yesterday.Irene Turner, 67, had asked Harold Shipman to visit her at home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, as she was unwell.Mrs Turner's son-in-law, Michael Woodruff, told the jury that he was summoned to her house after his mother-in-law was found dead by a neighbour. Mr Woodruff said : "Dr Shipman said that due to the number of tablets that she was on, he would not need a post mortem and that he would be able to issue a death certificate the next day." Shipman was "cold" when he said that Mrs Turner had not wanted to go into hospital as he had recommended. Mr Woodruff said his mother-in-law had been "as bright as a button" on the day of her death in July 1996. She had recovered from breast cancer and was taking tablets for diabetes. Mrs Turner's neighbour Sheila Ward told the jury that Shipman had asked her to pack a bag for her neighbour as she would be going to hospital. He asked her to return in five minutes, but did not offer any explanation for the delay. When Mrs Ward returned to her house, the doctor had gone and Mrs Turner was dead. The prosecution claims that Shipman administered a lethal dose of morphine to Mrs Turner. Shipman, 53, of Mottram, near Hyde, denies murdering 15 women patients and forging the will of one. The trial continues.
