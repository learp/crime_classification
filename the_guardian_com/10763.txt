Shortly afterwards, the Chrysler was stopped in Ashlin Road, Newham.It was then that an officer in his thirties left the armed response vehicle and sustained serious head injuries.It is not yet clear how the officer – a member of the Met police's CO19 firearms unit – was injured, but a Scotland Yard spokesman said he had not been shot or stabbed.The victim of the reported burglary, to which police were alerted at 6:16am, said the suspects were armed.Following the incident in Ashlin Road, the police constable was rushed by ambulance to an east London hospital, where his condition was described as critical.Two other officers, both Newham borough police constables, sustained minor injuries as the Chrysler rammed a marked police vehicle in a bid to leave the scene.The three people in the Chrysler were arrested and taken to east London police stations where they remain in custody.
