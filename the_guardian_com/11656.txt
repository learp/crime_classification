A child molester, tracked down by Scotland Yard's sex offences cold case team 30 years after he committed his crimes, was jailed for three and a half years yesterday.Frank Newberry, a 65-year-old grandfather from Royston, Hertfordshire, admitted four charges of indecent assault on a 13-year-old girl in the early 1970s. Four counts of rape will lie on file. The victim contacted officers from the Metropolitan police's Project Sapphire in the winter of 2002. "Amy" (not her real name) claimed at Wood Green crown court in north London yesterday that Newberry raped and sexually assaulted her up to 15 times over the course of a year in 1972-3. Amy, now a 45-year-old mother-of-two and a businesswoman, said Newberry's abuse had had a traumatic and lasting effect. Newberry, whom the court heard had a daughter the same age at the time of the attacks, lived near her family and started to give her lifts from Hollyhill riding stables in Enfield, north London. The first attack took place in a house in Enfield. On another occasion he raped her in an alley between two stables, and at other times he stopped the car in a wood and assaulted her. The retired electrician later claimed he thought Amy was a lot older and a college student. Judge Mervyn Roberts said Newberry would remain on the sex offenders' register indefinitely.
