Doctors are expected to lose the right to vet themselves under a shake-up of their professional regulation which will be announced by Patricia Hewitt, the health secretary, today.The medical regulator, the General Medical Council, is set to be stripped of its powers to discipline doctors and prevent them from practising under reforms aimed at preventing a repeat of the Harold Shipman scandal, and at restoring public confidence following a spate of cases involving unscrupulous doctors.Sir Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, who has been charged with producing the reforms, has been concerned that doctors should not be seen both to investigate themselves and to adjudicate. It is unclear who will be given the role of adjudication, but it is thought it could be carried out by an independent panel of legal, medical and lay people.The Times reported that the proposals - to be published in a white paper to be laid before parliament today - will also see the GMC lose its medical majority, something it has proposed itself and accepted. The white paper will also propose that GPs and consultants undergo MOTs every five years to ensure they are fit to practise and are not a danger to patients.Sir Liam has expressed concern that once doctors reach this level, they can work for more than 30 years with no formal reassessment of their competence, clinical skills or performance. In contrast, airline pilots would be assessed 100 times during a similar working life.Today's proposals follow Sir Liam's report, Good Doctors, Safer Patients, published last summer.At the same time, the government will publish its response to the Fifth Report of the Shipman Inquiry, which sets out plans to impose fresh safeguards to prevent a repeat of the serial killer, including ensuring death certificates are signed by two doctors.The GMC, which strikes off around 35 doctors a year but which critics argue is toothless, said it would not comment on the proposals until they had been announced by the government.A Department of Health spokeswoman said: "We cannot breach parliamentary procedure in commenting on this."BackstoryHarold Shipman killed 215 patients in 23 years without suspicion, because he filled out the death certificates. Dame Janet Smith, chairing the Shipman inquiry, criticised the General Medical Council in 2004, saying its culture, members, methods and governance tended to favour doctors over patients. The chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, last year recommended a radical shake-up of the regulation of doctors, and an overhaul of the GMC.
