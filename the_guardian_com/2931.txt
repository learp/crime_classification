A senior Metropolitan police officer has been sentenced to 15 months in prison for trying to sell information about the Met's phone-hacking inquiry to the News of the World.Detective chief inspector April Casburn, 53, was found guilty last month of misconduct in public office, after making a phone call to the now-defunct tabloid in September 2010 to tip it off about Scotland Yard's decision to launch a new investigation into phone hacking.Handing down the jail term on Friday morning, Mr Justice Fulford said "the sentence would have been three years", but he had taken into account the fact that a "vulnerable child" which Casburn and her husband were in the process of adopting would be left without her mother while she served her sentence.However, Fulford said there was no doubt that what Casburn had done could have been "deeply damaging" to the investigation into phone hacking and was a "straightforward but troubling case of corruption" that warranted a custodial sentence.Patrick Gibbs QC, representing Casburn, had asked the judge to suspend the sentence, arguing that what she had done did not amount to a "breach in relation to counter-terrorism" or "a breach in relation to hacking".Gibbs said Casburn, who worked for the anti-terrorist unit, had phoned the paper at 7.51am on a Saturday on her way to Tesco. "She rang and made an almost inexplicable call," he added.He argued that the call was made out of frustration about resources being diverted from counter-terrorism to phone hacking and that in addition she had been bullied at work and was going through a divorce and an adoption process."It was about being very unhappy at work and making a mad telephone call," Gibbs said.However, Fulford said that such a phone call "was a truly dire step for a police officer to take".Fulford added that the evidence provided by Tim Wood, the News of the World journalist who took the call from Casburn and noted her request for money, was convincing and he did not accept that this was "an understandable case of whistleblowing".In a statement, the Met said it hoped that the 15-month sentence "sends a strong message that the leaking of confidential information for personal gain is absolutely unacceptable and will not be tolerated" .It said Casburn, who will now lose her job, had "proactively" approached the very newspaper that was under investigation to make money. "She betrayed the service and let down her colleagues," it added."It was instead a corrupt attempt to make money out of a sensitive and potentially very damaging information … If the News of the World had accepted her offer, Ms Casburn would have taken the money and therefore have posed a significant threat to the integrity of the investigation [into phone hacking]," the judge said.Casburn denied asking for money and no story ever appeared.But Fulford said he found Wood to be a "reliable and honest and disinterested witness", who had taken the trouble to make a careful note of the conversation to pass on to his boss amid understandable suspicions that the call could have been part of a sophisticated operation to catch the paper out for corruption."He had no reason to lie and every cause to be cautious, given the risk that the newspaper was about to become the victim of a sting," the judge added.Fulford also rejected Casburn's argument that all she was passing on was information that was already in the public domain. During the course of the call, she had mentioned that Scotland Yard was investigating six individuals, including the paper's former editor Andy Coulson.Gibbs, Casburn's QC, argued during the trial that this information was already well documented and in the public domain as a result of reports in the Guardian and the New York Times.The judge said, however, that Casburn had committed a serious offence in telling the very newspaper that was under investigation of Scotland Yard's strategy."She revealed the actual intentions of the police team … and she revealed the current detail of the strategy," he said, adding this was information that could have been of "tactical" use to the six people under suspicion."We expect the very highest standards of probity of police officers, particularly those at highest levels. It's a very serious matter indeed that men and women who have all the privileges, benefits and responsibilities of public office use their position for corrupt purposes," he said.Fulford added that had the News of the World taken up Casburn's offer, she would have been able to pass on details about the phone-hacking investigation on an ongoing basis, even though she was not directly involved in it."She would have learned confidential details of the progress of the investigation … Chinese walls in contexts such as this are often porous. Activity of this kind is deeply damaging to the administration of criminal justice."Casburn is the first person to be convicted and sentenced in a case connected to the News of the World phone-hacking investigation, which was reopened in January 2011 and has led to the arrest of more than 95 people.In a short impact statement on Casburn's conduct, the Met said her actions had the potential of "undermining public safety"."Counter-terrorist policing is highly dependent on the trust and support of the intelligence agencies, the agencies have a right to expect the very highest standard of integrity among the offices and staff on counter-terrorism command," said Duncan Hall, detective chief superintendent and head of operations in the counter-terrorism command."There is real potential for that position of trust to be undermined … which could manifest itself in the flow of intelligence from our partner agencies … thereby potentially undermining public safety."Casburn sat composed throughout the hour-long hearing on Friday morning. On being sentenced, she turned to the public gallery overhead and blew a kiss.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
