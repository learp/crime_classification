David Blunkett yesterday clashed with his long-standing rival Lord Irvine when his office rejected claims by the lord chancellor that his plans for antisocial behaviour laws were draconian.In a letter dated April 6, copied to the prime minister and the deputy prime minister, Lord Irvine condemned the home secretary's plans for enforceable residential parenting classes. He described them as an extreme example of the nanny state. The measures were highlighted in an antisocial behaviour white paper published in March, but have appeared in only a diluted form in the bill given an unopposed second reading on April 8. A Home Office source said the proposal for compulsory residential courses would still be introduced as an amendment. Lord Irvine, in his leaked letter, said he supported the measures in principle, but added: "There are plainly human rights implications here under article 8 of the European convention on human rights. Though the prevention of offending and protection of others might justify the proposals, some will regard a court order imposing a residence requirement on a person who has not necessarily been convicted of any offence as draconian and an extreme example of the nanny state." In a statement the Home Office said: "When the home secretary introduced the antisocial behaviour bill he made it plain that those people who have no experience of the misery that antisocial behaviour can bring should not stand in the way of those people wanting to take measures to do something about it. That remains his position." In his letter Lord Irvine raised questions about who would be responsible for looking after the children if they remained at home while their parents attended a residential course.
