A man who cheated lovers out of thousands of pounds was caught after four of the women teamed up to confront him, a court has heard.Simon Reid was trapped when some of the women he was involved with found out about each other and hatched a plot to expose him.The women met at a restaurant in Plymouth, Devon, and lured him to one of their homes. They appeared one by one and recorded Reid's shock and horror on a camcorder.Reid, 44, was jailed for 30 months by a judge at Plymouth crown court after admitting two charges of fraud.The judge, Kevin de Haan QC, said: "You told lies that frankly Baron von Münchausen would have been proud of."Reid conned Joanne Ward out of £17,000, telling her he had five properties in the US and was a climbing instructor.He told a second woman, Laura Buckingham, from Plymouth, that he was a drugs and alcohol worker. He claimed he had a son who was an RAF helicopter pilot and had lost both legs after crashing in Afghanistan. She lent him £1,800 that was never paid back.The judge said Reid had preyed on "ladies who may be lonely or emotionally vulnerable, persuading them to part with money through a tissue of lies."These were despicable offences. To want to be loved is an essential part of the human condition, and you set out to inveigle your way into the hearts of these ladies. To make them fall in love with you, you played on their sympathies."
