The chairwoman of a Scotland Yard advisory group yesterday claimed comments by a senior detective involved in the bungled Stephen Lawrence investigation showed how far there was still to go in combating racism .Jennifer Douglas, who chairs a lay group advising the Met's racial and violent crimes task force, condemned remarks by retired detective inspector Ben Bullock blaming the murdered teenager's parents for hampering the police. Mr Bullock was second in command of the investigation into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence in south-east London in April 1993.Mr Bullock, the only officer to face disciplinary charges, claimed the family distracted police. He told a Sunday newspaper that a visit by former South African president Nelson Mandela put pressure on the police rather than adding to appeals for information on the murder. Ms Douglas said: "We have been working closely with the Metropolitan police for the past six months to address the issues of unwitting institutional racism exposed in the Lawrence inquiry. Mr Bullock has shown how much further we still have to go." Ms Douglas also attacked the two cautions handed out to Mr Bullock last week by a disciplinary hearing, the most lenient punishment available. "I think it's appalling. He obviously feels he has been vindicated." Stephen Lawrence's parents, Doreen and Neville, have demanded an apology from Mr Bullock who retired after the disciplinary hearing. Imran Khan, solicitor for the Lawrences, said: "He has effectively provided greater hurt to a family who have gone through a horrifying ordeal."
