An official inquiry into the foreign prison population in Britain's jails has identified major failings in how the immigration service is handling deportations, branding the department 'unaccountable', 'unreliable' and a 'generation in the past'.In a development that will put further pressure on the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, officials working for HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) have just completed a survey of 12 jails looking at how the Immigration and Nationality Directorate deals with foreign nationals.The Observer understands that a number of those interviewed between August and December 2005 give a scathing assessment of the immigration service. The inspectorate was told that Morton Hall, a women-only prison, became so frustrated by the directorate's inaction that it bypassed the directorate and started its own deportation negotiations with foreign countries' embassies.The assessments will be submitted to the prisons inspectorate which plans to publish its report in the autumn. It is likely to make uncomfortable reading for Clarke, who pledged to get a grip on the problem of foreign prisoners last August.The Observer has also learnt that a specialist team set up by Clarke to deal with the backlog of deportation cases is so understaffed that it is employing outside agency personnel who have little experience in dealing with immigration issues.'The evidence is piling up day by day that ministers were allowing systematic administrative incompetence to continue and the solutions they put in place were minuscule compared with the size of the problem,' said Nick Clegg, Liberal Democrat spokesman on home affairs.'This reinforces the charge of neglect, it is clear the Home Secretary has failed in his duty,' said David Davis, the shadow home secretary.In a further body blow to the Home Office, a former senior government adviser, writing in today's Observer, calls for the department to be broken up. Katharine Raymond, who was David Blunkett's special adviser on home affairs, fires a devastating broadside at what is regarded as the government's most unwieldy department.'This department has become too big to manage. Its left hand does not know what its right is doing,' she writes. 'The government can no longer avoid confronting the hard question of whether it is safe to leave it intact. It has turned into a dinosaur with a brain too small to co-ordinate its gigantic body.'Many of the problems facing the immigration service over foreign nationals in British prisons stem from the Home Office's earlier difficulties over asylum. The Observer has learnt that between 2000 and 2004, the Immigration Appeals Tribunals had an agreement with the Home Office to process 6,000 asylum cases a month. In reality, the tribunals were hearing an average 8,300 cases a month, creating an immense backlog of asylum cases.In an attempt to quell the crisis, a decision was made to switch around 100 personnel from the immigration service's deportation department to asylum, leaving few staff to concentrate on processing foreign prisoners.Last August, when Clarke became aware that the personnel switch had placed huge pressures on the deportation team, he created a new casework unit to deal with the problem. But sources within the directorate say the unit is still chronically understaffed.Two weeks before the scandal broke, the Public and Commercial Services union, which represents immigration officials, told the directorate it had serious concerns that temporary agency workers were being recruited to tackle deportation because there were so few trained staff to deal with the problem.The government's critics said the problems facing the casework team were down to a failure on the part of the Home Secretary. 'The simple fact is that when public safety is involved it's not good enough to issue an initiative then forget about the consequences,' Davis said.The need to recruit more trained staff is likely to become increasingly urgent as the Home Office tries to calm the prisons' crisis. According to the immigration service, 3,119 foreign prisoners are due to be released between October 2005 and October 2006, but a Home Office spokeswoman told The Observer: 'We do not know how many of them are due for deportation.'So far it has emerged that five prisoners who should have been deported went on to commit further serious crimes including wounding, ABH and robbery.The Observer has also unearthed the case of Gheorge Banu from Romania, who was recommended for deportation when he was released in August 2004 after serving a sentence for fraud. But instead, Banu remained in the UK where, until February 2005, he led a gang that cloned bank cards, netting Â£643,000 from the scam, one of the largest such crimes in British history.It is likely that further examples will come to light as the Home Office concludes its sweep of more than 900 foreign prisoners released without being considered for deportation between February 1999 and March 2006.Of the 1,023 offenders who should have been considered for deportation, 79 were imprisoned for serious offences. Deportation proceedings have commenced against 63 of these. Over the weekend a series of raids on deportation suspects homes were being carried out.But Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers, warned that there may be another group of foreign prisoners who have absconded.'You have to ask what has happened to the unknown number of foreign nationals who have have been released on probation supervision, where deportation procedures have commenced but are not yet completed,' he said.He warned that many foreign nationals may simply disappear and go on to commit more crimes. 'It is highly unlikely that any released foreign nationals will be apprehended unless they are arrested in connection with a further offence. Last year 66 per cent of all prisoners were reconvicted within two years of release.'Michael Howard, the former Home Secretary, upped the stakes this weekend by warning that the Home Office would be liable to compensation lawsuits from the victims of prisoners who had been wrongly released and gone on to reoffend. 'If they had done their job properly these people would not have been at liberty to reoffend,' he said.In an attempt to reclaim the initiative, the Home Office is to explore the idea of repatriating EU prisoners to institutions in their home countries. More than 2,000 EU nationals are currently in Britain's prisons, while there are around 800 British nationals in EU jails. It is also to study the possibility that even those serving short sentences of as little as three months could be automatically considered for deportation.The Home Office issued new guidance on deportation practice in March last year. But many of the new guidelines laid out in the PSO 6000 document have yet to be implemented.An internal email to Home Office staff, sent by the department's senior civil servant, Sir David Normington, last week acknowledges the scale of the problem facing the department.'The foreign national prisoner population is at record levels and it is clear that while an increasing number of cases have been referred for consideration, we have not kept pace with rising demand,' he wrote. 'The only thing we can do in these circumstances is to apologise and make sure we put the position right as far as possible.'
