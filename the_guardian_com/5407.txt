It's not good, a senior security official told me the other day, when you want to talk to the home secretary about the latest terrorist threat assessment and you know his mind is on the latest prison scandal.MI5, and the police, are likely to welcome the decision, after a battle royal in Whitehall, to break up the Home Office.John Reid's new department, a kind of ministry for security, will now concentrate on counter-terrorism, police and crime, while responsibility for prisons and probation will be hived off to a ministry of justice under the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer.So crime will be in dealt with one place, the consequences of it, and its effects, in another. Whether that helps in the continuing quest for joined-up government remains to be seen.The Home Office will have a new office for security and terrorism, a unit which will drive and try to coordinate all the different elements of the fight against terrorism - including, presumably, the struggle for "hearts and minds".The prime minister will chair a monthly meeting of what is to be called a security and counter-terrorism council. Weekly meetings of a security and counter-terrorism board will be chaired by the home secretary.The irony is that the cabinet committee on security and intelligence - in existence before Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997 - rarely met after he entered Downing Street.Indeed, the parliamentary intelligence and security committee regularly chided him for never discussing such urgent matters with his cabinet colleagues.
