A 94-year-old woman is recovering in hospital after she was attacked as she slept in her own bed.Emma Winnall sustained multiple injuries including a fractured skull, a broken arm and wrist and a partially severed finger during the attack, which is believed to have taken place in her home in Moseley, Birmingham on Monday night.The pensioner remains seriously ill and sedated in hospital having undergone emergency surgery, including having metal plates inserted into her arm, West Midlands police said. She is showing signs of improvement and it is hoped she will make a full recovery.Detectives have so far been unable to determine a motive for the attack and are asking the public for help to trace the person who entered her home and carried out the attack.Detective Chief Inspector Sarb Johal said: "It doesn't appear anything was stolen from the lady's home and the interior was largely undisturbed."We believe an implement of some sort was used during the assault – our forensics experts are scouring the property in the hope of shedding some light on exactly what happened."He added: "Mrs Winnall's daughter has asked us to issue an image of her mother in hospital showing the extent of her injuries in the hope it will stir consciences and persuade anyone with information to contact us."The victim's carer raised the alarm at 9am on Tuesday morning but the attack is believed to have taken place at any time from 9pm the previous night.Johal said "Mrs Winnall had nothing of note to steal … it was a senseless assault and I'd urge anyone with suspicions about who may be responsible to get in touch straight away."I'm sure the answer to this vicious assault lies in our local communities so we're appealing for help to try and trace the offender."Anyone with information is asked to contact West Midlands Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
