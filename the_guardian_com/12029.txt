The Metropolitan Police Service and the NSPCC have published a joint report into sexual allegations made against Jimmy Savile.The publication entitled 'Giving Victims a Voice', details the work of Operation Yewtree based on the accounts of hundreds of victims who have come forward since Jimmy Savile was exposed as a sex offender in October 2012. Alexandra Topping writes today: A 30-page report from the Met police and the NSPCC has revealed that Jimmy Savile sexually assaulted children as young as 10 over six decades as a paedophile.He abused children at 14 hospitals including Great Ormond Street and a children's hospice, according to the report Giving Victims a Voice.The report states that the police and the NSPCC have "concluded that Jimmy Savile was one of the UK's most prolific known sexual predators. Indeed the formal recording of allegations of crime on this scale is, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented in the UK."Detailed breakdowns of offences and victims by age and offence type are provided in the publication. We've picked out some of the key charts from the report. {"dataSourceUrl":"//docs.google.com/a/guardian.co.uk/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AgeWW3ExhzkIdExwMDJ3eFptSUx6ckVySUZEWVpxQXc&transpose=0&headers=1&range=D13%3AL19&gid=0&pub=1","options":{"vAxes":[{"useFormatFromData":true,"title":null,"minValue":null,"logScale":false,"viewWindow":{"min":null,"max":null},"maxValue":null},{"useFormatFromData":true,"minValue":null,"logScale":false,"viewWindow":{"min":null,"max":null},"maxValue":null}],"titleTextStyle":{"bold":true,"color":"#000","fontSize":"20"},"booleanRole":"certainty","title":"Types of offences, by age","legendTextStyle":{"color":"#222","fontSize":"8"},"animation":{"duration":0},"legend":"in","theme":"maximized","focusTarget":"category","hAxis":{"useFormatFromData":true,"minValue":null,"viewWindowMode":null,"viewWindow":null,"maxValue":null},"isStacked":true,"width":460,"height":400},"state":{},"view":{},"chartType":"ColumnChart","chartName":"Chart1"} Around 600 people have have come forward to provide information to investigators since Operation Yewtree began in October 2012. The totalnumber of these relating to Savile is expected to be about 450, mainly alleging sexual abuse. The chart above shows a breakdown of victims and offences by age, the biggest group were aged between 13 and 16 with a high number aged under 10-years old.More than 200 criminal offences have been formally recorded across 28 police force areas in which Savile is a suspect - 126 of these are defined as 'indecent acts' and 34 as rape. The report also states that of the rape victims recorded, 26 were female and eight male.The graph below shows a timeline of allegations, including notable locations. The report states 'peak offending' took place between 1965 and 1978. Between 1970 and 1978 he was offending at the BBC, Duncroft School, Stoke Mandeville Hospital and Leeds General Infirmary. There was also an offence at Broadmoor hospital during this period. {"dataSourceUrl":"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AgeWW3ExhzkIdExwMDJ3eFptSUx6ckVySUZEWVpxQXc&transpose=0&headers=1&range=D25%3AI81&gid=0&pub=1","options":{"vAxes":[{"useFormatFromData":true,"title":"Number of cases","minValue":null,"logScale":false,"viewWindow":{"min":null,"max":null},"maxValue":null},{"useFormatFromData":true,"minValue":null,"logScale":false,"viewWindow":{"min":null,"max":null},"maxValue":null}],"titleTextStyle":{"bold":true,"color":"#000","fontSize":"20"},"booleanRole":"certainty","title":"When and where the abuse happened","legendTextStyle":{"color":"#222","fontSize":"8"},"animation":{"duration":0},"legend":"in","theme":"maximized","focusTarget":"category","useFirstColumnAsDomain":true,"hAxis":{"title":"Year","useFormatFromData":true,"minValue":null,"viewWindowMode":null,"viewWindow":null,"maxValue":null},"isStacked":true,"width":460,"height":400},"state":{},"view":{"columns":[{"calc":"stringify","type":"string","sourceColumn":0},1,2,3,4,5]},"chartType":"ColumnChart","chartName":"Chart2"} Findings from the report give more detail into the timeline of the offences. Peter Walker writes: Victims have complained of abuse connected to Savile's work at the BBC between 1965 and 2006, up to the final recording of Top of the Pops. Abuse was reported at Leeds general infirmary, where Savile had close links and worked as a voluntary porter, between 1965 and 1995. At Stoke Mandeville hospital, for which he was a major fundraiser and often stayed overnight, reported offending happened from 1965 to 1988. At Duncroft school, which he also visited regularly, there are allegations from between 1970 and 1978.The report states that there 57 allegations have been linked to hospital premises, including hospices. Another 33 claims of abuse have been linked to television or radio studios and 14 to schools.The report concludes with the following statement: Perhaps the most important learning from this appalling case is in relation to the children and adults who spoke out about Jimmy Savile at the time. Too often they were not taken seriously. We must not allow this to happen again - those who come forward must be given a voice and swift action taken to verify accounts of abuse.The MPS and NSPCC report notes that the charts (which have been redone for this article by the Guardian) are based on formal crime reports but the broader findings use wider data available to investigators i.e. accounts from victims that have not resulted in formal crime reports.Download the data• DATA: download the full spreadsheetSOURCES: Giving Victims a VoiceNEW!
