More than 55% of knife and gun crime attacks in the last year were concentrated in inner city areas of London, Birmingham and Manchester, according to Home Office statistics published yesterday.The first set of official statistics on the use of a knife or other sharp instrument, such as a broken bottle, show that there were 22,151 attacks in the last year - close to one in five of all violent attacks.The issue of knife crime has become a touchstone issue, with 18 teenagers falling victim to fatal stabbings in London this year. The Conservative spokesman, Dominic Grieve, said the scale of knife crime was a shocking indictment of Labour's failure to tackle crime and its causes.Home Office criminologists said yesterday that it was possible to have outbreaks of increasing but concentrated violence, including knife crime, while still having an overall decline in violence across the whole of the country.The figures for the year to this March on both police recorded crime and the British Crime Survey show falling levels of violent crime of between 8% and 12%.The annual murder rate was 784 people killed, up from 759 the previous year but below the 1,047 recorded six years ago. But these figures are not broken down by type of death, so cannot used to determine whether fatal stabbings have played a greater or lesser role than usual. In past years they have accounted for about one third of all murders.The 22,151 serious violent offences in which a knife was involved was the first time that such figures were collected and so it is not possible to determine a national trend. This figure excludes the number of offenders found in possession of a knife. The BCS says that 6% of violent incidents involved knife crime, and this was broadly comparable with the 7% the year before. Metropolitan police data for London knife crime show there were 10,220 'knife enabled' crime in the capital in 2007/08 - down 16% on the previous year.Gun crime, however, rose by a further 2% with the police recording 9,803 firearm offences. The latest figures show 52 people died as a result of being shot - four fewer than the previous year.The British Crime Survey confirms that alcohol-fuelled violence remains a key factor, with 947,000 violent incidents [45%] where the victim believed their attacker was drunk compared with 383,000 incidents where they were believed to be under the influence of drugs.The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said that the government was determined to deliver further reductions in crime, particularly violence involving guns and knives: "Whilst the BCS shows violence falling by 40% since 1997, with a 12% fall in the last year alone, we also know that knives are still being used in the most serious violent incidents."But Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said it showed just how slow the Government has been to tackle knife crime that it had only just started recording knife offences and still does not survey crimes concerning under-16s, even though this group has seen rapidly increasing hospital admissions for stab wounds: "Unlike most journalists, ministers still cannot tell us how many murders were committed using knives last year."
