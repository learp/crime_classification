The news of Britain's first cautions for basic Wi-Fi hacking - using somebody else's wireless internet connection without their permission - potentially makes criminals of thousands of us.Police in Worcestershire cautioned a man who was seen using somebody's unsecured wireless internet from his car, while a woman had earlier been given a reprimand for the same offence. I'll admit to having done the same thing many, many times over the years - not least when I moved home and BT decided to wait two months before installing a phone line to my house. So are those of us who hop on board from time to time committing a criminal act?It's still generally considered a grey area, though of course a lot depends on what you do with it. Broadband is, in theory, always switched on and usually paid for with a flat fee - so unless I abuse an open network (maybe by looking at illegal content or overloading it with huge downloads), there is no real impact on the person who owns the connection.And there is a cadre of net heads who deliberately choose to share their wireless network with anyone who's passing by - a sort of ad hoc public service network. These kindly souls give succour to all of us struggling with our net addiction.Some argue that it's the fault of those stupid enough to leave their Wi-Fi connections unlocked: if they're foolish enough to leave the door open, why shouldn't we walk in? Well, I might be deemed silly if I left my home unlocked - but that doesn't mean I'd be happy to discover a stranger sitting on my sofa and watching the TV.Online etiquette often differs from the real world, however, and most would accept that the emphasis right now is on the user to protect themselves. And it's easy enough - a password is usually enough to solve most security problems; maybe all equipment sold should come with security automatically turned on.The truth is that unsecured networks are everywhere. Just get your laptop out in a busy street or on the train and you'll be able to see huge numbers of internet hotspots that people haven't secured. I'm not sure if Wi-Fi leeching is stealing somebody else's property, or merely the digital equivalent of finding a coin on the street - but I do know that the fact we haven't got a straight answer simply underlines how little many people know about the machines and technologies they use.
