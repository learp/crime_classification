The unprecedented trial without jury of four men for armed robbery will begin in January.John Twomey, Glen Cameron, Peter Blake and Barry Hibberd will be tried by a judge alone after the court of appeal ruled there was a danger of jury interference.The four men appeared at the Old Bailey today for a preliminary hearing in the case, relating to a Â£1.75m raid at a Heathrow warehouse in February 2004.Mr Justice Calvert-Smith is expected to preside over the trial, which is scheduled to start on 12 January at a court likely to be Kingston or Isleworth.Campaigners said last month the landmark decision to hold a trial without a jury set a "dangerous precedent".Twomey, 61, of New Milton, Hants, Blake, 57, of Notting Hill, west London, Hibberd, 42, of Shepherd's Bush, west London, and Cameron, 49, of New Milton, all deny a series of charges including conspiracy to rob and firearm possession. All four remain on bail.
