The schools minister Andrew Adonis today called on police forces to free up more constables to work in schools in a bid to cut violent crime.Police officers are currently stationed in at least 450 schools keeping order and frisking pupils for weapons, drink and drugs.Adonis told the teachers' union Voice: "The debate about whether police should be in schools is over." He said police officers were not regarded as outsiders in schools."The model is to have a police office stationed on site," he said. "Schools, in my experience, are strongly supportive of this. Headteachers are warmly supportive of engagement by appropriately trained officers."Schools in more challenging areas can particularly benefit from the work of specially trained police officer. We have been encouraging local police forces to make more officer available."Teachers already have the power to search pupils for knives. Earlier this month, the education secretary, Ed Balls, said they would be given the authority to search for drink, drugs, cigarettes and stolen property.The government's chief adviser on school discipline, Sir Alan Steer, has said schools are not exercising their legal right to search for weapons since they gained it in June last year.More than 3,000 secondary schools in England have their own police officers. Others share constables with a cluster of local schools including primaries.
