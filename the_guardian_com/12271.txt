The man, a Spanish citizen whose name was not released, was detained during a police operation on Tuesday night in Narón, in north-west Spain.From his shop and online store, the man sold a range of clothes promoting Isis and another Islamist militant group, Harakat Sham al-Islam, the interior ministry said. They included T-shirts with a silk-screened image showing the hostage Alan Henning as he was about to be beheaded by Islamic State last year, together with his killer and the Isis flag.

The man was selling the T-shirts to customers in Spain and Portugal for €14 (£10) each. He is accused of using social networks to spread Islamist propaganda and to “belittle and humiliate victims of jihadi terrorism”, the ministry said in a statement. So far this year, the ministry said, 47 people accused of having links to Islamist militancy have been arrested in Spain. Europe’s worst Islamist attack occurred in Spain in 2004 when 191 people were killed in bombings of Madrid commuter trains.
