The Conservatives today backed plans by the home secretary, Alan Johnson, for a national roll-out of powers allowing parents to check whether those who regularly care for their children are convicted sex offenders.The decision followed a pilot scheme in four police areas – Cambridgeshire, Hampshire, Cleveland and Warwickshire – which gave parents and carers controlled access to the sex offenders register.At least one police force, Avon and Somerset, refused to take part in the pilot.The decision was announced by Johnson in the News of the World, which has campaigned for what it calls "Sarah's law" – the publication of the names and addresses of convicted sex offenders.The tabloid described the move as "the biggest breakthrough since the campaign was launched after the abduction and murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne in July 2000".The shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling, said: "We are very sympathetic to what the Home Office is trying to achieve and, if the pilots have worked properly, we would be happy to see the scheme extended."The Conservatives indicated that the national roll-out was likely to take place whatever the outcome of the general election.However, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Chris Huhne, voiced caution over the decision to extend the system to all police areas in England and Wales."We need far more information about these trials before they are rolled out across the country," he said."The concern is that this will do nothing for the safety of children and could even lead to an increase in sex offenders."The News of the World said Johnson's decision followed an evaluation by De Montfort University, in Leicester, of the 585 inquiries made by parents in the 12 months to September 2009.Researchers found that 24 children had been in contact with convicted sex offenders out of 315 cases treated as applications for information about suspected individuals.The home secretary said the early results were encouraging and that the pilot had provided crucial protection for children who might otherwise be at risk."The development of this scheme is a major step forward in our ability to protect children from sex offenders," he said, adding that a final decision on extending the scheme across England and Wales would be taken shortly.Sara Payne, the mother of Sarah and the government's "victims' champion", told the News of the World: "In all the long years of campaigning for parents' rights to keep their children safe from predatory paedophiles, this is the most important development to date."When the pilot schemes were introduced, the then home secretary, Jacqui Smith, stressed that they did not amount to the "community-wide" notification schemes of the photographs and addresses of sex offenders used in the "Megan's law" disclosure schemes in the US.Disclosure is only made to parents and others with a direct interest in a child about a carer who has regular unsupervised access. The police and probation service consider each individual request.
