Despite its reputation for sporting nearly-identical conservative haircuts, the FBI – the Federal Bureau of Investigation, America's government gumshoes – assembled and published an all-inclusive guide to hair. And despite its reputation for tight-lippedness, it made its guide available to anyone who might have a use or desire for it.Hair Bibliography for the Forensic Scientist might make a fine gift for anyone who cares about the sometimes-tangled relationship between hair and crime. You might regard this as completely legal intellectual pornography for those who watch CSI [Crime Scene Investigation].The author, Max Houck of the FBI's Trace Evidence Unit in Washington DC, at least pretended that his 17-page report, published in 2002 in the journal Forensic Science Communications, would appeal strictly to professionals. "It is hoped that this listing will provide some assistance to forensic hair examiners who are seeking information and support for courtroom forensic challenges," he wrote.Some light, even playful, touches suggest that Houck knew his paper would also find its way to amateurs, and even to casual fans of the hair-and-crime game.The list begins coyly with Don't Miss a Hair, a seven-pager published in 1976 in the FBI law enforcement bulletin.Next comes more cutesiness: From Bad to Worse: Hair Today, Scorned Tomorrow, which you can find in a 1997 issue of the journal Science Sleuthing.Then comes a more specific, and mildly grizzly, title that's worded with strange ambiguity: Laboratory Solves Variety of Crimes with Animal Hairs (FBI law enforcement bulletin, 1960).Then a return to the strictly human, and a higher degree of specificity: Pigmentation in a Central American Tribe with Special Reference to Fair-headedness (American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 1953).One report's title almost begs you to go and find out how, exactly, its authors, DL Exline, FP Smith and SO Drexler, gathered their knowledge: Frequency of Pubic Hair Transfer During Sexual Intercourse, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, 1998.The list is dominated by 10 items written or co-written by BD Gaudette. That's Barry D Gaudette, chief scientist for hair and fibre, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Gaudette's An Attempt at Determining Probabilities in Human Scalp Hair Comparison, co-written with ES Keeping in the Journal of Forensic Sciences in 1974, specifies a rule of thumb that you can use in writing either a crime novel or a maths textbook: "It is estimated that if one human scalp hair found at the scene of a crime is indistinguishable from at least one of a group of about nine dissimilar hairs from a given source, the probability that it could have originated from another source is very small, about 1 in 4,500. If, instead of one hair, n mutually dissimilar human scalp hairs are found to be indistinguishable from those of a given source, this probability is then estimated to be (1/4,500) to the nth power, which is negligible when n is greater than or equal to three."• Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize
