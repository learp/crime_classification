A man who spent 25 years in jail for a crime he did not commit has been told no action will be taken against police officers who gathered corrupt evidence against him.Robert Brown's supporters said the decision flew in the face of evidence revealed in an internal police inquiry which found the main investigating officer had been at the head of "a massive conspiracy of corrupt behaviour". The officer, Detective Chief Inspector Jack Butler, was subsequently convicted of perjury in another case, and was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. The Independent Police Complaints Commission told Mr Brown on Monday that there was insufficient evidence to pursue misconduct actions against officers. Mr Brown was convicted in Manchester, in 1977, for the murder of Annie Walsh. He claimed at the time that a confession had been "beaten out of him" at Platt Lane police station. He was cleared by the court of appeal in 2002. Announcing their decision, the judges said: "Sadly, there was, at Platt Lane police station, a culture of corruption and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over which Butler had presided in a senior role." The commission said Mr Brown had refused to take part in its inquiry and had not made a formal statement of complaint. But, from his home in Glasgow Mr Brown refuted these allegations, calling them "a sick joke". He said: "I handed over my formal complaint during a Channel 4 documentary, so it's on film. I also have receipts for formal complaints going back to 1990." He was still calling for a full independent inquiry. John McManus, of Miscarriages of Justice (Scotland), said the commission's report was a cover-up.
