The Conservatives were accused yesterday of issuing "dodgy crime figures" after highlighting contentious statistics that suggested violent crime had increased dramatically under Labour.Jacqui Smith, the former home secretary, said the Tories had been caught "bang to rights" after sending out statistics to activists from the British Crime Survey without mentioning a Home Office warning that the methodology had changed.Chris Grayling, the shadow home secretary, found himself in trouble after the BBC reported that Tories had sent out leaflets in constituencies giving what police called an "extremely misleading" impression. A leaflet produced by the office of Mark Lancaster, MP for Milton Keynes North East, claimed that violent attacks had increased in the constituency by 236%, from 1,790 to 6,015 a year, since 1999.Nikki Ross, the local police commander, told the Milton Keynes Citizen that the claim was "extremely misleading" because "everything from public order offences to harassment to allowing a dog to be out of control in a public place" was classed as violent crime. "The actual number of people who were victims of serious violence was 81," Superintendant Ross said.Labour and the Liberal Democrats said the Tories had failed to point out that statistics from the British Crime Survey had to be treated with care. The Home Office says it is not possible to compare figures before and after 2002 because of a change in the way violent crime was recorded which gave the impression it had increased by 35% in the first year.Alan Johnson, the home secretary, said the British Crime Survey indicated that violent crime had fallen by 41% since 1997. "It's one thing to make a slip-up on your figures â€“ it's quite another to deliberately mislead."Grayling denied any wrongdoing. "There are certainly changes in the recording methods, but the point is that they are the only comparators available," he told the Today programme. "We use the official crime figures published by the Home Office. The Home Office has continued to use the same comparators."
