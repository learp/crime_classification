A man accused of starving his partner's daughter to death pleaded guilty to five counts of child cruelty today. Junaid Abuhamza, 30, who denies the murder of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, admitted cruelty charges relating to five other children during the hearing at Birmingham crown court. He is expected to go on trial tomorrow alongside Khyra's mother, Angela Gordon, 34. Khyra was reportedly found critically ill and severely emaciated at the couple's home in Handsworth, Birmingham, and died in hospital on 17 May last year. Her five siblings went into foster care.
