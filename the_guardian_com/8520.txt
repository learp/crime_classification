A fantasist has been jailed for two years after conning police into thinking he was a James Bond-style secret agent.Michael Newitt, 41, turned up at Hinckley police station in Leicestershire announcing himself as Commander Newitt of the Metropolitan police. He said he was a special operations commander with MI5, the Foreign Office and counter-terrorism units.An officer gave Newitt a new pocket book after he claimed to be on a counter-terrorism operation in the county.Newitt's fake ID documents were carried in a leather wallet with a crown on the front. The letters CMG – standing for a high-ranking award fictitiously presented to James Bond in the story From Russia with Love – were printed after his name.The failed businessman from Osgathorpe, near Loughborough, made an arrest on the M6 motorway while driving a Volvo fitted with blue strobe police lights and a siren, said Adrian Harris, prosecuting, at Leicester crown court today."He's a conman and a fantasist who's styled himself as a James Bond character. His life has been a spectacular illusion," Harris said. "He's tricked several people, even police officers, into believing his lies."Even Newitt's wife believed his stories when he said he was off on "special missions", the court heard. He would sleep beside one of his replica guns and would sometimes race off from home without warning.Newitt, the subject of an earlier bankruptcy order, was prosecuted in 2005 for failing to keep proper accounts.His latest business, Micina Technologies, based near Hinckley, was on the brink of collapse, the court heard, and he was struggling to pay for his car, business premises and the mooring fees for his £200,000 motor cruiser.Newitt began offending after falling out with the manager of a marina who removed his boat from its mooring in December 2006.He demanded it be put back, claiming he was an undercover intelligence officer – and served the manager with a copy of the Official Secrets Act.The court was told that Newitt's story began to unravel after he called Hinckley police station in April claiming to have information about drugs.PC Lee Smith, who had a military background, was suspicious of Newitt's "Commander" title, checked him out and arrested him.Officers seized from him a pair of handcuffs, a friction-lock baton, three air weapons and ammunition, seven flash grenades, shredded identity documents, four non-functioning police radio handsets and earpieces.Newitt admitted five fake ID card offences, fraudulently claiming to be a police officer and carrying two imitation firearms: a replica Glock 9mm pistol and a commando rifle.Gary Short, defending, said Newitt was a man of low self-esteem who, having set up the fantasy lifestyle, started acquiring articles to impress. "In his eyes, Commander Newitt was a real person," he said. "The persona was created to give himself a feeling of worth and to generate respect from others, and not to commit criminal offences."
