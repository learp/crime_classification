A former police officer has been jailed for 19 years for a string of serious sex crimes.Wayne Scott, 37, was convicted after a five-day trial of the rape and attempted rape of a woman, having already admitted raping another woman seven times over a number of years.He also confessed to two common assaults, one sexual assault and two counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual touching.Sentencing Scott at Newcastle crown court, Judge James Goss QC described him as manipulative, controlling and domineering."Your offending has had an enormous impact on the wellbeing, confidence and lives of those against whom you offended, destroying their lives," he said.Scott's offences came to light after he was dismissed by Cleveland police when a member of the public complained about him touching her sexually while on duty.Although he was not prosecuted for that offence, the publicity led other women to come forward and make complaints.Speaking after the hearing, Detective Superintendent Peter McPhillips of Cleveland police said: "I'm really pleased with the sentence today."Wayne Scott is a sexual deviant and a predator who manipulated his victims and had a significant detrimental impact on their lives. Yet he has never exhibited any remorse and he does not appear to understand the horrific nature of his crimes."I would like to pay tribute to all of his victims, in particular those who we managed to trace and who were brave enough to provide us with the details of his crimes."The judge said that Scott would serve 15 years in custody, and also passed a sexual offences prevention order and placed him on the sex offenders register.A statement from one of his victims was read out saying she was worried about his release as he had already tried to contact her since being in prison.On hearing his fate, Scott became unsteady on his feet, first bending over, then sinking into his seat.His appearances in the dock had been characterised by attempts to mouth words, sobbing and hanging his head.Since his arrest, the 37-year-old, formerly of Stockton, Teesside, has twice tried to kill himself, jumping from a prison balcony and leaping from a moving vehicle while on his way to a medical examination.Senior officers have said there are allegations from eight more victims that did not make it to court, and they have appealed for others to come forward.McPhillips said: "I hope this sentence will send a positive message to victims of sexual abuse, that we will listen to them and together with our partners work with them to bring offenders to justice."I would again appeal to anyone who believes they were a victim of Wayne Scott to contact officers."
