Rakesh Bhayani, 41, has been found guilty of murdering a wealthy accounts clerk turned part-time escort in order to fund his gambling habit.Another man, Nicholas Kutner, 48, who was tried with him, was found not guilty of her murder but guilty of perverting the course of justice by concealing the death.Carole Waugh was found in the boot of a car in a lock-up garage in south London four months after she went missing.Following her death Bhayani used a series of lookalike women to pose as the 47-year-old Waugh, emptying her bank accounts, maxing out her credit cards and selling her jewellery in order to fund his lavish lifestyle.Mr Justice Wilkie deferred sentencing until Thursday to allow Waugh's family to attend."I am particularly aware that the family of Carole Waugh are not in attendance today and that it should be desirable that they should be present," he told the court."I have in mind that I should proceed to sentence tomorrow when they will be here and therefore able to hear what is said. I know that they are coming from a long way distant."Waugh had worked in Libya, boasting that she had links to the Gaddafi family, before becoming a part-time escort who worked under the pseudonym PoshTottyFun and offered her clients "lots of good clean adult fun".Described as a "Walter Mitty character" who may have wanted her life to seem more interesting than it was, she met Bhayani through an adult site.The conman befriended Waugh, who was described as a financially independent but lonely woman, going as far as to write him a reference describing him as "one of the good guys".She trusted Bhayani, who had served a series of sentences for fraud, giving him £12,000 for a gambling rehabilitation programme and lending him £40,000 through their acquaintance.But Bhayani, who had a fondness for lavish goods and gambling, plotted to seize all of her worldly goods, including her £650,000 flat in Marylebone, central London.She had started to push to get the money she was owed back when she was killed by a single stab wound to the neck on the evening of 16-17 April.Bhayani stuffed Waugh's body into a large holdall and, abandoning plans to burn the body in a remote area of the Cotswolds, he bought a car and put her corpse in the boot, leaving it in a garage in New Maldon.On the day of her murder Bhayani posed as a property developer at an upmarket jeweller's off Bond Street.A third defendant, Elie Khoury, 40, of Paddington, central London, was found not guilty of conspiracy to defraud.
