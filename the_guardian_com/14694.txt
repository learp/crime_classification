The boxer Amir Khan was today banned from driving for 42 days and fined £1,000 after he was convicted of speeding.The Commonwealth lightweight champion drove at more than twice the speed limit behind the wheel of his BMW 360i convertible on the M62 near Rochdale, Greater Manchester on New Year's Eve 2006, Rochdale magistrates heard.A police officer said his speedometer was "off the clock" at 155mph as he pursued him.Sentencing Khan, the district judge, Pamela Baldwin, said there was not enough evidence to prove he was driving at more than 100mph but she was satisfied it was in excess of 70mph. He denied the charge but admitted his speed may have reached about 75mph.Khan, 21, regarded as one of the brightest hopes in British boxing, is already banned from driving after his licence was suspended for six months last October for speeding through a red light in the wrong lane, knocking over a pedestrian and breaking his leg.Khan is reported to have bought himself a £58,000 Range Rover Sport V8 for Christmas.
