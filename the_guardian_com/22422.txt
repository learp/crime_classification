Coronation Street star Bill Roache is looking forward to standing before a jury to "vigorously protest his innocence" on "deeply upsetting" child sex charges, his lawyer has said.Brian Russell spoke outside Preston magistrates court on Friday as the actor arrived to face five new charges of indecent assault linked to allegations made in the wake of publicity surrounding his original arrest last month.Roache, 81, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, was arrested on Thursday morning after attending a police station in Cheshire by appointment.The new offences are alleged to have been committed in the Manchester area in 1965 and 1968 with alleged victims aged between 11 or 12 and 16.After Roache was charged last month with raping a 15-year-old girl in 1967, he issued a statement saying he "strenuously" denied the allegations.Roache – the world's longest-serving soap actor – has played Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap since its launch, but will not be appearing in the programme until legal proceedings are concluded.He was bailed to appear at Preston crown court on Monday, when he is due to face an earlier charge of raping a 15-year-old girl in 1967.It is expected that a date for when Roache will enter formal pleas will then be scheduled. The actor's previous bail conditions remain in place.They include residence at his home in Wilmslow or an alternative address in London and that he has no direct unsupervised contact with anyone under 16.The court heard he also surrendered his passport.Roache must not approach any of his five alleged victims or named witnesses.
