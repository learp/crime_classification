There are errors in your claim that West Midlands Police stopped and searched nearly half of all people in Britain in the year to March 2004 (Freedom of Information - the act's first year, January 2).First, the statistics on stop and search, which only cover England and Wales, have been published by the Home Office for some years; this is not an FOI issue. Second, the West Midlands statistics (drawn from an investigation I undertook) concern the force's use of only one stop and search power (section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994) where the force did undertake around half of all such stops in England and Wales.This power applies in a defined locality where serious violence is anticipated or where people are known to be carrying weapons. Because it is especially intrusive - with the police not required to have reasonable grounds for suspecting any particular individual before stopping them - and because the evidence suggested the force was using it excessively, it agreed, as a result of our investigation, to amend its approach.
