Mr Justice Rix drew the short straw by happening to be duty judge on the weekend that Jack Straw decided to gag the media over leaks from the Lawrence inquiry report three days early.First, Sir Bernard Rix's Saturday night was interrupted by a call from government lawyers seeking a "pyjama injunction" to stop the Sunday Telegraph publishing details from the report. Sir Bernard, who is not an expert in media law, granted the injunction to preserve the status quo pending any arguments by the media to lift or vary the ban.Yesterday he was hauled out of a wedding reception at the Dorchester Hotel in London to rubber-stamp a variation agreed to by the Treasury Solicitor, the Government's lawyers, and legal representatives of national newspapers. Not a high-profile judge, Sir Bernard last hit the headlines when he halted a strike on London Underground four years ago.The 54-year-old judge, who lists fencing as a former hobby in Who's Who, is described as "spruce and dapper and wealthy" by a senior lawyer. A former director of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, he was educated at St Paul's School in London, New College, Oxford, and Harvard Law School where he was Kennedy Scholar in 1968. He took silk in 1981 and became a Recorder nine years later.In 1993 he became a judge of the High Court, Queen's Bench Division.The lawyer said: "He's young and with it, not a senile old fart, but I doubt whether he knows anything about this area of the law."Sir Bernard is in charge of the commercial court, where he sits on complex cases often involving millions of pounds. In a survey of lawyers' opinions of judges last year by the magazine Legal Business, several regarded him as among the best on the bench.
