A female member of police staff who was sexually assaulted in a bar by a detective has said she will never go out with another group of police officers again because she does not trust them.The woman spoke out as Mike Johnson, 37, of the Humberside police force, was sentenced to a 12-month community order and curfew after admitting sexually assaulting her last year.Sentencing Johnson at Bradford crown court on Thursday, Judge John Potter said that what he had done had been "nothing less than sexual abuse".Johnson is the third member of the Humberside force to be investigated for sexual offences in the last 17 months.His sentence comes as the Independent Police Complaints Commission carries out an inquiry into the force's investigations of such allegations following a complaint by a woman, in one of the three Humberside cases, about the way her claim had been handled.Johnson's case was one of 56 documented by the Guardian in an investigation last month into the scale of abuse of power by police officers and police community support officers who target women and vulnerable individuals to sexual harass or assault them.The investigation revealed concerns that the problem could be more widespread than previously believed.Next month the IPCC and the Association of Chief Police Officers is publishing a report examining the issue.Bradford crown court heard on Thursday that Johnson assaulted the woman during a night out with colleagues in a bar near Hull city centre in May last year.Johnson twice put his arm around the small of the woman's back in the space of 20 minutes in an "inappropriate" manner, the court heard.On the second occasion her ran his fingers down over the back of her clothing and touched her in the vaginal area, the court heard.At the time she had a number of personal difficulties, was engaging in counselling and therapy, and making good progress, which, she said, was knocked back by this conduct.In a victim impact statement, she told the court: "I strongly feel he needs some kind of treatment, he needs help so this kind of thing doesn't happen to another woman. In the past six years I have only been out very occasionally and have always felt safe. This isn't the case now."The way I feel about things now, I will never go out with a group of police officers again. I will never feel safe."Potter said the woman had been very brave in coming forward and had acted with courage in extremely difficult circumstances.Johnson, a police officer for more than seven years, pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault last month on the day he was due to stand trial.The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to proceed with two further counts of sexual assault against another woman – also a female member of police staff – on a separate date. He resigned from the force last year.Nicholas Barker, prosecuting, told the court that when Johnson was arrested and interviewed he replied that he had no recollection of the incident last May near Hull city centre.Christopher Dunn, defending, said the offence Johnson admitted happened after he had been drinking to excess, on an empty stomach, in "a very highly emotionally charged gathering".Dunn told the hearing "a moment of madness" had stripped him of the work he loved, decimated his career prospects and affected his family.Johnson, from Bridlington, East Yorkshire, who worked for Humberside CID's priority crime team, had previously served for five years as a soldier in the Royal Anglian Regiment.He was ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for five years.In June, Gary Hastings, a former Humberside police community support officer, was jailed for 10 years for child sex offences. He resigned from the Humberside force after being suspended during the investigation.It emerged last week that a second PCSO has also been investigated by the force's department of professional standards after a woman complained of an assault when he visited her while on duty on 31 January.The officer was never charged with a criminal offence and resigned from the force in February, avoiding any disciplinary action.The woman complained about how the case was investigated to the IPCC and the watchdog announced it was starting an independent investigation into how Humberside dealt with her allegations.Detective Superintendent Ray Higgins, head of professional standards for Humberside police, defended the way the force had handled the inquiries into all three officers.He said: "Humberside police does not take any sort of criminal activity of our staff lightly and we strive to ensure that any inappropriate behaviour by police officers and staff, be it criminal or otherwise, will be dealt with robustly."It should be noted that following our internal investigations none of the three referred to remain in the police service. Any investigation undertaken by Humberside police into allegations made against a police officer or member of police staff is conducted in a thorough and professional manner and this applies to the cases against Gary Hastings, Michael Johnson and a former PSCO."Higgins said the force would respond to any issues identified by the IPCC inquiry.
