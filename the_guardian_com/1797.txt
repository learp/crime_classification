One of the richest businessmen in Britain has spoken of his shock after an aggravated burglary at his home.John Caudwell, 57, the founder of Phones4U, suffered a gash to his head when he was struck with a crowbar at his home at Broughton Hall, near Eccleshall, Staffordshire, on Monday night. His partner Claire Johnson, 41, and a female member of staff were also assaulted, but neither suffered injuries.Caudwell said the burglars stole every piece of jewellery owned by him and Johnson.A Staffordshire police spokesman said today: "Detectives investigating the aggravated burglary at Broughton Hall have arrested a 48-year-old man from Liverpool."The man was arrested by officers from the Staffordshire and Merseyside police forces in Liverpool on Wednesday afternoon."In a statement issued last night, Caudwell said: "On Monday evening at 8.15pm, a group broke into my home and burst into the kitchen. In attempting to defend myself and my family, I was attacked by a man with a crowbar."I suffered a gash to my forehead, to my elbow and damage to my other arm and my back. They took every item of jewellery that Claire and I possessed, plus some cash."Thankfully, nobody else was hurt physically, although no doubt the shock of the event and the brutal actions and language of the attackers will live on for some time."He sold Phones4U in 2006 and, in recent years, Caudwell has become well-known for his work with Caudwell Children, a charity that provides specialist equipment, treatment and therapies for sick, autistic and disabled youngsters across the UK.He appealed to anyone who might have any knowledge or suspicions about the identity of the burglars to come forward to the police to "limit any harm or damage that they may do to others".
