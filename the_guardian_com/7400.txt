The road rage killer Kenneth Noye was today granted a fresh chance to appeal against his conviction for murder.The 63-year-old was jailed for life at the Old Bailey in 2000 for stabbing 21-year-old Stephen Cameron on the M25 at Swanley, in Kent, in 1996.But the Criminal Cases Review Commission has referred his conviction to the court of appeal because of questions over the pathologist's evidence.In June, Noye failed in a legal bid to have his sentence reduced.A spokesman for the commission said: "Having carried out a thorough review of Mr Noye's case, which has included consideration of the pathology evidence at trial and new expert evidence acquired since the original decision in October 2006, the commission has decided to refer Mr Noye's conviction to the court of appeal on the grounds that there is a real possibility that the court may quash the conviction as unsafe."The commission's referral of Mr Noye's conviction to the court of appeal means that the court will hear a fresh appeal."The court will decide whether to uphold the conviction, whether to quash the conviction and require a retrial, or whether to quash the conviction without requiring a retrial."Noye denied murder but was sentenced to life for murdering Cameron during an argument on a motorway slip road in 1996.He used a knife he kept in his car to stab Cameron as the victim's 17-year-old fiancee looked on.The killing sparked an international hunt for Noye, who had already served 14 years in jail for his part in the 1983 Brink's Mat bullion robbery.Noye â€“ who had previously been cleared of murdering a police officer, was extradited from Spain in 1998.His previous appeal to reduce his minimum term failed after a high court judge, sitting at Newcastle crown court, ordered that he must spend at least 16 years in jail before he could be considered for parole.
