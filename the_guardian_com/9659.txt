The chairman of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry indicated yesterday that one of his central findings would be a "collective failure" in the Metropolitan Police to tackle racism.Sir William Macpherson said he had rejected the judgment of Lord Scarman who concluded after the Brixton riots 17 years ago that there were just a few bad apples in the force.Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old black student, was murdered at a bus stop in south London in 1993. Five white men were arrested but no one has been convicted of the killing.Sir William said that during the 56 days of evidence into the police investigation of Stephen's racist murder he had been grappling with a definition of "institutional racism" - the charge levelled at the police by the Lawrence family.Having found discrimination, both conscious and unconscious, he said: "It is a collective failure that has to be addressed and not one individual police constable that has to be hauled over the coals."Sir William's comments - challenging years of police protestations - were made on the first day of part two of the inquiry, which will examine the lessons to be learned for the investigation and prosecution of racially motivated crime.During submissions from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, he told Don Crompton, inspector for the North-west and Northern Ireland, that he (Mr Crompton) would have been "aghast" to listen to the evidence on police understanding and training on racial issues.Earlier he had equally robust words about the "huge disparity" in the stop and search and arrest figures for blacks and whites. Home Office research shows that 108 blacks per thousand of the population were stopped compared with 14 for whites.Sir William said there was an obvious crisis of confidence between the black community and the police.Addressing Peter Pugh, head of the Home Office's operational policing policy unit, he said: "It might be good for the Home Office and everybody else involved to take on the perceptions of the black community and assume they are right rather than make excuses and assume they are wrong."Mr Pugh admitted that police race awareness training, initiated by the Scarman report, had failed.Asked by Richard Stone, one of the Sir William's advisers, whether the differences in stop and search figures could be explained by colour, Mr Pugh said: "The research would not dispute that."Mr Crompton told the inquiry that training in community and race relations was patchy and inconsistent and middle ranking officers often failed to confront inappropriate behaviour.Agreeing that the stop and search figures were disturbing, he said: "There is little doubt in my mind that one of the issues to be addressed revolves around stereotyping. There is a propensity to see young black males as being perpetrators rather than victims."David Blakey, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers and chief constable of West Mercia, told the inquiry: "There are individuals who have racist attitudes in the police service. We are determined to root it out at every opportunity."The inquiry, at Elephant and Castle, south London, continues today.
