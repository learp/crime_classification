A man who urinated on the Manchester Cenotaph has been ordered to spend 200 hours cleaning war memorials across the city as part of his punishment. Caedmon Kerr, 24, was caught on CCTV unsteadily walking up to the remembrance site in St Peter’s Square and relieving himself. The hotel receptionist apologised, telling a court hearing was so drunk he could not remember defiling the memorial. Kerr, from Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, was given 200 hours of unpaid work by a judge who branded his behaviour disrespectful and disgusting. Council CCTV operators caught Kerr wandering around the monument in the early hours of the morning on 7 February. He was seen approaching one of the obelisks at the side of the main structure, unzipping his fly and urinating. The cameras showed Kerr “skipping and dancing” from the scene and shouting at passersby. He was later arrested in the city centre. Kerr apologised for his actions saying: “I’m just completely ashamed. It was not something I ever expected to find myself accused of. Especially considering I have had a morally straight upbringing, a good education and lots of opportunities.I can fully understand the significance of the war memorial.”
