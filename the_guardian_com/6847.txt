The suspects held over the Woolwich murder this month are expected to be played video footage showing the attack on the soldier, experts in interrogating terrorism suspects said.Michael Adebowale, one of the suspects, has been questioned at a south London police station by counter terrorism detectives investigating the murder of the soldier, Lee Rigby, who was killed in Woolwich on 22 May.The interrogation strategy involves detectives putting gathered evidence to the suspect during the interview, as they aim to shut off any attempt by his defence to argue that the facts could fit a lesser charge, such as manslaughter or diminished responsibility.Suspects are typically given a standard warning that their case could be harmed if they fail to give an explanation at the first opportunity.The need to interview the suspects, out of fairness to them and because it might strengthen any criminal case, explains why a week after the attack prosecutors have yet to decide if charges should be brought.Adebowale, 22, was arrested at the scene of Rigby's murder with Michael Adebolajo, 28, who was seen on mobile phone footage explaining the attack using the rhetoric of violent jihad.Both men were shot by police at the scene and Adebolajo remains in hospital.Adebowale was released into police custody on Tuesday after doctors declared him fit to be questioned. He has also been arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder a police officer. Police have got a total of 96 hours, including extensions, to hold Adebowale.Detectives will also want to find out about the suspects' radicalisation, and will need to establish if other people were involved in the planning of the attack.The police said a postmortem had established that Rigby, 25, died from "multiple incised wounds", indicating that he suffered slashing or hacking from the blade of a weapon as opposed to its point.Detectives also appealed for witnesses who might have seen a blue car, used by the attackers to run Rigby down, in the minutes leading up to his death.In a statement, the Metropolitan police said: "Mr Rigby was walking to the Royal Artillery Barracks in Artillery Place, near to the junction with John Wilson Street, SE18, when he was struck by a blue Vauxhall Tigra registration number N696 JWX. He was then attacked by two men."Police have returned to the scene of the attack to find other witnesses, and the charity Victim Support said it had provided help for 11 witnesses traumatised by the attack on Rigby.On Wednesday the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation said it would be a mistake for the government to ban radical Islamists from appearing on television. After criticism of the BBC for giving airtime to Anjem Choudary, a former member of the now banned al-Muhajiroun, the home secretary, Theresa May, had suggested banning such preachers from appearing on air.But David Anderson QC said that if extremists were banned from television, it would risk sanitising them.He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: "I'm a great believer in the marketplace of ideas, the good ideas drive out the bad." He said that people should be heard otherwise there was a risk that others "don't actually realise how extreme they are".Police also said that firearms officers who fired at the suspects at Woolwich, seen on video to rush at an armed response vehicle as it pulled up, could be back on duty within days.Chief Superintendent Alistair Sutherland said the three armed officers and two of their commanders were undergoing assessments.The independent police complaints commission has already said officers would not face criminal or disciplinary charges after police fired eight shots at the suspects.Sutherland said: "At this stage I would anticipate them being back on operational duty fairly quickly."Eight other people have been arrested in connection with Rigby's death. Hayden Allen, 21, was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder but later released on bail.Allen said on Wednesday that he had "no prior knowledge of the atrocity that happened last week" and that he had played no part in the incident or "the lead-up to it whatsoever". Allen had been hit by a taser gun during his arrest.
