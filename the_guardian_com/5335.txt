New community sentences introduced four years ago are failing to cut prison populations, according to a report published today.The study from the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King's College also found that some magistrates were confused about the system of community orders and suspended sentence orders that was introduced in April 2005 in an effort to reduce prison numbers.Some probation officers said the sentences had no deterrent effect, with some offenders regarding them as a softer option than a jail term.Richard Garside, the director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, said the study showed the new orders were being breached more often than the previous regime of community sentences, largely because probation officers were told to enforce them more rigorously.Garside told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that prison numbers had increased even as more offenders had received community sentences."For a number of years [we have seen] a rising prison population at the same time as we have seen an increased use of community sentences, so there isn't really any evidence to suggest that if you want to use community orders as a means of reducing the prison population or at least capping its growth, they are having any obvious impact."The research revealed that the policy was not well understood by courts."There is some evidence to suggest that magistrates are confused about the types of sentences and how they should be used," said Garside.The introduction of the new orders was part of a tougher sentencing policy, he said, with community orders replacing fines, and jail terms for those who would previously have served sentences in the community.Garside said the government needed to legislate to prevent a drift upwards in the severity of punishments."We are seeing right across the board what criminologists call 'up-tariffing'," he said. "Fewer people are getting fines than in the past. One of the key things we need to do – and it can only be done legislatively – is to have a broad-based strategy from government based on trying to change the sentencing framework aimed at reducing tariffs."The new orders require offenders to do unpaid work or undergo rehabilitation for problems such as drug or alcohol addiction. A community order can last anywhere between 12 hours and three years and is not intended as a direct alternative to a prison term. But if it is breached, the courts have the power to make it tougher or to revoke it and impose a new sentence, which could involve prison.If a suspended sentence order is breached, the courts are told to send the offender to prison "unless there are strong reasons for not doing so".
