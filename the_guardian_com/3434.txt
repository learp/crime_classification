Knife murderers could face prison terms of 30 years after the justice secretary, Jack Straw, today announced a review of sentencing policy.Under current laws, the starting point judges use when sentencing in such cases is 15 years, in contrast to the 30 years for murders committed with a gun. The review could recommend that sentences for murders with a knife be increased to the same level â€“ a doubling of the current basic sentence.Straw told the House of Commons: "There have been considerable concerns about the starting points for the minimum terms for murder involving the use of a firearm, which is 30 years, compared with murder involving use of a knife which is 15 years."In the light of these concerns, I intend to review the provisions of schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 with a view to deciding whether to amend it as I can by order."Yesterday, the family of the murdered teenager Ben Kinsella criticised the 19-year sentences given to his killers, and called for a review of the system.
