A man who groomed murdered teenager Kayleigh Haywood on Facebook has been found guilty of holding her captive at his home.Luke Harlow was convicted of falsely imprisoning Kayleigh by a jury at Nottingham crown court a day after the 15-year-old’s killer, Stephen Beadman, was found guilty of the same charge. Beadman, who had previously admitted rape and murder and faces life imprisonment, will be sentenced alongside Harlow on Friday. Neighbours Harlow and Beadman, aged 28 and 29 and both of Ibstock, Leicestershire, had denied falsely imprisoning Kayleigh during a six-hour period before she was raped and killed on farmland last November. Harlow stared at the jury after being found guilty. A woman believed to be his sister walked out of the courtroom immediately after the majority 10-1 guilty verdict, telling Harlow: “We will fight this, Luke, I mean it.” Harlow admitted grooming Kayleigh and two offences of sexual activity with a child, before the start of his two-week trial.
