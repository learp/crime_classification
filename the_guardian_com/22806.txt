Si√¥n Jenkins was yesterday enjoying his first day of freedom after being granted bail before his retrial for the murder of his foster daughter, Billie-Jo.Mr Jenkins, who spent six years of a life sentence in prison before the conviction was quashed on appeal last month, was travelling to his parents' home in Wales, where will he await the new trial. One of his first obligations will be to report to the police at Aberystwyth - a condition of his bail requires him to check in with the police daily. Mr Jenkins was driven away from Belmarsh prison in south-east London at 8.30pm on Monday by a campaigning journalist and family friend, Bob Woffinden. Mr Woffinden said Mr Jenkins was happy to be free, though frustrated that he had to wait for eight hours before being released after being granted bail while administrative matters were sorted out. After leaving Belmarsh, Mr Jenkins was reunited with his family at his aunt's house in Bromley, Kent, and spent the night there. Mr Woffinden said Mr Jenkins, 46, would be spending the first few days of his freedom settling back into the world outside prison. He said: "He just wants to spend a few days with his family getting used to the outside world and getting over what has happened to him over the last six years." Mr Woffinden said it would be much easier for Mr Jenkins to work on preparing his case now that he was at liberty. His retrial is expected to be at the Old Bailey in the new year.
