A teenager is expected to appear at Ealing magistrates court in west London today accused of murdering an 80-year-old Asian man in the street, the police said last night.The unnamed 16-year-old from Northolt, west London, was one of two youths questioned by detectives yesterday after Akberali Mohamedally was set upon in an underpass in Northolt, the police said. Mr Mohamedally, who was originally from Pakistan, lived in Southall, west London. He was taken from the White Hart roundabout to Ealing hospital on Friday evening and pronounced dead. Detective Superintendent Sue Hill of Scotland Yard said: "This was a despicable attack on a frail old man by cowardly individuals. They assaulted him and left him for dead. A police spokesman said they did not believe the attack on Mr Mohamedally, a Muslim, was linked to the terrorism arrests last week. A second 16-year-old has been bailed until mid April. Â· The police have asked anyone who saw the incident or has any information to call the incident room, 020-8358 0600, or Crimestoppers, 0800 555 111.
