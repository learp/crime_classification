The actions of a woman who trapped her paedophile husband by posing as a teenage girl on the internet have been praised by a children's charity.David Anthony Roberts, 69, asked a girl he thought was 14 to have sex with him, not realising he was actually having an online conversation with his then wife, Cheryl, the South Wales Echo reported. When Mrs Roberts called in the police and NSPCC, indecent images of children were found on the man's computer.He admitted to police that he would have been prepared to have sex with the 14-year-old if she agreed to meet up with him. He was sentenced yesterday to a three-year community order and will have to attend a programme for sex offenders.Claude Knights, the director of the children's charity Kidscape, said: "The offences that he has committed are very serious indeed and his wife must be commended for the active part that she played in bringing him to justice."This is yet another case that points to the risks posed to young people by online sexual predators. There is a strong message to parents to ensure that their children know they must never email, chat or text message with strangers. Most importantly it is never safe to arrange offline meetings with people that they have met online."Roberts, of Bridgend, pleaded guilty on 21 September to attempting to engage in sexual activity in the presence of a child. He also admitted four counts of making indecent photographs of a child and two counts of possessing such pictures.The sentencing judge at Cardiff crown court said Roberts had to register as a sex offender for five years and was barred indefinitely from attempting to make contact with children on the internet.It was reported that Mrs Roberts decided to pose as the teenager after becoming suspicious when she read a message on her husband's computer in 2008. She set up profiles and began having online conversations with her husband as a young girl.The couple have divorced after 18 years of marriage.Psychiatric reports said Roberts might have a brain disorder that made him an exhibitionist. Byron Broadstock, defending, said Roberts would welcome treatment.
