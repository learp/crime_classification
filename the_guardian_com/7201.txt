A senior police officer accused of blunders during the bungled Stephen Lawrence murder investigation is to launch a legal attempt to avoid facing a disciplinary hearing.Detective Inspector Benjamin Bullock, who was second in command of the investigation, is the only police officer involved to face internal disciplinary charges.The Guardian has learned that at a preliminary hearing on Monday his lawyers will try to have seven counts of neglect of duty thrown out by arguing the process Mr Bullock is facing is unfair.He was deputy senior investigating officer following the racially motivated killing of Stephen Lawrence, 18, in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993.Mr Bullock is due to face the charges in June before a panel comprising of two members of the police complaints authority and chaired by Des Flanders, deputy assistant commissioner of ther metropolitan police.It is understood that his lawyers will seek to have the hearing scrapped by arguing that the intense publicity will make it hard for him to get a fair hearing.He and other senior officers were heavily criticised in a report by Sir William Macpherson, who chaired the public enquiry into the police's handling of the murder.Four other senior officers criticised have retired from the police force.Glen Smyth, of the Metropolitan Police Federation, which is representing Mr Bullock, said the hearing behind closed doors on Monday would be asked to decide if the charges should go ahead and whether they were appropriate.It is believed part of the argument by Mr Bullock's barrister, Michael Egan QC, will centre on allegedly critical remarks about him made by Peter Moorhouse, chairman of the complaints authority, before the Commons home affairs select committee in January. Mr Smyth said: 'If you're going to stay and fight your corner you've got to know that the process you've entered upon is fair and objective, because they are the fundamentals of any tribunal.'In January the authority announced charges against Mr Bullock, only for it to be revealed that he was seeking retirement after 30 years service and would thus not face a hearing.After a public furore, Mr Bullock announced that he had withdrawn his retirement notice. Lee Jasper, a member of the home secretary's race relations forum, said: 'The Metropolitan police should be in no doubt that the eyes of the country are on them, waiting to see how seriously they will prosecute the charges against DI Bullock.'Failure to prosecute the charges will inevitably result in a crisis of confidence in the Met's ability to discipline its own officers.'
