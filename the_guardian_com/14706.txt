Five boys who hurled stones, chunks of wood and abuse at a father playing cricket with his son, triggering a fatal heart attack, burst into tears yesterday as an Old Bailey jury convicted them of manslaughter and violent disorder.They clutched their parents in the dock at the end of a month-long trial which heard how they had carried out the vicious onslaught when none of them was over 12 and one had just turned 10.Among the youngest defendants to appear at the central criminal court, they were bailed for reports before sentencing by a judge who earlier warned about their behaviour during the hearing.After Old Bailey staff complained of the five wandering around, hanging out of windows and potentially causing mischief, Judge Warwick McKinnon ordered the boys' parents to keep them under control.Even after that, one of the defendants screwed up his jumper into a pillow and dozed off during the trial, which was conducted informally without wigs or robes. The misbehaviour coincided with prosecution arguments to the jury that the boys' youth was no excuse for their attack and they knew their violence was wrong.Their victim was 67-year-old Ernest Norton, described as an easy-going house husband, who was giving informal cricket practice to his teenage son James while his wife used the nearby gym at Erith leisure centre, in Kent, in February last year.The court heard that Mr Norton and James, who was 17 at the time and getting ready for A-levels, had just set up stumps in an open-air tennis court when about 20 boys arrived and started hurling abuse.After shouts such as "Rubbish bowler" and "Get back to the old people's home", Mr Norton went to confront the crowd and was met with spitting and a hail of missiles. He was hit by half-a-dozen stones and bits of broken plank.One rock, the size of half a brick, hit him on the temple and a second, not much smaller, fractured his cheekbone. As his son watched incredulously, he fell to the ground with a heart attack.David Fisher QC, prosecuting, told the jury that the boys had been roaming the area earlier, looking for trouble. They had arranged a gang fight but were scared off by a passer-by who confiscated a baseball bat one of them was carrying.They turned to smashing windows in an empty factory before deciding to hang around the leisure centre, aiming verbal abuse at staff. The arrival of the Nortons gave them an easy target."We were keeping ourselves to ourselves," James told the trial. "It seemed they just wanted to pick on someone."The boys belonged to a local gang called TNE - for The New Estate - but Nicholas Valios QC, for the youngest defendant, asked the jury not to be swayed by current publicity about gang culture. "Every day one has read about gangs killing, knifing, shooting and terrorising estates. That really isn't so in this case."As an off-duty police officer and other passers-by tried to help Mr Norton, the court heard, the boys ran off. One was heard saying "I think I got him", but another, in tears as he struggled to keep up with the pack, kept shouting: "He's dead, he's dead."Only one of the five, now 14, gave evidence, admitting that he spat at Mr Norton and that his behaviour had been "stupid, revolting and appalling". He told the court that he had thrown stones but only to try to topple the stumps and wreck the Nortons' game "for a bit of fun".Mrs Norton's wife, Linda, 56, who was fetched from the gym by James and held her husband's hand as he died, said that he had been fit and well and led an active life after heart bypass surgery in 1977.
