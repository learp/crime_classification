Two men have been arrested following a dog attack that left 10 people needing hospital treatment.Sussex police went to Marline Road in Hastings, East Sussex, at about 8.55pm on Sunday after reports that two dogs had escaped into the street and several people were injured.When officers arrived, members of the public had already captured one of the dogs in a dog crate, a police spokesman said. The second dog was contained by a dog unit in a garden with the help of police officers at the scene, allowing the South East Coast ambulance service to treat the injured.A police spokesman said: "Ten local people, none of whom are children, sustained a range of serious but not life threatening, bites, cuts and scratches caused in the attacks in the street and were treated at the Conquest hospital."None have been detained at hospital, but three of the 10, a woman and two men, have been referred for outpatient treatment at the Queen Victoria hospital, East Grinstead." The spokesman said he could not confirm the breed of either dog.A 22-year-old man from Hastings was arrested at the scene on suspicion of allowing dogs to be dangerously out of control and is in police custody. A second man, 21, was subsequently arrested, also on suspicion of allowing dogs to be dangerously out of control.Inspector Sarah Godley, from the East Sussex neighbourhood response team, said: "This was an incredibly distressing incident for everyone involved and quick work from members of the public and officers at the scene meant that the incident was quickly brought under control."Firearms officers were deployed to the incident, but they were stood down when it became clear that the unarmed officers were able to get the dogs under control safely. We are now trying to establish exactly what has happened and are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident."Godley added that officers would remain in the area and that anyone with any information or concerns should contact the police.
