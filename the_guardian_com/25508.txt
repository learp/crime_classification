Police hunting the killers of PC Sharon Beshenivsky have arrested 19-year-old Yusuf Jama in connection with her murder and the attempted murder of her colleague, PC Teresa Milburn.The suspect was picked up in Birmingham, according to West Yorkshire Police, who are also searching for Jama's older brother, Mustaf, 25, and 24-year-old Muzzaker Imtiaz Shah.A police spokesman said: 'The man was arrested by West Midlands Police in Birmingham, and West Yorkshire officers will transfer him to an undisclosed West Yorkshire police station for questioning. Inquiries are continuing and we are still appealing to trace two men named yesterday.'Since naming and releasing photographs of the three men, police said they received a 'number of calls' from the public.PC Beshenivsky was gunned down as she and PC Milburn responded to a silent panic button at Universal Express travel agents in Bradford. The robbers were said to have tied up employees and demanded £100,000, but when the officers arrived the gang fled 'shooting like cowboys' with just £2,000.It was reported yesterday that PC Beshenivsky's husband agonised for a week about how to tell their youngest child, four-year-old Lydia, of her death. Paul Beshenivsky, 42, said he decided to break the news to Lydia and her brother Paul, seven, when they returned home from a friend's house on Friday. He said that Lydia, who was celebrating her birthday on the day her mother was killed, kept asking: 'Why did those bad men put mummy in the sky?' PC Beshenivsky had wrapped her daughter's presents the night before the killing and left the card to write when she got home.Last week Tony Blair paid tribute: 'It is clear that Sharon Beshenivsky was a wonderful mother and wife as well as being a dedicated police officer. It is a sad, if perhaps inevitable, fact that it takes an evil act like this to remind us all of the bravery and sacrifice of our policemen and women.'
