Moors murderer Ian Brady has won his battle to have a mental health tribunal held in public, it was confirmed yesterday.The child killer will have the right to give evidence at the hearing, which is expected to take place by the end of the year. Brady, 65, has been force-fed by staff at secure Ashworth hospital in Merseyside since going on hunger strike in September 1999. In February 2000 a high court judge ruled that Brady was insane and incapable of deciding to end his life. He wants the mental health tribunal to move him to an ordinary prison, where the authorities would be powerless to prevent him deliberately starving to death. A mental health tribunal panel sat on September 1 to decide if the hearing could take place in public. An Ashworth hospital spokeswoman said: "Every detained patient has the right to a mental health tribunal every year."
