Michael Stone, the man convicted of killing Lin Russell and her six-year-old daughter, Megan, yesterday lost a high court battle to stop the publication of an official inquiry report into the murders.Josie Russell, Mrs Russell's other daughter, who was badly injured in the hammer attack, and her father, Shaun, have been pressing for six years for the report to be published because they hope that mental health professionals will be able to learn lessons from its findings.But Stone objected, claiming the report contained sensitive information about his illnesses and would breach his privacy.A barrister, Robert Francis QC, had been commissioned in 1999 to investigate whether mental health and probation workers had failed to supervise and treat Stone properly before he killed. The report - completed in 2000 - was not published while Stone appealed against his convictions.Yesterday, Mr Justice Davis rejected Stone's claim, rulin : "The public interest requires publication in full."He added: "It seems, regrettably, all too likely that in the future there will be other instances where persons receiving psychiatric treatment or care in the community will commit acts of murder or extreme violence."The judge said the public "has a reasonable and justified expectation" that the report of an inquiry into a high-profile case such as Stone's would be published "so that the public is not left in the dark about how it happened".But the 384-page report will be kept secret for at least another two weeks as Stone's lawyers consider attempting to get the verdict overturned in the appeal court.Outside the high court, Dr Russell said the latest delay was "frustrating and galling". He had phoned Josie immediately to tell her the result of the judgment. "She said, 'very good, excellent'. When I said that it now sounds like it will go to appeal, she just said 'he will not win'. I guess that was her gut reaction." He hoped the case would end quickly so he and Josie "could retire, as it were, from the limelight and get on with our lives"."This court case has come as we have been mourning my wife and daughter, as it was the 10th anniversary of their deaths two days ago, and that has been a difficult time for us and other members of the family, particularly my late wife's mother, who is in hospital."We believe it is in the public interest that lessons need to be learned, because what we have read in this report has been fairly horrifying about failures in the system in looking after Michael Stone up to the time of the murders."He said the judgment reflected a "very sensible public view, and maybe one can say pushing the pendulum back to the rights of the victim rather than the criminal". He questioned whether Stone's lawyers should be given more public money to pursue the case further.Mr Justice Davis yesterday refused to grant Stone's lawyers immediate permission to appeal against his ruling, saying there were "no compelling reasons". However, the lawyers have 14 days to persuade the court of appeal to allow them to contest the ruling.Stone, 45, who has a long history of mental illness, is serving three life sentences in Wakefield prison for murdering Lin Russell, 45, and Megan, and attempting to murder Josie in Kent in 1996. Josie, now 19, is studying art at college, and has moved into her own house in north Wales, near her father.Peter Edwards, Stone's lawyer, said: "I anticipate that he will be disappointed with this outcome."The three authorities which commissioned the report - Kent and Medway strategic health authority, Kent county council, and Kent probation board - and the Department of Health had argued for the report to be published.In his ruling the judge observed that the South East Coast SHA - until recently the Kent & Medway SHA - inevitably faced "the most searching examination of its practices and procedures".
