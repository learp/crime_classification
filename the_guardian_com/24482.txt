The mother of Shannon Matthews, the nine-year-old girl who has not been seen for more than three weeks, said yesterday she believes her daughter was snatched by someone close to the family.Karen Matthews said Shannon, who was last seen leaving school, had not been unhappy and said she was sure her daughter "was still out there." Matthews said she was convinced that Shannon was abducted on her way home from a school swimming trip in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, on February 19. Asked if she thought someone she knew was responsible, she told the BBC: "It seems that way because there's no trace of her at all. There's no trace of her swimming costume, her towel or anything."Senior police reiterated their "grave concern" over Shannon's fate this week as they outlined further details of the huge search operation which is now one of the biggest inquiries the West Yorkshire force has undertaken. As well as 300 local officers, the hunt includes more than half of the UK's specialist body search dogs. Yesterday Matthews said she believed someone had taken Shannon to hurt her, but added that she had no idea who was responsible. "All my friends and family have all been checked and there are no sightings of her things there at all."Matthews' partner, Craig Meehan, said it was wrong to make comparisons between his family and the parents of Madeleine McCann, who went missing while on holiday in Portugal last year. The pair dismissed rumours that Meehan was connected to Shannon's disappearance and claims made by Matthews' parents that he had hit the schoolgirl. The last confirmed sighting of Shannon was at her school at 3.10pm on February 19.
