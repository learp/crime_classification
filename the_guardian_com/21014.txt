The oldest member of the Hatton Garden jewellery raid gang has failed in an attempt to win a reduction of his jail sentence. Brian Reader, 77, one of the masterminds behind what is said to be the biggest burglary in English history, was given a prison term of six years and three months in March. At the court of appeal in London on Friday, two judges were urged to show “mercy” and reduce his sentence following a deterioration in his health. One last job: the inside story of the Hatton Garden heist But Mr Justice Flaux and Mr Justice Edis rejected Reader’s application for permission to appeal against his sentence. Flaux said: “The sentence passed was not in any sense manifestly excessive.” Reader, of Dartford, Kent, had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary. The Hatton Garden gang carried out the meticulously planned crime over the Easter weekend last year. They ransacked 73 boxes at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit after using a drill to bore a hole into the vault wall. Valuables worth up to £14m, including gold, diamonds and sapphires, were taken. Two-thirds of them remain unrecovered.
