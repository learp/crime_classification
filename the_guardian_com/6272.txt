Police today said three men had been arrested for allegedly assisting an offender during their search for the gunman Raoul Moat.As an inquest into Moat's death was opened by the Newcastle coroner, Northumbria police said the men were held in raids at two addresses in Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead.A spokesman said: "Three men have been arrested this morning in connection with assisting an offender during the search for Raoul Moat. The men were arrested from two addresses in Gateshead and one in Newcastle."At this stage, the investigation is still ongoing and further arrests cannot be ruled out."The development brings the number of arrests concerning Moat to 10.Two men were remanded in custody by Newcastle magistrates until 22 July, to appear at the city's crown court on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and possession of a firearm.Two other men, arrested on Wednesday in Rothbury, the Northumberland village where Moat died, have been released on police bail.A man and a woman were arrested in Blyth, Northumberland, on Thursday, also allegedly on suspicion of assisting an offender.Moat, a 37-year-old former nightclub bouncer, became the most wanted man in Britain as police hunted him following three shootings last week.He is thought to have shot himself during a stand-off in Rothbury early on Saturday.The hunt began after he was suspected of murdering Chris Brown, the new partner of his former girlfriend, Samantha Stobbart, and injuring her in Birtley, Gateshead, on 3 July.Within 24 hours, he declared "war" on police and shot PC David Rathband, 42, a married father of two, who was sitting in his patrol car in East Denton, Newcastle. His sight may be irreparably damaged, but he has said that he bears no grudge against Moat and is determined to return to work.
