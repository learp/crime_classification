The family of the murdered British student Meredith Kercher attended her funeral today.Mourners packed Croydon parish church in south London for a private family service.Among those attending were dozens of friends from the University of Leeds, where Kercher studied, and former schoolfriends from Croydon.Kercher's parents, Arline and John, her sister, Stephanie, and brothers John and Lyle, were the last to arrive at the church.They followed Kercher's coffin, which was adorned with colourful floral tributes and her photograph.The vicar of Croydon, the Rev Colin Boswell, led the service, where Lyle was due to talk about Kercher's life.Boswell is also chaplain at Kercher's former school, Old Palace school in central Croydon. A choir from the independent girls' school were to sing a requiem, In Paradisum.Speaking before the service, Boswell said his sermon would "hopefully try to bring some life and light into what is a very dark situation".Kercher, 21, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was found dead with her throat cut on November 2 in an Italian apartment where she lived with Amanda Knox, 20. Knox is being held with her boyfriend, Raffaele Sollicito, 23, and Rudy Hermann Guede, 20, a drug dealer, over her murder.A Congolese bar owner, Diya "Patrick" Lumumba, 38, has been released from prison but remains a suspect in the case. All four deny any involvement.Kercher's family have had a long wait for the funeral. An Italian judge ruled the funeral could go ahead only two weeks ago.Kercher's body was flown back from Perugia to England last month but lawyers argued over whether a second post-mortem examination was needed.The funeral will be followed by a private burial at Mitcham Road cemetery, near Croydon.Among the floral tributes at the church was the word Mez, Kercher's nickname, written in small yellow flowers.There was also a small bouquet with a card marked "The City of Perugia". Another tribute read simply, "You will always be in our hearts".Two large, pillow-shaped tributes made of small blue flowers and covered with photographs of Kercher were left either side of the church entrance.Another tribute attached to a bouquet of white roses read: "Why such a tragic waste? May your smile be infectious in Heaven Mez."
