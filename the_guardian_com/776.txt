Detectives were yesterday investigating claims that teenagers throwing missiles from a footbridge caused a woman to swerve off the road and into a tree.Suzanne Singer, 40, was killed when she lost control of her car in thick fog three days before Christmas.Police said that several motorists had come forward to report that their vehicles had been hit by stones, branches and in one case an airgun pellet on the same stretch of road in Dunton, Essex.An Essex police spokesman said: "Initially we knew that two motorists had reported that their cars were struck. But other motorists have since come forward to say their cars have been struck by rocks and eggs on that stretch of road."Singer, a secretary who lived alone, died from multiple injuries when her Vauxhall Corsa hit a tree on Saturday. She had been on her way to her home in Shoeburyness.Her sister, Caroline Say, told reporters that she believed Singer had died after her car was hit by stones thrown from the bridge. "I hope that these youngsters are caught and charged with murder, they killed my sister," she said. "They should search their conscience and go to the police. If their parents have got any kind of heart they should turn their children in."The police spokesman said that although officers were treating the death as a road accident they were investigating claims that the driver lost control of the car after it was hit by a missile."Police are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of Suzanne Singer," he said. "At this stage it is being treated as unexplained and further inquiries are continuing relating to her journey as is the forensic examination of the car."Police cannot rule out the possibility that her vehicle was struck by an object but neither can they rule out the possibility that the driver lost control of the car."After the accident detectives sealed off the road for several hours as specialist teams searched the area for any sign of missiles. Yesterday forensic experts continued to examine the car.Singer's death follows that of lorry driver Laurence McCourt who died when a breeze block was thrown from a bridge into his cab.The 68-year-old from Sandwell, West Midlands, was fatally injured on the A45 near Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, last July.
