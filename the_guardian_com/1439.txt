Three senior police officers will face a misconduct tribunal for allegedly bungling the investigation into a racist killing in Brighton in 1999.The Independent Police Complaints Commission announced yesterday that a superintendent and two detective inspectors with Sussex police will be questioned on how they handled the inquiry into the killing of the father-of-two. Another high-ranking officer, who has since left Sussex police, could also be disciplined by his or her current police authority, and three other officers, two of whom are still with Sussex, will receive a verbal warning. Jay Abatan, 42, who was of Nigerian descent, was attacked while waiting for a taxi outside the Ocean Rooms night club. When he was punched he fell, hitting his head on the pavement, and lapsed into a coma for five days before his life support machine was switched off. Graham Curtis, 41, and Peter Bell, 39, were arrested, but manslaughter charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence. Instead they were charged with affray and actual bodily harm but acquitted on both counts. Curtis hanged himself at his Brighton home last June. Complaints from Mr Abatan's family prompted a review, carried out by Essex police, which identified 57 mistakes in the inquiry. A second review, by Avon and Somerset Constabulary, was equally damning. The IPCC issued a critical report in May.
