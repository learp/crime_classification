Having a biological father who maintained a close relationship with his son, whether or not he lived in the family home, might be crucial in preventing susceptible boys becoming criminals, research presented yesterday suggested. But stepfathers appeared to do little to decrease the risk that a boy will turn to crime, the conference of the British Psychological Society's division of forensic psychology heard in Birmingham. The study by the clinical psychologist Jenny Taylor looked at why a proportion of boys with all the "risk factors" associated with criminal behaviour resisted a life of crime. Drawing on data from socially deprived areas of south London, she compared a group of "good boys", who had no criminal convictions and had caused teachers no trouble, with a group of "bad boys" at a secure unit for unmanageable adolescents, many of them persisitent offenders convicted of sexual assault, theft and stealing vehicles. All 68 boys, aged between 12 and 16, were from working class backgrounds, had lower than average intellectual ability, had similar problems with their peers and with hyperactivity, had equally large families, and in both groups 40% suffered from dyslexia. But there was one "very striking" difference between the two groups: 55% of the "good boys" lived with their biological fathers, compared with only 4% of the "bad boys". Almost 80% of the "good boys" spoke of being close to their biological fathers. Among these were 24% of the group who said they had a biological father living away from home who was an influence in their lives. Only 18% said there was no one they regarded as a father figure, while 3% said they had a stepfather. Among the "bad boys", 45% said they had no one they considered a father figure, 30% said they had a stepfather, 22% a biological father not living at home and only 4% a father living at home. Such findings would appear to back research suggesting that having a stepfather was an additional "risk factor", said Dr Taylor, who carried out the research while at the South London and Maudsley NHS trust. It also suggested that a father who disapproved of crime and showed an interest in his son acted as a crucial social control, countering negative influences such as criminal peers. Boys gained a sense of being loved and approved of, and the fear of jeopardising this proved enough to deter them from crime, she said. "For children in this age group, formal controls - such as being told off by police - aren't enough." Dr Taylor denied that her work suggested that "at risk" boys needed to live in a nuclear family. "It's not necessarily about them living with their biological fathers but about having someone they think of as a father who shows an interest in them and what they're doing," she said. The research, far from providing fodder for the rightwing family values lobby, could be seen as a boon for single mothers, she said. "This suggests we should move away from pathologising single mums and instead see that, if there are dangers, it's due to the absence of fathers." Â• When offenders don a disguise, such as a balaclava, hood or mask, it makes them more violent and destructive to people and property, a forensic psychologist, Andrew Silke, of the University of Leicester, told the conference. He believed this was less because they thought there would be no comeback than because, by becoming anonymous, they felt freed from the normal constraints. The findings emerged from comparing police, victim and media reports in his study of 500 paramilitary punishment beatings in Northern Ireland, 205 of which (41%) involved offenders wearing disguises.
