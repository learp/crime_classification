The Financial Services Authority has reached an agreement with police forces around the country on the possible arrest and questioning of suspects in connection with its criminal investigations.The City regulator has had powers to investigate financial crimes since 2001; since then it has asked the police to arrest individuals for questioning five times in two different investigations.It has also obtained and executed search warrants 12 times in relation to five cases including those involving unauthorised business and criminal market abuse cases. However, the FSA had been limited to only the one agreement with the City of London police; it has now extended this to police forces around the country.The FSA said the memorandum of understanding sets out the circumstances in which the police will assist the FSA, how requests for assistance should be made and the respective responsibilities of the FSA and the police.The FSA usually conducts its investigations by inviting individuals to voluntary interviews but it can ask the police to arrest the person in certain circumstances.It can also ask for search warrants if it believes information might be destroyed. The FSA said it might typically obtain a search warrant when investigating unauthorised financial services businesses.
