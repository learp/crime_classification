A 10-year-old boy believed to be Britain's youngest ever joyrider was yesterday banned from driving for a further two years, after previously being disqualified from driving in January.The 4ft 5in boy, who cannot be named, appeared at Hastings youth court yesterday, charged with five motoring offences. In the same court last week he admitted stealing his father's car, driving while disqualified and driving with no insurance. He had taken his father's Vauxhall Cavalier on June 1, but was stopped near his home in Ore, Hastings, after being reported by his father. Magistrates sentenced him for those offences and two others - stealing a car and stealing a bicycle - yesterday. They also issued a 12-month parenting order, forcing his parents to adhere to certain stipulations regarding the control of their son. The boy was sentenced to an 18-month supervision order in addition to the driving bans imposed. The family left court without comment. After the hearing, Chief Inspector Ken Taylor, the district commander of Hastings, issued a statement addressing youths across the country. He said: "This was an issue not just about the boy's safety but that of the public as well. "Driving a car is not a game and even trained drivers can make mistakes. It is a shame to saddle yourself with a criminal record which can have a detrimental effect on the rest of your life."
