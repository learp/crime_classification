Few doctors have been found guilty of murder in Britain. Last May, Newcastle GP David Moor was acquitted after giving an elderly, terminally-ill patient a massive overdose of diamorphine. The case was regarded as a vindication for euthanasia campaigners.In 1992, Nigel Cox, a consultant rheumatologist, was convicted of killing an elderly arthritis sufferer with an injection of potassium chloride. But the charge of "attempted murder" enabled him to be freed with a suspended sentence. The most celebrated case of a doctor walking free from a murder charge was the sensational trial of Dr John Bodkin Adams in 1957. A fashionable Eastbourne GP, Dr Adams preached a different kind of euthanasia. Everyone has to die sometime, so we should do what we can to "ease the passing", he argued during the Old Bailey court case in which he was accused of killing an elderly patient in order to benefit from her will. Sensational press coverage before the trial suggested he had been responsible for the poisoning of many rich old ladies shortly after they altered their wills in his favour. The GP's Rolls-Royce was alleged to be the result of one such transaction. The Express's crime reporter, Percy Hoskins, went against Fleet Street opinion and maintained that Dr Adams was innocent. He exposed a police campaign against Dr Adams, in which Scotland Yard planted anti-Adams stories in national newspapers. After a 17-day trial, the jury rejected police evidence and Dr Adams was acquitted. Afterwards, the doctor received large sums of money from the court actions he took against several newspapers for seeking to prejudice the outcome of the trial.Dr Adams was a free man, but he could never escape notoriety. The trial judge, Lord Devlin, broke with precedent and wrote about the case in a 1985 book, which he titled Easing the Passing. Dr Adams died in 1983.
