A 16-year-old girl and three young men were jailed today for killing bar manager David Morley in a "happy slapping" spree of random violence.The gang, who filmed the killing on a mobile phone, were convicted at the Old Bailey last month of the manslaughter of Mr Morley, 38, a survivor of the 1999 Soho nail bombing. Reece Sargeant, 21, Darren Case, 18, and David Blenman, 17, were each given 12-year sentences.Chelsea O'Mahoney, 16, was sentenced to eight years. She was said to have kicked Mr Morley's head like a football as he lay on the ground. The four were acquitted of murder but found guilty of manslaughter and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm in December following their attack on Mr Morley as he chatted to a friend on a bench on London's South Bank on October 30 2004. The court heard how the gang were addicted to happy slapping, the act of carrying out an attack and filming it on a mobile phone."It seems that three of you had been on previous expeditions and had become obsessed with the activity of catching people unawares, assaulting them and filming it for your later gratification," Judge Brian Barker said on passing sentence."No-one listening to this case could fail to have been affected by your selfishness and blindness to the suffering of others. "You sought enjoyment from humiliation and pleasure from the infliction of pain and you were clearly determined to continue and take advantage of any opportunity that presented itself. "Each of your victims was totally innocent and taken totally by surprise. You behaved with total indifference to those who crossed your path in the heart of London."
