A man who died after an assault in Northern Ireland was killed by a loyalist lynch mob, a Northern Ireland assembly member claimed today.Kevin McDaid, 49, was attacked in ­Coleraine, Co Londonderry, after football matches involving Rangers and Celtic that decided the Scottish title on Sunday.Up to 30 people were involved in the incident at Somerset Drive, SDLP assembly member John Dallat claimed. "This is the second time that this kind of lynching mob has been involved in Coleraine."Stunned neighbours paid tribute to father-of-four McDaid, who was attacked yards from his terrace home while out looking for his children. Another man, Damien Flaming, is fighting for survival in hospital.As police forensics officers combed the area, known as the Heights, neighbours huddled dumbfounded in small groups close by. For many, the scene had a dreary familiarity with many other murders.McDaid was allegedly targeted because he lived in a mainly Catholic area. Unemployed, he devoted his life to bringing up his children. A nearby hardware shop keeper said he was always in for "bits and pieces" with some of his children.Neighbour Peter Neill said: "He never had any bitterness in him and he was attacked by scum. He was a gentle­man."A local minister said youths had been drinking after the football match and went looking for trouble.Nationalist and unionist estates sit cheek-by-jowl in the town, with painted kerbstones marking the territory. Yet Somerset Drive appears free from graffiti or sectarian murals. In recent years it has attracted migrant workers.Community workers have tried to calm tensions provoked over a bonfire last year that was intended to mark the 1971 internment of republicans.
