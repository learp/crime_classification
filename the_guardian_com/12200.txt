As befits a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, Charles Clarke used a blizzard of figures to support his fightback on foreign prisoner releases in the Commons yesterday. But it failed to obscure the one bald fact that a week after the home secretary first admitted the scale of the fiasco and apologised for the failures, the police have yet to catch up with 38 of the most serious offenders released during his watch.Mr Clarke tried to reassure MPs when he updated them on the police and immigration operation to find the 79 most serious offenders who had been released without their deportation being considered.He explained that deportation action had been started in 70 cases. And he reported that a decision "in accordance with current policy criteria" had been taken for the remaining nine, that they would not be thrown out of the country.But then it became apparent that this had only been an operation involving a trawl through the files and the formal start of legal proceedings. It did not actually mean that the police knew the whereabouts of the released criminals.The hunt continued during the bank holiday weekend with a major police incident room operating in Portsmouth, a search through the casework files by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in Croydon, and joint police and IND operations to detain offenders decided for deportation.But all the home secretary could report yesterday was that 32 of the 70 now earmarked for deportation were accounted for and "either deported or within our control".Last Tuesday Mr Clarke said 20 had already been deported. So by yesterday, the Home Office had identified only a further 12 offenders who have been detained or deported in the past week.The implication was clear that at least 38 out of the 70 most serious offenders earmarked for deportation have yet to be brought "within our control".Last week the home secretary said he was confident that the most serious offenders would be found because they were "subject to the most continuous contact".But the hunt for this group is proving more difficult than Mr Clarke anticipated. As the chief inspector of probation has warned in the past, just because the criminal justice services have somebody's address on file, this does not necessarily mean they know where they are.The home secretary is also in trouble over a second group of released foreign prisoners. These involve the 103 offenders who were not put in the "most serious offenders" class because the type of offence they had committed was unknown. Mr Clarke revealed yesterday that 11 of the 103 had now been identified as within the Home Office category of "more serious offenders". All 11 have now been considered for deportation and formal proceedings have started in seven of the 11 cases."Since their release none of these individuals has committed any of the more serious further offences," reported Mr Clarke, which could simply mean there is no record of any of them on the police national computer being arrested for a serious crime. The Home Office said last night it had no information on whether the 11 had been found but it can safely be assumed that if they are arrested the fact will be widely publicised.As to the rest of the 1,023 foreign prisoners who have been released since 1999 without their deportation being considered, the home secretary said officials had now looked at the files in 574 cases. They had completed the process in 554 cases and it had been decided to try to deport 446 of them.There was no word on how many the police or IND have so far caught up with.As to the future, both Tony Blair and Mr Clarke said they were confident that the system now in place would mean that every foreigner convicted of an imprisonable offence would be considered for deportation before the end of their sentence.One strange aspect of the affair has been the emergence of the fact that in only 160 of the 1,023 cases did the sentencing judge recommend deportation. In future judges are to be given much clearer guidance about making such recommendations.But it has also become clear that there are a large group of prisoners in the system whose nationality is simply not known and there are to be new sanctions against those who give false information about where they have come from or refuse to say anything at all.These measures are not likely to prove controversial. More problematic is the proposal to introduce a clear legal presumption that deportation will follow release for foreign prisoners. Mr Blair said yesterday that this should follow automatically in every case but the home secretary qualified this by saying "unless there are special circumstances why it cannot" - a much more careful piece of language that the former home secretary Michael Howard was quick to spot yesterday.The decision to extend the threshold for deportation from the current criteria of those serving sentences of 12 months or more to all imprisonable offences will widen the net considerably. It is to apply not only to those who are sent to prison but also those who are given a community punishment, if the offence is serious enough. Some probation sources argued yesterday that fare evaders and those who did not pay their bills might face deportation in future, but it seems unlikely that the system will ever be that efficient.
